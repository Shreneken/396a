    "summary": "Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral damage. The new status quo deeply divides members of the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into an all-out feud, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) must pick a side.",

            "content": "I kind of like the movie. The acting and the action is great, but the center story that drives this, the Sokovia Accords, is the most fabricated, biggest bs possible. The explanation given by Ross, the Secretary of State, is New York, Wash DC, Sokovia, and Lagos is billions in damage and loss of life = they need to be controlled. The first three were a percent of what would have happened if it had not been stopped and the fourth was an accident in which more would have been killed in the marketplace than were killed in the building [and it was still an accident]. Like I said: an excellent action movie with a weak center piece.",

This film is perfectly paced also despite being on the long side which I never felt once. The only minor complaints is the music while very good isn't as good as Winter Soldiers and the editing while very well done bounces around a lot. There is way more characters in this and it borders on being an Avengers Film more than a Captain America film at times. But I never felt that was a hindrance because it never really has many subplots to it, it just has more characters involved in the main plot. Also, the villain is kind of forgettable as well as he gets lost in the shuffle of so many other characters at times. Anyone should give this a watch though. A great way to close on of the best trilogies ever made.",

To have the world you built over 8 years torn apart when a threat coming that they can only stop when united, this movie has dire consequences. Zero, however, does not need to be in the film, this movie did not need a villain, and even though he is, his plan doesn't make all too much sense, it is completely a result of coincidence. Regardless, the pain and emotion in this story help me forgive its flaws.",

            "content": "Captain America: Civil War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a thrilling action/adventure film that pits members of the Avengers against each other in a conflict over government oversight and personal loyalty.\n\nThe film benefits from a strong ensemble cast, with standout performances from Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, as well as newcomers Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man. The dynamic between the characters is compelling, and the film effectively balances character development with high-stakes action sequences.\n\nThe cinematography and special effects are impressive, with thrilling set pieces and fight scenes that showcase the characters' unique abilities. The film's themes of personal responsibility and the consequences of unchecked power are thoughtfully explored, adding depth to the film's fast-paced action.\n\nHowever, the film's complex plot and large cast can at times feel overwhelming, and some characters don't receive as much screen time or development as others. The film's humor and lighter moments can also feel out of place at times, detracting from the film's more serious themes.\n\nOverall, Captain America: Civil War is a thrilling and well-executed superhero film that delivers on action, character development, and thought-provoking themes. While it may not be perfect, it's a standout entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the genre.",

            "content": "Joe and Anthony Russo's second addition to the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe is an explosive, globe-trotting affair that can't help but feel like the unofficial third Avengers film.\n\nWhen political pressure from numerous sources overflow, the Avengers receive an ultimatum: sign the new 'Sokovia Accords' (documents that mean the Avengers will obey a committee that decides when, where and if they can fight crucial battles) or retire. This deeply divides the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes heroes should remain free to operate without government interference, whereas Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) disagrees and states the Avengers need to be 'put in check'. But when it appears to be Bucky Barnes a.k.a The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is responsible for an attack on the UN building during a meeting for these accords, Steve must jump into action and find Bucky before someone else does. Their disagreement then escalates into an explosive, intense feud that will create a long-lasting rift between the two sides.\n\nThe film is full of both emotional moments and, in classic Marvel fashion, perilous fight scenes. The Russo Brothers also bring in props and characters from some of their previous jobs - for example, Jim Rash makes a cameo as a member of the MIT team. Due to the vast cast and variety of subplot, viewers could argue that 'Captain America: Civil War' is an unofficial Avengers film. Anthony Mackie even referred to the film as 'Avengers 2.5'. As well as dealing with numerous subplot and storylines, The Russo Brothers were put in charge of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) debut into the MCU. They give each character enough time to be introduced to viewers without their debut taking up chunks of the film. The Russos leave enough unexplained to build up the anticipation for each character's solo films that were to come in the later years: 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' released in 2017 and 'Black Panther' released in 2018.\n\nLike any other Marvel film, 'Captain America: Civil War' sets up the future of the MCU. Both 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' are influenced by the events of this 'Civil War'. The casting, as always, is brilliant. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers as the honest, protective man that he is. Robert Downey Jr. brings back Tony Stark's arrogant, humorous personality to viewers, resuming his role as the billionaire playboy. Natasha Romanoff acts as a midpoint between the two sides, joining Tony's team, only to end up letting Cap get away, eventually joining him on the run. Tom Holland brings Peter Parker's nervous, nerdy presence to the screen. His casting also makes him the youngest person to play the iconic web-slinger. Holland was only 19 during filming. Daniel Br\u00fchl also makes his Marvel debut as Helmut Zemo, the first non-enhanced primary antagonist in the MCU. Br\u00fchl brings his slick charm to the character, presenting Zemo as a cold, calculated man on a mission, a mission for revenge.\n\nHenry Jackman once again lends his composing ability to the film. Jackman creates a score that features intense climaxes and compliments the action on-screen. Jackman also features and reworks the themes of heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America and the iconic Winter Soldier theme. Trent Olapoch's cinematography is impressive, he captures the feel and aesthetic of the previous Marvel movies while still providing new and unique imagery.\n\nIf you look at 'Civil War' as a whole, it's clear to see that all the subplot and plotlines come together almost like a jigsaw puzzle. There's a myriad of themes and ideologies floating around the film including grief, accountability and responsibility. The dominant theme that looms over the film is choice. Each character chooses what side they fight on, Steve chose to help Bucky knowing it made him an enemy of the state, and Zemo chose to go after the avengers to relieve his grief.\n\nOverall, 'Captain America: Civil War' is an impressive piece of skilful filmmaking that features great performances, detailed storylines and a brilliant score. The Russo Brothers prove that they can wrangle such a large cast and create a complex film that deals with powerful themes and ideas.",

While the chilling but relatable Daniel Buhl's Zemo might be billed as the villain, the catalyst for conflict is a difference in ideology between the Avengers. The Russos' talent for managing ensembles makes what could have been Avengers 2.5 a quintessential Captain America movie, but also giving Iron Man an antagonistic- though sympathetic- role, with Downey Jr at his absolute best with a beaten down, emotionally exhausted and guilt ridden Iron Man. Evans plays the titular hero as stoic as ever, while wrestling with his past demons in the returning Winter Soldier, and his own inner turmoil around the ability to do the right thing while also battling the accountability for that power. The film deals with the consequences of conflict, the very human cost of victory and the politics of intervention where even our heroes hands aren't clean, while still allowing for entertaining action and the odd one liner and massive super hero cameo- though they feel natural rather than forced in. Everything on screen feels vital, as the Russos expand on their thriller motif from Winter Soldier with surprisingly affecting results. They aren't fighting aliens, or robots- they are fighting conflicting ideas of how to do the right thing, the right way. An ambitious and powerfully executed- and never bettered- instalment of the MCU, that frankly has no business being as excellent as it truly is.",

The sokovia accords weren't actually all that bad. If Steve had put some actual thought into it, he might've realized that it would have covered more of the cost of a mission  gone wrong, or prevent more people from dying, as was demonstrated in the opening scene(no hate to wanda i know she didn't mean it)\n- Iron man's anger was COMPLETELY justified.

It is interesting to (finally) consider some of the collateral damage and civilian deaths caused by the massive amounts of destruction caused by fights that the Avengers have participated in. The arc of the story quickly turns to that of superheroes battling other superheroes. The plan is a good one by Zemo, and it is a kind of cool choice that he is never masked up. \n\nI'm curious now to move on to the next movie - Black Widow - and then to Black Panther, and see what fallout there is from the Civil War film - i forget how the world at large reacts, or if that is even dealt with.\n\nThe fights are cool in this one, and the effects are top notch.  I love Spider-Man's character, best live action Spider-man by far. Where is Nick Fury at this time? (The Team Thor stuff is funny). The banter between characters is good.

            "content": "The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.\n\n'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.\n\nGranted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.\n\nAs with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong?\n\nHowever, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.\n\nThe action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.\n\nThere are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.\n\nOverall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "A fierce battle between friends over ideologies.\n\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo's superhero espionage action-thriller Captain America: Civil War (2016). Their striking intensity for the intriguing espionage of sleeper cell agents like The Winter Soldier is fascinating in the midst of chaos within The Avengers' greatest argument. The action is creative and thrilling as our beloved heroes use their powers in new and inventive ways against one another. I was laughing and concerned for these characters despite knowing no one would die from this artificial conflict. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were right to give The Russo Brothers the directing gig for Civil War as it nicely follows up on The Winter Soldier plot.\n\nWriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make you care about each hero and their opinion. I love how you do believe Captain America and Iron Man each have real motivations to fight for what they believe in as The Avengers face UN oversight versus freedom of choice. I definitely sympathize more with Captain America's thinking as why would The Avengers ever trust the United States government, let alone a nebulous political body like the UN to guide their superpowered actions? Captain America chooses to do what is morally right, while Iron Man wants to be responsible for all of the destruction The Avengers cause, let alone the death toll. I enjoyed Zemo's complex scheme as why fight The Avengers, when I can get them to kill each other, is a better plan than most Marvel villains.\n\nChris Evans is steadfast as the moral man with stars and stripes Steve Rogers. Evans' Captain America hits hard with killer action choreography, but it's Evans' performance as the kind and thoughtful Captain America that will not give up on The Winter Soldier still having Bucky's personality and mind in there somewhere. I like how Evans' shows he is not guilty, but proud to value freedom of choice as an American value in regards to not allowing The Avengers to assemble as government stooges. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent at expressing his heartbroken emotions over his parents untimely demise as well as his conflicted feelings over The Avengers operating unrestricted.\n\nScarlett Johansson is amazing as the ruthless fighter spy Black Widow and really earnest as Natasha Romanoff. Her ability to convince you that Black Widow would side with Iron Man, then realize that Captain America is only doing what is right speaks volumes about her character. Sebastian Stan is cool, exciting, and devastating as you watch Bucky get tortured until he's a sleeper cell agent called The Winter Soldier. Anthony Mackie is very casually funny as Falcon as is Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. Ant-Man's enlarged form steals the show and Rudd is so charming as this oddball hero. \n\nDon Cheadle is touching as the veteran War Machine and cool during the crazy airport battle. Jeremy Renner is fantastic as Hawkeye with a weary and funny performance as the artful archer. Chadwick Boseman is immediately cool and mysterious as Black Panther. His combat is mesmerizing, let alone his commanding gravitas. Paul Bettany makes Vision feel wise, even when he's wrong. You believe that Vision wants to protect Wanda, but he does not trust her with her own powers. Elizabeth Olsen is moving as the hurt Wanda Maximoff, while awesome as the magical Scarlet Witch. Emily VanCamp is endearing as Agent 13 or Sharon Carter. \n\nTom Holland is likable and funny as the young Peter Parker and Spider-Man. His quips and nervous manner feel like comic book Spider-Man. Daniel Br\u00fchl's antagonist Zemo is understandable in his vengeful rage and sinister in conversation with The Avengers. Frank Grillo's Crossbones is intense in the action opener, while William Hurt packs a dramatic punch as the voice of the UN not authorizing The Avengers to operate of their own accord. Martin Freeman is funny as a government stooge. Marisa Tomei is gorgeous and playful as Aunt May. John Kani, John Slattery, Alfre Woodward, Jim Rash, and Stan Lee all have nice cameos.\n\nEditor Jeffrey Ford cuts swiftly between character point of views and gives each person time to speak naturally in gently cut conversations. The action is fast and sharp as opposed to the steady and engaging dialogue. Jeffrey Ford Civil War does not feel like 147 minutes long as it just grips you with exciting action immediately, then follows through with its promise of Marvel's mightiest heroes doing battle.\n\nCinematographer Trent Opaloch comes up with innovative ways to shoot the action with wide shots and real stunt performers. Going from Black Widow taking out guys in style to Ant Man's shifting sizes is really neat with creative cinematography. Civil War has a lot of attention to detail with sharp panning shots and nice framing for a change with some Marvel movies. The CGI is amazing for Vision's lasers, Scarlet Witch's red aura magic, and Ant-Man's size changes.\n\nComposer Henry Jackman's somber score cuts deep with Civil War's torn characters. His exciting and playful side comes out during the action with sweeping music and melodies bringing in this massive hero brawl. Costume designer Judianna Makovsky came up with cool contemporary Spider-Man and Black Panther outfits that look modern.\n\nOverall, Civil War is one of Marvel's most entertaining and interesting movies.",

It all felt like Marvel was \"aggressively\" snapping things into place rather than letting an organic story happen. This may sort of get away from the point a bit, but I dislike the airport scene because of how it ties into the much larger issues the movie has. The airport scene is exciting the first time around but it feels hollow, purposeless, and like I said before, completely contrived (which is how I felt about most of the movie). I personally thought Civil War failed because the conflict between Steve and Tony never once felt right and I couldn't buy into it since neither of them really seemed to be acting like themselves for much of the movie. \n\nI thought it actively ruined Tony and Steve with staggering amounts of stubbornness and idiocy. It turned Cap into a petty, backstabbing manipulator who was willing to risk the lives of so many he cares for (people who he knew would never turn him down if he asked for help) rather than actually attempt to have a real discussion with Tony. Tony's sudden 180 into being pro-Government control is so sudden and out of established character that I just never bought it. Yes he's usually a touch of a hypocrite but his distrust of Governments and bureaucracy has been one of the most persistent and clearly defined elements of his character. \n\nIt really felt like there was a movie missing somewhere which brought them both to this point, and the instances during the movie which rapidly led them to this point felt seriously artificial. The movie is written in a way to\u00a0make\u00a0these characters fight, when these characters would have tried to find another solution or at least make a serious attempt at talking things out. The story was seriously forced for much of the movie and I really was disappointed in it. Hell there was no actual character reason at all that Natasha was pro-accords. It was\u00a0only\u00a0done so that they could have her fight Hawkeye and so she could suddenly switch sides. The fact that these people would ever endanger the lives of people they care for to the extent they do and come to blows in the way they did was honestly kind of a disgusting bastardization of the characters. \n\nThe only part I thought actually worked in the movie was Cap and Tony at the end, when Tony learns what Steve had been hiding from him about Bucky and the fight they had. That was the only thing in the movie that actually felt real and I absolutely loved that. It was much very impactful, personal and significant because there was emotion and stakes behind that fight.",

It delivers on every front possible and has fantastic performances from every substantial cast member, whether lead or supporting. The fights and action set-pieces are some of the best you'll see in a Marvel movie and raise expectations for future films. The dialogue is top notch and the writing and directing overall are superb. This is a culmination movie but is structurally very different from the two Avengers films that came before it; this works well to its advantage since it gives us a big breath of fresh air. This is the first movie in the MCU that really focuses on the consequences of actions, and references previous installments in the process of doing so. Via this, Civil War is one of the most realistic and believeable movies in the franchise, other than the abilities of some of the characters. Civil War forces the Avengers to ask important questions about themselves as a team and their role in the world and in doing so puts them in difficult positions that have massive ramifications for the Avengers as an organization. The Avengers have had fights and disagreements before, but this movie takes that to another level and it's fascinating to watch them as they attempt to work through it. The writing and directing allow for multiple different storylines to converge without taking away from any of them, and they combine really nicely to add depth and emotional impact to the film. Daniel Bruhl's Zemo is one of the more complicated and convincing villains in the universe and his performance as the character is great, making Zemo a worthy yet unique adversary to the Avengers. Civil War highlights key character changes and furthers arcs for many of the Avengers, beautifully setting them and the team up for next outings. Civil War is also a great blend of humor and seriousness and introduces some big new characters smoothly. Overall, the film has a lot of finesse and is one of the most enjoyable and complex ones in the whole MCU, and is a must-see for Marvel fans.",

            "content": "Back when I had watched Batman v Superman and Captain America: Civil War for the first time, my verdict was absolutely clear: Batman v Superman is clearly the superior one of the two. In Batman v Superman I wanted Batman to win and that's what happened, while in Captain America: Civil War I wanted Iron Man to win but he lost. So I had already made up my mind - I was gonna hate every scene, every character and the whole story of this movie. I completely ignored what made this movie so great, just because it showed Captain America win. I had initially given this movie only 3 stars, but now that I gave it a rewatch, I have realised how wrong I was.\n\nThe thing that made this movie so great is what the stakes were. After the destruction that had happened in Age of Ultron, the Sokovia Accords were introduced. By convention anyone would think that Steve Rogers will support it being the patriot that he is, while Tony Stark will oppose it being the capitalist that he is. And if that had happened the entire movie would have come crumbling down. But instead, the opposite happened. Steve opposed it since he had seen what the Nazis were capable of, while Tony supported it since he was feling guilty of what happened over there. So here instead of their differences being created on the basis of their superficial ideologies, it changed to their personal ethics.\n\nThe team that they assembled was not based on similar reasons though. Spider-Man, War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, Scarlett Witch, Falcon - all of them took their sides based on their likeablility. Peter and Rhodes, for example, liked Tony so they took their sides while Wanda and Clint liked Steve more so they took his side. As a result the airport battle resulted in Black Widow changing sides. If she had taken sides with personal reasons, she'd have never done this. Black Panther was the only one who had gone against Captain because of his father's death, and he wanted revenge.\n\nZemo was also a great villain. He was very underappreciated until Falcon and the Winter Soldier came up. He really deserved a lot of praise for his master plan. He made the Avengers fight among themselves, tortured officials and finally made Tony try to kill Bucky. Unlike Ultron, who was the previous big villain, Zemo actually seemed like someone who could do something on his own because he had a complete idea of what he was fighting and what all could be put on the stakes if he really wants to create a rift among the heroes.\n\nThe fight scenes are the only thing I have a problem with. All the fight scenes which have Black Widow or Hawkeye in them always have tons of jump cuts. This was quite visible in the fight from the beginning of the movie. In the end however, the fight of The Winter Soldier alongside Captain America against Iron Man was pretty well choreographed. The makers of this movie didn't make it seem like Iron Man was weak. The situation was created such that Iron Man couldn't win. His suit was uncharged, he was emotional, they were in close range and he only wanted to incapacitate Captain America. If it had been a proper fight Tony wouldn't have wasted a second to turn them both into pulp.\n\nAnd finally what satisfies me the most is the comeuppance. Captain America and everyone who sided with him got arrested. It felt so good seeing Black Widow get what she deserves. This is probably one of the only MCU movies that actually had a consequence, something which only started happening in MCU after this movie took the bold step. The bad things that happened in this movie affected what will happen in the future. Otherwise one only those characters used to die who had been introduced in that very movie, bad guys always lost, the characters who had died came back to life (looking at you, Infinity War; especially Loki and Gamora).\n\nNow that I have learnt to appreciate the good movies, I ahve seen that Captain America: Civil War is actually a very powerful movie. This is a term I use for movies which look great and are great, overall a masterpiece. It's one of the most memorable and impactful MCU movies out there. I'm really sorry about trashing this movie previously. Now that I've grown up, I've also grown into liking it.",

Iron Man becomes very unlikeable in this (luckily he got it back in some later movies), and since we know that he is wrong when it comes to Bucky for a lot of it it's hard to see both sides. The Sokovia Accords rules are slightly too vague especially when it comes to later movies (maybe I'm stupid but I didn't fully understand that the rule was that they only needed permission to interfere with other countries/ needed to register until looking it up later), and it doesn't really make sense they'd be so willing to work with the government after events in previous movies. I think if they centered the fight solely around what to do about Bucky (and even had him actually be the one to kill Black Panthers dad while hypnotized causing a more interesting dynamic with justifications on both side) it would have been better. The action is amazing in this movie however so if you're looking solely for that you will be satisfied",

I have a blast every time Spider-Man and Ant-Man talk. I get chills every time Black Panther had an action scene. Now that T'Challa is gone due to Chadwick Boseman's recent passing I rewatch his scenes in sadness. On a brighter note this film has incredible character development. Every single character's disagreement is valid and it fits their character. When they all end up fighting each other at the airport. You know why their fighting and know exactly why they're there. You're not constantly asking why all the time you understand why there doing all of this. This film is also thrilling from beginning to end and you actually really don't  know what's going to happen until you watch it until the end. The only problem that I have with this movie his Zemo. His motivation is understandable I just thought that he needed to be more interesting. But they do fix this latter in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier.

Franchise entry pic employs legions of non-union CGI contractors, while Downey Jr. walked away with excess of 40 million for his participation in Captain America: Civil War.

The set pieces were amazing and the choreographed fight scenes were the best yet in the MCU. Fantastic introductions to the Black Panther and Spiderman.

            "content": "Captain America Civil War is iconic. It will be remembered as the go to example of how to have two protagonists, two good guys fight each other while keeping their characters consistent. It already has larger studios trying to imitate its success and failing to reach the high bar it sets. It perfectly executes the story it wants to tell. However, I feel that everything besides the narrative and characters were unmemorable and unnoteworthy . \n\nCreating a realistic scenario where the just, patriotic, noble Steve Rogers and the reformed, changed Tony Stark and not making it feel forced is no small feat. Full credit to the Russo brothers for masterfully crafting this narrative. The key to that narrative being the main antagonist of the film Zemo. \n\nZemo is definitely in the upper tier of Marvel villains. A masterful performance by Daniel Br\u00fchl combined with a masterful script and backstory come to make a compelling villain. When it comes to villains in an action movie, brain will always triumph bron. A smart, clever villain will always be leagues more interesting than a villain that is simply buff. Zemo is the perfect example of this, he reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker or Light Yagami, a smart villain with a genius plan.His charisma is nowhere near the level of Light and his look and performance is no where near as iconic as Heath Ledger, but his plan is absolute genius. \n\nAside from the villain, every side character gets fleshed out as well throughout the movie. Black Panther is introduced, and given a stronger character development than in his stand alone movie. Wanda and Vision start to develop a  very cute relationship that I'm sure will never, ever be exploited through a dated TV show on a barely relevant streaming service. Spider Holland is introduced, Black Widow continues to be true neutral in the mcu alignment chart, Hawkeye is here, enough said. \n\nTaking a step back from character analysis, my overall takeaway is that the movie succeeds in what it sets out to do with flying colors. It sets up a civil war between IronMan and Captain America, explores both their characters further and delivers solid action scenes. So why isn't this movie a 10/10? Honestly, as sad as it is to say it's because it's part of the MCU. The movie doesn't do enough new things to shake up the MCU or it's characters. Looking at it, you may disagree. Spiderman and Black Panther are introduced, Wannda and Vision develop a relationship, Tony Stark and Steve Rodgers fall out and don't speak to each other for years!. It's everything else that feels way too similar, nothing except the characters stand out. The music is unmemorable, the sound design as a whole is bland and flat. Camera work is once again unmemorable, lighting is flat and set design is boring. The best word to describe everything besides the characters and narrative is unnoteworthy. It's not deserving of scorn, but not deserving of praise either. \n\nUltimately, Civil War is a great story, with good production value. No major changes would be needed to improve Captain America Civil War just smaller tweaks would have made a world of difference.",

Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won't spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.\n\nIt gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.\n\nSebastian Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn't love that character in his preceding appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Br\u00fchl plays his role very nicely. Elsewhere, Paul Rudd's inclusion is amusing.\n\nThe whole film, as is normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made. As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I guess there's no hiding who my standout avenger is, eh?\n\nThe only 'but' I have for this is the title. It's practically an avengers film. I'm not saying it's an ill-fitting title, I get it's the titular character's arc, but I feel like it does the film a slight disservice - it's impacts much more than Captain America.\n\nThat's not a big deal, at all, though.

This movie has a really good balance between emotional moments and action. All the characters are really good developed and there are a lot good lines. Of course, it's about two sides in the Avengers group. One side who follows the governments of the world and the other side who wants to do what their feelings are saying, but if you look closely it's about a group of friends with different ideas about good and bad. I'm very positive about it and this was my first MCU movie I had ever seen! So this is really iconic for me personally. Why did I say in the light of 2020 it's a bit a point of discussion? Well, Captain America is so good as gone now, but his biggest group of enemies is still not defeated. This is probably his last movie in the Captain America series, so in my opinion it should have happened in this movie. On the other hand it's better with the knowledge of now. Spider-Man and Black Panther have their entrance in the universe. I think the biggest questionable point of this movie is that this movie really can't stand on itself. Almost all the other MCU movies can. It's not really a problem, but it explains why I gave it 4 stars instead of 4,5 or even 5.",

The cameos from Black Panther and Spiderman are icing on the cake of this exciting clash of superheroes. The action scenes are a lot of fun, especially the creatively epic fight sequence from the airport scene. While I do have issues with Captain America's anti-accountability stance and Tony Stark's hypocrisy with projecting his own past of irresponsible actions that got people killed, there is still enough interesting discourse between the two philosophies that creates an engaging ethical cash between the two heroes.",

The character dynamics, the dialogue, the strife that breaks these friends apart, the humour, heart, and even the (surprisingly for movies known for good action scenes) original, breathtaking action scenes that actually propel the story and characters forward-all of it serves an impactful narrative. The movie abounds in pitch perfect performances (apologies to those who hate aliteration) with Evans and Downey in particular killing it in every last scene. The end is truly gutwrenching. People have their own feelings about how the Marvel films are nowhere near the artistry of the Nolan Batmans (which i love) but just because a film has comedy in it, doesn't mean it isn't art or doesn't take its world seriously. Speaking of humour, Paul Rudd in this movie was genius in every single line reading. I am sure many would ridicule me for saying so, but i loved Daniel Bruhl's Zemo as a villain. His plan made sense and came from his own personal loss, not to mention, other than Thanos, he is the only villain to succeed in his goal fighting the Avengers. In fact, he even surpasses Thanos in that he manages to break the bond between these friends that ultimately leads to Thanos being able to win in Infinity War. His role wasn't as flashy as many Marvel villains but it was meaningful. And if all this wasn't enough, this movie brilliantly and succinctly introduces us to Spider-Man and Black Panther, both well-portrayed by Holland and Boseman, respectively. My favorite Marvel film and one of my all time favorite trips to the cinema ever.",

'Vengence has consumed you, it is consuming them, and I am done letting it consume me'.\n\nPeter Parker was perfect, smart way to introduce with Tony but Sony played with Tony~Uncle Ben too much. Spider-man leaving quips, movie reference and taking taking taking throughout fight sequence, teen-ager looking to impress Stark. The first thing Peter said when he heard he got selected as a Stark Intern was ask if it was paid, classic Peter. \n\nVision line of 'Our very own strength invites challenges, challenges incites conflict, conflict breeds catastrophe' is the most underrated line in history or MCU, party because it is long but I have it memorised. #MCUnerd\n\nNow about the real deal\nIf you look at Steve and Tony from a 3rd perspective, they both are right and wrong at the same time, flawed characters. Tony was driven by fear in Ultron now he is driven by Guilt. Captain America lost hope in institution because his SHIELD was inflantrated by Hydra. Their roots of motivations arises from the progression these characters have been taking from their past films. I loved their arguments in Avengers 1 but here it crosses the line for the final battle.\n\nPeggy dieing and Sharon Carters words of Peggy saying to stand on your ground for Cap to inspire, hits hard. Black Widow betraying Tony to let escape Steve was worth it as she knows where Steve is coming from.\n\nScarlet and Visions love story grows a little bit more, while other side characters like Ant-man being for laughs, Clint to pit against his classic Widow and Rhodey injury feels hard but him dieing would have been much better for more consequences of actions.\n\nThe registration act feels natural given the amount civilians death from past films. The airport sequence is iconic and I love that the characters are fighting but still pulling their punches, they were friends now are fighting against each other.\n\nTony as villain is believable but you feel bad for him at the end. Zemo on the other hand is one of my favourite MCU villains, love how he pulls all the strings and he succeeds to break the avengers apart, also making way for Thanos to win. This plan is always 1 step ahead but his plans seems too much fictional if you step back and thing about everything, its a con but the other great things I gets from this movie just blows this point away.\n\nOne major nerdy point, this movie had multiple times say ' Mission report, December 16, 1991' Dec 16 being Starks parents death while in Iron Man 1 (2008) showed a newpaper saying Starks died on Dec 17, this just proves people making this movies actually cares about these characters and wants to make quality movies and not just cashgrabs. Every single character gets there moment to shine and doesn't get neglected by the big cast.",

            "content": "Captain America: Civil War, directed by The Russo Brothers, had some BIG shoes to fill after The Winter Soldier, and they absolutely exceeded expectations, pushing the MCU films to new heights! Undoubtedly, Civil War is a huge fan service film, but that doesn't discourage the fact that this film is one of the best of the saga, thus far, having so many relatable themes, and memorable scenes. The Russo Brothers set this intriguing, serious tone for the majority of the film, creating amazing tension between the characters, while they interwove their brilliantly written humor. The Russo Brothers do such a great job keeping the continuity going from The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger, while also tying into the saga beautifully, setting up some great exposition. One of my main issues I have with Civil War; Not that there is so much going on, but the way they structured and balanced the scenes. The way the scenes were set, it didn't make the sequences feel as cohesive as they could've, with some plots becoming underdeveloped.\n\nEven though this is a story-driven film, The Russo Brothers, Stephen McFeely & Christopher Markus allowed for countless, brilliant character moments, allowing each character to shine, and get a little more depth. Every character's motive is understood and fleshed out well, because of the good writting, and the set up films prior, giving every character a few more layers. The only issue I had with the characters, is that the creative team set themselves for some balancing issues, strictly due to the additions of a couple of cameo characters, but they made the absolute best of it. With this being a Captain America film, you know he's going to have a lot on his plate, and the writers and Chris Evans handled and balanced everything great! His character was the main focus, being really well written, expanding on his genuine bond with the team, and reaching a new level of \"banter\" with Tony Stark. His argument was described so well, where you can whole heartily get behind him, and completely back him up. Tony Stark runs the same lines. His character was another main focus, being well written, and having the best character arch of the film. Robert Downey Jr. nails his role once again, being a stand-out, in someone else's movie. Tom Holland ABSOLUTELY CRUSHES his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man! This is such a fresh take on his character, being nailed to a T! Tom Holland seemed to get almost all of the best lines, stealing every single scene he's in! Holland brings an extreme likability to the character, and I can't wait for his solo film! Chadwick Boseman also gets introduced into the MCU, as the Black Panther, and he is another stand-out of this film! His character is also well written, having a nice character arch, being one of those characters you can instantly care for. Boseman puts on a great performance, proving he belongs in the MCU! We get one of the most highly anticipated characters, make his return, in Paul Rudd as Ant Man. He doesn't have much to do, but he makes the most out of all of his screen time! Scarlett Johansson returns as Black Widow, and returns as one of the most grounded of the character bunch. Her character gets a little more importance here, but she doesn't have that much characterization. Elizabeth Olsen favorably returns as Wanda Witch, having one of the best potentials coming into the film. McFeely and Markus tried to give her some importance, but her character was sadly sidelined, compared to everyone else. Paul Bettany runs the same lines as Wanda, getting a little more to do, but I needed more from the both of them. Sebastian Stan, Don Cheadle, and Anthony Mackie all return as their respected characters. They all had their minimal time to shine, but they were just left in the background, for the most part. Helmut Zemo is in the top three for most controversial villains of the MCU. I believed that Zemo had a purpose in this film, being a subtle villain, but if they were to scratch his character, the narrative wouldn't really change all that much, if anything, it would probably tighten up the narrative.\n\nThe screenplay by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, shines in most aspects, but they could've trimmed down some things, and gave it to the characters that needed that extra time to develop. If they did that, and maybe added another decent risk, or two, this film would be close to flawless.\n\nWith the action being handled by The Russo Brothers, you know it's going to be a hit, but this was a grandslam! They incorporated so many great shots, with the right amount of shaky cam, being one of the most notable films for the action. The Russo Brothers always know how to bring tention during these action sequences, and it was handled extremely well.\n\nOverall, Captain America: Civil War, is probably my second favorite MCU film, and I think it's more than fair to say that this is a film that belongs at the top of the list",

            "content": "At the time of release, this movie was hands down the best MCU movie that had been made with only one real competitor of The Winter Soldier. Civil War is a movie that had been built up to for 12 movies before it, so it may be hard to understand if you haven't watched another movie like Age of Ultron or Winter Soldier. But Civil War is Marvel at their best. It shows the state of the Avengers about a year after the events of Age of Ultron. While this is a Captain America movie, he's not the only one that has a great arc in this movie. The Avengers all have different opinions on how they should continue, after they are presented with the Sokovia Accords, saying the UN will be in charge of them. Each of their decisions make sense. Tony Stark supports the Accords, because he has seen what has happened when he is given too much power. He created the biggest threat that the Avengers had ever faced, and he feels responsible for the death of many, especially after a woman tells him about her son that died in Sokovia. Steve has just seen a government be taken over by HYDRA, and how government control can lead to terrible things. He knows that if they don't do what they do, things would be worse. By agreeing with the Accords, they would be giving up the right of choice. Rhodes supports Tony. Sam supports Steve. Black Widow supports Tony, because she hopes that if they support the Accords, they will be allowed to continue. This is the only family she's ever had, and she wants to keep it together. Vision tries to look at it logically and supports Tony, but his logic is flawed, because he assumes that the world ending events will stop if the Avengers stop avenging. One of the most amazing things about the movie is that it has an enormous cast of 12 superheroes and yet still doesn't feel cluttered or overloaded. The narrative focuses around Steve, Tony, Bucky, and sort of Natasha, but every character has their moment to shine. This movie also has some of the best action sequences in the MCU and the airport scene is probably one of the best action set-pieces in a superhero movie along with the Spider-Man 2 train sequence and the Dark Knight car chase. Its also amazing that both Steve and Tony are right in their own ways, which is why even though Iron Man is an antagonist, many people still support him, because he's also right in many ways. I personally am Team Cap but I see why others are Team Iron Man. The part in the airport scene where the Avengers are lining up to face each other is awesome. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are so funny, and make the movie enjoyable. In Civil War, we know why every character does exactly what they do. And then we have Zemo. Zemo is a very underrated villain. He is the one of the most effective villains as he was the only one besides Thanos that got what he wanted. He has clear and understandable motivations. The Avengers killed his family in Sokovia, and so now he wants revenge on them. Many people don't like Zemo because of his plan requiring a lot of luck. But it didn't require that much luck. Zemo just improvised in his plan as he went along. For example, his original plan was to find out about Siberia from the HYDRA guy, who he found out about after Black Widow released HYDRA's files to the internet in The Winter Soldier. He had already read about the what the Winter Soldier did in 1991 in that HYDRA book. He knew that Cap and Bucky were best friends, and what Cap would do for Bucky, as he had been following and studying the Avengers for a year. His plan was to get to Siberia, and get Cap and Bucky to follow him. The movie doesn't focus on the parts where he had to improvise as much because it would just be boring to see that, especially since the film focuses more on the heroes. He knew that Stark would do anything to make things right, as Wanda said in Age of Ultron, so he put the real Doctors body and fake mask for Bucky in the tub and told the hotel service person to come in, so she would find out that Bucky was framed, and Iron Man would see that Cap was right about a fake doctor and Bucky being framed, and the other soldiers. Steve and Bucky would follow him to stop the Winter Soldiers, Tony would follow to make things right with Steve. Civil War also has one of the best twists in a superhero movie ever. Zemo is the most subversive villain, and I was shocked when I saw Tony and Steve looking at the recording. It was such a good twist. We were supposed to think that December 16, 1991 was important, because of the super serum, and that Tony, Steve, and Bucky would face an army of Winter Soldiers. But instead of being big and meaningless, the Russos decide to make it small and powerful. Tony reaction is understandable, because it is how any normal person would act when they find out that the ones they thought were \"friends\" were actually the guy that killed his parents, and the guy that lied to him about it. The final battle is a gut punch. We all want them to stop fighting, but they can't. Civil War also has a great end for Steve Rogers's arc. He looks at Tony Stark as a bully that's trying to hurt his best friend, and he needs to stand up to that bully. He says the same thing he said to the bully in that ally all those years ago: \"I can do this all day.\" Bucky protected Steve when he was young, and Steve would save Bucky now. And when Steve is hitting Tony with the shield, we can tell that Tony thinks Steve will kill him, so he puts his hands over his face. When Steve puts the shield into Tony's arc reactor, we know there's no going back. When Tony said \"You don't deserve that shield,\" Cap drops the shield. The dropping of the shield is the end of Cap's arc. Steve stood for the traditional American values of honor, bravery, and justice, and he was noble and selfless. The dropping of the shield shows that Cap has rejected America, and this is not the America he stood for. Civil War has one of the most emotional endings. The Avengers are broken from within, and there is no healing. The themes of Choice and Revenge are clear and present. Choice drives the whole movie and the initial conflict between the heroes on the Accords. Revenge is shown when Zemo wants revenge on the Avengers. Black Panther wants revenge on Bucky, Iron Man wants revenge on Bucky. This is what tears them apart. Civil War also handles its new character really well. Spider-Man is a cool addition, and makes everything more enjoyable when he's there. But he is stuck there mainly for fans, because Spider-Man is the most marketable Marvel character. But Black Panther is awesome in the movie. He has his own character arc in the movie. He wants revenge on Bucky throughout the whole movie and does everything he can to kill him, because he thinks Bucky killed his father. He even follows Iron Man, because he knows Bucky will be there and he wants to kill Bucky. Then, he finds out that it was actually Zemo who killed his father and finds and confronts him. Zemo tells him about how he wanted revenge on the Avengers for the death of his family. When hearing this, T'Challa realizes, that he too wanted revenge on Bucky, and that this desire for revenge was destructive to those with it, and that by taking revenge, he was no better than Zemo. Because of this, he decides to give up this desire to kill Zemo in an act of revenge, and says: \"Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.\" Civil War is a masterpiece of a movie, and I definitely recommend watching it.",

It is when Spider-Man swoops in and takes Cap's shield, that scene is so fun to watch and it just is so cool when we see Spider-Man for the first time. In my opinion, this isn't really a Captain America movie it is really an Avengers 2.5 more than a Captain America movie. I honestly think this has RDJ's best performance in the MCU and this movie has some pretty good performances.\n\nI think this movie has some of the best action scenes in the whole MCU and it has some of the best choreography too. The sound design is very good with all of the sound effects like Spider-Mans webs, Iron Man's repulsors, and the jets sound so good. Like I said before this movie has some of the best performances in the whole MCU and I think this has RDJ's best performance in the whole MCU. The CGI and the De-Aging in the movie is very good but some people don't like the floating head from Iron Man's suit, in reality, if you were wearing an iron suit it would most likely resemble that of Iron Mans. The score elevates the whole movie and the airport scene is one of the coolest in the whole MCU with the score in it and all of the MCU movies have some of the scores of all time in my opinion. This really is just choosing a side and sticking with it I know that I am on Iron Man's side and I just wanted to keep him winning and winning and if I was on Cap's side I would want the same thing. They do have some twists I would have never seen coming which I was nervous because I thought I might have been predictable but thankfully it wasn't. Like I said in the previous MCU reviews it is so cool to see what he will accomplish and become later in his life. Like I said before I just wanted Iron Man to keep winning and pushing forward and I was on the edge of my seat because of the twists and the things they throw at you and I wanted to see him keep pushing and I kinda wanted Cap to lose and the incredible adapted from the comic from what I have heard they changed a few things but I heard they adapted it well. In the end, nobody really wins. Overall I absolutely love this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

Natasha is alright - she didn't do too much, I loved Rhodey in this one more than any of his other appearances. Vision was fun, Wanda was very cool. Zemo was an excellent villain, not someone you would expect which made it all the better. The airport fight was OK.

Slick dialogue, sick action, some smart retconning and remodelling and a smattering of excellent ideas. The concentrated, focused tone and influences and the cleverly designed superhero moments make for a memorable and nail-biting superflick.\n\nRemember that first time you saw a Marvel movie and you loved it. That very special Marvel movie that you came out of the cinema thinking: \"THAT'S what these connected, colourful, gripping, comic properties should be, full of in-jokes and great surprises and genuine humour.\"\nCivil War wipes the floor with that.\nFully succeeds at making a Cap centric story that has some amazing character introductions, exchanges, and is focussed on paying off so many threads from previous Marvel films in a way Ultron wishes it could.\nIt appeases the adult in me by providing rich dialogue, completely balanced non-archetypal politics, and stunning modern action sequences, each one with three or four gags at least that makes smart individual use of the characters skills involved.\nCap's third instalment simultaneously managed to also appeal to the child in me by providing many, surprising, earned comic book moments full of wonder and integrated very organically and very differently to the clusterfuck that was Ultron.\nI genuinely cheered, and exclaimed in wonder, or surprise or shock. And that's a testament to the skill, nerdy smarts and talents of the Russos and their team. Making Cap a sympathetic, emotional, very un-American hero.\nYes, you do have to have seen the other MCU properties to appreciate this movie. But even without all the comic bookiness, it succeeds as a taught 'family' thriller, brothers versus brothers. Genuine globetrotting (nice use of location cards) thrilling, clever, riveting, twisty movie that takes Winter Soldier, throws everything bad about it out, tosses in everything that made Iron Man great and closes off so many threads in a sensitive, spiralling, ingenious way that you can't help but go along for the ride and come out grinning.\nI won't whisper in your ear about how great it is (the way you could palpably hear a ripple of boyfriends in the cinema explaining who this or that is in the MCU when they appeared!) But instead I will shout from the rooftops how great this movie is - because if the MCU is more like this, then it isn't a colossal, cheeky, cashgrab, it can sometimes meet the lofty heights of an affective, reflective, relevant piece of art.",

All the positive reviews about him turned out to be true, and I even liked his only minus, the drawback of the first half of the film, I liked. He lets the movie swing.\n\nThe Russo brothers really can and now they have proved it. I'm glad that Joss Whedon left the studio, and now they will be the ones who will shoot the next Avengers - it's much better for them. They were able to do in the film about Captain America what Whedon could not do in the Age of Ultron - they assembled a huge team of heroes, both old and new, and managed to give out an unmixed mess from events where storylines and sometimes even the characters themselves are lost , and a measured and consistent drama, where everything is arranged on the shelves, and every little thing is visible.\n\nBy the way, they trained to shoot the Avengers clearly on this film, since it certainly is not about Captain America. This is really just another Avengers, only without Thor and the Hulk, but with a handful of new heroes.\n\nAnd to the topic of characters. The ant was nice to see, Tchalla is damn good and Spider-Man turned out to be a berry on the cake. How cool he is! This is the best Spider-Man of all that was on the screen before him. The perfect Peter Parker. I even applauded as soon as he appeared in the frame. I liked the previous Spider-Man and I regretted that they covered him, but now I realized how wrong I was. And yes, the age of Tom Holland is one hundred percent hit. Still, better than Marvel, no one knows how to film their own characters.\n\nIt was also pleasant to watch the development of the characters introduced in the Age of Ultron.\n\nThe villain was also worthy. Baron Zemo is not a typical villain (like the whole movie) for Marvel. It will not disappear from your head as soon as you leave the hall and, most likely, will remind yourself of yourself in other films.\n\nTrue, the secondary villain Krosbones, who was stupidly leaked at the very beginning, gave the best hope. By the way, he laughed out loud when he took off his mask, under which was his other mask. Just like Deadpool, but with the only difference being that this moment was conceived as serious.\n\nMartin Freeman, who literally flashed a couple of times, wanted much more, especially after he was vividly announced about his participation in the film.\n\nThe only negative that I would note is the ambiguous and almost open ending. Usually I like this, but here a similar denouement seemed inappropriate to me. I would still like to know what, in the end, happened with the Avengers, or at least with the heroes themselves after everything that happened. This question remains unanswered.\n\nAnother such question was \"Where did Nick Fury go?\" Thor in Asgard, the Hulk is there with him, as stated, but what is the excuse for the one-eyed leader? Moreover, everything that happens, it seems, is directly related to him - it's his Avengers! I think he would deal with quarreling children.\n\nIn general, I liked the picture, how I like few films from Marvel. In addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy, at least not a single such impression was made yet. Hope to see more of these superhero movies.",

It was hard to believe the MCU could be fresh after so many movies, and this looked like a cash grab, but i was happy to be wrong. Left the cinema like a kid, excited to talk to my friends about this.",

Sure, his plan requires a lot of luck and chance, but he is a perfect behind the screen villain, well Tony is actually pictured as the antagonist in the movie. Have I mentioned that I love the accords yet. The accords are a perfect thing to get this whole thing started. Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman are all excellent in this movie. The directing is absolutely perfect and the introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man was so good. I absolutely loved this movie, but it does become a little bit long at times. That and convenient plot points hold it back slightly. Also, have I mentioned how perfect Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. were? These are the best movies not named Avengers: Endgame they have been in yet. Unbelievably good movie, but just a little long and convenient.\n9.4/10",

The red herring plan is great and allows for the perfect conflict. Breaking the Avengers apart is the perfect concept for Marvel, it creates tension between characters that will have to be overcome in the future. We learn about Bucky, learn about Tony's past, and we get a massive insight into Steve's morals. Steve has already been seen doing what's right and just even if it disobeys direct orders, but this time he does it not against the government, but against his best friends as well. This movie also provides an introduction to multiple characters that were previously either not yet seen in the MCU, or had just not yet been introduced to the other characters.

So the government made up a contract which says they don't go after people on there own anymore. The Avengers all reacted differently which made them split up into two groups, Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Iron Man is for the contract, Captain America is against. Then there is also the fact that someone is pretending to be Bucky and committing crimes as Bucky. So Iron Man gets mad at Bucky and Captain America does everything to protect him. AKA there is a lot of anger is this movie.\n\nThe movie started off with a fight scene. Which was a very cool fight scene, the only thing was that it really frustrated me that the camera dude apparently could't keep his hands any sort of still. I watched the movie in IMAX 3D so maybe that's why it kind of bothered me in the beginning. But after a while I didn't mind it at all, and it just felt like you were more a part of the movie. I would highly recommend watching this movie in IMAX 3D cuz it was great. The movie was filled with fighting scenes and my favorite one was where both teams go against each other ya feel. All the cool characters together (that's funny cuz they weren't actually \"together\" ha) and there was surprisingly a lot of comedy in that battle too, which I personally really enjoyed.\n\nApart from all the lovely comebacks there where some new faces as well! First we got Black Panther, who has the coolest suit, but he was a bit too determent to get to Bucky, but once there will be more movies about him (which I guess is going to happen?) that for sure will change and I think I'll start liking him a bit more once that happens. ALSO the new Spider-Man! He's such a kid though, haha. I adore Tom Holland as Spider-Man he is so funny, I can't wait for more, I love it. I also want to take a moment to praise Paul Rudd, because he is the coolest and he made me laugh, a lot. Okay so, I can keep talking about all the characters, and I can keep going on for quite a while as well, but I won't because they are all just so cool. I have a lot of feelings. One thing I want to say though is that I keep getting more and more frustrated about Black Widow, I'm sorry I know there a probably a whole lot of fans out there but I just keep questioning why she's in the movies. I mean, she is a good and pretty dope fighter but that's it. I most of the time felt like that about Hawkeye as well, but not in this movie, so that's great.\n\nIt was a lot like Batman v Superman, almost the same storyline only some different characters, obviously ha. But I really really enjoyed it! It was so entertaining and the movie ended before I even knew. I really love the characters and it was fun to finally get to know more about their stories. I can't wait till this continuous. I already said a lot, and although I could still go on for quiet a while I'll stop now, so y'all can go watch this cool movie :-)",

While vague enough to be somewhat geopolitically prescient, this is also a plot we've seen before (wasn't this Loki's plan as well, to get the Avengers to fight one another and tear them apart from the inside?). Then again, the narrative conflict here is really rather perfunctory, and even more than the previous franchise installment, the movie feels like a lynchpin for the broader Marvel arc, workmanlike in its forthright efficiency, a workhorse for all that the film introduces, brings together, and moves around the board. The Russo Bros. do an apt job managing such a massive cast and monumental task, making the plot keep moving if not necessarily making it emotionally moving, even though Cap himself ends up feeling like something of a support character in his own franchise. The emotions are a bit too simple and one-dimensional, as if the screenplay itself had to turn superheroes into strawmen to keep proceedings coherent; the plot is simultaneously too byzantine and too straightforward, lacking in surprises yet full of complications; the characters are a few too many, their allegiances too fleeting---still, the result adds up to be more than its parts, especially in the spectacular crossover melee climax.",

He would have a harder time to put his hatred for the Stark family aside and join Iron Man\u00e2(TM)s side because he would be convinced that it would stop enhanced people like his sister from causing causalities again. He would try to beat Cap again and run around Giant-Man in circles, but he would be defeated easily.He would also refuse to fight back against Wanda and as a result, she wins the battle, throwing his famous catchphrase back at him \"We both didn't see this coming.\" During the beginning of the battle between the two teams of Avengers, He would also run faster than everyone else, even Spider-Man during the beginning of the battle between the two teams of Avengers. He would appear as a blur compared to everyone else. I imagine the Lagos incident would still happen even if he drops Wanda to lift Crossbones up into the sky. He also would have a rivalry with Vision over his romance for Wanda,have Black Widow help him learn of American culture and give Spider-Man a run for his money. At the battle in Germany at the airport, he would bicker and fight with his rival Hawkeye once again, while being surprised how he named his newborn son after Pietro and show anger at Vision for not being able to focus on capturing Cap and Winter Soldier due to his love for Wanda. At the end of the film, he would run around the training room, unsure of what to do now that the Avengers disbandedCaptain America and Pietro would both have a falling out over their differences of being the protective big brother of Wanda, which would lead him to joining Iron Man's side in Captain America: Civil War. It would also show that  despite battling each other and unlike Tony and Steve, nothing would ever break their love and loyatlity to each other. Even though they would be seperated at the end of Civil War, they would know that it would not be long and they would need each other when the Avengers reformed.",

First of all, it makes no sense for a Captain America movie to feature as much Iron Man as it does Captain America. They should've made this into an Avengers movie and given Cap a real third solo installment. \nThis movie barely has any soul, and worst of all, is trying to convince us that Iron Man's opinion is as valid as Captain America's, which it isn't, especially in Cap's own movie. This movie was so unabashedly biased in Iron Man's favor, despite the fact that he should have been a secondary character, that it made me angry. There is nothing noble about Tony trying to force his friends to sign their freedom away to the UN, especially given that trigger for him was the Sokovia tragedy, which HE caused (I know we all collectively try to forget about Ultron, but come on). There is nothing righteous about Tony trying to murder a brainwashed prisoner of war who was forced to commit atrocities. There is nothing dignified about Tony blackmailing a fifteen year old child into fighting with him against a group of overpowered superheroes. \nLet's all stop pretending that Tony Stark is a good person and that Captain America: Civil War is anything but the physical proof of everyone's willful blindness on that. Giving flaws to characters is obviously recommended to give them depth, but it only works if said characters are held responsible for their actions at some point. This movie is frustrating and a pain to watch and nothing more.",

            "content": "The Russo Brothers done a good job with this one. Fans have wanted Civil War to be a film since the start of The Avengers. To be honest I thought this film would be on a fast track to win Robert Downey Jr an Oscar. Robert Downey Jr as Ironman is the best thing I've seen since, well ever. You really feel a lot of sympathy for Iron Man seeing what he went through during the film. Most definitely recommend for 12+.\n\nThe comic book accuracy in this movie was surprisingly accurate. Also the poster for the film was super satisfying and cool to see come to life on screen. One of the best thing I found about Civil War was that we (the audience) had to pick a side between Cap or Tony. Also the CGI was incredible and almost seemed real.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws in Captain America: Civil War is that the rest of the movies have been carried on its shoulders, so you would have to watch Civil War to understand what was going on in future films starring each character. Not fully but there would be alot of references and scenes mainly referring to it. I did not like that we never got to see what happened to the main antagonist. \n\nIn this Marvel cinematic film they introduce Spider-man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Tom Holland, I must be honest, I originally thought he wasn't a good choice for our Spider-Man but now seeing how well his performance was and how good the suit was. I was definitely wrong. And Chadwick Boseman role for the film - I didn't really know what to expect because it's not like we have seen a Black Panther performance before, but seeing his performance I was amazed with it.\n\nGrade: A",

The fact is however, that the 'hero', Captain America, who is created to protect the country, does not listen and keeps dropping civialian bodies. In an attempt to soften the load and make sure for the audience that Cap is actually the good guy, the two 'hero' teams of Cap and Iron Man fight, in an attempt of Iron Man to stop Cap from dropping more casualties. The plot of the movie is completely ruined when in this fight nobody dies, and Cap gets off without a scratch. This makes you wonder where everybody's intentions lie, and whether anyone of the 'heroes' actually cares about 'the people' (civilians) there are trying to protect by fighting in the first place. In a matter of easing the pain, during the fight, War Machine drops down to earth when his suit dies, but even he gets out without dying from the drop. As a spectator, this makes you gringe so hard, why is there no parachute? The movie is ended with one last fight in which nobody does (again), and when you start to wonder where this movie begun, you begin to wonder what has changed in Marvel universe in this movie.

Because the Avengers broke up. And this movie absolutely pulled it off. \n\nCaptain America Civil War is a very entertaining and thought provoking movie that includes every single hero that has been introduced so far (as of May 2016). Captain America Civil War yet again stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark aka Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers aka Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson aka Falcon, Sebastian Stan as James Buchan Barnes aka The Winter Soldier or Bucky and more all portraying their own heroes again whilst tackling one of the MCU's most interesting, non cartoonish and confusing storylines. \n\nMarvel's \"Captain America: Civil War\" finds Steve Rogers leading the newly formed team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity. But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps-one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark's surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.    - From Rotten Tomatoes\n\nBefore I move on to my Story Review may I warn you that there will be SPOILERS for Captain America Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Spider Man Homecoming. Read at your own risk. I'll be discussing them in quite a lot of detail. The film opens with Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier getting mind controlled by HYRDA who order him to get serum for there The Super Soldiers. This scene felt like we were watching The Winter Soldier again, I know Bucky's story is still to be continued due to the fact that he finds out that he is actually Bucky in The Winter Soldier but I didn't really see the point of this scene until I found out it's meaning. Next we are in present day where Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), Falcon (Sam Wilson) and Captain America (Steve Rogers) are fighting Crossbones and his goons. There fights leaves destruction and havoc that the UN comes to together to try and stop the Avengers from being a private organisation. Instead they want the Avengers to be monitored and only be sent on missions if absolutely necessary. This causing a rift between the Avengers as you have Falcon, Captain America and Scarlet Witch who think the ACCORDS should not go ahead and let the Avengers still be a private organisation. Then you have Tony Stark, Black Widow, Vision and Colonel James Rhodes who think they should have the ACCORDS as it will stop the Avengers from killing the innocent and Tony thinks if they don't sign the ACCORDS something bad will be done about it later. This sets up the rest of the film nicely and this scene express all the Avengers' opinions and thoughts on the ACCORDS. Once Steve Rogers comes back from Peggy Carter's Funeral (which could of been more emotional and more satisfying) Black Widow goes off to Vienna to discuss the ACCORDS. This is where we meet King T'Chalka of Wakanda (The Former Black Panther) and Prince T'Challa of Wakanda (The New Black Panther). At the Vienna ACCORDS a Sokvian person called Zemo disguises himself to make him look like Bucky Barnes and sets off a bomb that kills at least 12 people at the UN including King T'Chalka. T'Challa is so devastated that the bomb killed his dad that he goes off to kill the person he thinks is responsible, Bucky. Black Widow calls up Steve. Steve tells her he knows what Bucky is doing  so he is going to get him. Black Widow tells him to stay out of it but he doesn't. Steve goes to Bucky's house that is filled with armed soldiers, Steve kills some of them and lets Bucky escape. T'Challa, now Black Panther, finds Bucky and chases him down a motor way. Captain and Falcon follows them but the three are later arrested when Rhodes, in the War Machine armour, turns up with follow police officers. When T'Chalka died, it was actually pretty sad, and we saw why T'Challa wanted revenge. We also saw what Steve would do for his friend but it feels like we have seen Bucky and Captain America fight at lot of times before due to The Winter Soldier movie and the arguments between Steve and Bucky feel like 'De ja vu' therefore it's getting quite repetitive. In Berlin, Captain America, Falcon, Black Panther and Bucky are all taken to the CIA headquarters in Berlin. There we get to meet Everett K Ross who is played by Martin Freeman and we now get to see what Sharon Carter is doing after SHIELD was compromised. Captain America (Steve Rogers), Falcon (Sam Wilson) and Black Panther (T'Challa) aren't put in cells but in offices, however they still cannot leave it. All there outfits, belongings are taken from them including Cap's Signature Shield. Bucky is now taken into a special room where he is kept in a special portable cell where he is interrogated by Zemo, the man behind the Vienna bombing. Zemo has killed the real physiatrist who is supposed to interrogate Bucky. Tony has a conversation with Steve telling him that him and Wanda (Scarlet Witch) will get reinstated. Steve is confused about Wanda so Tony says she is being protected by Vision in a Compound. Steve says she is only a kid and storms off a doesn't sign the ACCORDS like Tony wanted him to. In this conversation Tony mentions that him and Pepper Potts are 'taking' a break but in Spider Man Homecoming (the next film that Tony makes a main appearance in) and in that film he proposes to her. Does this mean that in the two month gap between Spider Man Homecoming and Civil War that Tony got back together with Pepper. Back in the Interrogation room, Zemo has annoyed Bucky and Bucky breaks out of his cell and escapes. Steve then finds Bucky and Bucky admits that he killed Tony's parents as they had serum that would make people into Super Soldiers. Tony asks Thunderbolt Ross if he and a few others can suit up and track down Barnes. Thunderbolt gives him 48 hours to bring in Barnes. Black Widow says she'll get Black Panther to help and Tony flies of to Queens to recruit Peter Parker to become Spider Man, I'll speak more about his character later on. Tony now used up most of his 48 hours recruiting Peter travels to Berlin's airport with Rhodes aka War Machine, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow and Spider Man to fight Captain America and his team that includes Hawkeye aka Clint Barton, Scarlet Witch aka Wanda Maximoff and Scott Lang aka Ant Man. Cap's team is the team against the ACCORDS who are breaking the law by fighting without permission and there is Tony's team who are trying to bring in Barnes and who are for the ACCORDS.  As Steve Rogers (Cap) will not hand over Barnes and turn himself in, Peter Parker, now in his brand new Spider Man Suit, jumps in and steals Cap's Shield. They fight but Black Widow betrays Iron Man aka Tony Stark and lets Bucky and Cap escape in a Helicopter. Rhodes and Tony fly after it but Falcon goes after them. Vison uses the Mind Stone to stop Falcon but it hits Rhodes and Rhodes breaks his legs. Captain America and Bucky fly off whilst Rhodes and Iron Man go to the hospital along with the rest of their team and the rest of Captain America's team who were left at the airport are arrested and taken away. This scene is by far the most thrilling and the all round best fight scene in the entire MCU and I'll speak more about that later on. Black Panther tells Ross that Black Widow is the reason why Captain America escaped so she goes on the run whilst Tony flies of to the prison to try and get information as to where Steve went. At the prison Falcon secretly tells Tony where Steve went and Tony flies of to get them and T'Challa follows Tony. On the way there, Tony is sent footage of Zemo that tells him that Zemo disguised himself as Bucky and that Zemo wasn't supposed to interrogate Bucky. Tony sends the footage to Ross. I am not sure if it is either Thunderbolt Ross or Everett Ross, it did not say. Tony makes a Truce with Cap and they explore the deserted island they're on. They find Zemo, who shows Tony footage of Bucky killing his parents. We briefly see this scene at the very start of the movie. This scene was actually really emotional and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Iron Man in this scene was brilliant. Steve admits that he knew Bucky killed his parents so Iron Man fights them. Zemo escapes but is caught by T'Challa who arrests him. Zemo admits that he set off the bomb in Vienna and he is sorry. He admits that his plan was to break up the Avengers. He then tells T'Challa that he wanted the Avengers dead because they are the reason for his wife's death. This scene was absolutely brilliant as it showed us why Zemo was a bad guy and why he did what he did. Captain America and Bucky defeat Iron Man by breaking the arc reactor that powers his suit. And now that greatest line of the movie is said by Tony 'You don't deserve that Shield, my father made that Shield!'. Steve leaves his shield and leaves with Bucky to free his friends in Prison and they go the Wakanda. Tony flies back to see Rhodes and Black Panther takes Zemo to Berlin for questioning. Tony then finds a letter, that was given to him in a very funny way by Stan Lee, that is from Steve. Steve tells Tony that was he did was wrong and that he is sorry for everything that happened. For me this was a great way to end the movie and it set up lots of new possibilities for the MCU. It's a shame we didn't get to see Hope Van Dyne, The Wasp, in the Airport fight though. There is also a few post credits scenes. The first one we get to see Bucky 'going back into the ice' until the Wakandans can find a way to cure his brainwashing and make him immune to it. For me I was excited for what was to come next once I saw this scene as it set ups lots of possibilities as to what The Black Panther movie would feature. The next one we see Peter Parker at home suffering from injuries he made in the airport battle, however when we last saw Peter Parker he had no scars on his face so how did he get them, was it just a editing mistake? Anyway, we then see him shoot a laser that projects the Spider Man symbol. It was quite obvious that we would see more of Spidey but this post credits scene was actually a pure joy to see.\n\nFirst of all can I just say that bringing Spider Man and Black Panther into the MCU was a real game changer and they chose the best people for the job. I honestly think that Marvel nailed Peter Parker, I think that Tom Holland is the best Peter Parker thus far. He looks the right age, he seems nerdy and his acting as the web slinger is top notch. Also Chadwick Boseman is also brilliant as Black Panther but I think that Marvel made a mistake of teasing Spider Man in the trailer and I think they should of left him for the big reveal in the movie. It would of been more exciting and shocking for the fans and would of added to the experience.\n\nThirdly, I will talk about the heroes and the two teams. The side I have picked is Iron Man, Iron Man is one of my favorite Marvel heroes period and he was in the right anyway so.... I like that the cast expressed their feelings for the UN ACCORDS and why they picked what side they did. Each individual hero had their time to shine on screen and they all were portrayed superbly. Marvel did have lots of heroes to deal with in this movie and they were able to fit them all in perfectly and they all had there own time to shine on-screen. The plot twist with Bucky and introducing the other Winter Soldiers was actually surprising and probably thrilled fans who wanted more than one Winter Soldier in Captain America The Winter Soldier. Iron Man/Tony Stark wasn't as funny and witty in this film as he has been in the previous films but that might of taken away the tone this movie set. Talking about humour, Scott Lang aka Ant Man (played marvellously by the extremely funny Paul Rudd) was the most humourous character in this film. His lines were really random and that is why they were funny. Also, Don Cheadle tackled the amputated leg scene superbly and showed what people are really going through. Overall all the heroes were portrayed excellently but it's a shame we couldn't of seen Thor and Hulk but they are somewhere in space. Cue Thor Ragnarok!\n\nNext, I'll talk about the villain, Zemo. Zemo is actually one of the best and most underrated villains in the entire MCU and is played terrifically by Daniel Br\u00fchl. He isn't even powerful but he is so smart and all the things he did were really well planned and clever and that's why I think he is the best villain in the entire MCU. He also has a moral reason to break up the Avengers. The Avengers killed his family when they were fighting Ultron so all he wanted was revenge and, boy, he got his revenge nice and toasty.\n\nNow, I'll go onto talking about the worst things about this film, there aren't any big mistakes in the film but there are them odd mistakes here and there but all movies have them so it's no need to talk about them. But before I move on can I just say that every time I've watched this movie, I have found out something new about the plot or Zemo or even what's going. All the way through this movie I just kept thinking about what is happening and why it's happening. This is a very thought provoking film that I had to rewatch as I was quite baffled the first time round. The film did actually improve hugely when I rewatched. The 2 hour and a half run time went by very quickly and the film was paced nicely and didn't drag. Back to talking about the worst things about Civil War, a big mistake this movie made was including two characters called Ross, I mean I don't have any thing wrong with the characters it's just that half the time you didn't know which one they were talking about. They could of called them by there first name to make it more understandable. Also the arguments do get repetitive about the ACCORDS. I did speak about the problem with Bucky and Cap in my story review so there is no need to revisit that here. But what I would of liked to off seen in the film is the return of Betty Ross, General 'Thunderbolt' Ross returned since The Incredible Hulk (a film I actually enjoyed) so why couldn't she return, it feels like see doesn't even exist anymore.\n\nThe sixth thing I'll talk about is my favorite scene, the Airport Battle. That is one of the best scenes in the MCU and is absolutely awesome. It was a dream to see all this character battle it out. We got a glimpse at the next Spider Man film and a glimpse at the Black Panther film too. The Airport Battle had some devastational effects on the characters and each character that was included in this big fight each had there own time to shine. It's just so good. \n\nOverall, Captain America Civil War brings together all the heroes introduced so far (as of May 2016), and even introduces some new ones, to make this absolutely awesome film that includes a sinister villain, a non cartoonish plot and some awesome fight scenes that is still, to this day, one of Marvel's best movies.",

Directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, had the seemingly impossible task of cramming dozens of different characters into one cohesive movie - and yet they pulled it off with style. Civil War is Marvel's deepest and most focused movie yet, with the story's central conflict between Chris Evans' Captain America and Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man. The main cast, including Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier and Anthony Mackie's Falcon give their best performances, the latter providing some much-needed levity. Newcomers, Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman (particularly the former, who steals the show) are also excellent additions. The action exceeds all expectations, as well. The battle at Berlin Airport is overflowing with scale, explosions and (surprisingly) some laughs as well. This is quickly followed by a more dark, emotional climax. With its cast, action scenes and emotional depth Civil War, indeed, has everything fans could have wanted. While it's conflicting tones can (occasionally) be distracting, Civil War is an impressive feat to pull off and should give fans confidence with the Russo's directing the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War.",

            "content": "Captain America Civil War is the best of the Captain America trilogy and also a superb way to kickstart the third Phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Captain America Civil War, the Avengers' lives are at stake after a mission goes awry that resulted with the deaths of a number of civilians. To solve this problem, the government introduces the Accords where the heroes will only work for them to save others when necessary. While Iron Man along with his allies agree to this, Captain America and the others refuse to do so. Things just couldn't get worse when the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes becomes a wanted man after bombing the piece treaty in Vienna that killed T'Challa's father. Cap soon learns that his friend has been framed and that he must find the mastermind behind the events that led to the fracturing of the Avengers as Iron Man fights his way to send Cap into custody. Back when this showed two years ago in IMAX I had a blast watching it, especially on the Director's Club. When I got it on DVD, I still couldn't get enough of this film as Marvel has really become a game changer by the start of Phase Three which led to Avengers Infinity War and this is one of Marvel's best efforts to date. Between DC's Batman V Superman and this film, Captain America Civil War is a much better experience especially when DC now starts to sink gradually from one film to the next. With Marvel, the stakes are high and they slowly start to turn into the crown jewel of comic book movies that began with the original Iron Man until this film,  Avengers Infinity War and so on. One of the things that I like about Captain America Civil War is that this movie like the previous films does a great job in keeping their footing on the right direction while telling a good story. This movie seriously did the job expanding some of the questions from the previous films like what truly happened to Iron Man's family and so on. I love how the film is well executed during the course of the story that does not lose its direction from one place to another as it is told in a powerful yet intriguing way. The movies twists and turns are so unexpected, you'd never see it coming. The themes about how far would you go to be a hero is well explored; every character is so fun to watch from the new ones (Black Panther) to the returning and reintroduced faces (Spider-Man and Ant-Man). The action scenes are intense combined with good old fashioned humor like what the previous Marvel films usually do (the airport battle is funny and exhilarating featuring crazy CGI effects from past Marvel films and the thrilling final battle against Iron Man, Captain America and Winter  Soldier). There are some scenes that are just as suspenceful as in its predecessor (the death of T'Challa's father, the Winter Soldier going crazy and the shocking twists in the finale) and last but not least, the main highlight of this film is the main antagonist Helmut Zemo, beginning with this film until Ant-Man And The Wasp, the villain issue has been solved. Neither of the enemies the Avengers faced this time around are not watered down from lack of character development. Marvel seriously responded to this issue by giving us villains who are threats to the heroes or are more human and changed the heroes mind knowing that the villains are usually telling the truth for all the right reasons and Zemo is just the start. Now that the films can compete with the Netflix Marvel shows villains. The acting is spot on, everyone from the casts did a good job with their roles in this film from Chris Evans to Robert Downey Junior as Captain America and Iron Man respectively. While the new faces like Tom Holland and Black Panther are amazing, last but not least. The returning casts from past Marvel films like Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle are great as Black Widow, Ant-Man, Falcon and War Machine while I like seeing Stan Lee once more in another funny Marvel cameo. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo did a spectacular job with their work on this film, they really took a huge leap forward with their work on this film until Avengers Infinity War with the help of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. These four are the key players of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as they helped in expanding this universe in the best directions thanks to their hardwork and effort this franchise has sprawled to the top of the hill. Overall Captain America Civil War is a fun start for the Phase Three MCU films, the result is an entertaining and memorable Action film filled with humor and charm while delving deeper into the mythology of this expanding universe. This film gets an 11/10.",

Team Iron Man- Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff), Chadwick Boseman (T'challa/Black Panther), Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), and Paul Bettany (Vision).

The only thing this movie actually achieved was destroying my opinion of all the characters involved, every single one of them should have handled the entire affair way better than they did. The Vision went from being something really interesting in Age of Ultron to some kind of weirdly obsessive nanny.

It was a bit anemic when it came to humor but the actors managed to squeeze some out.  After seeing \"Avengers: Infinity War\" this past weekend and keeping \"Captain America: Civil War\" in mind, I'm convinced more than ever now that Marvel Studios  needs to keep the Russo brothers far away from Marvel Studios movies.    These days we're surrounded by negativity anytime we turn on the news or read Twitter.  We don't need to see it reflected in a Marvel movie.  Marvel was good at keeping a positive view on things - enough so for us to escape into for a few hours while watching it.",

            "content": "While Marvel and DC are perpetual rivals, never before did they really go head to head with similar movies before the Spring of 2016.  After the massive disappointment of Batman V Superman, Marvel gave it a shot with their own version, also an adaptation of one of the most popular comic stories of all time.  I bring up DC because it's hard to think about Civil War without thinking of Batman V Superman because of how similar they are, and how close their release dates were.  And it's quite clear that part of what made Civil War great was that it succeeded where Batman V Superman failed.  This review is not just hating on DC, but it really is important.  Right when this movie came out, the disappointment from BvS was still fresh on our minds.  But enough about BvS, on to Civil War.\n\nMarvel has two types of movies, the mystical, cosmic ones and the earth-based ones.  This is clearly the latter.  It feels more like Winter Soldier than any other Marvel movie, and not just because it's a Captain America movie.  There's a lot of talk about the politics within the MCU's world, which is vital to the plot.  The Avengers are torn as to whether they should be put in check or not.  For those who may not be interested in fictional politics, this will be rather boring.  It's kind of like the politics in the Star Wars Prequels, only with way better writing.  The Sokovia Accords are something interesting to thing about though.  What if this was your world?  Would you want them kept in their place? \n\nThe characters in this movie is the most important aspect.  You have the clear division between Cap and Iron Man, where the tension they built over the previous few movies destroys their friendship.  At the end of the movie when they're fighting each other, it is actually sad.  You saw them build a relationship over the past few movies, and now look at them.  Of course, this movie's show stealer was Black Panther.  Wow.  Everyone knew he would be a fun character to watch, but he was much better than anticipated.  The way his character develops makes for a very great sub-plot, which this movie definitely needs.  Zemo is one of Marvel's best villains.  He has no powers, no super-suit, no magic weapon, none of that.  All he has is an idea and some Soviet secrets, and you could very well argue that he wins in the end.  There's an interesting relationship between Scarlet Witch and Vision, where she takes Cap's side to and Vision takes Tony's, seeming more like a robot but yet with a bit of humanity in him.  Most of the rest of the Avengers are just there for comic relief, like Ant-Man and Spider-Man.  That's welcome though.  Most of this movie takes itself quite seriously, and the humor helps keep the mood up.\n \nThe action scenes are fantastic.  The airport battle is the best MCU action scene (haven't seen Infinity War yet), and it's not even close.  It goes on for 15 minutes, and it's fun to watch, climactic, and has some great lines thrown in.  The final battle was epic, emotional, and a great end to a great movie.  If there is one thing to complain about, the movie's a tad bit long.  It's just over 2 and a half hours.  It's still a great movie, and one of my favorite MCU films to date.  Team Cap!",

The idea that they can fight like this and not accidentally maim or murder each other is just so hard to believe.

His plan all depends on knowing exactly where people are going to be exactly what they are going to do, and exactly how they are going to respond. How could he know Cap, Bucky, and Tony were all going to be in the hydra base at the same time or that they would be together at all. and how could he have known that Tony would try to kill Bucky? Spider man was one of the things I didnt like in this movie his jokes were pretty lame and corney. Spiderman didnt entertian me at all. Thank goodness for Homecoming otherwise I would not be looking forward to the futer of MCU spiderman. Black panther on the other hand was awsome and his ambition to kill Bucky for revenge of killing his father was the best part of the story in the movie and it was great when black panther relised Bucky didnt do it and that he was letting revenge distoy himself as well as it was destroying Tony. in end the movie was fun, action packed with cool fight sequences and had an ok story with lots more good character development.",

The conflict Captain America and Iron Man have is very compelling, you want both sides to win but you know both sides can't win. When you think the conflict is over and everything is settled a major plot twist brings everything to its knees again. Causing Bucky to actually be a real enemy to Tony. Sometimes the CGI was wobbly (especially in the airport battle) but it wasn't too obvious except for the floating head thing that Tony had. The Russo's really know how to handle characters in big ensemble movies, even better than Joss Whedon. Tony is the best he's ever been since Iron Man and all of the other characters feel so much more real from their iterations in Avengers: Age of Ultron. I gotta hand it to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, they really know how to write. All the actors delivered great performances and great chemistry. For a movie centered around Captain America I didn't mind all the characters being on screen. The score by Henry Jackman was also great and it might be just as great as The Winter Soldier soundtrack. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a very important movie in the MCU and a very good one at that, the Russo's did it again.",

There is absolutely nothing interesting about the fights. There is no tension. The characters do not act like they're in a dangerous situation and joke around during the situation. And though the jokes are funny sometimes, they remove any trace of tension during the fights. And the CGI feels awfully obvious. The fact that the scenes are shot in a uninspired way along with a flat color palette doesn't help the situation at all. In short, the second act is uninspired and boring. However, towards the end of the second act, we finally feel a sense of tension. Then we move to the third act. The third act is amazing and the climax is one of the best in any superhero film. But it isn't enough to save the film from a disappointing second act which takes up most of the film.

            "content": "Captain America: Civil War is an action packed movie and one of the better films in the MCU. The film basically follows two storylines, one involving the Avengers and one revolving around Captain America, that builds off the events of the Winter Soldier. The plot involving the Avengers is the more interesting and well developed. Following the destructive events of many of their actions in previous films, there are many in the world who question their intentions and safety to the world. The United Nations wants to pass the Sokovia Accords, which would restrict and control the actions of the Avengers. This splits the team up, with Tony Stark leading the way in favour of the Accords, and Steve Rogers questioning them. This drives the premise of the film bringing together the heroes for another film, despite this technically being a Captain America film. The plot that builds on the Winter Soldier revolves around Bucky and events in 1991. Bucky is still dangerous despite remembering who Steve is, and Captain America does whatever it takes to save his life. This drives the premise of the film as Bucky is a wanted fugitive and anyone who chooses to protect him is considered a criminal too. Those who choose to side with Captain America become wanted criminals and help Steve in his quest to stop the villain Zemo, who is part of the reason why Steve refuses to sign the Sokovia Accords. Zemo is another bland MCU villain, receiving very little screen time and is very one dimensional in the scenes he is present. He is important to the overall plot however, especially in the Third Act, but his motives are the only important thing about Zemo. Despite the weakness of the villain, the plot involving the Avengers serves as the highlight of the movie. The struggles and differing perceptions the team possess, shows that even a group of so-called heroes with special abilities is vulnerable to disunity and are far from perfect. The action sequences are visually stunning and serve as the highlights of the film, the most notable being the airport scene involving all the heroes and the final fight of the Third Act. These fights in particular are emotionally capturing and action packed. The fight sequences in the first half of the movie are less impressive however. The effects of these scenes are amazing, but the heroes survive endless bullets and injuries, making these sequences unrealistic at times. The film also fails to kill off any major characters, which make it hard to believe stakes are involved or the heroes are really in danger. Despite these drawbacks, the fight sequences are some of the best in the MCU yet. The pacing of the film is favourable, as the run time is very long. There are some slower portions of the movie, but for the most part, the film is well paced for a 147 minute run time. The climax of the film is also incredible, providing interesting and heart breaking twists, before bringing Iron Man and Captain America to their absolute heights as characters. This will serve as an interesting premise moving forward into Infinity War. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is an action packed and emotionally driven superhero adventure. The story involving the Avengers is amazing and provides many great action sequences, which overcome another forgettable villain and an underdeveloped story that builds on the Winter Soldier.",

            "content": "I'll not beat around the bush, this is how you do a superhero movie! This movie is fantastic from start to finish. The character arcs are great, the visuals are stunning, the story is gripping, the list goes on. It felt like a natural sequel to both Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, not an easy task.\n\nWhen this movie was first announced, my biggest concern was that it was going to go away from a Captain America  movie, and be  more of an Avengers movie. This wouldn't be a bad thing, but I feel that it would have taken away from the journey Steve has been on since we met him way back in WW2. That is not the case luckily, and this movie does a fantastic job of having all these massive characters on screen, while never taking away from Steve himself. We follow his journey and ghosts from his past, but we are also shown the larger MCU  and how, just because people want the same thing, doesn't mean they want to go about it the same way. It is Civil War after all, so we needed a big character to stand against Steve and his fight for righteousness, the other big player in this movie was Iron Man.\n\nRDJ was great in this. We clearly see his motivations and what drives him to do what he does and why he believes in the accords. He has done some terrible things, why wouldn't he be made accountable for them? His arc with Bucky is great too and you feel the pain he has when finding out Bucky killed his parents.  This connection between Steve's old life and new also helped defined who he was and what he stands for. Their conflict pours over to include all the other Avengers and it was great to see how their characters felt about the registration act. None of their actions felt out of place and out of character, which is a credit to the writers and the cast.\n\nI cant talk about the characters without talking about the 2 new ones introduced,  Black Panther and Spider-man. Both of them were awesome in their own way. Black Panther was great and was it was good seeing a different aspect of a super hero. We aren't told a great deal about him but after the death of his father, we see the kind of man he is. We see how he is originally driven by anger and revenge but by the end, we see that he has to be strong for his country and for his people.\n\nThen there's Spider-man. When this was announced, every fan both freaked out and started their own ideas of who and what they wanted for the new Spider-man. Tom Holland nailed it, Marvel's perfect casting at work again. The suit was great, the quips were great, the action was great. Spider-man was done perfectly. no question.\n\nThe action of the movie was also great. The airport scene will go down in MCU history as one of the most awe-inspiring spectacles on screen.  Seeing all the Avengers fighting against each other was something I never thought I'd see, but I am very glad I did. The trailer had shown Spider-man and the other Avengers but the giant man twist was a great addition to an already fantastic set piece. The other  actions scenes were also really good. The Crossbones chase was great and was a good way to introduce the Sokovia Accords. The final fight with Cap and Tony was also great and it felt earned, not just a fight for the sake of a fight.\n\nNow it wasn't a perfect movie. it did suffer from the usual MCU condition of not having a really good villain. Zemo wasn't bad by any means, but he just felt a bit tacked on. I enjoyed his plan and understood it, but I understand the main complaint, that a lot of it was down to luck rather than planning. It is called Civil War so I cant really fault this secondary villain too much, but it is a negative against an otherwise perfect movie.\n\nVerdict: DISCHARGED\n\nEven with a slightly weak villain, Captain America: Civil War is the definition of a super hero movie. I didn't think I could enjoy a movie more than Winter Soldier but then I saw this. That is 2 for 2 for the Russo Brothers, and this really has me excited to see what they can do with Infinity War.",

            "content": "Captain America: Civil Kerfuffle. It's pretty bizarre to have a film like this and put only a single character's name in the title, since so many of the Avengers team are in it. It's not so much a Captain America movie as it is Avengers Assemble 1.5. But that isn't to say it wasn't enjoyable. It has the same kind of thoughtful discourse and questions on the responsibilities of superheroes in modern society that you'd expect from latter-day Marvel, and the characters are still engaging, likable and, most importantly, 3 dimensional.  The most notable problems lie once again in its close quarters action sequences. The camera still wobbles and moves too fast and the edits are still far too frequent for you to adequately gauge what is going on, to whom and for what reason. The director needs to pull back and slow down and the editor needs to do likewise. It also suffers from blatant franchiseism, trying its best to squeeze in as much foreshadowing for Infinity War as it possibly can. But despite all this I still really enjoyed it, even at 2 hours and 27 minutes. It never feels that long, is never boring and the action, when you can decipher it, is exciting and always has a reason to exist. It's a worthy conclusion to a solid superhero trilogy.",

Honestly, I can't think of anyone who would make for an awesome Black Panther because of Chadwick Boseman. Speaking of which, the introduction of the new Spiderman is another plus for me. To me, Tom Holland is the best Spiderman out there, especially after what we saw from him with Spiderman Homecoming. And yes, even better than Tobey Maguire, who we all adore. Honestly, I can go on and on about praising this movie, but this is as much as I will do.

I was team Cap all the way but as the movie draws to a close I did not know which side was in the right. This movie does a very good job with balancing the two sides so each one is right. If you do not like what Iron Man is trying to do and you want Cap to win then by the end of the movie you will sympathize with Iron Man. The conflict here is done very well though the battle at the airport feels more like kids playing a paintball match then superheroes trying to beat each other to a pulp. The story progresses along at a good pace and sprinkled throughout the movie there are twists and turn no one could see coming. The biggest problem with the story is the sub plot with Zemo. While he gets off to a good start when he tortures the man in the motel he soon falls into the category of a bad MCU villain. He is relatively forgotten and eventually shows up at the end. Black Panther takes him down in a fairly pathetic way. Captain America was better in Cap The Winter Soldier but he is still fine here. Iron Man is good and shows a lot of emotion. Black Widow is awesome at the start but is also kind of forgotten. Falcon is fine, Scarlet Witch is much better now then she was in Age of Ultron, Winter Soldier is again great but I preferred him in Cap Winter Soldier, Hawkeye is also sort of forgotten, I still do not like Vision, Black Panther is awesome, War Machine is meh. He should have died so that the movie can feel like there was consequences. Paul Rudd is again hilarious as Ant-Man and Tom Holland makes for the best cinematic Spider-Man ever. Crossbones is completely wasted. My hopes have been answered for Emily van Camp's character. She is Peggy Carter's great niece. Now Marvel just has to explore Cap's relationship with her and her character can come full circle. Overall it is a great movie with a huge ensemble and lots of action but the bad villain and barely any consequences way it down. Thumbs up.",

Just because of the amount of heroes in this film doesn't have to automatically mean that this should be called \"Avengers: Civil War\"\n\nThe reason why this is a Cap movie is because of his struggle to protect his best friend, Bucky. Yes, the accords are taking place, and yes there are mixed opinions. Not to mention, every fight scene Cap partakes in also includes other heroes to back him up. If this was really a \"Civil War\" this wouldn't be a Cap movie. The only real reason it's called \"Civil War\" is because it correlates with the accords. Cap doesn't want to give up his best friend back in the days of World War II no matter who or what comes in his way. The final battle is not because oft the accords, it's because of the government wanting Bucky for his manipulated actions, when deep down, Cap knows that Bucky didn't do anything. However, he has nothing to prove. The 5 Winter Soldier event also had a part in the fight between the two factions. Cap's team knew about Zemo's manipulation, and founded out that his plan was to unleash the soldiers. \n\nZemo, is probably one of my favorite Main Antagonists in any of the Marvel films. His motivation is good, his plan is good, and he's just a smart guy. Once Cap, Iron Man, and Bucky went to battle the soldiers, a twist is revealed that Zemo really just brought them here not to kill soldiers, but each other. The big reveal happens, and that's when Avengers are truly torn apart.\n\nThe things that aren't so good in this movie is plot-holes involving Zemo's plan. To counteract that argument, though, he did say he is very patient and took the time to study each Avenger. Spider-Man didn't need to be in this movie, but I quite liked him.",

This peak of MCU pulls every cat out of the bag they can, with political correctness that it breathes and a thrilling blood for blood revenge that it dwells on. This sci-fi genre that MCU has been claiming it so arrogantly uptill now comes alive in this final chapter of Steve Rogers. The film is not only confident but thought provoking where the makers being aware of the influence of these characters over the decades, crafts into the storytelling wisely; one of the primary reason why Zack Snyder's Dawn Of Justice fails to communicate with its momentum.\n\nWhat Joss Whedon failed to do in Age Of Ultron, Russo Brothers, the directors, does it with such ease that the previous chapter seems like a joke. The depth that this film breeds in this accused franchise is impeccable in context to the passion of finally even attempting to raise bigger questions that not only puts its banner on trial but also exhales satire in those dinner table conversations. \"..and conflict breeds catastrophe\" so obvious is that conversation yet so enlightening on reaping the flag with a propaganda written in bold for each character in that room that may or may not emit their views.\n\n\"It must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh?\" whips Downey to Johansson that has a much more gasping effect than any of the staged battles in the film. Probably the most underrated antagonist in the franchise, all his clips edited and sprinkled on the storyline is much more nuanced that your usual scenarios in MCU, \"there is a little green in your blue eyes..\" he concludes and you know then and there with a satisfying feeling that the film has succeeded along with Daniel Bruhl that spirals out what they call it Civil War, he, an empire fallen.",

Having read the comics this movie is titled after, I wanted a deeper discussion about why each hero was picking which side, and showing that there's more grey and nuance to the freedom vs. security debate. Instead, this movie rushes through the motivations for everyone to pick a side so it can get to the action. Case in point, Ant-Man and Hawkeye are practically afterthoughts whose motivations are glossed over so fast it's almost insulting. It is pretty cool to see all these heroes fighting each other, using their powers creatively against and with one another, but the substance isn't really there to make it more than just a summer blockbuster spectacle. Also, Spider-Man's appearance feels shoved-in at the last minute and doesn't add much other than \"Hey, we reached a deal to put Spidey in the MCU\". In fact, having a child fighting in a conflict he doesn't understand just makes Tony Stark seem like more of a selfish idiot and harder to side with.\n\nIf you think I'm nitpicking, you'll probably love this movie. If you care about story and character motivations and don't mind if there isn't something exploding every 5 minutes, you might be disappointed by this movie.",

I watched this when it came out in theater and just happened to step on some thread about it to remind me that I should rate it and give some thoughts - though there may be a good possibility that I'm missing some stuff. Initially I was with Cap because I didn't like the Accords. But then I got a few problem with Cap himself. His line \"we are [giving up] if we're not taking responsibility for our actions\" sounds all fine and dandy if we were shown how Cap DOES take responsibility for the collateral damage and countless victims. Is he paying for the destruction? Does he deal with apologies/explanations as a public figure to government, reporters, etc? We will never know because we were never shown one. Cap sounds logical, but does he propose anything useful instead to satisfy the reasons that the Accords first raised from? If he doesn't, he is just another vigilante who makes himself sound like a hero. It's really immature if one thinks 'gosh they saved the world. Without them, more would have died. So it's illogical that they are being held responsible or being criticized or being restricted to some government accords - that's like a punishment rather than a praise for saving the day.' As a captain, you have to be able to give alternative plans on how to take responsibility and convince the public that they are not just boundless vigilantes. And lastly, Cap should have explained every little details about Bucky/Hydra situation to make Tony understand and make an apology for not telling him like a true captain would do to a teammate right after successfully damaging the suit enough that Tony can't make another attempt to kill Bucky. Sending a letter after heat has cooled down is understandable, but he should have done it at the spot as well to be more effective and logical really. I remember hearing \"you don't have to do this\" line and thinking 'that's not really the tone or words you use to calm down a person. Talk more sympathetically towards Tony who just learned the truth about his parents' death.' Plus, I don't know if it was just poor directing or acting, but the scene where Cap dropped the shield and carried Bucky out just seemed oddly cold and indifferent. His attitude and the camera angle were just somehow weird. Maybe it's because I thought more appropriate response from Cap is sympathetic undertone since Cap in my head is a character who can relate yet be logical. As for Tony, he did all the flawed yet understandable things within his character. Tony isn't a perfect character of virtue. Moreover, he does stuff to take responsibility in his own ways like funding the Avengers, taking initiatives like Damage Control, and agreeing to sign Sokovia Accords. Yes, all those attempts of taking responsibility are flawed and create problems, but that's not really the point. At least he is not all talk.",

            "content": "Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.\n\nThe world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?\n\nCivil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.\n\nEach character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.\n\nThe grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did. \n\nFans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character \"show up\" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance.1st, Civil War is basically a copy of BvS. A government building gets blown up by a bomb, killing a prominent government official. A villain manipulating heroes into fighting.\n\n2nd, too many characters just popping up without any reason at all and just shoehorned into the movie - Ant-Man/Giant Man - Black Panther - Hawkeye (was retired, now suddenly abandons the girlfriend and kids to come back and help a fugitive escape from the authorities) - The Annoying Spider-Kid (more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace; did more talking than fighting)\n\n3rd, after all the buildup about a disagreement over the issues of collateral damage and government oversight of the heroes, those issues were completely trivialized by a \"big fight\" that was nothing more than a friendly sparring contest with bad one-liners thrown in: \"Are we still going to be friends after this?\" \"We haven't met before?\" \"Mr Stark. What do I do now?\" \"You have a METAL arm?\" \"I'm from Queens. I'm from Brooklyn.\"\n\nWas the \"Civil War\" supposed to be a real fight for something they believed in, or just a \"Joke-Off\" to determine who could deliver the best jokes?\n\n4th, MCU fans had been saying for months that Captain America was justified in opposing government oversight of the heroes because he didn't want the Avengers to be controlled by HYDRA. But it wasn't HYDRA who requested the Sokovia accords. It was the United Nations.\n\nThe Avengers had caused massive deaths and destruction so the United Nations wanted oversight of the Avengers. But Captain America didn't want the Avengers to be held responsible and have to answer to the people for the massive deaths and destruction that they caused.\n\nCaptain America wanted the Avengers to be the supreme authority (exactly like Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein made themselves the supreme authority) to make decisions on what's best for the people instead of letting the elected representatives of the people make decisions on what's best for the people (like the way a Democracy works). So basically, Captain America opposes Democracy and favors Tyranny.\n\n5th, plenty of plot holes and lazy, contrived writing. Tony Stark had called Secretary of State Ross to evacuate the airport prior to the big fight. So Ross knew before the big fight that the Captain America and the Bucky were planning to hijack a plane at that airport.\n\nSo why didn't Ross just have military fighter jets hovering in the sky nearby in case they succeed in hijacking a plane? There's already a \"shoot on sight\" order for Bucky so if they succeed in hijacking a plane, then the military fighter jets can just fly in and either shoot at their plane to force them to land or shoot down their plane.\n\nSince Captain America and Bucky can't fly on their own, their powers are useless when they're inside a plane being fired upon by military fighter jets. And their plane wouldn't be able to evade military fighter jets. But the script needed Captain America and Bucky to escape so that it could set up the final fight between Iron Man and Captain America.\n\nAlso, the 1st half of the movie is all about Tony Stark trying to get all the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords, which state that the Avengers would operate only when approved by a UN panel. Then in the 2nd half of the movie, Tony recruits Peter Parker to join his team even though Peter is a minor and wouldn't be able to sign a legal document and thus wouldn't be approved by the UN panel to operate under the Sokovia Accords.\n\nAnother egregious error is that the whole movie set up Bucky as the killer of Iron Man's parents, thus setting up the main conflict in the movie, but why would there be video footage of their accident on some random back road in 1991? And how did whomever filmed the video footage know to place the camera at that EXACT spot where their car crashed, and not a mile ahead or a mile behind where the car crashed?\n\nIf there was video footage, then wouldn't Iron Man or Jarvis or even Ultron have stumbled across it by now? Tony hacked classified government networks in seconds in Iron Man 2, hacked Shield in The Avengers and has apparently been watching Peter Parker on a regular basis. Seems like he would have found video footage of his parents' deaths a long time ago.\n\nAnd better yet, how could the coroner rule their deaths an accident when the ligature marks around Maria Stark's neck and the fist imprints in Howard Stark's face would have been immediately evident in the autopsy? Was the coroner just incompetent?\n\nAlso, Tony Stark believed his parents died in an accident and never suspected foul play at all. So how did Zemo know that their \"accident\" from 25 years ago was actually foul play? How did Zemo know there was video footage from 25 years ago of Tony's parents being murdered and how did Zemo find that footage when Tony never knew about or found that same footage?\n\nTony Stark was more angry at Steve Rogers because Steve knew but didn't tell him. So how did Zemo know that Steve knew the \"accident\" 25 years ago was actually foul play?\n\nThose are massive pills we're asked to swallow that exist only because they conveniently set up the final conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Now that's some mighty contrived writing.\n\n6th, another forgettable MCU villain. Zemo was about as invisible in Civil War as Luke Skywalker was in The Force Awakens.\n\n7th, critics and haters of BvS complained about how Lex knew Superman is Clark Kent and how Superman knew Batman is Bruce Wayne, but there was no explanation at all for how Tony Stark knew Spider-Man is a high school kid in Queens.",

Chadwick Boseman did a really good job as Black Panther, and as someone who's not insanely excited for the Black Panther solo film, I hope that he gives a performance as great as he did in Civil War. The movie encapsulates you from the opening scene and it continues throughout the entire film. The airplane scene may be one of my favorite action sequences in any movie I've seen (this is before Infinity War). Tom Holland owned the role of Spider-Man and I loved how they introduced him.

However, I don't think anybody could have predicted how great Captain America: Civil War would be on numerous levels. Granted, I was excited for this one, anyway; aside from the fact it would be the MCU's take on the Civil War storyline that occurred in the comics a decade prior, The Winter Soldier had been a significant improvement over The First Avenger (which was still a really good film), leading me to wonder if Civil War would continue that trend. It did, and how! First of all, if you are worried that this is too crowded of a movie (\"Avengers 2.5,\" I remember hearing) due to the size of the cast, don't fear - this is still distinctly Captain America's film. Conversely, if you are worried that some of the characters don't get their time in the spotlight, everyone adequately gets time to shine and contribute to the story. While discussing each acting performance would take a great deal of time, I would in remiss if I didn't specifically address the two main leads. At least to date, this, I believe, is the best we've seen Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. play Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, which is no small feat. Thanks to both their performances and the writing, we can really see how far these two characters have come since their debut movies. I also would like to give special shout-outs to Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland in their debuts as Black Panther and Spider-Man, respectively. Both shine here and give the MCU a bright future. I also cannot neglect to mention the film's action scenes, which are the absolute best this franchise (and perhaps any superhero films in general) has seen. Without going into specifics, I will say that the airport sequence is a new high watermark for superhero action. It will be tough for Marvel (or DC and Fox, for that matter), to top the action here. Overall, in case you couldn't gleam this from my amateur review, Captain America: Civil War should not be missed by ANY movie fan, not just Marvel fans.",

A run-of- the-mill action fest would have brought in the dough, while also entertaining the masses. But, yet again, Marvel showed us why it's number one.\n\n\"Captain America: Civil War\" poses a question that may have crossed your mind while watching \"The Avengers\" or \"Age of Ultron\": in the midst of the mind-blowing action taking place on screen, how many innocent civilians were killed?\n\nWithin the first half hour of the film, the Avengers are shown footage from major events in past Marvel movies, but rather than enjoying a shot of the Hulk smashing a few aliens into a building, the heroes see pieces of that building crush a bystander filming the chaos from his phone. Instead of watching Captain America throw his mighty shield, they are treated to the lifeless eyes of a woman caught in the crossfire of superhero and super villain.\n\nShortly following this, Earth's mightiest heroes are presented with a document, called the Sokovia Accords, which states that the Avengers must place themselves under the command of the United Nations or retire. Tony Stark signs. Steve Rogers doesn't, ultimately pitting the two heroes against one another and leaving the rest to choose a side.\n\nWhile technically a Captain America story, \"Civil War\" plays out more like an Avengers 2.5, which works in the film's favor. The Russo brothers mesh the darker tone of \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" with the humor of \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" masterfully balancing a plethora of characters new and old. The dialogue is thought provoking, the action is spectacular and the performances have never been better.",

This first installment into Phase 3 of Marvel really takes the franchise to the next level and gets you excited for films to come. It is easy to see the huge progress that Marvel has made with its films. The coolest and most intricate fight scenes I've ever seen (and that ladies and gentleman is what makes a good super hero movie). We are introduced briefly to the villain Crossbones in the first fight sequence. The CGI to make RDJ look young is incredible (and I love the Mister Softee shirt). I think the people who have lost loved ones in the battles that take place with the Avengers are selfish, I get that your son or daughter or dad or relative died but look at the big picture, the Avengers save millions of lives, they can't save everyone. Because of this concept and other innocent people getting killed from Avenger events, Tony and the United Nations want to keep close watch on the actions of the Avengers. The Captain, however, thinks it will suffocate them as a team and prevent them from doing their duty. The Sokovia Accords are this put into place. Peggy Carter dies. After the UN conference in Vienna we meet T'Challa (Black Panther) and the team splits into two. Peggy's niece (aka The Girl Next Door) and Cap are getting it! \nSide note: The Black Panther is dope. \nHAH! When Captain America basically curls a helicopter... Best part of the movie is when we are introduced to an all new Spider-Man (played by Tom Holland). I loved the sequence leading up to the big fight scene. And the big fight scene itself was amazingly portrayed and thought out. Well done. So apparently there's some top secret base in the middle of the ocean where they keep high security prisoners (in this case some of the Avengers on Caps side)? The Winter Soldier killed Mr. and Mrs. Stark. The movie gets pretty deep with intensity and broken bonds during the scene with Captain America and Iron Man fighting each other (it makes you think what the future holds for the Avengers). Great ending note from the Cap.\n\nMid credit scene is Bucky agreeing to go into a cryogenic sleep until a cure can be found for his brainwashing. This takes place in Wakanda (kingdom of the Black Panther).\n\nEnd credits scene is Peter Parker trying out new tech given to him by Stark. Spider-Man will return.\n\n\nStan Lee appears as a FedEx delivery man mispronouncing Tony's name as \"Tony Stank\".",

Cap, stunned by the news, lets his guard down long enough for Rumlow to ignite his bomb-vest. Ever alert, Scarlett Witch (Wanda Maximoff, played by Elizabeth Olsen) uses her powers to contain the explosion. But she is not powerful enough to prevent it from tearing through a building, killing several Wakandan citizens.\n\nSCOTT: Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that the world will no longer tolerate them having free reign to decide which missions to pursue and how to execute those missions. The United Nations is about to approve The Sokovia Accords establishing a UN committee to oversee all Avenger operations. Some of our superheroes, led by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), are in agreement with this new oversight, while others in the group, led by Steve Rogers, oppose it. The resultant internal fight compromises the group s ability to stop supervillain Helmut Zemo (Daniel Br hl) from carrying out his evil mission.\n\nGREG: Scott, after suffering through last March s Batman v Superman, Civil War was a welcome respite. Here is a complicated story with multiple heroes told in a compelling, thoughtful, and still exciting manner - all the things missing from the ponderous BvS. While there were slow moments in the film (the meeting with a very young Spider Man () brought the movie to a standstill), overall, this was a movie worth the nearly two-and-a-half hours running time. This movie had it all. A huge cast with lots of action. And, everybody on-screen wanted something. There were no hangers-on. There were no merely-mentioneds. Nothing went to waste and everything pushed the story forward. This was a logical completion to the Captain America trilogy, and it sets us up for future Avengers films. I was fully satisfied.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Civil War is an appealing movie for all the reasons that you mention. How many times over the years have we said, well, Marvel has done it again: Another smart, crisply told story with rich, appealing characters. As you mention, Civil War pulls out all the stops by including almost every superhero in the Marvel universe. Ironically, these added characters augment the Avengers while also compromising them. Legitimate philosophical differences divide the group, which I found fascinating and realistic. What I didn t find realistic was the group fighting each other to the near-death. So I have the same criticism for this film that I had for Batman vs. Superman, namely, the implausible premise that super-smart and super-virtuous heroes would be so dumb as to try to kill each other. Yes, at a superficial level it is fun and cool to watch all these superpowers matched up against each other. But come on. We should expect more from our heroes than brutish fighting among them. Isaac Asimov once said that violence is the last resort of the incompetent. I agree. What s next, a movie in which Jesus and Gandhi get into a knife fight? So while I admire the impeccable craftsmanship of this movie, I question its premise of having super-good guys deciding to do super-bad things to each other. Violence is not the answer, and it never will be the answer, to human problems. We need role models who exemplify this basic principle, not violate it. I understand it wouldn t have been much of a movie if the Avengers resolved their differences peacefully. Sadly, we only gravitate to movies in which conflict is settled by brute force -- even when it s our so-called superheroes who initiate that brute force.\n\nGREG: Well, all I can say to that is that violence has solved all our major wars. And, we have super smart people at all levels of government and still we fight senseless battles. So, while I agree with your sentiment, there are plenty of counter examples about smart people and stupid solutions. The thing that impresses me is the lack of villains in this story. We ve written before that the best villain mirrors the hero in every way. What better way to create oppositional forces for heroes - than other heroes? It s a deft move on Marvels part and creates a tension that you could not possibly create with pure-evil villains. Here we have heroes fighting heroes where we can see both sides of the argument. There is no clear right or wrong. And, as we have seen before, the best villains think they are in the right. Team Cap and Team Iron Man both strongly believe they are in the right. It s a strong composition of equal heroes instead of equal heroes and villains. Very cool stuff.\n\nSCOTT: We do encounter a couple of villains in this movie, such as Brock Rumlow at the outset and Helmut Zemo throughout most of the story. In fact, dealing with Zemo s villainy is what drives the intra-group conflict within the Avengers. I was struck by the inner schism of Bucky Barnes -- he is part hero, part villain, which metaphorically characterizes the schism within the Avengers. It s interesting to consider the mentors, or lack of mentors, in this film. Perhaps the Avengers foolishly fight amongst themselves because they are lacking good mentorship. Who is there to tell Tony Stark that he should allow Steve Rogers to follow his own path? No one, and that s a problem. Heroes who lack mentors are prone to doing stupid things, which is exactly what transpires when the Avengers begin self-destructing. In a sense, The Sokovia Accords represent an attempt by the world s nations to mentor the Avengers, to help them use their superpowers more wisely.\n\nGREG: Those are some interesting thoughts about mentors in this story. Often we see former heroes become the mentors for the up-and-coming heroes. However, the Avengers are in a strange place - they are the first of their kind. While Captain America does mentor the younger Scarlet Witch, he is, in fact, the prototypal hero. There is no one to guide him. On the other hand, we have Iron Man. He should have been mentored by his father. But we see that Tony Stark was largely ignored by his father, and so Tony lacks a proper mentor. In fact, it is possible that the elder Stark may be considered a dark mentor as he offered negative examples for his son.\n\nSCOTT: Rating Captain America: Civil War is a challenge. On the one hand, we have the flawed premise of super-virtuous people fighting each other. On the other hand, we have Marvel s impeccable execution of this flawed premise. There s an old adage that goes,  You can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig.  The flawed storyline here doesn t render the movie entirely piggish, as there is still much to like here. Civil War is great fun to watch and represents another technological marvel for Marvel. So despite the flawed premise I will award this film 3 Reels out of 5. The heroes here do go on a journey of divisiveness and healing. The schism begins with the presentation of The Sokovia Accords and ends when our heroes finally come to their senses after nearly destroying each other. Have they changed much as a result of their journey? Besides all the bruises, they may have been humbled and reached some understanding of the pointlessness of their fighting. Again, a Heroes rating of 3 out of 5 seems about right. As we ve noted, there isn t much mentorship going on here, which may be the main problem with our heroes engaging in their senseless battle. You re right, Greg, about Tony Stark lacking a moral compass from either his father or from Pepper Potts. Steve Rogers just does his thing without help, and it shows. The Sokovia Accords is the world s attempt to mentor our heroes, but they re a pretty stubborn bunch. The best I can do is give a rating here of 2 Mentors out of 5.  Movie: Heroes: Mentors:\n\nGREG: Scott, I think you have to rate a film on what it attempts to bring to the screen. If this were a slapstick comedy, I d rate it as a slapstick comedy. But since it s action-adventure, I believe you have to rate it on the genre it is slotted in. I appreciate your non-violent leanings, but as you point out there is no story here without the conflict - it is subtitled Civil WAR after all. I enjoyed this film and I think it nicely rounds out the Captain America trilogy. The filmmakers delivered on their promise and I happily award 4 out of 5 Reels. But I have to agree with you on the Heroes rating. These heroes are fairly well-established here and there is little growth or transformation. That is the primary thing you and I look for in a hero s journey and it s lacking here. Nobody really learns anything. In the end, Captain America and Iron Man go their separate ways after a knock-down-drag-out fight. However, the secondary characteristics we look for in heroes (charisma, strength, loyalty, etc ) are there in strong measure. Like you, I award 3 out 5 Heroes. And there is little mentoring going on here. We see suggestions of dark mentoring from the senior Stark, but there are no past heroes to guide our up-and-coming heroes. I can only muster 1 out of 5 Mentors for Captain America: Civil War. Movie: Heroes: Mentors:",
