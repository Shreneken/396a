An isolated retiree with strict principles and a short fuse, who spends his days enforcing block association rules that only he cares about, and visiting his wife's grave, Ove has given up on life. After a boisterous young family moves in next door and accidentally flattens Ove's mailbox, an unlikely friendship forms.",

Its a bit like a Scandinavian version of Victor Meldrew from the BBC sitcom One Foot In The Grave - Ove is a decent guy who has had a slightly tough past but he comes across as quite snippy and oaf-ish, although he's more likeable than would first appear. It certainly has a sentimental aspect, although it is seemingly quite bleak certainly at the start. As a trigger warning, it does show preparations for suicide attempts, which may upset some, so bare that in mind. I thought the main character was very well portrayed by the actor Rolf Lassgard.\n\nIt may feature some dark comedy, undoubtedly, but it also felt like quite a re-assuring film and I thought it was well done.",

While his transformation over the course of the film isn't entirely believable, it's hard not to get caught up in his evolution into a man who is willing to reach out to others to help them live while simultaneously wishing for nothing but his own death.  Rolf Lassgard is excellent in the lead role, as is Bahar Pars, the new neighbor who leads him out of the dark shadows of his life.  Despite the sorrow that lingers in the background throughout the movie, there is a strange light that keeps things afloat, providing just enough subtle humor to make the whole thing worthwhile.",

            "content": "While I had heard about this film, I had not never viewed it, until a recommendation on an episode (on YouTube) of Collider Videos-Movie Talk (09-22-2017 edition). My impression from just briefly reading reviews in 2016, was that it was slow-moving story about a grumpy old man.  While it does contain those two factors, this film is so much more.\n\nA Man Called Ove was funny, clever, great dialogue, beautifully shot scenes and even a great soundtrack  for the movie's conclusion. This is a Swedish movie, so there is angst,  bittersweet themes and more acting than action. It is very nationally telling that in Sweden, this film is considered a comedy. While it did go dark and emotional, it never pandered. The humor was blended smoothly into the story. My attention was held throughout the entire runtime. Ove's journey from childhood, to a newly wed and finally an old man flowed smoothly even with the occasional flashbacks.  These breaks from the current timeline of Ove's old age were expertly inserted by the director (Hannes Holm) and editor (Fredrik Morheden) with no unnecessary exposition. Every actor portrayed a believable human,not just a manufactured character. Tom Hanks' production company, Playtone, will be remaking this film with Tom Hanks attached to star as the Ove character. While Tom Hanks is probably the best choice for Ove, I hope that this remake does not become a pale copy of the original film.",

It contains some funny moments. It manages to get sentimental without turning sappy. Yet, there's also nothing new here. Rolf Lassgard is indeed wonderful as Ove, likewise Filip Berg as his younger self, and Ida Engvoll as the love of his life. But at this point, it seems 'crotchety widowed men' are becoming a subgenre. If you enjoy them, this one is stellar, and will surely rank higher. But if you crave a twist, or an ounce of added excitement, it's a long two hours.",

Still grieving his late wife, Ove has largely given up on life until a boisterous young family moves in next-door and forces him out of his shell in this heartwarming tale that reminds us that life is sweeter when it's shared.\" ~iTunes.com\n\nI wasn't sure if we'd enjoy A Man Named Ove with it's tagline \"Misery Hates Company\".  However, we thoroughly enjoyed the unraveling of Ove's story through his memories during his failed suicide attempts. It crisscrosses genres from the blackest of comedies to tearjerker to walking the tightrope between sweet and saccharine sentimentality.

Healthy competition between Ove and his neighbor over there cars result in both diving nice cars. Such is the power of competition to do good things. The kicker was the vacation. They could have drove but his wife said the bus was more romantic. She obviously never traveled by gray hound. The bus crashes of course and leave his wife without the use of her legs, thus disparaging mass transit. \"If only Ove would have drove.\" Our heroic self made stoic individualist eventually dies of too large a heart, found with \nhis cat sleeping peacefully on his still chest.\nI enjoyed watching, but by the end of the movie I found myself questioning the motive behind this flick.

Many of the jokes are so unexpected that you not only laugh at their actual nature, but also at how surprising they are. Ove is the classic elderly curmudgeon with no perceived place in life or any more use to society. The film does bear very close resemblances to pictures such as Gran Torino, and suffers from a pervading sense of predictability. Fortunately it never rests on its laurels, delivering many moments of heartfelt humility and laugh out loud hilarity. The dialogue is razor-sharp and its story spectacularly well observed, capturing exactly what it's like to be in a state of obsolescence while also trying to control what's happening around you. Ove is a miserable antisocialite, but he gets plenty of chances to display real humanity while still never losing his gruff demeanour. What's so effective about the comedy is that it exists not to provide a succession of cheap laughs, but to force us to address some cruel realities including disability, bereavement and even suicide. Most would find this in poor taste, but for me there's no better way to combat the grim issues we face than through a comedic lens. Had this movie gone the other way and leant in the direction of saccharine sentimentalism, it would have flopped badly and been near-insufferable. But as is, it's frank, smart, loveable and oh so hilarious.",

He's also trying, unsuccessfully, to kill himself.\n\nIn a romantic attempt to join the deceased love of his life, lonely Ove tries over and over to leave his mortal coil, but the nosy, pestering, interrupting neighbours keep botching things up. Soon there is enough distraction that Ove's extended life might not seem so pointless.\n\n\"A Man Called Ove\" balances the comedy with the drama just right, keeping the sappy moments (yes of course they exist) to a tolerable minimum.

I resigned myself to seeing it due to its Oscar nomination for Best Makeup and Hairstyling but immediately became entranced by its perfect blend of comedy and drama.  Ove (pronounced \"Oo-veh\") is one of the grumpiest men that you will ever meet and his story shows that it is never too late in life for a change of heart.  It is an incredible example of patient storytelling that discloses small details of a larger story to develop the characters until the big reveal toward the end of the film.  Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd commands the screen with his deep bass voice and old man posture.  He manages to be dislikable, intimidating, endearing, and humorous all at the same time.  He also shows an amazing transition as he forms an unlikely bond with his new neighbor, played by Bahar Pars.  Filip Berg is believable as a younger version of Ove and Ida Engvoll turns in a charming performance as Sonja.  All of the acting hits on the realism and humor that is needed for the film's dichotomy.  The makeup/hairstyling team of Eva von Bahr and Love Larson deserve the Oscar for their work on this film.  Lassg\u00e5rd is a youthful-looking man with a full head of hair and their ability to physically transform him into an elderly bald man is remarkable.  This film was shot using a lot of close-ups and the make-up looks great from every angle.  You may wonder why they didn't just cast an actual old man in this role but you will understand once you see the emotionally charged performance by Lassg\u00e5rd.  I don't know if this film can win the Best Hairstyling and Makeup Oscar because it is difficult for foreign films to compete with American franchises like Star Trek, but I would love to see it acknowledged for their excellent work.  While I enjoy foreign films, it is rare for me to rank them higher than an American equivalent.  Ove is one of those films.  I hope that they never adapt this with English speakers because nothing can ever top the original Swedish version (sound familiar, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"?)  Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Score, even Best Picture - I would have nominated Ove for all them.  \"A Man Called Ove\" is a must-see for every movie fan.  You will laugh its dark humor, shed many more tears than you expect (at several times throughout the film), and be left with one of the most perfect endings of any film that you will ever see.",

The lead performance is so sincere and dynamic it counters any chance of the film getting too sappy.

            "content": "We've seen films about grumpy, widowed old men before, but never quite like this. I've always been a fan of self-contained films that don't require too many locations in order to tell the story at hand, but this is one of the most impressive films I have ever seen accomplish that. Not to say that the camerawork feels like a documentary, but director Hannes Holm creates an atmosphere of characters that seems as though they exist out in the world somewhere. From all of its subtleties, to all of its ambitious plot points, A Man Called Ove is not just a great Swedish film, but one of the best films I was able to see in all of 2016. Here is why I believe you should run (not walk) to check out this film.\n\nWhether or not you can speak the Swedish dialect, A Man Called Ove is a must-see film. That's really all you need to know in my opinion, due to the fact the plot details reveal themselves slowly throughout the film. For that reason, I'm only going to touch on a few things that stood out to me. The basic premise is that a man has lost his wife from an unknown cause and finds himself in constant mourning. Never a hit in making friends, this lonely man named Ove finds himself wanting to commit suicide in order to be with his wife. Every time he is about to commit suicide, something prevents it from happening. Making friends with new neighbours that move in, the film begins to balance some happy and sad flashbacks, revealing he and his wife's past. That is as much as I can say without giving away the incredible conclusion this film has.\n\nPeriodically, the film flashes back to explore the relationship that Ove had with his wife Sonja. At its core, there really are two stories happening here. One about an elderly man living alone and the other a love story about a very unlikely couple. Their relationship in the past was a joy to see, because it added the much-needed levity to an otherwise somber film. It keeps you engaged throughout the entire duration, due to the fact that the present day material is great and the material in the past constantly reveals new things about certain characters, giving more meaning to the present day. Also, the ending to this film is absolutely stunning in my opinion, and that wouldn't have been possible without the flashbacks. A Man Called Ove is a great lesson for film student who wish to know the perfect use of a flashback.\n\nAs mentioned above, the direction of this film by Hannes Holm is incredibly sincere and some of the best I have seen from any independent production in 2016. With very few characters, he is able to create a world around them that feels incredibly well-realized and lived-in. A Man Called Ove is a rare film that gets better as it progresses and more in revealed, meaning that a second viewing will be warranted and will make the film even better once you know everything. That is no small feat for a picture to accomplish, but this one does it in spades. I loved every second of this directors vision for this beautiful (albeit heartbreaking) story.\n\nIn the end, as I look back on A Man Called Ove, I appreciate it more and more, due to the fact that it really is a film that tries to get your spirits up. Beginning with an elderly man who wants to commit suicide is not enjoyable in any way, but the way that he is brought out of that way of thinking was amazingly bittersweet. With fantastic character development and a conclusion that had me in tears, I really couldn't find much to dislike about A Man Called Ove. It's one of the best films in all of 2016, at least in my opinion, and I high recommend checking it out. Its Oscar nomination for best foreign film is more than well-deserved. This is exactly the right way to make a character study. I love A Man Called Ove.",

            "content": "A Man Called Ove: At first, this Swedish Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, based on Fredrik Backman's best-selling novel, appears to be a predictable story about a crotchety old man repeatedly trying (and failing) to kill himself, following the death of his beloved wife.  But when some gregarious new neighbors humorously worm their way into his sullen, solitary existence, they, along with a series of poignant, well-placed flashbacks, reveal the heartbreaking events that made Ove the man he is today. The film starts very slowly, gradually building to a beautiful, emotional ending, underscored by a heartfelt-but-not-maudlin performance by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd. He, along with impressively spot-on casting (the younger Ove and Sonja, played by Filip Berg and Ida Engvoll, are amazingly convincing) make this superb tearjerker pretty darn close to perfect. A",

Pushing sixty, but acting way elder - yelling at people breaking the smallest rules or not living up to his limited expectations. He lives in a tight neighborhood, with some interesting people. They seem to care about him, but in real life I believe most people would stay far away from him. Anyhow, we get to know the man very delicately and the story never fail to interest the viewer. Very cool characters and our main guy is terrificly acted out by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd - a very underated actor in my opinion. The story is sad but very heartwarming and it's guaranteed to give you plenty of laughs. Brilliantly told and paced and some neat tricks when it comes to the photography. A few flaws, like when Ove nearly beats up a guy using his horn and some other overdone scenes. Some too expected turns also takes place, but it never kill the film. \n\nI love the score and the feelgood vibe this film brings to me. Not a straight forward feel good flick, but it really does have that vibe. I also dig the cat.\nThe film reminds me of a mixture of \"Gran Torino\" and \"En ganske snill mann\" mostly, but several films got similarities. Still it manage to stand out well. A touching and very entertaining film - not the most typical combination, but a very solid one. Expected a typical semi-funny flick, but was acutally blown away. Great stuff!\n\n8.5 out of 10 black cats crossing.",
