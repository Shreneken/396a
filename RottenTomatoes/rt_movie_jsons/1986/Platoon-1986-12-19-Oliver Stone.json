Infighting in his unit between Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), who believes nearby villagers are harboring Viet Cong soldiers, and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), who has a more sympathetic view of the locals, ends up pitting the soldiers against each other as well as against the enemy.",

Willem Dafoe played a very compelling and likable character and Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger acted very well for their parts too. There are scenes that are powerful to watch, scary to watch, and scenes that make you think deeply about American interventions and the politics/life in the war at the time. I also normally don't like too much narration but in this movie through Charlie's perspective, it actually worked! Thank you for your work Oliver Stone!!",

The Soundtrack is excellent, the pacing is perfect and the editing is very well done also. There really is no point in this movie where it felt slow or out of place at all. The Action scenes were very grounded and well done and even the bigger action scenes did a great job at always feeling grounded and intimate still. The story telling is very unique in this where it starts as a well done standard war movie but takes a very sharp turn into a very unique narrative that I have never seen before giving it a very unique identity.

I was haunted, my consciousness focused ever inward; I felt like the film had given me the faintest hint of what it must be like to return from combat only to bring the war home with me in my soul. The film's harrowing and chaotic depiction of warfare epitomizes a feeling that I've had for some time: there is never a need to make an anti-war film, in that a depiction of war that is sufficiently realistic and uncompromising argues against the atrocities of combat far more eloquently than any philosophical position ever could. \"Platoon's\" wisdom is in its decision to omit the extraneous embellishments that have so frequently distanced other war films from the grim realities which say more than enough on their own. Perhaps more than any other film that I have seen, \"Platoon\" left me stunned viewer with an unforgettable impression of the tragic sweep of war, inducing inevitable despair at the thought of so horrifying and wasteful an atrocity. To see the film is to be left breathless and hollowed out; you will surely think twice about the validity of every other war film that you've seen up to this point, and you may find yourself not wanting to see another.",

Charlie Sheen.\n\nA film that has now become synonymous with Barbers haunting score that forms the bedrock for the character study of these group of men we are thrown into awful conditions with fighting an enemy they cannot see or understand. What follows is a 2 hour experience of being dragged from one harsh set piece to the next being seen through the eyes of new recruit Chris played by a very young Charlie Sheen. The journey is shepherded by his 2 surrogate father figures played here excellently by Berenger and Defoe as they attempt to guide these young men from two very much opposing viewpoints.\n\nI first saw this when I was exploring war movies at a young age and consider this seminal viewing. This is a piece of work from Oliver Stone that would form the mould for many wartime movies to follow. Often mentioned in the same vein as Apocalypse Now, although two very different movies, both study its characters and look at how war and the atrocities seen can fundamentally change an individual. There are many big players here before they got famous, John C McGinley (from Scrubs fame) steals every scene he is in and Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp are also part of the supporting cast. The narrative thread is sometimes a little lacking and the main focus is to study one mans tour in 'Nam largely influenced by the directors own experiences of warfare during his time of service.\n\nPlatoon is excellent. Its narrative by todays standards is slightly lacking with no real thread carrying things throughout apart from Defoe and Berenger fighting metaphorically for Charlie Sheens soul. As a study of the horrors of war during Vietnam it has rarely been done better and even now rewatching this many years later it is hard not to get choked up any time Barbers classic theme swells throughout the horrific images being displayed. \n\nIf you are a war film connoisseur who hasn't seen this, you should probably rectify this immediately.",

I had forgotten a lot of it, firstly how short it is for a so called 'epic'. Secondly how brutal it is, especially the scene in which American soldiers torch a local village, the torching being the least of their crimes in that 15 minute sequence. And also, Charlie Sheen is pretty damn good, to the point where I forgot it was Sheen, so engrossed was I in the mayhem and constant peril of the jungle warfare.

Oliver Stone's breakthrough work is based on the director's experiences in the Vietnam War in 1965 and deals with fear, deceit and hatred within his own troup. In terms of its chronology, Platoon is very reminiscent of Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which appeared more than ten years later. It has a strong philosophical narrative and portrays the events from the soldiers' point of view. Nevertheless, the films differ fundamentally in some aspects.\n\nAs is usual in films about soldiers, there is no clear protagonist here. Rather, it is an ensemble piece, with the focus most likely to be on Charlie Sheen's character Charlie, who is arguably meant to embody Stone. Actually predestined for an academic career, Charlie decides to support his country on the battlefield and leave college behind. However, after only a few days he realises that this was probably a mistake. In a letter to his grandmother, which is often read aloud with a delicate voiceover, he complains mainly about the lack of cohesion with his comrades. Sheen does a good job, especially in moments of terror, pure fear is written all over his face. He also manages to evoke empathy, something his co-stars mostly lack. This is especially true of Tom Berenger's Bob Barnes. He hates the war more than anything. Instead of compensating for this with solidarity, however, he transfers this hatred completely to his fellow combatants and is not above overstepping boundaries. He is bitter and ruthless, which causes resentment in his own ranks. Not only with Sheen's \"heroic\" protagonist, but above all Sergeant Elias Gordin, played by Willem Dafoe. He is the exact opposite of Barnes: helpful, remorseful and respectful of his comrades. Sooner or later, this becomes his undoing in the eternal feud with Barnes. Although the film lives from its ensemble, the two regularly manage to play each other up against the wall in their scenes together. Therefore, they stand out from the cast because, unlike Sheen's actual protagonists, they bring a bit more personality and power to the screen. One could be forgiven for thinking that this was a story about the rivalry between two completely contrasting characters, designed to show how differently one can deal with such a hopeless situation.\n\nBesides the excellent acting performances, in which Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp or John McGinley are not lost in their younger years, Platoon comes along with a lot of realism. You buy every scene of the film and it manages to take the audience into the brutal and bloodthirsty war scenes. In contrast to other films in the genre, Stone spares explicit portrayals here, but comes more through powerful individual moments that stay in your head. Although these are sometimes very dramatic, one cannot help but praise them for their recognition value. It comes across clearly that Stone wanted to show what was probably the most traumatic time of his life. He succeeds in Platoon with stirring battle sequences, memorable characters and a clever narrative thread that makes war tangible for us.",

Thanks in large part to the cinematography, the viewer can feel the heat and the humidity and the sweat on the face and smell the stench of rotting vegetation in the steaming landscape.  Platoon focuses on good and evil, not just within the context of the war but also within the individual platoon, as evidenced by Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe).

I think the bleak tone with the complex themes make the movie a memorable experience. I also think the entire cast does a committed job in portraying characters that feel like real people the whole way through.

            "content": "The movie platoon is mostly focused on the main hero \u2013 Chris. A college student, who volunteered to participate in Vietnam war. He thought that college was pointless and that he should honor his country like his grandfather and father did in WWI and WWII. Already after the \"first fight\" Chris sees how horrific this war is. Just because the person, that was on the post fell asleep, people died and got wounded. Although there were moments, where he was given rest, for example: entire scene of people taking a short break with beers, weed, playing cards, he did not forget where he was. As one of the next major parts of the movie was American troops invading a small Vietnamese village. Where we can see how \"terrible\" the soldiers were. But after a while, we realize just how scared they themselves are. As civilians were also used as a weapon during this war, nobody could trust even a kid. But Chris could not really understand it, he saw it as racial discrimination. After that, Barnes and Elias \u2013 two sergeants, get into the conflict, which starts, as Chris says, \"Civil war inside the platoon\". After which Barnes attempts to kill Elias, who indeed survived. And no one would have known, until Chris saw bleeding Elias, which led him to understand that Barnes lied about Elias's death and could not get over the conflict with him, which is why he shot him. The \"final battle\" in the movie showed nearly all the rest of horrors of the war, as well as traps and usage of Napalm The movie ends with Chris wounded, flying outside. Understanding how lucky he is to go away from this hell on earth and how horrific a war can truly be.\n\nFor the character analysis, I would like to choose Barnes, as he may seem like a typical clich\u00e9 sergeant, that is furious, angry, and nearly undying. But it is not all of him. It is not his first year in Vietnam, which is nearly all we know about him, which means that he is probably a well-prepared fighter. There are a few scenes in the movie which let us understand more about his mental condition. Barnes is sick and tired of the war, he just wants it to end, as he fights not for the idea of\n\nwar, but for himself. We can clearly see this in his attitude and in the scars, he has on the face, that he has survived stuff that is even more horrific, than what we have seen in the movie. Scene in the village shows, that he has probably experienced civilians killing his own people, which is why he kills wife of the head of village. He does not want for the horrors to repeat again. Him killing Elias and his overall conflict with him also seems reasonable. As Elias is more focused on going by the law, while Barnes finds the most effective and quick method. Which is Barnes kills Elias, as Elias is the only person that does not let him do things his way. After Chris finds out about it, he attempts to fight Elias, and the only thing stopping Elias from killing Chris is the understanding, that others will see it and he would probably get in jail. If not that, he would have probably already finished Chris off. And, the last scene just shows who Barnes really is, as he fights all the Vietnamese with barely using a gun. He does not care about his wounds. Only thing he cares about is for all of them to die. He is so overwhelmed with the idea of killing, that he could have even killed Chris, who tried to save him, if not the napalm bombing. I believe that Barnes is one of the most important characters in the story as he perfectly represents a person who's purpose in life has become war.\n\nThe setting, despite the movie being made in 1986, looks realistic. The actors are what makes the movie great. Especially William Dafoe, who is, in my opinion, living his character. The effects are so good, that even right now they look perfect. Setting and the location of the movie also plays a role, as I completely believed everything that was happening throughout the entire movie. The setting suggests a very horrific atmosphere, as it brings suspense in nearly every single frame. Every time the characters are in the jungle, something could happen. The suspense is also not letting go even when the soldiers are resting. The music is intense and when needed, it is sad. Voices of the characters are perfect. And, in Russian voice-over (which I watched) they were even more tough, which made the movie seem even more serious. The only thing that made me feel like it was fake were gun sounds, as all of them are familiar to me from 1990s video games. As well as the shooting effects were not that good, but it is not the problem of the people that made the movie, it is a problem of time.\n\nPlatoon's theme is mainly focused on how terrible the Vietnamese war was. What the people experienced in it. There are several conflicts: rights of black people vs\nrights of white people, inner conflict between Elias and Barnes, what is right and what is wrong and especially, the inner conflict of Chris, as to who to trust and if he did the right choice. Movie leads us through understanding why every single person in the movie does what he does. In the end, all of people were like brothers, except for a few, no matter whether you are new to the war, or you have been fighting for long, white or black, everyone on the battlefield is the same and is fighting for his own country, or money. By introducing us to Chris the movie shows, that people fought not only for being called heroes when they come back, but for their country. As well as it is trying to tell us about whether the entire war was necessary or not. Were those sacrifices made by soldiers worth it? Or did it just damage their mental health and led them to become obsessed with killing like Barnes? The question is supposed to be answered by the viewer himself. The pure explanation is not really given.\n\nOverall, I would consider this movie very good if you like action, war and history movies, it is awesome and in my opinion, the best movie about the Vietnamese war after \"Full Metal Jacket\", just because of how remarkable the last one is.",

One is that the whole film is less a character journey or one with a narrative. Instead the picture is an experience, enlisting viewers into the deep, dark, gritty war jungle of Cambodia surrounded by blood-hungry, pot-smoking, obscenity-slaying, gun-happy soldiers. Second, Platoon studies the duality of humanity and moral crisis, forcing the viewers to ask questions about serving your country. When you see the American soldiers rioting a rural village and killing innocent Asians, you can't help but feel conflicted with your choice to defend your country. Furthermore, you empathize with Taylor (Charlie Sheen) as soon as he kills his own staff sergeant (Tom Berenger) as well as feel guilty because by definition he's on his side. However, you'd see Sgt. Barnes as a villain when he kills Elias (Willem Dafoe) in enemy fire, thereby stabbing his own comrade in the back. Oliver Stone's Platoon is a brilliantly told war film that shows the black and white sides of American soldiers at the Vietnam War. Also, did you catch Johnny Depp in this movie?

            "content": "Written and directed by Oliver Stone, the film taking home the Oscar for the Best Picture in 1987 was Platoon.  Set in Vietnam during the Vietnam War, the film is based on Stone's actual experiences serving in the same war.  It's raw, emotionally draining and extremely unpleasant.  It's also a damn fine movie.\n\nCharlie Sheen plays the central character of Chris Taylor, a newly arrived infantryman.  Unlike the other soldiers around him, he has not been drafted, but instead has volunteered thinking that it is his duty as an American citizen.  Upon arriving in Vietnam he quickly learns that the newer you are, the less valuable the rest of the company finds you to be.  As the movie's tagline states, \"The first casualty of war is innocence\".  The movie does not glorify war, or America's efforts in them.  In fact it does the opposite by immersing the viewer very quickly into the utter chaos and destruction that war entails.  The carnage is high, the mutilation plentiful, and the mental challenges immense.  Seeing people placed in inhumane environs, and then watching how that in turn sends them down the rabbit hole of seeing other races/peoples as less human is not enjoyable to watch, but it is sobering.  \n\nSheen's performance is an accomplished one, but he is outshone by Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger.  The two actors portray sergeants within the unit, each with members of the team that look to them for guidance.  Defoe and those that follow him seek nothing other than trying to make the best of the undesired circumstances while watching out for one another.  Berenger on the other hand is a fully realized creature of war, reveling in it, and using it to excuse otherwise inexcusable behavior.  They are very figuratively set out as representing good and evil. Sheen, as Taylor, must literally continually choose how much of his soul he can afford to sacrifice in order to simply be lucky enough to come out alive\u2026 if he can at all. \n\nAn added bonus is seeing so many young actors in the cast who will eventually go on to have very long and successful careers in Hollywood.  Among them are Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Keith David and Mark Moses.",

Taylor (Charlie Sheen) arrives just as body bags are being shipped out, which seems to be the natural progression except for the lucky ones. Taylor is the odd-man out in a number of ways; new guys aren't treated with much regard and unlike many of his co-horts, he's actually rich and volunteered for this shit.\n\nAnd it is mostly shit. From the heat and bugs to Stone's exquisitely filmed and choreographed firefights, Taylor's clean-up crew platoon is a testament to stress on the body and the mind. If the fear of losing a limb or your life doesn't get you then the anger over a loss of a friend sure will. These men face obstacles not just to their own mortality, but to their sanity. In one scene Stone takes an incredible risk, showing American soldiers being far from the patriotic heroes we bill them as. It's a disturbing look at unchecked power and emotions and an even-handed, unsympathetic look at the complexity of human behavior.\n\nTo say Stone gave Charlie Sheen his two best acting roles (\"Wall Street\" being the other) is an understatement. Taylor is essentially us, much like Sheen's dad, Martin, was us in \"Apocalypse Now.\" We see the war through his eyes and hope he can escape it not just with his life but his own morality intact. Tom Berenger is also great as his hard-edged commanding officer, a seasoned war veteran with the scars to prove it. His moral ambiguousness is a great contrast to William DaFoe's more reasonable 2nd in command, leading to one of the movie's many haunting scenes.\n\"Platoon\" makes no excuses but makes the solid claim that a senseless war can lead to a senseless mind. It's a riveting watch.",

Elias is a true heroic character, meanwhile the psychopathic Barnes is a strong counterpoint to the moral center Elias is to the platoon. Charlie Sheen's character isn't particularly fleshed out, but this works because his generic appeal makes it easy for the audience to project themselves onto him, as an everyman experiencing war for the first time.

Many were not fully trained for this and did not know what to expect. We see Sheen's character initially not being able to cope with the demands from the heat, the surroundings and the fellow men. We see a lot of Sheen's facial expressions and much of his pain and sorrow comes from his eyes. He does a good job. The experience men Tom Berenger and William Defoe are excellent. Both have different ways about looking at the war and about their moral compass. I don't fully feel Berenger's character is the villain but we see how the war can effect people. William Defoe tries to see it from the ordinary people and does not accept Berenger just killing innocent people. We see the internal struggle of men and their morals. Like a civil war in the platoon where something will go wrong. People losing themselves. The brutal killings and burning of a village is shocking. We don't hide from it and we are not shielded from it. At times it feels like a laugh. Watching a girl being raped and only Sheen's character stops it is again hard to watch. The men don't realise that they are losing themselves and they should know its wrong. The fighting scenes are very brutal including the last 10 minutes. We see from different camera perspectives, very close on the ground and from above on the helicopters. This is excellent cinematography and i did very much like i was there and it unnerved me and not knowing where the Vietnam army were. Watching the men being rolled into a big hole is a powerful statement. Many lost their lives from both sides but they will be left in areas to rot. A very powerful scene is Defoe's death scene, he runs away from gunshot before ultimately knees on the ground and arms in the air before collapsing. Its a bleak movie and one that i will not want to watch again for a while. It felt really raw and real. One scene as the camera pans down the line of the men just seeing their faces was very effective. Their reactions show so much about what they are facing. We have some dialogue linked to the men that were fighting in Vietnam, from the many poor people and people out of work. There is little links to the politics and what they are fighting for. The film is pretty short and we don't see the men outside of the war. A film directed with experience and passion by Stone and the loss of innocence is shown fully by Charlie Sheen's changes.",

By so many accounts of those that served our country, this is a stunningly accurate and authentic depiction of boots-on-the-ground wartime in Vietnam, in equal parts aching and unvarnished.\n\nThe film leans heavily on the tale of the progressively lost innocence of an infantryman in a role that saw Charlie Sheen emerge from under his father Martin's legendary performance in \"Apocalypse Now,\" particularly as Charlie's voiceover is evoked as he reads letters of acute introspection to his grandmother back home (this is an exceedingly well-acted film from top to bottom). As the platoon takes on a largely unseen enemy, the combat scenes are wholly immersive yet alarmingly difficult to watch, and as well they should be -- yet they're also beautifully executed in the context of expert filmmaking, as a dark, faceless claustrophobia permeates throughout. \n\n\"Platoon\" remains in that small group of films -- regardless of subject matter -- which manage to tell whatever their specific story is with a far greater depth of nuance than others who fall short of the mark. In our current environment -- in which our one-time thirst for wartime truths has arguably been suppressed by a sheer exhaustion with endless conflicts -- \"Platoon\" may not be front-of-mind for our escapist consumer population. Yet here it waits, immortalized with great storytelling and great performances, and with a message destined to reemerge at our current expense of selectively looking the other way.",

            "content": "I have to say I was slightly disappointed by this film having had it built up to be one of the best films about the Vietnam War and one of director Oliver Stone's best. I would disagree with this praise on both counts as Apocalypse Now (1979) and The Deer Hunter (1978) are both more intimate explorations of the War's effect on the lives of Americans and JFK (1991) and Talk Radio (1988) are far more interesting, better directed films by Stone. I understand that 1986 wasn't the strongest year in terms of Best Picture nominees, Blue Velvet (1986) was not even nominated, but A Room with a View (1985) is definitely better than this film and it would have been a nice opportunity to reward Merchant/Ivory because Howards End (1992) and The Remains of the Day (1993) lost.\n\nChris Taylor, Charlie Sheen, is a wealthy young man who has volunteered to join the U.S. Army and participate in the Vietnam War in 1968. His platoon is divided as two opposing leaders battle to gain control of the members of the platoon. Sergeant Bob Barnes, Tom Berenger, is ruthless and cynical who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. He is opposed by the more idealistic, conflicted Sergeant Elias, Willem Dafoe, who takes a liking to the innocent Taylor. Taylor witnesses the brutality and bloodshed caused by the U.S. Army and questions the morality of what he is doing as members of his platoon die around him.\n\nThe film manages to make some important comments about the Vietnam War as you realize how desensitized to violence you can become when you see it every day and that moral clarity disappears when faced with the fog of war but it didn't make these points as well as Paths of Glory (1957) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). I was moved by the death of the moral Sergeant Elias and Sheen's final monologue is a genuine reflection on how Vietnam war veterans dealt with the repercussions of their actions during the war. Had Stone sprinkled some more of these moments in I would have felt more compelled by the story and cared more about the chaotic action scenes.\n\nI suppose Stone's point was that war causes you to value life less and combat is so intense and irrational that it's hard to figure out what's going on but we spend so much time with random flashing and noise on screen when that point could have been made much more concisely. A film like Birdy (1984) manages to show how unintelligible war can appear when you are participating in it but there you see only brief flashbacks while the protagonist ruminates on how these brief moments have changed him. I didn't feel any real perspective in these scenes and although maybe if I had experienced warfare myself these scenes would seem shockingly realistic and accurate to the life of a soldier I wasn't feeling what Stone wanted me to feel.\n\nThe positives of the film were the supporting performances as Willem Dafoe, one of my favorite actors, gives one of his most recognized performances and Tom Berenger gives a campy performance as the villain. Dafoe is able to sell the few lines of dialogue he gets as he and Sheen discuss the difficulty of knowing whether what they are doing is right. His crestfallen face when he realizes that Berenger will betray him and his physical work during his famous death scene is impressive. Berenger is given the most enjoyable to play role in the film as the villain with a giant Ernst Stavro Blofeld-like facial scar who at one point yells \"I am reality!\", real subtle screenplay. I think that Michael Caine in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) puts them both to shame but I'm not going to begrudge an awards nomination for Dafoe.\n\nI would recommend that people see this film because it does have it's strong points, Dafoe's performance and the messages about war chief among them, but don't go in expecting a masterpiece. The Academy made the wrong decisions this year in terms of what to nominate for Best Picture but this isn't the worst film that could have one as I shrink in fear at the thought of The Mission (1986) being a Best Picture winner.",

As was the case for an entire generation of battle-scarred veterans, there is only Vietnam. We arrive with Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a fictionalized version of director Oliver Stone himself. We are thrust unknowingly and unfeelingly into the heart of a dark jungle where the concept of humanism is a long distant memory and the notion of honor is nonexistent. Much like the government officials who send the boys of our nation off to fight for their country, we're not supposed to care about where they came from . . . only what they can do once they're in combat. If you ever wanted to experience a first class psychological examination of war's harsh realities, then this is the film for you.\n\nWar films always seem to be split into two camps: those who believe in glorifying military service as an inevitable necessity (predominantly found within the first half of the Twentieth Century in American cinema) and those who believe in showing warfare as a horrific nightmare that should be avoided at all costs. Stone draws on his personal experiences slogging through the muck and the blood and makes it easy to understand that the horrific nightmare is probably a lot closer to the truth than the glorification.\n\nWe explore the routines of war. We witness the way the men treat each other, their mentality, their fear, their isolationism, their disgust at their situation, their exhaustion, their flagging morality, their increasing hostility, their pain, and their grief. It is all detailed with startling clarity. There are moments in this film which are so vivid they make the viewer believe they are actually standing side-by-side with the soldiers instead of sitting safe and sound in a movie theater or in the confines of their own living room.\n\nThis was my introduction to the unsurpassed acting ability of the great Willem Dafoe. He doesn't disappoint here and he has never disappointed since. His misplaced incorruptibility is an unparalleled counterpoint to the dark cynicism Tom Berenger provides. They are almost like symbolic representations of Heaven and Hell at a point in time when the lines between the realms were starting to blur. It's not coincidence that their characters are named Elias (which can be traced back to the Hebrew name for God) and Robert (which no doubt refers to the medieval legend \"Robert the Devil\") respectively.\n\nJohn C. McGinley and Francesco Quinn proved in this film that they could hang with the big boys while Sheen showed me for the first time in his career that he was an honest actor and not some cheap impression of an actor as he was in \"Red Dawn\" and \"The Boys Next Door.\" This is a technically proficient film as well. Robert Richardson's cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen in a Vietnam-based motion picture. The final visual of Elias (featured prominently on theatrical posters and covers for home video releases - natch) has got to be one of the most iconic moments in its entire decade. This is a damn near perfect work of art, unforgettable in all aspects, which challenges the viewer to closely examine what they have learned about the consequences of war when the film is over.",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's brutal Vietnam epic has aged poorly.\n\nPlatoon (1986) is brutal and thrilling at its peaks, but it is quite long and unbearably slow at times. The lack of many edits keeps the pace at a crawl. The vague soundtrack only chimes in during a few opportune moments to remind you that you are watching a film and not actual war documentation. \n\nNotably, I think Stone's depiction of Vietnam veterans is quite damning. They murder numerous civilians, including women and children. You see American soldiers rape women and make excuses for it. You see officers kill other American troops, whether to cover for themselves or in mistaken air strikes. You see the blatant racism of American soldiers towards black soldiers and the local Vietnamese people. You see soldiers doing drugs, drinking excessively, and protect themselves in cowardice in general. Finally, you see the overall disarray and disorganization of the Vietnam War as fumbled by top officers in the United States Army. I think most audiences will find Platoon too heinous to watch, despite its historical accuracy. It is dark and the hopefulness is even more dim. Platoon is like forcing viewers to bear witness to the atrocities of American warfare.\n\nDespite Stone's stellar direction and brave cinematography with painstaking attention to detail for era specific accuracy, Platoon is just too meandering to say it has a plot. Vietnam was certainly desolate and hopeless, but a movie should have some kind of structure. Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is still the best Vietnam film ever directed. Even Stanley Kubrick's lesser film Full Metal Jacket outdoes Platoon in most every way. Stone directed Platoon with an admirable sense of duty and respect, but it feels pretty shallow and contrived at times.\n\nCharacters aplenty in Platoon just seem to disappear. You will hardly learn anyone's name while watching Platoon. Most of this fine cast of actors hardly even get a line in before the die or are just forgotten about completely. I feel like much of Stone's dialogue is too wordy for these characters and often lands flat. His contrived sense of righteousness is fogged by the overall melodramatic tone for most of Platoon. The subplot of revenge as well as the debate about justice in Vietnam are some of Stone's finest words. However, much of the script for the lower grunts is pretty repugnant and witless, despite the great attempts at acting from the supporting cast.\n\nSpeaking of actors, Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger give career highlight performances in Platoon. They not only shine as the best actors in the cast, but as the most complex characters representing the peace dove and war hawk dynamic of Vietnam's soldiers. Bot Dafoe and Berenger are absolutely incredible in Platoon. I found myself mesmerized by their acting.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the massive supporting cast is relegated to minor lines and forgettable roles. Platoon certainly wastes Forest Whitaker, who is worth far more than displayed here. John C. McGinley is pretty comically bad. His sniveling coward character Sgt. O'Neill is just terrible. I must mention Charlie Sheen gets a lot of undeserved credit for Platoon as I found him dull, uninspired, and bland for the majority of Platoon. He was trying to imitate his father, Martin Sheen, in his legendary performance in Apocalypse Now, but Charlie Sheen just falls short of his father's skill level. Charlie just looks out of his element the whole time and only really starts to act towards the last half hour. I cannot say the whole cast delivered, honestly.\n\nOverall, Oliver Stone made a respectable war movie that had higher aspirations than it really accomplishes. If you want to see why Vietnam was Hell on Earth for all involved, watch Platoon. If you want to see the best films about Vietnam for the real experience, I suggest Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket.",

Writer-Director Oliver Stone captures some raw brutal scenes and attempts in empowering the characters through it, creating a perfect arc for the plot line but fails to ask for attention and offer gripping screenplay to the audience. Charlie Sheen seems a bit unsuitable for his protagonist role and doesn't quite justify its character whilst Willem Dafoe breathes life into the character and is outstanding as a supporting cast. Platoon takes big leaps on its first act and slows down on its second one until which the track becomes predictable on its climatic sequence.",

            "content": "Platoon is so much more than just your average war film. This is actually rather intelligent, both in its plot and technical execution. It's the Vietnam War, we follow a platoon of US soldiers as they attempt to wipe out the enemy. The question that this film raises is: who really is the enemy? You have the conflict of the war itself (America against Vietnam) but within the platoon is a conflict for authority. Split between what is right and what is wrong, the moral implications of this war have taken effect on several soldiers as they question their choices. This was a smart element to include within the plot, it was easier to establish character development and build some tension. The majority of the characters were sufficiently developed and their personalities had charisma. This was mostly down to the great cast. Willem Dafoe was easily the best performance, Tom Berenger was also decent and the heated chemistry between them was well conveyed. Charlie Sheen however, didn't work for me. His acting ability consisted of monotonous dialogue delivery and shouting, perhaps he was overpowered by the rest of the great cast? I don't know, just felt meh. Didn't help that his biggest battle was with nature...we're talking ants, leeches and other insects. Obviously, animals love abit of Sheen. Oliver Stone's direction was solid, very realistic and gritty. The makeup effects were practical, the wounds and blown up limbs looked pretty damn realistic. A standout scene was the raiding of the Vietnamese village. This was the turning point where actually the American side were perceived as the antagonists, clearly communicating with our inner moral compasses. Effective, very effective. This is easily one of the best war films I've seen and winning Best Picture was fully justified.",

When we see that we have to keep our eyes everywhere and make sure we are prepared and certain we are safe. When we see that they could be hiding anywhere when they have already been here.

When something's we see we wish not to see but can't help it when it's better to know then wonder. When something's we see we hate when we see they are all the same enemy. When what we see we hate when we hate being here. When what we see is victory, and expects others to surrender when they are not the dominant ones. When what we don't see we add to the fuems of evil to a war that makes us seem we are on the wrong side when we see our targets and aims are on innocent people. When we see ourselves in charge to have full control of lives and the situation to get information and send the message of whom we are. When what we see is the total destruction of lives torn apart for the sole purpose of war. When what we see is our humanity disappearing when we don't see the lives that are at cost when we treat them less of a human being. When something's we don't need to see but feel that it hurts, that what we are fighting for is uncertain whether its right or wrong.

When we see that we want to go home alive, when we wish to see our plans after war to go through when we are done. When we see we are taking heavy fire and can't see where it's coming from to fire back. When we see that we must pull back and regroup while we can when they are heading towards us with full frontal attack. When we see there is no large enough army to take us down when we are in full assault mode. When we see in the fog of war are the fatalities that die by our own men that we don't see but others see. When we see we must carry the bodies of the dead back home, when we see to it we leave nobody behind. When we see that we couldn't get everyone when it's too late and we can't go back. When we see some of us are really tough soldiers when we can take so much and still be able to stand up for one last chance at an afterlife after war. When we see that we made it and others didn't to know the realities of war is some of us make it and others don't and we must rely on us.

When we see that we can't trust those to lead us, regardless of how much they have seen and been through. When we have to see those whom we disagree with but have to see regardless when we are all in this war together. When we don't need to see when we hear the news of other soldiers like us got hit worse too to see we are losing this war. When what we do see and hear are those whom we rely on not seeing and hearing us out to know we are fighting each other as well.  When what we see is a bunch of soldiers ordered to work together when they can't and we are fighting the same war but can't seem to find our aim when our enemy's targets are hitting us and we are hitting nothing but ourselves to know why we are losing this war in the first place. When we don't see is we didn't bother to check our egos and power struggles at home before we enlisted and joined to take each other backs and arms to fight. When we see that we are all suffering in pain one way another, when we are uncertain of the outcome when we have no positive enforcements, no good news, no good leadership taking us to victory and back home. When we do see is some tickets heading back home when it's the only way out to what we signed in for. When what we see is not the mindsets that bring us together or give us the strength to fight, when we don't see eye to eye on what is on our mind. When what we don't see we hear when our own men can't speak when they are dead and what we hear is our enemies on the other end. When we prefer to fight at certain times when others can see our position clearly when they know where we are firing from. When we see that our back is running away when they see how many there are to stay to get killed. When we see that we are losing our position and grasp of this war when we are too busy hiding rather than fighting. When we have to be careful that we don't close our eyes when we wake we don't want see our enemies on the other end. When what we can't seem to hear or see on the other end is help to back us up when. When we see is our enemies everywhere, sacrificing themselves to kill as many of us, and picking us off one by one even our own when we know the end is now and we have one last chance for revenge and see to those pay for their betrayal. When we see that we position ourselves to survive a full out assault destroying everything in its paths. When we get to see the light of day, when we see we survived the impossible when everyone else died and we are in bad shape. When we see others survive to know where our target remains. When we see that reinforcements came at the right time. When we see that reinforcements came on time at the cost of so many enemy soldiers and too late for many of ours. When we see that we made it out of enemy lines, and some of ours whom we started with. When we see from another point of view the cost of war to know what was it all for to see all the destruction and suffering it leaves us during and after war that remains with us and in history. When it's hard to see a life of war that remains with us when we are responsible for so many deaths to know what do we see and whom do we see when its all over when we are judged.",

This film is probably a fictitious retelling and generally has to do with the inner struggles of the platoon. There's a lot of good actors in this, and some you may haven't heard about because they weren't main or supporting characters like the most minor roles I've ever seen played by Tony Todd and Johnny Depp. \n\nIf you were to talk to your friends about this film and what they remember, they probably wouldn't remember right away that those and some others were actually in this film. I wasn't fully entertained by this film, but I can appreciate how put together it was. This may be the greatest acting performance and the most important acting role that Charlie Sheen has ever played in his career. \n\nI've seen a lot of his works, and acting-wise, it was him who drew me to wanting to watch this film and own it in the first place.

He found the Vietnam/Army scenes in Forest Gump to be true-to-life.) His opinion informed mine while I watched this movie, but I still found merit in it. It is well crafted, and the performances are very good. The action scenes are scary and don't glorify war. Director Oliver Stone supposedly based this movie on his own experiences.

            "content": "\"I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves. And the enemy was in us.\"\n\nIf all war films were as good and sincere as Platoon it would probably be one of my favorite genres, but there are very few exceptions where the material is treated right as most directors tend to either be incredibly biased debating either in favor or against the war. It's strange I make this claim since Platoon is obviously an anti-war film, but it treats the material with an honesty you don't find in other films of the genre. It is much easier to make a statement like this in a war that everyone considers was a terrible mistake to get into. What Platoon has going for it however, is that it was written and directed by a man who actually served in the Vietnam War and decided to share his experience of what really was going on. Oliver Stone handles the material with incredible honesty not shying away from the horrors and senseless deaths in war and he delivers a film that never feels sermonizing (with a few exceptions). Even the villains (not the Vietnam soldiers, but the dubious Sgt. Barnes and his band of brothers) are portrayed with some sort of empathy. Platoon isn't actually a film that focuses on war between Vietnamese and American soldiers, but rather the civil war that was going on inside the mind of these soldiers that Stone fought alongside with. He wasn't afraid at pointing out who the real enemy truly was and for that reason the Vietnamese soldiers are barely portrayed in this film. It seems that with Platoon, Stone was able to cope with the effects that the war had on him and the result is a passionate and sincere film. \n\nIn the very opening scene we are introduced to Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) as he has just been deployed to Vietnam and is arriving at the war zone. He narrates the film through voiceover as he is writing letters to his grandma informing her about the war. Unlike most of the soldiers, he wasn't forced to go to the war, but volunteered after giving up on college. During the first few weeks he is struggling to keep up with the pace of war and no one seems to care too much for him since he's the new kid who hasn't yet been exposed to all the carnage they've experienced. Chris is currently serving two noncommissioned officers who couldn't be more different from each other. On the one hand there is scar faced Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who seems to have been in the war forever and on the other there is Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who is much more lighthearted and easy going. Both are experts at war who know they are fighting with unexperienced soldiers. When a village raid gets out of hand both Sergeants take opposite sides and the platoon is divided between those who support Elias and those who take Barnes's side. Evidently the war has taken a toll on all these men and some begin to question their very participation in it when they realize the enemy is inside each of them. There are also supporting performances from Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, and John C. McGinley who are all in the platoon together.\n\nThere is no denying the emotional buildup during the scene of the village raid and Johnny Depp's face says it all during one of the killings that takes place there. It is one of the most intense scenes I've seen in a war film. The performances in this movie are what stood out for me. Charlie Sheen is great in the lead role, but it is the confrontation between Berenger and Dafoe that truly stands out. Both deserved their Oscar nominations despite not winning, but Platoon still took the top honors for Best Picture in 1987. My only complaint with the film perhaps was that it didn't really need the voiceover narration from Charlie Sheen. Stone could've had enough faith in the audience and let them see what he wanted to say with the images alone and not spoon feed them with the narration. The excuse for its inclusion is that he is writing his grandmother, but there are things as the movie goes on that are evidently thrown in there so the audience could understand what he was thinking. It's just a minor complaint because his character was still the easiest to identify with. The score and the cinematography are both effective and they enhance the horrors portrayed in this film. Platoon still manages to have an impact almost thirty years laters and that is why it is a classic.\n \nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "By 1986, Oliver Stone was mostly recognized as the screenwriter behind Brian de Palma\u00b4s masterpiece \"Scarface\", even due he had written a handful of films and directed a couple of films; but it all changed when he presented a film that was \"partially\" based on his personal experiences in the Vietnam War: \"Platoon\". \nChris Taylor is a colleague dropout who volunteers for duty in Vietnam as he sees it as the only thing he can do in life and because he has nobody that cares for him. When he is finally in the battlefield he encounters and befriends a group of soldiers but he soon witness the cruel reality of war and the atrocities that people are willing to do inside of it. \nThe Vietnam War has been used as the setting of numerous films and most of them are pretty forgettable with some exceptions like Kubrick\u00b4s \"Full Metal Jacket\", Coppola\u00b4s \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Deer Hunter\", and Oliver Stone\u00b4s \"Platoon\". \"Platoon\" is one of those war films that manages to tell a human story without glorifying war. It counts with a pretty big and impressive cast that delivers solid/strong performances with the best being, obviously, Charlie Sheen in a role that reminds me that he is/was a solid actor beyond his \"comedic\" roles; gorgeous locations that are perfectly exploited, memorable dialog, beautiful cinematography, a perfect pacing, a memorable story, iconic scenes, an excellent use of songs of the time, well executed character relationships, a script that doesn't fall in any clich\u00e9, solid themes, and  intense and pulse pounding action sequences that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only big complain with \"Platoon\" is that it wastes a lot of talented actors like Johnny Deep and Forrest Whitaker in roles that mostly remain on the background and are then completely drop from the film. The other issue I have is the fact that there are too many characters that at times I got them confused or even forgot who they were. \n\"Platoon\" is filled with emotion, phenomenal acting and a touching, relatable and unforgettable story about the humanity in the middle of hell. This is not only Oliver Stone\u00b4s masterpiece but also one of the best war films ever made and the third best film about the Vietnam War in my list.",

The typically nice-guy Tom Berenger and bad-guy Willem Dafoe have their respective roles reversed, painting a poignant picture of the duality of men when pushed to the brink of their capacities, while the on-location shooting and preternatural cinematography make Platoon equal parts first person war experience and Ayn Rand-like character study.

However, you should watch this, not only because it is a classic, and because is one of the only great Charlie Sheen movies, but because its representation of the War of Vietnam is something you don't get in any other movie, not in The Deer Hunter, not in Apocalypse Now and definitely not in Forrest Gump. Platoon is the real deal, as painful to watch as it is.\nA moving piece of cinema, with scenes that are so brutal that show in the delicate but heavy-handed way that makes Oliver Stone such a great critic for all U.S.'s issues what the Vietnam war does to the people that came in as the civilised men we knew and get out with a brain so torn out by the tragedy and the horrors. Because at times Platoon is a very, very sad Horror film, that takes the refreshing turn of showing the American army as enemies and not all the time as victims. Because both countries cause suffering and pain to each other, and in that aspect, Platoon is particularly powerful at.\nCharlie Sheen, whatever happened to him, gives a full-on performance as the main character of Platoon. He is also favored by the really complex character he is given, Chris Taylor, an innocent high-class boy who turned into a disturbed killing machine. Of course that the rivalrie between the two Sargeants of the platoon, Sgt Barnes and Sgt Elias, played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, steal the scenes in which they have to shove the characters into our minds, but that's why Dafoe and Berenger were chosen to give life to this rivalry. The second half of the movie deals with this enmity in a less satisfying way, trying to convince us of an enemy to a movie that was just perfect being as neutral as it was. But as far as structure goes, the movie is stil impeccable.\nThe production is outstanding, with scenes that put Michael Bay to shame (In fact, 1986 Stone explosions look better than 2014 Bay \"fireworks\" or whatever those are). The showdowns are tense, exciting and gripping at every second, and the sense of melancholy is throughout the movie present, thanks to Stone's sensitive direction, Robert Richardson's amazing cinematography and the musical masterpiece that is \"Adagio for Strings\". Platoon is a movie that really does justice to Vietnam, and does not sugar-coat it nor overproduce it. It's an Oliver Stone film that packs a punch like no other actual film out there.",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's breakthrough directorial debut.  Inspired by Stone's personal experience as an infantryman during the Vietnam War, Platoon follows a young US cadet named Chris Taylor who volunteers in the war, fighting in a platoon.  Later on, he starts realizing the grim realization and the dangers of war, and starts questioning the fight after witnessing the actions if his team, and after a military men's death (he had known him, and knows who killed him).  Although not the best war film, it still is one of the best due to its realism, and content.  This masterpiece focuses on the awful side of war instead of glorifying violence and death (anti-war film), adding graphic violence, lots of blood and gore, smoke, gunfire, explosions , and demolished areas in order to capture the look of war 100%.  But what's a film without a human touch?  Luckily, director-writer Oliver Stone, a former veteran during the war, inputs characterization, drama, comedy, and grit into the characters, who are brought perfectly through excellent acting.  The best performances come from main stars Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, and Tom Berenger, who show the light and warm hearted sides of their characters, as well as their secret and dark sides.  Charlie Sheen as the young cadet displays incredible acting abilities that modern audiences don't see anymore and probably won't as finding film work has been tough for him due to his troubles with the law.  Stone writes an amazing script that captures everything soldiers experience in war, and also gives stellar direction, thus bringing this film to life flawlessly.  Platoon also focuses on the themes on trust, who we are really fighting for, what are we really fighting for, who the real enemy is, and our true intentions in battle and life.  The film also stellar cinematography thanks to Robert Richardson, which also helps capture the stellar, realistic battle sequences that aid in showing the disgraceful concept of war.  Although it loses to Saving Private Ryan for best and most realistic war film of all time, it still is a must-see for anyone who wants to see what war looks and feels like.",

Although competition for the top spot is tight, between Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, We Were Soldiers and Platoon, it's this one that takes it to the jungle with the band of soldiers who are trying to keep hold of their humanity, and those who have all but lost it, and is the staple for Vietnam on screen.  It's not just based around a battle like We Were Soldiers, it's not a rare special mission like Apocalypse Now, and not based on a single incident like Casualties of War, it's a very unique story that falls onto a single platoon of soldiers as they fight to survive many things, including each other, and up there in some of the best war movie stories with Saving Private Ryan.  The action is good, looks good, with good cinematography, although by today's standards takes a hard hit due to pretty lame sound effects, even though it won an academy award for it in 1986.  The action isn't the centre of the movie however, as that falls to the story and the conflicts between the men as they both take sides with who is in the right and wrong, and start a deadly civil war that quietly takes place within the platoon.  The death of Elias is probably one of the best and most memorable in film, while that or Barnes is simple and bittersweet.  It is however still a great movie and for me the best representation of Vietnam, with some good actors and acting, many of them at the start of their careers.",

As time passes the Platoon is split between two NCOs sgt. Elias and sgt Barnes. Barnes representing the dark side to the military willing to stoop to killing children if it accomplishes his mission while sgt Elias represents conscience and doing what is right even when everything is going to hell around him. The movie has some brutal scenes that depict war in a less than heroic fashion a nice change of pace from most other American war movies.

Well it that time, once again, to deliver you a countdown to my 200th movie review and what better way to kick things off than on Veteran's Day. A day where the average Joe's like us pay tribute to the real G.I. Joes of the United States military by giving these soldiers a salute, offering them discount meals at cheesy restaurants, and buying a war movie or two depicting there fallen brethren maliciously killing villagers and going insane in the process. So you may be asking yourself why I picked this film. Well it is Veteran's Day, this movie won the Best Picture Award back in 1985, and I figured I haven't seen this movie up until now. If you ask me that's more than enough review this so let us dig right on into my review on Platoon.\n\nSo this film takes place from the perspective point-of-view of a young soldier Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, who serves his time during the worst year of the Vietnam War. What I like about this is that you get to watch Charlie Sheen's character slowly devolve from a well mannered person to a guy who just goes numb and not gives a rat's ass what other people think about him. The director Oliver Stone does some amazing work throughout this film when it came right down to the dialogue between the soldiers and those frightening battle scenes that just put you on the edge of your seat when they happen. There was one scene where I jumped out of my couch as I saw this one soldier get blown up from setting off a trap and it even made me say, \"Holy crap\" out loud. And you would think that in a Vietnam War movie, you would obviously think that the Viet Cong's are the enemy, but oh no. Tom Berenger is a true monster in this when it came to putting his gun to the fore head's of little children, killing his own teammates, or even going straight up primal when he completely lost his anger. Other actors included Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, Keith David, and John C. McGinley who deliver some great dialogue in here as well. One thing I may have to complain about is that fact that after every battle scene the movie plays this same song over and over again which, to me personally, it got pretty annoying. Overall, it is a Great War movie to see if you have not seen it already. Somewhere in the Top 20 or 15 range of best War movies of all time.",

The Director (Oliver Stone) Gives us a haunting and painstaking vision of war through the innocent lives of young americans whose innocence was lost when they fired their first shots. Bolstered by his own experiences in Vietnam, Oliver Stone gives us on of the most mature and thought provoking war film to date.  The movie centers around Pvt. Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who was a naive college dropout who volunteered in the army to prove himself. Throughout the film, we see him grow up from a child to a man hardened by the war and brutality he never expected. His platoon leaders, Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) represent the good and evil, with Barnes being the evil and Elias the good. They constantly battle with each other, with draws points to the duality of man under pressure. Like I said, good vs. evil. The films has several religious overtones and presents itself not just as an anti-war film, but a honest portrayal of man and his darkest hours. All-in-All Platoon was a well made war film with great acting, honest writing, and mature direction which makes this film a memorable and thought provoking piece of film making at its finest.",

            "content": "An Object Lesson in How Not to Fight a War  \r\n\r\nIf you believe IMDb, half of Hollywood was almost cast in this, or else cast but in a different role.  My favourite part is that they considered Johnny Depp for the lead but didn't give it to him because he was too young and unknown, surely the last time he was ever declared such.  (This was his third movie and the year before he would be launched to Teen Idol status by [i]21 Jump Street[/i].)  And while this is one of those movies which saddens me by reminding me that Charlie Sheen can act, it's also interesting to think how it would have looked starring Johnny Depp.  Oh, and Charlie Sheen almost fell out of a helicopter during filming and had his life saved by Keith David, so there's that, too; this was about twenty years before Charlie Sheen started breaking down, and he still had some good movies in him.  But it seems that shooting Vietnam-themed movies in the Philippines can be dangerous if your last name is Sheen.\r\n\r\nChris Taylor (Sheen) dropped out of college and joined the military, even volunteering to go to Vietnam.  He felt, it seems, that it shouldn't be a rich man's war but a poor man's fight, and since his father and grandfather both served their country during the wars when they were young, it is now his turn.  When he arrives in-country, he is caught up in the struggle between the vicious Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and the saintly Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe, whose fifty-eighth birthday is today).  Elias represents the good intentions that sent us into Vietnam; Barnes represents the cruelty we were willing to countenance in order to win.  Barnes very nearly instigates a massacre, which Elias heads off.  Barnes knows what will happen to him if Elias is allowed to live, but Vietnam can be very dangerous for an American soldier.  All Taylor wants to do is survive, but there is still the question of which man he will come to be like when he leaves.\r\n\r\nI first saw this film in college, in the one film class I've taken.  (History of the Twentieth Century Through Film.)  I remember coming up out of the world of the film shaking.  I was, it's worth noting, considerably less distracted when I saw it in class.  After all, I was sitting in a dark room with nothing but the film; I didn't have a baby then.  However, I'm also wondering how much seeing more of Oliver Stone's work has influenced me.  Of all the Stone films I've seen, this is far and away the best, and in a way, that's disappointing.  He wrote this about his own personal experiences, about what it was like to really be in Vietnam and to walk the balance between light and dark.  He worked for years trying to get his film made, because he felt it was a story that needed to be told.  And once he'd succeeded, with all his passion and his power, he turned to a hack job about such lunatic conspiracism that even other conspiracy theorists didn't want anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nWillem Dafoe was cast because he had mostly played villains.  (There's a line at one point about thinking he's Jesus, but he wouldn't play Jesus for another two years.)  What he has done since then, I think, is portray a lot of tortured souls--including, of course, Jesus.  Even when he plays villains, there is something in them beyond mere evil.  I keep thinking of his take on the Green Goblin, probably the most nuanced supervillain in recent cinema.  That's a man who is trying to do good, and it drives him insane and turns him to evil.  He's been nominated for two Oscars (for this, losing to Michael Caine in [i]Hannah and Her Sisters[/i], and for [i]Shadow of the Vampire[/i], losing to Benicio del Toro in [i]Traffic[/i]), and I think there are several other films where an argument can be made that he should have been.  He's not truly a star, not really, but I think this is the film where he became an actor for people who pay attention to acting, which is in some ways better, if not in paycheck.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps telling that some of the most tortured of movies about the Vietnam War were made by veterans.  Stone--the last veteran to win an Oscar, if you only count people who actually fought in a war--wrote this film to respond to such propaganda pieces as [i]The Green Berets[/i].  Vietnam, I think, was a much more complicated war than World War II, and it's harder to say good things about it.  This is not to say bad things about those who fought in it, just about the reasons for causing the fight in the first place.  The moral uncertainty behind the origins of the war seems to have rubbed off on what happened in the individual fights, and that's why most of the classic films about Vietnam have been about ambiguity.  There may or may not be such thing as a good war, but if there is, Vietnam wasn't it.  The real Vietnam was more subtle than the conflict between Barnes and Elias, but we can't all be walking Christ metaphors--and even my professor gave up and acknowledged this one after forbidding their use all quarter.",

Elias, who no longer believes in the war, but is willing to fight on no matter what, and Sgt. Barnes, who has been wounded seven times since 1965 and wears the jagged scars on his face as a symbol of the torment and rage welling up in his soul. Barnes believes in what he's doing, while Elias is unsure of Barnes' rather vicious methods of keeping the upper hand over the enemy. In the January of 1968, the platoon is soon divided between the two sergeants, and when Elias threatens to reveal Barnes' crimes to the authorities, Barnes responds in an unexpected way...

Throughout the film, Taylor witnesses the terrors of Vietnam from the enemy and sometimes even from his fellow soldiers.\n\nI was surprised to eventually learn that Oliver Stone directed this movie out of his own personal experiences in fighting Vietnam himself. But then again you can tell by how this movie turned out. It covered so many things that happened to soldiers in Vietnam. I mean sure there's all the blood and gore and fellow soldiers dying like any war film, but then you have the misery and horror of venturing the jungle, soldiers searching and destroying villages, soldiers having a feud against another and what have you. And the acting is great - my personal favorites were Charlie Sheen as Taylor and William Dafoe as Sargent Elias - and the battles where very epic and of coarse, give a very dark and suspenseful look at being in the battle lines as a war film naturally should. \n\nAnd that's my review for Platoon.

This film goes deeper than most vietnam films in terms of showing the emotional and psycological strain the war had on the soldiers and it also shows the horrible acts man is capable of carrying out as an result of this strain.\r\nThroughout the movie Chris Taylor played by Charlie Sheen brilliantly narrates the film by letters to his grandmother and thereby informs the viewer of his emotional state. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe all makes an outstanding performance,  to see Willem Dafoe do both emotional acting and some Rambo-like scenes is very entertaining. Because of the brilliant acting, along with some amazing cinematography and a important message that has been all but forgotten \"The Platoon\" is one of the four films about the vietnam war everyone should see.",

In the latter half of the film, too much time is spent away from the central conflict for the sake of showing bullets fly past and into characters who have not been on screen for more than two minutes. There are elements of showing how members of a platoon bonded, there are elements of showing the corruption of man during warfare, and there are elements of showing the brutality of bloody battles. How I wish that Platoon had chosen one of these as its primary focus. \n\nCharlie Sheen as the protagonist, while not so awful to be distracting, is one of the poorest casting decisions that I have seen in the while. There are some brilliant technical moments and quotable dialogue that redeem the film but it is not something I would want to see again.",

            "content": "Vietnam, 1967.  Welcome to Bravo Company.  Where boys learn to become men.  And where boys must grow up fast or die young.  The tropical heat will wear you down and diseases such as malaria spread quickly.  And body bags are all too common a sight.  We see a group of fresh faced recruits stepping off a military cargo plane.  They are barely out of high school (hell many didn't even finish high school) and have an innocent, virginal look to them.  Many are baby faced, thinking this will be an adventure.  But the reality of war will hit them like a bullet to the brain.  You know the old saying, \"xin loi.\"  Tough shit. \n\nOne of these recruits is Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a young man who is thrust into combat duty despite his youth and inexperience.  But Taylor is different from many of his fellow soldiers.  You see, Taylor wasn't drafted by the Army; he volunteered to be here.  Taylor dropped out of college in order to enlist in the military.  He is driven by ideals and family pride - both his grandfather and father served in the first and second World Wars respectively.  Taylor is a privileged kid, but doesn't believe it's fair that his kind get to escape the draft by enrolling in college while the poor have no choice but to make themselves sacrificial limbs in the name of preserving the United States.   In a letter written to his grandmother, Taylor realizes that when he was growing up, his life was far different from those of his colleagues in Bravo Company.  It's a revelation for him, how he had lived such a sheltered life from the real world.   These young men serving in Bravo Company are grunts, people with little to no ambition and not much in terms of future goals.  They came from small towns with broken homes, and a lack of family support.  Their fellow soldiers in this platoon are their only true family.  But to Taylor, these young soldiers represent the essence of true American valor.  \n\n\"They're poor. They're the unwanted. Yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom. It's weird, isn't it?  They're at the bottom of the barrel, and they know it.  Maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts', cause a grunt can take it, can take anything. They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma.  The heart and soul.\" \n\nIt only takes Taylor a week to realize how much Vietnam is an endurance test.  Taylor finds himself exhausted.  War takes a punishing cost on him and his fellow soldiers.  When you see him accompanying his fellow soldiers on a mission, you witness his sweating and heavy breathing; fatigue is setting in quickly but he cannot be the weak link in this chain.  Taylor sees red ants crawling on his neck, and other bugs crawling all over his face.  He finds himself sleeping in dire conditions with one eye kept open so that his unit doesn't get ambushed in the middle of the night.  .  \n\n\"Somebody once wrote: 'Hell is the impossibility of reason.' That's what this place feels like. Hell. I hate it already and it's only been a week. Some god-damn week, Grandma. The hardest thing I think I've ever done is go on point three times this week - I don't even know what I'm doing. A gook could be standing three feet in front of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired. We get up at 5 am, hump all day, camp around four or five, dig a foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a three-man listening post in the jungle. It's scary, 'cause nobody tells me how to do anything 'cause I'm new and nobody cares about the new guys. They don't even want to know your name. The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much 'cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say, if you're gonna get killed in the Nam, it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much.  If you're lucky, you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a three-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3, 4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep. I don't think I can keep this up for a year, Grandma. I think I've made a big mistake comin' here...\"\n\nThe Bravo Company platoon is led by field Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) as well as Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), and let me tell you, Barnes is as hardened as the permanent scars on his face.  Although highly respected and feared, Barnes is callous, berating his own men and even threatening harm to them if they don't shape up.  Meanwhile, Taylor becomes acquainted with Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), who becomes a big brother of sorts for Taylor.  \n \nMany of the soldiers in this platoon are reaching their breaking point as the death toll rises and the unseen enemy has seemingly gained an upper hand.  The platoon finds itself in a village where they believe that many of the villagers are working in collusion with the Viet Cong.  Barnes gradually becomes unstable and this is evident when he kills an innocent villager in cold blood.  Even Taylor finds himself at the verge of breaking down.  At one point, during this village raid, Taylor points a gun at a one-legged Vietnamese villager.  His decision whether to pull the trigger or not will have significant repercussions which he will carry for the rest of his life well beyond his service of duty in Vietnam...if he lives that long.      \n\nTaylor senses the tension in his platoon and the heightened animosity between Barnes and Elias.  The members of the platoon have begun splitting into two camps, with some siding with Barnes and others siding with Elias.  Taylor finds himself with Elias's group.  If these soldiers want to stay alive, they will have to put aside their differences and learn to work together to defeat the Viet Cong.  But the rift between the members of the platoon may be so great that there is no turning back...and they may be headed for destruction by their own hand...   \n\nIn the war torn jungles of Vietnam, staying alive can be the hardest task.  Keeping your sanity is a whole another challenge.  Taylor has to learn to hold onto his humanity, even in the face of the darkest horrors of war.\n\nPlatoon is an honest glimpse into the lives of the soldiers who served in the front lines of the Vietnam War without the glamour and the glory.  Forget all those Uncle Sam \"I Want You\" recruitment posters, you wanna know what war's really like?  Oliver Stone tells it like it is in Platoon.  The best filmmakers are ones that can tell stories while respecting their audiences and Stone does just that.  Stone respects his audience and doesn't talk down to them.  He respects them enough to present an uncensored perspective on what he sees is the truth as to what happened among US soldiers during the Vietnam War.    \n\nDirector Oliver Stone is a Vietnam veteran and much of this movie is based on his own first hand experiences serving in combat over at Vietnam.  It adds a layer of authenticity to this masterpiece and makes the viewer vicariously experience what Stone - and many soldiers - went through during the Vietnam War.  Stone served in combat duty during the Vietnam War so he witnessed all the realities of war from the courage of his fellow men in the line of duty to the unspeakable atrocities of villagers being slaughtered.  He has seen it all and Platoon perfectly encapsulates all of Stone's experiences in Vietnam.\n  \nIn terms of cinematic storytelling, Oliver Stone is a visionary.  Although the characters, events, and plot are fictional, Stone is using fiction to share his experiences serving as a soldier in the Vietnam War.  Making this movie must have been a cathartic experience for Oliver Stone.  I see this movie as Stone's personal memoirs of the Vietnam War in the style of a docufiction.  It almost feels autobiographical as Taylor seems to me like a fictionalized version of Stone himself.  Instead of making a straightforward documentary, Stone tells his own story through Chris Taylor.  After all, like the main character, Stone dropped out of Yale University and served in Vietnam.  He could have easily lived a prosperous life with an Ivy League education and a six figure job waiting for him, but he chose to enlist in the military because he felt it was the right thing to do.   When we hear Taylor's voiceover narration while writing letters to his grandmother, it feels as though Oliver Stone is sharing his own stories with the audience.  This voiceover device is a powerful tool that makes the story feel all the more real.   \n\nOliver Stone also speaks for a generation, many of whom have kept these painful secrets about what they saw in Vietnam burned in their conscience for far too long.  We are used to the old fashioned Hollywood movies depicting World War II heroics which get audiences pumped, making war seem almost exciting.  They would be effective recruitment tools used by the military.  But Platoon is different.   We really see the inhumane side of war.  The village massacre serves as an important turning point in this movie.  Because it shows that these American soldiers were no better than the enemy they were facing.  This movie flies in the face of all the celebrated jingoism of the 1980s Ronald Reagan era.     \n\nPlatoon shows how war takes a toll on the physical body, the psychological mind, and the spiritual soul.  War is not fun and games.  War is hell and can break the most resilient of souls.  For better or worse, war changes who we are and what we believe in.  When we see our own colleagues dying right in front of our eyes, it impacts us, no matter how strong we think we are inside.  War not only takes a physical toll on its participants, the emotional scars are even deeper.  But those scars are buried deep inside festering until they can no longer take it and wish that it would all just end.  The Adagio for Strings theme plays prominently throughout the movie, representing the true nature of war and its aftermath.  \n\n\nStone goes for gut-wrenching realism here focusing on much of the mental breakdown of these soldiers.  Even though these men are fighting on the same side in this war, we witness many of them turn against each other.  We see the internal strife, exacerbated by the damaged morale.  These soldiers are biting their lip in order not to crack under tremendous pressure.    \n\nDespite what these soldiers have been through, they serve our country, and they continue to do so, enduring the worst of conditions, sometimes inadequate equipment and supplies, and low morale among the soldiers.      \n\nPlatoon is also a coming-of-age tale.  We see Taylor changing and growing from his experiences here.  If Taylor can somehow make it out alive and finish his tour of duty, Taylor will have grown up and become a different man.  Not necessarily a better man, but wiser perhaps.  Vital to the plot is the power struggle between Barnes and Elias. Elias is trying to hold onto those last shreds of morality.  He becomes a mentor to Taylor, trying to protect him from the worst of war.  This tug-of-war battle for Taylor's soul has Barnes and Elias pulling Taylor back and forth in opposite directions.  It's interesting watching the two fight it out for Taylor's soul with Elias the angel on Taylor's shoulder and Barnes as the devil.  Taylor will learn that losing your humanity is the greatest tragedy of all.  \n\nThe narrative focuses on Taylor, but we get to know a variety of characters.  We meet soldiers like Bunny (Kevin Dillon), who is a sociopath with a complete disregard for human life.  Sgt. O'Neill (John C. McGinley) is a bit antagonistic and very manic, but in his own way, he's only following orders and is just trying to make the best of a harsh situation.  There's fellow recruit Gardner (Bob Orwig), a nice kid but is exactly what he is - fresh meat.  And King (Keith David), who is somehow able to keep his head straight amidst all the turmoil.    \n\nThe cast is exceptional.  I'm really impressed with Charlie Sheen's performance and this film showcases his immense acting talent.  To think that Sheen was just 21 years old when he starred in this movie shows that he was indeed an acting prodigy.  Unfortunately, I think Charlie Sheen peaked too early in his career and he never quite had a performance like the one he delivered here.  In his later years, Sheen has been more well known for his off-screen antics, but in Platoon, Sheen delivers a truly winning performance.  Tom Berenger is splendid as Staff Sergeant Barnes.  You will absolutely despise his character even though he's one hell of a soldier.  Barnes does some very despicable things and he tries to justify his conduct by saying that it's war and anything goes.  I'm glad he received an Academy Award nomination for his role here.  I'm usually used to Willem Dafoe playing over-the-top characters, but here he surprises me.  You can tell that his character really gives a damn about Taylor's well-being and tries to be the moral center of the platoon.\n    \nMany of the other cast members were young actors who started out with smaller roles in this movie and have since gone on to great success.  It's fun to watch future stars Johnny Depp, Forrest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, and Tony Todd appear in early roles here.  The always reliable Keith David (one of the finest character actors and an underrated performer) is great as one of the more practical and poised members of the platoon.  And Francesco Quinn - absolutely spellbinding as Rhah, a heroin addicted soldier who also takes Taylor under his wing.  I thought that Quinn stood out among the members of the platoon and though he had a solid career in movies and television, he never quite achieved star status.  It's a meaningful role.  Rhah personifies the many young soldiers who use drugs as a way to ease the pain - and also to avoid confronting the very real prospect of dying on the battlefield.  What's amazing is that there are no deadweight performances at all, everybody does their part and they do it well.  \n  \nThe storyline is relatively easy to follow though there's a great plot twist that really hits you like a punch in the gut.  Military technical advisor Dale Dye (a decorated Vietnam Veteran himself who served as a US Marine Captain) provides further credibility to the storyline.  I can't say for certain whether Platoon portrays a completely accurate depiction of how the United State military operated its protocol during the Vietnam War, but Dye works to make it as realistic as possible.  Dye also has a supporting role as Captain Harris, the commander of Bravo Company.    \n\nPlatoon is also enhanced by great cinematography which captures everything from the terror of the soldiers' faces to the intensity of the firefights during the night ambushes.  Platoon was shot location in the Luzon island of the Philippines.  Although not a perfect substitution, this island provides a suitable backdrop for a land that has been drenched by much human blood.   \n\nOliver Stone stages the battle sequences with a degree of flair.  The way battles were thought in Vietnam was different from other wars.  Vietnam War relied on the strategy of subterfuge.   The enemy was much more difficult to detect.  They would use the environment to their advantage in setting traps and ambushing the soldiers.  The soldiers would hear gunfire and know they were being shot at, but they couldn't see who was doing the shooting.  So the soldiers had to learn how to camouflage themselves and blend in with the jungle settings.  The soldiers also have to watch out for booby traps rigged by the Viet Cong.\n\nPlatoon doesn't flinch at the violence and brutality.  We see and hear soldiers screaming in agony if they are lucky to survive.  Body parts get blown away by grenades and other explosive devices.  And there are graphic details of the soldiers' wounds being treated.  Though not the most gruesome of war movies, it can be tough to watch at times.  \n\nPlatoon is full of unforgettable images.  One of the most popular scenes is when we see a soldier thought to have died emerging from the jungle and running in the field, trying to escape the North Vietnamese soldiers.  He raises his arms in a desperate attempt to cling onto life.  It has become an iconic moment not just for this movie, but for much of cinema.          \n\nUltimately, Platoon is about the staggering costs of war.  There are of course, the human casualties, the men who don't make it home.  Beyond that, the men who survive often end up suffering long-term physical injuries, many of who will never fully recover from those injuries.  And many others endure trauma that is a lot less obvious ranging from post-traumatic stress disorder to other forms of psychological damage and mental health issues.  And yet there are those who become hooked on drugs of all kinds, both of the legal and illegal variety ranging from prescription painkillers to God-knows-what substances, as a coping mechanism.  Although Platoon may be cynical and quite bitter, there are glimmers of hope even in war.  \n  \nIn the end, Platoon is a fitting tribute to those who served (and the many who died) in the Vietnam War.  It doesn't celebrate heroism, but war really is not always about heroes.  Often times, it's simply about making it out alive and surviving long enough so that they can go home.  It's definitely not a film you will forget and is one of the best war movies period.  Like all great cinema, Platoon is transcendent film and continues to resonate with audiences decades after gaining recognition at the Academy Awards.  It is a timeless classic and one which is as important today as it was when it was first released.  And Platoon will endure as an important cinematic milestone for future generations to come.",

It shows a young Charlie sheen and Forrest Whitaker who already from a young age show an amazing set of talent. The movie is really great and impact duo though I would of liked it to be a bit longer and William Defoe to be alive a bit more in it. Though this film is nothing short of fantastic",

Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Keith David, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp.\n\nStone won well-deserved Oscar for his unconventional Vietnam war study, which is a triumph of capturing soldiers reactions under fire and showing the ultimate Hell on earth. Based on director Stone's actual experiences during the front lines, this gives the viewer an unforgettable insight on the horrifying bloodshed known as the battlefield. Film's harrowing war sequences are a hammer blow to the head; a must-see. Only flaw: the main character-played by Sheen-has motives which are hard to relate to, leaving this otherwise excellent film in a certain degree of aloofness. Outstanding Cinematography by Robert Richardson, and Music by Georges Delerue. Also won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Editing, and Sound.",
