            "content": "Shot by cinematographer Sven Nykvist, an Ingmar Bergman mainstay, starring Erland Josephson, another Bergman regular, and shot in a remote area of Sweden, it's no wonder Andrei Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice looks and feels like a Bergman film.  Despite being one of Tarkovsky's lesser-known films, it is filled with complex themes and stark images, including the haunting climax, reminiscent of the burning house scene from Tarkovsky's earlier film, The Mirror.  The plot?  A small group of friends and family gather for a birthday celebration, only to discover via a radio announcement that WW3 has commenced and nuclear annihilation is imminent, forcing them to come to terms with their own mortality.  For those not familiar with Tarkovsky's work, be prepared for some lengthy but wildly effective shots, meticulous composition and plenty of philosophical musings.  Like all of Tarkovsky's work, it is brilliant throughout.",

            "content": "Two outs, bottom of the ninth, and The Sacrifice scores: this was the last Tarkovsky feature film I had not seen, but it was the first to put me to sleep. I was worried it would never happen. \n\nI had to do a double-take initially because about half an hour in, The Sacrifice looked superficially like an Ingmar Bergman film, with a mildly dysfunctional family of bourgeoisie falling apart due to deep emotional problems, but a deeper look reveals classic Tarkovsky material - concerns with a world out of balance, the inherent weakness of human nature, and surreal imagery that calls to mind deeper questions about philosophy and the human psyche. With characters forced to reflect on their existences now that they are all in mortal danger from a threat that they cannot stop, Tarkovsky examines personal ambition and purpose set against the framework of a larger world that threatens to leave any one member behind (themes that may very well have been on the director's mind with his untimely cancer diagnosis); exasperated, regretful, and filled with new and strange purpose, our protagonists begin exhibiting unusual behavior in an attempt to refocus their perspectives that have quickly become painfully outdated. There are musings on Christianity (or more likely, any deity of choice), as one of perhaps many potentially valid spiritual constants that may each be true; the unknowability of it is key and terrifying. \n\nOne of the less immediately idiosyncratic films from the director from a thematic perspective, but visually much of Tarkovsky's talent remains on display, even without the need for a diverse range of distinctive setpieces. (4/5)",

The film entirely enraptured my attention; I even enjoyed the philosophic banter.  That is, until the scene where Alexander's friend Otto, comes up with a plan to avert the consequences of WWIII and save the entire world.  Simply, he must fuck his witchy servant girl named Maria (the virgin Mary lol).  Apparently, the way to escape death, for old men, is to get their dick wet in much younger women and also destroy their connection to their family in the process.  I'm sure it was a huge sacrifice for the protagonist to sneak out and fuck his servant; way to take one for the team.  I do find it amusing that they had to shoot that burning house scene twice, rebuilding the entire thing, because Tarkovsky wouldn't listen to his cinematographer about having two cameras working at once.",

            "content": "Admittedly, I have a limited experience with Andrei Tarkovsky, but both of his films that I\u2019ve seen have been frustrating to watch. I had some hope for The Sacrifice because I was told it actually has a plot with some progression. Yet it takes forever to get that plot in motion, and once you\u2019re there it moves at a snail\u2019s pace. Tarkovsky relishes slow-moving shots, tons of philosophical speeches, and setting the camera approximately 3 miles away from the characters so we can just sit and stare at a lot of dead space while the actors roam through it. The tedium of watching a film that is captured in this way is hard to describe. Even when there is a semblance of plot it doesn\u2019t make any sense. I don\u2019t understand the actions of the characters, and I couldn\u2019t care less about what happens to them because no one has a personality. Perhaps that is the biggest failing for me in The Sacrifice, that we are kept at such a distance from the characters (literally and figuratively) that their story becomes boring by default. I can deal with some slower paced movies because I\u2019m invested in strong characters, and enjoying good performances, but Tarkovsky denies me those things and forces me to just sit and wait for something to happen despite the fact that he hasn\u2019t made me care about who is affected by what happens. There were moments where The Sacrifice almost broke through and got me interested, but then it would make the oddest choices and I\u2019d find myself annoyed again. I think I\u2019ll do my best to avoid all other Tarkovsky films, and I\u2019d probably suggest most other people do likewise.",

            "content": "I love how Tarkovsky's movies are like these meditative pieces of art. He was always so patient and graceful with his camera movements. Wherever that seaside town is, it's beautiful. Very calm. Andrei was a very introspective and philosophical guy and here in this movie you can see it clear as day. His movies are always deeper than what's really on the surface. Always talking about life, death, the meaning of life, being born again, love. \n\nQuite the monologue that old man gives. Talking about how civilization and progress has been built on acts of doing evil instead of good. This almost seems like it's a movie about ghosts living in the present world. That one girl, Maria, looks like she's a Holocaust survivor. She almost looks like she could be a ghost. There's moments that are very unsettling whether it's the mood and atmosphere that's being created or the subject material that being presented. And sometimes both at the same time. Like with the little boy sleeping in his bed. \n\nThe use of greyscale in the movie makes it very haunting to watch at times. Gives the impression that these people are ghosts roaming on land but have no idea that they are in fact ghosts and are dead. The pacing of the movie can be off-putting. And more so are the characters movements and pace. It's almost like they're detached or aren't human. It's a very gloomy and somber movie. That bitch started acting all hysterical and crazy. I'd knock that bitch right out, make her calm down. \n\nThis movie is a trip. Tarkovsky's use of sound is brilliant. The use of water and dripping. So is Maria like the virgin Mary from the bible? \n\nI've always found fire so fascinating and captivating. Like being something burn and how quickly it does it and how it ca spread so easily. It's a very uncontrollable element. Both dangerous but beautiful all at the same time. I think thought the same thing the way he's always filming fire in a poetic way. \n\nDeeeeeeeeefinitely an art film. I couldn't help but feel like it was a film made by Bergman. Especially with all the Swedish dialogue and actors. Overall, it was a very interesting movie to watch even with it's slow pace.",

Tarkovsky's vision is brave enough to be interpreted through the lense of failed and confused characters. What is this film about? The consequence of taking one's happiness for granted, the power of ritual, the fantasy of art's importance? We are given no clear answers. The blu ray I watched was not well mastered and the sound was especially compromised. It is a shame, as sound is an area that Tarkovsky films rely on heavily. I far preferred Nostalghia and Solaris which I feel are similar, both captured the surrealism of the dream state in a more convincing manner.",

This film really takes the whole arty-European-long-take thing about as far as it can possibly go. It was meant as a sort of farewell film for Tarkovsky, who died shortly after completing it. There's definitely a mournful air to the entire film. The story is about a few people living on an island off the coast of Sweden who gather for a birthday party, and then are told that nuclear armageddon will end all life on earth within the next few hours. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it definitely leaves a lot of room for interesting interpretation.

It's appropriately a film about aging and accepting death, which is communicated through Tarkovsky's haunting nuances and prolonged tracking shots. It's also one of the few films in the director's catalog that really uses dialogue to add to the tapestry as well, as the characters musings on philosophy, religion and humanity make the theme of The Sacrifice more lucid, without directly spoon-feeding the audience either. Perhaps not Tarkovsky's most notable masterpiece, but it was the ideal film for him to go out on.",
