    "summary": "Three successive family Thanksgiving dinners mark time for Hannah (Mia Farrow), her younger sisters Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest) and the men in their lives. Lee is having an affair with Hannah's husband, Elliot (Michael Caine), and trying to end her Svengali-like romance with artist Frederick (Max von Sydow). Holly is frustrated by her lack of career fulfillment and her increasing dependence on Hannah's largesse, while being courted by the hypochondriac Mickey (Woody Allen).",

            "content": "Is Hannah and Her Sisters Woody Allen's best film?  Possibly. In it, Allen covers his standard themes \u2013 existential angst, fractured relationships, the existence of God, and mortality, among others.  It is a movie filled with interesting and fully realized characters.  The cast, more expansive than usual, is filled with great actors, including the likes of Michael Caine, Mia Farrow, Diane Wiest, Carrie Fisher, and Max von Sydow.  Allen, always a great writer, is in top form, creating situations that are both poignant and hilarious, full of clever insights and thought-provoking ideas.  Allen's oeuvre is considerable and if Hannah and Her Sisters doesn't sit at the top, it's pretty darn close.",

The actors are all at their best, with Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest both giving standout, Oscar worthy performances while even Woody Allen balances his standard neurotic one.  Behind the camera, Woody Allen crafts a funny but also heartbreaking film about how three sisters and their families navigate love in their various relationships, all while bookended during two different Thanksgiving diners (thus making an appropriate holiday movie).   Great watch during Turkey season.",

After having viewed at least a couple of dozen of his films, it seems to me it's always basically the same thing:  Husband or wife or girlfriend or boyfriend or both has/have an affair and moves on or, possibly, breaks off the affair and repairs the original relationship. It's an interesting enough topic, I suppose, but it's not like there aren't lots of other stories which could be told.\n\nThis one's a classic. I re-watched it again the other night, and I enjoyed it. The Woody Allen character himself is a bit exasperating and, honestly, none of the characters is particularly compelling. Still, I enjoyed watching the story unfold, and the happy endings didn't come across as unlikely or overly cutesy. All in all, it's a nice film.",

However, of course it has the quirky love story at the end. I really enjoyed this one tho as far as keeps your interest, good dialogue, nyc setting, acting, nice plot, funny, decent characters and liked how it was uniquely broken up like a book with chapters. What I wasn't crazy about was Elliot's casting (not believable) guy is an ogre no one would do that to their sister for him (sorry not sorry). Also must woody Allen always have some old guy (Frederick) with a young woman (Lee)? Movie did make me nostalgic for that time period. One of those movies that makes u think but doesn't take itself so serious as to not be funny n entertaining-good stuff.",

The only thing that might have stopped me, might have, is - my parents would be devastated, I would have to shoot them also, first. And then I have an aunt and uncle, y'know it would have been a bloodbath.\"\n\nIt's not mile-a-minute jokes in the way that many of Allen's most prominent films are, but instead leans more heavily toward comedy-drama, in many ways a more challenging discipline. The story is a twisting web of connections that weave together distinctive characters and conflicts (though for most of the film, Allen's Mickey is off doing his own thing while the real plot happens elsewhere, which can be a bit jarring before the threads come together); the film is really best described as a quilt of subplots rather than a direct narrative revolving around the particular development of any one character. The most distinctive element of the film is its writing, with dialogue that flows and feels natural (particularly strong in casual conversation), before transitioning to soul-baring conflict. Supported by strong performances all around, the film feels authentic and convincing; these characters have faults, and that not only alright, it makes them watchable.\n\nIn an ensemble film, one of the most difficult things to do is make each character not only work, but make the audience care about them. Hannah and her Sisters is one of the few films to actually do that well. (4/5)",

He is the destroyer of a self-created genre. The writer and director Woody Allen, don't forget, is also the creator. This God like person that he carries off himself, in the entire runtime of his films; which is mostly short and crisply edited, is something everyone would envy. And it is the commanding signature vocab of his, that he spreads, injects in each and every character. Now this is sort of insanely risky. You are, as a rule, told to give each character a different voice. And here we are decades and one of the most successful careers of all time later. Allen's gift of witty humor is not a joke.\n\nHe balances the drama and humor like a champ. And this is something that previously and even now, so many have tried to achieve, but only few can get the reactions as anticipated. So how does he do that? And why can't anyone else cross that bridge as effortlessly and frequently as he does? Well, it is simple. At the back of his head, he is always aware of the theme that underlines the entire scenario, the entire film.\n\nAnd now all the jokes or elaborated sketches that are about to come will serve that purpose bits by bits. And this gradual procedure goes unnoticed for you are busy having the time of your life. You can see the grin on his face, when he jam-packs this much content in that aforementioned runtime. The result is a fast paced narration that looks like a hack job and instead is a fully functioning craftsmanship that can only be achieved by someone who is nominated for 24 Oscars. Hannah And Her Sisters might be about them, but just as any other Woody character or film, all I see his hypochondriac face.",

            "content": "Dianne Wiest is such a singular and striking actress that she is capable of stealing an entire film out from under performers as significant as Barbara Hershey and Woody Allen. She is gifted with one of her greatest roles in this film as she plays the former Cocaine addict/aspiring actress turned screenwriter Holly to perfection, earning an Academy Award in the process. There is a delightfulness to watching such a unique figure bring her touch to the material of Woody Allen as she is able to take familiar tropes within his work and make them feel new and refreshing. The film itself is a lovely exploration into the neuroses of various artistic New Yorkers and the nature of existence but it is Wiest's luminous presence that will stay in your mind long after seeing the film.\n\nSisters Hannah, Lee and Holly in addition to the various men in their lives with whom they are romantically involved. The dependable Hannah, Mia Farrow, is being cheated on by her frustrated husband Elliot, Michael Caine, who has developed a quixotic passion for her needy sister Lee, Barbara Hershey. Meanwhile, Hannah's neurotic ex-husband Mickey, Woody Allen, becomes convinced that he has various terminal illnesses and begins to believe that life is meaningless and not worth living because he will eventually die. The third sister in the family, Holly, Dianne Wiest, takes up writing after failing as an actress and rekindles her relationship with Mickey with whom she had gone on a disastrous first date. Over the years the sisters have their lives turned upside down as they are asked to question the roles they play in the lives of their loved ones and pursue new relationships and ambitions.\n\nThe film, as with many others directed by Allen, serves as a love letter to New York from the tour of architectural wonders taken by Holly, her friend and a potential love interest early on in the film to the simples shots of the rivers in Autumn. We feel Allen's affection for this place and the people that inhabit it as we realize that only in a city this big and this cultured could an array of characters so charming and colorful exist. All of the characters are in some way interested in art and we get to spend time with them as they head into trendy record stores or witness the nude portraits that have been painted of them. Part of the excitement of watching a film is having a window into the lives of others and getting to see the glamour of New York is an appealing prospect.\n\nAllen does revisit so many of his favorite tropes here as we see a couple overcome infidelity, an indecisive and flighty woman who finally lands on a career path and a character writing events from their own life into their writing, angering those around them. They feel more lively here than they do in some of his lesser works, such as You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010), with their integration feeling smoother and the delivery of his trademark dialogue having a chutzpah to it. I am glad that he chose to revisit some of this material as I think he still finds new ways to explore it and ways to view the issues that we all face in our lives at some point.\n\nThe most touching storyline in the film is that which concerns the romance between Mickey and Holly who find fulfillment and support in one another after facing rejection from others in their lives. We see both of these tortured souls go through their own trials and tribulations as Holly pursues architect David, Sam Waterston, who dumps her for her friend April, Carrie Fisher, while Mickey goes through an existential crisis. When she gets over her cocaine addiction and finds a career path that could be viable she is ready to be in a real relationship and I hadn't seen a scene as delightful as that in which she and Mickey flirt in a while. His effusive praise of her screenplay and her ecstatic reaction, such a contrast to the expressions of despair she previously held, fully sold me on their bond being strong and something that could truly last. Of course the final scene of the film is one of the best as we see that the two have endured as a couple despite the struggles they might have faced and have bright prospects on the horizon.",

So Mickey is narrating himself complaining about a spot in his back which includes brain tumor and his hearing loss thinking that he was going to kill himself. Michael Caine plays Elliot who madly in love with Hannah's sister and while he is still married to Hannah. No matter what I think, it's an treat for all of people in the world.

Here, he creates such a wonderfully simple little universe to spend time in here, as he captures the delusions of people in affairs with poignancy, hope, & (duh) humor. He even plays with the camera more than usual to great effect. If Bergman ever dabbled in screwball comedy, Hannah & Her Sisters is what we would get. Top-tier Allen.",

It's family drama, relationship drama, and even health drama. Allen tries to put a humorous spin on some of it, which works only sparingly. I often have frustration with movies of this style because it is seemingly just a bunch of scenes loosely tied together with no plot. Things just happen, people change, and relationships adapt but there seems to be no point to it all. It accurately reflects how real relationships can sometimes work, and I liked that they showed the juxtaposition of what we think versus what we do. The conversations were authentic, and the acting was sincere, but the story was aimless. I think the movie is intended more as a look at what real life is like, and that's why it was both stressful and boring. There are some scenes that kept me engaged, and I did have enough interest in the characters to wonder where they would end up. I think some people will really enjoy Hannah and Her Sisters, but it's not going to be the general public. Sadly, I tend to have a more simplistic, \"general public\" taste in film. The lack of a cohesive through-line in the script to bind the multitude of subplots together left me cold and uninterested.",

The rest really wasnt that interesting in my opinion, it's just a sappy romance movie about a love-hexagon between 6 people over 2 years, and it is not that funny, nor does it have any interesting characters, except Allen's and Max von Sydow's.\n\nAll in all, ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) is a fine film, but i expected more from Allen. Some consider this one of his finest films, i consider it a big disappointment.\n\nSorry",

The character Allen plays, should be a bit part, but he forces himself to the limelight. Michael Caine's character is entirely unsympathetic and takes up too much of the film.

Personally, I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more if it was just a drama without any comedy, but it is a Woody Allen film which always has it's Jewish jokes. After watching a few of Woody Allen's movies, this has to be some of his best work which is relevant for nowadays. Watchable!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRound-Up:\nMichael Caine put in a great performance in this movie, along with Diane West who seems slightly out of her sweet and innocent comfort zone. Mia Farrow and Barbara Hershey act the same in most of there movies so there performances weren't that surprising. Basically, it's just another one of those Woody Allen movies that deal with troubled relationships so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome.\n\nBudget: $6.4million\nWorldwide Gross: $59million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about troubled relationships and religion. 4/10",
