The first film was a claustrophobic suspenseful horror film and this is an intense action film. They are both equally entertaining. The vast majority of the special effects are convincing and realistic, my only gripe is the rear-screen projection as it looks washed-out compared to the foreground. There is so much truly stunning cinematography. Sound design continues the epic memorable trend set by the first film. The most memorable being the pulse rifle sounds. Characters are memorable and interesting except maybe Newt who can get a little annoying but overall that is a minor gripe. There are some truly awesome moments in the story that is perfectly told. The special edition is better than the theatrical version but it is very long! I love the action and evolution of the series. It is exciting and fun. I do usually prefer suspense to action. I loved most of the old-school ambitious effects. More action than horror, not a bad thing, very good action at that.",

Pushing the concept that the aliens just use people as incubators to impregnate them; all of them; kind of dilutes the horror a little bit.  It's better if you don't know what they'll do: sometimes they might eat you; sometimes they rip you apart; sometimes they rape you; sometimes they incubate you.  That's more in line with the Xenomorph of the original movie; he was unpredictable.  When you narrow the concept down to just they want you to be their surrogate; it definitely weakens the horror.",

The film is just as spine-chilling as the first one especially with rollercoaster ride of violence, thrills, and chills. The visual effects especially for the Xenomorphs were quite excellent. The costume designs were also quite nuanced and simple yet brilliant. To top it all off, Sigourney Weaver puts on a fantastic performance that can be entertaining all because of her strong-willed determinization. It's difficult to make a fantastic movie.

The editing is well done and perfectly shows the development of a plot that in my opinion is perfect. As you can guess from the title, there are many xenomorphs in addition to the queen who has an incredible design and a biological functioning that closes a large plot hole. Moving on to the characters, they were all right or wrong: the various Marines have a behavior typical of soldiers and there are those who are braver than others, Bishop is a different robot from Ash and this works very well, Newt is a smart girl and intelligent but also strong and self-confident, just like Ripley who returns to being the heroine of the story showing off even more girlpower without it being intrusive.

The entire cast, Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Jenette Goldstein, Bill Paxton (RIP), all of them, were cast perfectly and delivered such real and memorable performances. In fact, this incredible movie partly contributed to my decision years later, to join the United States Marine Corps. The direction, sound, cinematography, sets, special effects, acting, musical score, lighting and clever use of silence, were all revolutionary and contributed to the greatness of this film. You truly feel immersed in their plight of being stuck on LV-426, with an entire Xenomorph hive hunting them down. Aliens defines the sci-fi action genre and inspired many other popular franchises such as, Warhammer 40K and Starcraft. Aliens is an absolute treat and still holds up well today as a science fiction action movie. I happily recommend it.",

The special effects are amped up and improved and the action is swift paced and spread throughout the film making it a thrill ride from beginning to end.  Sigourney Weaver gives another superb performance as Ellen Ripley once again and helps add the familiarity between films that is appreciated.  The film replaces some of the more slow building atmosphere with a more action oriented ideal, but somehow manages to blend a perfect balance of action and disturbing quiet throughout.  While I loved \"Alien\" and it's a tough choice between the two, in terms of sheer entertainment I lean toward \"Aliens\".  James Cameron does everything a sequel should do and some and what he ends up with is a sequel that arguably surpasses the great original and makes for one of the best 1-2 punches of science fiction/horror films the cinema has ever given us!",

The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here.

            "content": "Aliens is considered a classic, but 35 years after its release it's long since become evident that it only used to be one, and that those who still urge to give it top ratings, and think it's one of the 'best films of all times', are fanatically affected by a romantic nostalgia of what ones hit them when this film was true state of the art. If this were a real classic it should create a sense of timelessness, but if there's anything Aleins doesn't do it's materializing as up to date. Sadly this is not only due to bad hairstyles, silly jargon, costumes and lots of technical effects, as well as some pathetic efforts to seem authentically futuristic and simultaneously avoid being parodic. With one certain exception, everything is so incredibly 1980's that it makes Star Trek in comparison appear as much more authentic and realistic when it comes to set artistic technological concepts and character appearances. Aliens supposedly taking place in the year 2279 and Star Trek some 200 years later is then taken into consideration. Only during the first half hour there are so many locigal flaws and even more indicating factors that this visually was made within a certain decade, that it's not even silly, it's embarassing. On top of it all, several of the characters are simply absurd to the extent of comical, and some of the acting performances are equally poor and basically exaggerated. It's getting better as these characters disappear from the story. Only the three actors playing Ripley, Newt and Bishop deliver approvable acting, occasionally very good. However, there is one outstanding exception to it all, and it's probably also what has made this film still worth mentioning as highly influential. The alien monster and the visual effects created to make it come alive are forever brilliant and deserve the label timeless. Sadly, however creepy and cliffhanging it gets, as a drama this film is not very remarkable.",

This one is not a bad movie by any means but the key thing I took into my first viewing was that many considered it superior to the original, which I had felt was absolutely perfect. There have been very, very few truly successful imitators of Alien since its release but there have been dozens that took the individual facets that made Aliens pretty good and did them better. They did a good job at making a legend out of Ripley, creating likable supporting characters and being different enough from Alien to be worth watching; I can't fault them for going the nonstop action route regardless how much I liked the relative calm of the first movie. The issue I had was that for the last half of the movie they devoted as little screentime as possible to advancing the plot, instead maximizing the time they could dedicate to having guys shoot at & get killed by the aliens. The result became a sort of blur of action sequences that have melted together in my memory until they unveiled the alien queen & it finally became clear that we were getting somewhere. The good certainly outweighs the bad here, but the notion that this is equal to or superior than the original just does not compute for me. Looking forward to the derided third installment!",

            "content": "9.5/10. While 'Aliens' and it's predecessor different beasts all together, this sequel successfully channels the horror of the original while recontextualizing it in a blockbuster action package. There's no slow burn atmosphere building to be found here, Ridley Scott's attention to detail in every frame is missing. But James Cameron does excellent work of his own, eschewing meticulous artistry for popcorn munching, pulse-pounding splendor, and cerebral subtlety for thrilling, unbound entertainment value. This isn't lowest-common-denominator fair; the action is grounded in a compelling turn from Sigourney Weaver who becomes at once the most sympathetic and relentlessly kick-butt action star of the 80's. While Sly and Arnold may have a higher kill count, neither have played heroes more grounded or vulnerable, and certainly not while bringing fire, determination, and a will to survive so evocatively to their roles. Weaver reprises her roll as Ripley and is given a compelling story; having been found nearly 60 years after the disaster aboard the Nostromo, Ripley deals with PTSD from the event and tries adjusting to a world she does not recognize and without the daughter whom she was not there to raise. She is haunted and broken, but as she returns to the planet where the Xenomorphs where originally found and where there is now an abandoned human colony, she joins a group of marines who quickly realize they are in over their heads with these creatures. The marines, who initially feel more like basic writers-room templates, round into fully-fledged characters as their training fails to protect them. Bill Paxton, who plays Pvt. Hudson, exemplifies this: on the surface his performance may feel a little cheesy, but he honestly nails the dopey, ubermasculine meat head who is horrified, panicked, and useless when his powers of violence are blunted by the alien threat. While his is the most obvious example, the other marines reveal more about their personalities as they deal with the transition from soldier to survivor, becoming sympathetic characters that make their trials feel that much more personal. Weaver, however, rises above the supporting cast as she resurrects Ripley from the ashes of her trauma. Ripley is a survivor who grows through her experiences where others would wilt. Weaver imbues a range of emotion into Ripley, from fear and rage to resolve and love. This is the most dynamic action-hero of the decade played by one of its most dynamic stars. Where there were moments in the original that the Xenomorph broke my suspension of disbelief by clearly looking like a person in a costume (I particularly recall the \"jump scare\" where the alien reaches out for a hug while squatted in a vent in the fetal position), they looked nothing less than terrifying in ‘Aliens.' The special effects and set pieces are incredible through and through, though there is a little bit lost in some of the art design that was there in the original. It might be that nothing can quite compare to the cavernous, Giger designed ship that the Nostromo crew explored. We are no less treated to variety – from the space station to the colony and finally the hive, great care was put into the locations, set and costume designs. This movie is wildly entertaining: it is packed with suspense and action as the heroes fight for survival but is elevated with great acting and directing that puts characters, themes, and story telling on as high a pedestal as any other aspect of the film. As great an action thriller as ‘Alien' is a horror film, ‘Aliens' is an influential and infinitely watchable triumph.",

            "content": "How is this my favorite movie ever? Let me count the ways....\n\n1) It was the first R-rated film I ever saw in theaters at the age of 11 - hadn't seen the first one...this scared the shit out of me, loved it! Later it came on video, rewatched it, and had nightmares....still had to rewatch it again and again. :o \n\n2) The underrated screenwriting acumen of James Cameron. Nobody sets up an action/sci fi epic as effectively does - the first 25 minutes is a masterclass in reintroducing us to Ripley's story (special edition including that crucial scene about her daughter), does an efficient job of future world building with minimal flash, introduces us to all of the new characters (Hudson's jitteriness, Vasquez' bravado, Bishop's inherent decency) in broad but effective strokes, and of course sets up the best Chevkov's Gun EVER. ;) \n\n3) Sigourney Weaver's lead performance which deservedly garnered her an Oscar nomination.  Yes the fact that a woman was leading an action blockbuster like this was groundbreaking in itself but we run the gamut of emotions with her...how completely freaked and isolated she initially is, how she eventually asserts herself into a leader when no one else steps up, how the personal stakes are raised for her as she gets to know Newt, and how it's more than just a maternal instinct that drives her to go back into that thermal processor.  In the back of her mind, she still wants to take this xenomorph thing head-on and you see it with that pissed off head turn she gives in that initial silent showdown with the Queen. 😠 It makes ZERO strategic sense for her to stir shit up by flaming those eggs.  The whole place is about to blow up anyway and she needs to get out of there with Newt but....she sees one open up and she has just HAD IT!  Weaver nails this moment with that glance and probably the only reason it hasn't been cited more in the legacy of this film is #5.\n\n4) James Horner's all-timer musical score for this film - yes it reminds us of other scores he had already done including 'Wrath of Khan just a few years prior but he still makes his mark with this story....those violins that just SCRAPE suddenly when there's a sudden movement, it's essential to what makes this such a thrilling ride.\n\n5) \"Get away from her your bitch!\" Punctuation to THE best fist-pump moment in the history of cinema. :) \n\n6) The technical wizardry of Stan Winston and the rest of the effects team in basically utilizing little more than half a dozen fully completed xenomorph puppets and/or suits....and convincing us that it's an overwhelming army.  And the full-size marionette used to portray the Alien Queen...it was operated by about eight men and remains thoroughly convincing! (No wonder I had nightmares)\n\n7) The Irreplaceable Michael Biehn. He apparently was cast at the last possible minute as Hicks and thank the lord because his hyper-focused wiry presence grounds this movie as much as he did for The Terminator just three years prior. \n\n8) Co-ed locker rooms. :) Yes Paul Verhoeven would really take this concept to its Apex in future films but that post-pod wake-up sequence when we are introduced to the Colonial Marines earns its place in the anals of the best introductory scenes for a rag-tag bunch of heroes.  It's hard NOT to like these folks - Vasquez, Spunkmeyer, Hudson, Bishop, Apone, Dietrich, Frost -  and there's no Altman or PTA-like camera or sound trickery (not that there's anything wrong with that) necessary to introduce us to each of them in such a short amount of time.  Just simple, confident storytelling aided by spot-on casting. \n\n8) TENSION...sustained tension for pretty much the last 80 or so minutes of the movie, it's pretty impressive. As far as I'm concerned, Cameron and crew pull off with this movie what acclaimed filmmakers from Chris Nolan to Rian Johnson to Edgar Wright couldn't pull off nearly as well: a fully satisfying Fourth Act that doesn't feel tacked on but actually enhances the movie.  Does it make much logistical sense for the 'Queen to be able to hitch a ride like that with them back to the Sulaco? Not really if you think about it but who cares when it's SO satisfying.",

            "content": "A far cry from Ridley Scott's original classic Alien.\n\nJames Cameron's science-fiction action thriller Aliens (1986) begs the question: what more could you want other than action and aliens? Well, how about a story. James Cameron's script is full of corny 80's one-liners, dumb one-note characters, action cliches, boring set-up, all culminating in a few exciting action sequences that are not as intense as any scene from Alien. James Cameron is a poor man's Ridley Scott and Aliens proves it. I will always prefer Alien to Aliens, but if you're an action fan more than a horror or sci-fi person, then perhaps you'll love Aliens. I just felt like for all of Cameron's smoke and steam filled direction with cool practical effects mostly, he just doesn't compare to Scott. I was never riveted, afraid, or emotionally engaged either.\n\nAlso, why did James Cameron bother to write in an explanation to the unsolved mysteries in Alien? Did we need the Xenomorph Queen to justify the eggs, especially since this doesn't really lead to anything other than the final action scene. I love the Queen's design and impressive puppet that took 14 puppeteers to operate. Most of the effects hold up with a few awkward green screens among all the mini models and revamped cars and ships.\n\nI don't find Cameron's characters interesting. They are all machismo without personality or charm. We get Sigourney Weaver's excellent heroine Ripley back for a less nuanced performance with intelligence, but she's just there to kill xenomorphs like the rest of the obnoxious space marines. Weaver did a commendable job, seeing as there's barely a script here with any story or interesting dialogue. It's Weaver's heartfelt interactions with a scared child called Newt that are tender and emotional.\n\nYet, Carrie Henn is not very good, often grating with her constant screams, which is strange for an apparently clever child who survived on her own presumably without alerting aliens in numerous situations. At least, Sigourney Weaver can carry Aliens to the all too familiar end with Cameron just returning to Ridley Scott's blueprints from Alien.\n\nMichael Biehn is pretty cool as Hicks, but his character is oddly dumb for second in command. Paul Reiser is perfectly loathsome as Burks, but he's barely memorable as the greedy capitalist James Cameron would grow into one day. Lance Henriksen is excellent as the android Bishop. His robotic dialogue and artificially hurt feelings are interesting. I liked him the most after Sigourney Weaver. Bill Baxton is truly terrible as the constantly whining and panicked Hudson. William Hope is apt as Gorman, but he's also annoying at times considering he's the leader of a military operation with no real plan. \n\nI have a major issue with Aliens as James Cameron made the absurd choice to cast a white Jewish woman named Jenette Goldstein in brownface to portray a hispanic soldier named Vasquez. She puts on a terrible latina accent and does the same idiotic machismo act as all the other moronic military space navy guys. Al Matthews, one of the only black characters, gets nothing to do as Sergeant, but he gives an admirable quick performance. Mark Rolston is pretty lame as the overly macho Drake, who does nothing too. Ricco Ross feels like another poorly written character that's just like the rest of the crew. I could not even name half of these characters without having to look them up as they're mostly forgettable.\n\nRay Lovejoy's editing is too full of jump cuts to appear fast paced, but I actually found Aliens much slower and more boring with a dull slow pace. Especially since Aliens is 137 minutes and certainly feels about a half hour too long. Adrian Biddle's shaky camera work is not very remarkable as cinematographer, but there are the occasional neat shots in wide or close-up confined spaces.\n\nI feel sorry for my favorite composer, James Horner, only getting about 4 days to rush out this forgettable score that isn't as compelling or creepy as Jerry Goldsmith's original score for Alien. James Horner is normally a phenomenal composer, so I'm pretty disappointed that Cameron didn't give him the proper respect to allow Horner adequate time to write Aliens' music.\n\nIn short, for all the explosions and gunfire, Aliens is just not as entertaining and timeless as everyone praises this one for James Cameron is just not as great a director as Ridley Scott. Nor will he ever be.",

            "content": "After enjoying Back to the Future more than I had expected, I decided to watch another 80s blockbuster, and oh my Lord did Aliens blow me away. Unlike Alien, an isolated, monster pick-off cast one-by-one set in space, Aliens ups the action, ups the effects, and ups the thrills. I always appreciated the series' vision — not steampunk, not quite cyber-punk, and not 2001: A Space Odyssey-like where everything is efficient and sheen, Aliens has a gritty feel while including the technological and scientific advancements of a space-set movie. 57 years after the first film, we find our heroine, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), in stasis, i.e. asleep in pod where she doesn't age, with her orange cat, Jonesy! (100%, 10/10, 100 gold stars for him.) Somehow, Ellen's lawyer (Paul Reiser), who is also a rep for the corp she works for (?), convinces her to go to an isolated colony to investigate their lack of communication. To be honest, this was the weakest part of the movie, as there really was no reason for Ellen to go on this mission, but hey, it puts our badass protag back into conflict. Accompanied by a team of meathead Marines, Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) delivering the famous, cracking \"That's game over, man! It's game over!\" line, the team starts on a rescue mission, which quickly becomes an alien-killing mission. Corporate greed, grief, the loyalty of artificial intelligence, and motherhood all intertwine the plot beautifully. But what so many came to see were right there in the title: The aliens, dammit. I always loved their hellish design and here we get a lot of them. Their ability to basically unfurl from the wall, scale the ceiling, their acid-blood, spear-whip tails, and, of course, those Russian-doll mouths make them delightfully terrifying and a formidable opponent. This movie is a practical effects junkie's wet dream. Those last 20–30 minutes, full of fire, alarms, explosions, and the \"Queen\" are to die for. I mean, it's just prime action-movie watching. The practical effects during scenes with the Queen, from her laying eggs to tearing apart Bishop (Lance Henriksen), are incredible. But most noteworthy, what probably comes to mind while discussing this series the most (only after the famous \"chestplosion\" of Alien), is the melee between Big Momma and Ripley in the loader suit. \"Get away from her, you bitch!\" is such a good line to ring the bell. While I could've gone for a maneuver other than \"space ejection,\" as it was the tactic used in the first film, I think it served the plot best by showing Bishop, an android, saving Newt (Carrie Henn) from being shot into space. Ripley questions Bishop's allegiance to humanity early on, and it is further questioned when he is missing at the pick-up point. But even severed in half — his white innards dangling on the ground — he manages to be a hero. This franchise gave us one of the first female, sci-fi heroes and is a pillar of the genre. While James Cameron has become somewhat of a punchline with his many… many Avatar sequel updates, Aliens is a reminder of what the man is capable of.",

It's a logical step too, as the only way to increase the stakes from the first film would be to increase the number of monsters. Some essential elements remain, such as the perfectly terrifying aliens, an intriguing android, and a tough as ever Ripley (Sigourny Weaver). Like the first in the series, this film is suspenseful, but in a slightly different way because, just as the aliens are more in number, the humans they are attacking possess greater skills to defend themselves. These characters  must also contend with an added difficulty that didn't exist in Alien: a little girl to protect. This responsibility brings out a side in Ripley's character that wasn't at all evident in the first film which is that she's a mother. This is revealed in an important scene in the Special Edition, which enhances our understanding of Ripley's maternal instincts. The Special Edition also features unnecessary scenes that break the tension of the film by clumsily returning to the exquisitely creepy crashed ship from Alien and displaying the boring goings on in the colony, a place that should have remained mysterious and uncharted by the audience until the marines arrived. This just goes to show the danger of going back and tampering with an already successful film especially in a franchise like Alien where less is more suspenseful and scary.",

And James Horner's soundtrack for Aliens is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time, the adrenaline from the Aliens soundtrack that I got was amazing. Also, the battle with the Alien Queen was amazing but they kept it realistic and didn't go crazy with it which I like. The ambiance is very creepy too and the movie kept me on edge most of the time which is what I like. The battle scenes between the Marines and the Aliens were very tense and fun to watch too.

Look at the clothes.  There are superficialities that say 'I am in space', but otherwise, they are just regular street clothes. Ripley is wearing Reeboks.  Vasquez is a homey with a teardrop tattoo Spanglishing it up.  The company execs all have regular suits, and Reiser's evil yupee might have well been in 'Die Hard'.  They just took America from the 1980s and put it in space.  The plot, too, despite all the space stuff, is just a mom fighting for her kid.\nWeaver is good in this film, although I don't think great.  She makes a pretty good normal person who rises to the occasion, and the action scenes are good.  Her 'getting angry' acting kind of falls flat though.\nI am going to Add that Bill Paxton does a GREAT job being a weasel.  To this DAY, when shit goes south in my life, I quote the MAN: 'we're all gonna die, man!', 'game over man, game over!' and 'why don't we put HER in charge?'\nThe final showdown, while full of suspense and well done, goes on way too long.  By the time the monster hitches a ride up to the ship, I am rolling my eyes.  And the forklift fight scene was really good, but wasn't there a GUN lying around somewhere on the WARSHIP?",

Aliens and Alien are so stylistically different that it feels almost unfair to compare them.  As for me I personally like Alien more.  Aliens' set design and shot set ups aren't as strong as Alien but Aliens makes up for that with more Xenomorph action and fantastic special effects.  As for the characters Ripley is just as awesome as she was in Alien, as for the new characters they take a bit of time to warm up to but after a while you really root for them to make it off of the planet alive.  One of my biggest problems with Alien is that when you saw the Xenomorph completely it looked too much like someone in a costume that however is fixed in Aliens; the Xenomorphs move like an other worldly creature and as for the alien queen the effects are some of the best I've ever seen in film.  One of the scariest scenes in the movie is the scene where Newt and Ripley are locked in the medical bay with the facehuggers; it is a superb scene that reminds me how I feel when there is a spider in my room.   Aliens is a very action packed, well made and acted film that delivers as a sequel and it stands on its own.",

Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package. From the point when the opening half-hour of exposition ends, and the real movie begins, Cameron barely gives viewers a chance to catch their breaths or ease their grips on their armrests as he plunges his characters from one dire situation to the next. This is one of those rare motion pictures that involves the audience so completely in the story that we're as worn out at the end as our on-screen counterparts.  For fans of the Alien series, Aliens represented an unqualified triumph, exceeding the expectations of the most optimistic faithful.

As a result, what he has pulled off in here is almost impossible, living up to the expectation of an already cultural phenomenon, and for me, it exceeds the previous venture by Ridley Scott. And I only feel that it exceeds the expectations, is because it is incredibly difficult for the writer and director James Cameron to fill in on already infomercial pamphlet. And if you look at it properly, actually there is nothing new that he brings out plot wise in this chapter, it is another same adventure, they name it so unenthusiastically.\n\nBut it is the hypnotizing procedure of Cameron and self-realization of what it is. He is addressing the absurdity of the plot by not mocking it but acknowledging it seriously. And after the guns are loaded, premise set, his manipulation as a visual storyteller is extremely inspiring. Take the set pieces for instance. He has already painted these missions like some war invasion and with it he has drawn out the obligation over necessary elements.\n\nLiterally, unloading those responsibilities on his characters, he is stretching the claustrophobic and exhausting aspect of the job by confiding them in tiny set pieces. Most of the time, the set pieces are really small or are either have multiple characters roaming about, giving them less room to full flex their muscles and fight at their will. And even if he puts them on big pieces, he is focusing on their close up, where they are sweating and worn out by this whole fiasco. Mind you, Cameron hasn't even touched the fictional part of his storyline and you are already vulnerable. Aliens remains a classic, for no one after this focused on the day to day issues that human behavior exerts on each other; which is more horrifying than anything.\n",

Maybe it's that each iteration had a different director rather than being the sole vision of one director? I'm not sure. That being said, I do appreciate \"Aliens\" for the direction in which James Cameron has taken it. On the filmmaking side of things, I think that he did an incredible job and really furthered the genre in his venture. The sound design was incredible and definitely affected my viewing for the better (despite still not being a big fan). I enjoyed the moments of silence, as well as the swells of sound. I liked that whenever an alien was about to appear, or a moment of tension was building - there was seemingly so much silence. In watching the film, it felt like you could hear a pin drop from miles and miles away. When Cameron would then have the alien appear it was like this cascade of sound hit you all at once and I couldn't help but jump a little in my seat. It is moments like that that make the film so iconic and make me enjoy it maybe just a little bit. Having seen \"Alien\" and then having this be my first time seeing \"Aliens\", it was very cool to see the progression in sound design this go around!",

Alien was an incredible space horror film. Aliens is a generic, over-the-top action movie.\n\nThe acting is horrendous in Aliens, as is the majority of the script. I absolutely hated the space marines with the burning passion of a thousand suns, Hudson (Bill Paxton) and Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) being the worst offenders. I literally wanted all of them to die as soon as possible.\n\nIt is conveniently revealed that Ripley had a daughter, a fact that - to the best of my knowledge - was never even discussed in Alien. This just to make the bond between her and Newt (Carrie Henn) supposedly more meaningful. I'll take Jonesy over Newt any day.\n\nSuffice to say that Aliens is a huge disappointment in my eyes, and begins the obvious descent into mediocrity that the rest of the series appears to have wallowed in for the past 30 years.",

Cameron came with the idea to transform this in a \"Rambo in space\", full of thick Marines so caricatural and grotesque that you wonder sometimes if this is parody. The worse is that, to be able to maintain this battle on the length of a film, Cameron had to weaken and banalize the Aliens, who become ordinary monsters that can be beaten with a classic weapon. You have to see how strangely slow and harmless they become, for Ripley to be able to slaughter a bunch of them on her way to salvation, all that with a kid on her arms.\nFor the rest, the film is well executed, technically impressive, and the storyline between Ripley/Newt involving Ripley's deceased daughter (thats in the Director's cut) is quite moving.

The directing by James Cameron was really good and different from Ridley Scott’s directing with the first Alien movie. This movie also does a pretty good job with actually adding some humor into the mix. The action sequences were intense and suspenseful. The special/visual effects in this movie was even more impressive than the first movie (but the first one did have outstanding effects too). There was only one scene of the movie that felt very fake to me. This movie was definitely a mix of a James Cameron film and an Alien Movie, but with that made again a really good Alien sequel.

            "content": "Which one is better? Alien or Aliens? Who cares? Both are awesome movies. Aliens is a movie that shows that tonal shifts aren't always bad. While the first film was a horror-thriller about people having to ensure they make it through the end of the movie before the uninvited passenger murders their asses, this movie is more of an action movie which is all about Ripley becoming a badass with Sigourney Weaver inhabiting the role and no longer being the character who was the last person people expected to survive the first film. The special effects have aged remarkably well much like the first movie. No CGI. Everything was really there and I agree that the Alien Queen is hands-down the BEST animatronic in a movie. Personally, I believe that the movie is a build-up to that awesome pre-ass kicking one-liner. The action sequences are amazing. Rather than blowing something up every ten minutes, we instead have to patiently wait for the chaos to come, ESPECIALLY if you're watching the director's cut. And when it appears, it's amazing. Maybe I misjudged you, James Cameron since I thought Terminator was good yet overrated and I hated Avatar the first time I saw it. I might give the latter a second chance one day. I haven't watched it in years. Deep down, Aliens is also a story about motherly instinct. The Alien Queen is essentially just pissed that humans are murdering her babies and Ripley is essentially being a surrogate mother to the accent-challenged Newt so that she could be the mother she failed to be for her own daughter. An original draft of the script is really harsh with it by going to the Interstellar Academy of Outliving Your Kids. Watch the disc with the special features on it. You'll see what I mean. If you enjoyed Alien, you'll be blown away by Aliens with its action sequences, memorable characters and remarkable non-CG special effects that stand the test of time.",

James Cameron's direction was superb, the music by James Horner was great (he was nominated for the Best Original Score Oscar), the settings/visual effects were just as great compared to \"Alien\", & the action went well with the horror elements in this science fiction film (although I initially thought the action overshadowed the horror, which had made me feel dismayed until I saw the film & was pleased that they mixed well).\nAlthough I still prefer \"Alien\", I will say \"Aliens\" really was a great film & a magnificent sequel!",

            "content": "With the impending cinema release of Alien Convenant and as another example in the Classic Movies Revisited segment of this blog I decided to give Aliens a view and see how well this James Cameron directed classic has aged!\nThe good news, as with most cinematic masterpieces is that it has aged quite well. Obviously, movie special effects have improved in leaps and bounds since the mid 80's (ironically at the hands of James Cameron himself) but the movie itself proves that  tale, tension and atmosphere together with a powerful central performance by Sigourney Weaver, shows that classic film making is timeless!\nIn this sequel to the equally impressive Alien, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) accompanies a crew to the moon from the first film which although it has been colonised, contact has been lost. On arrival, loaded with heavy firepower and a military crew, Ripley discovers a sole survivor, a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) and what follows is an all out bloodbath as she battles the aliens that threaten the crew and more importantly Newt's survival.\nThe first half of the movie is quite similar to the first Alien film, in that the tension is slowly built by Cameron before an explosive second half sees the pace crank up dramatically and what follows is movie genre pick n' mix with action, horror, drama and war all evident in the lead up to a dramatic finale!\nThis film also saw the beginning of the careers of some excellent actors in the shape of Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Paul Reiser and indeed the strong performances of the cast add extra weight to already solid production. \nHowever, as in Alien, it is Weaver who steals the show, putting in a tough and smart turn as the formidable Ellen Ripley. \nOverall, Aliens puts the myth that a sequel can never be as good as the original to bed, and is deserved of repeated view if only to demonstrate how a blockbuster big budget movie can entertain the masses yet still have so much more attached than just eye-popping special effects.

            "content": "WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW! No wonder why I'm even experiencing Alien in general. Aliens however is an example of thrill-fest. James Cameron had to direct it and I gotta say, he's one of my favourite directors. Sure Gale Anne Hurd had to work with him just like The Terminator and the sequel Judgment Day. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ellen Ripley and a whole cast are out to face the aliens in the movie called Aliens. Do I even need to tell you how scary it is? It is scarier as each other. Okay, not AS scary though but I think Ridley Scott's version is scary. Now it's all action and horror and the aliens don't even come after an hour. All right, previously on Alien, Ripley is asleep on a ship and one of the men here had to bring her to the hospital and she had a nightmare about meeting the president (which I didn't know) named Burke played by Paul Reiser and has an alien inside her. But she knows it was just a dream. Now she has to join the army to face those vicious looking aliens in the quarantine. There's some good cast in this like Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and many more. Lance Henriksen's character, Bishop is kind of an android, Michael Biehn's character, Hicks is a shooter of Aliens and Bill Paxton's character, Hudson is dumb, tough like Hicks and he can cracks some one-liners. Course, Paul Reiser's character, Burke doesn't have guns, he's the expert of an alien situation. There are some scenes when Ripley and the soldiers getting ready like in the war and you have a sergeant telling them to move it like killers. That is an awesome scene. I'm sure you can get a fun out of this thrill ride and get horrified by the look of the aliens the way they move and the way they hide like walls. Now that's the scary part! Still it is awesome when you think about it. If it wasn't awesome when you've playing a videogame from it and get horrified from the aliens and die! I don't know about you but I think Burke is the one who let those people die from impregnation from the aliens. So they will have to find the aliens with the thingy-midgigy to know where they are but they're on the ceiling and take them down. The child named Newt who is the survivor got kidnapped by an alien and now Ripley has to find her and escape from the alien fortress of the alien queen which I think the scene is scary as hell. Where Ripley and Newt is in the fortress where the alien queen lives and where she lays eggs. But the scariest part for me is that when she wakes up she and her aliens are here kill Ripley and Newt but Ripley flamethrows the eggs and escapes. That is the scary but quiet moment. But now the mission is over which is not because Bishop got stabbed by the alien queen making him covered in white blood and Ripley uses the mechanical thing and says the memorable line which I think Dad said before she said it is ''Get away from her, you b£$%h!'' Woaho! I couldn't believe it! So the alien queen is dead, all the aliens are dead, the soldiers are dead apart from Dwayne Hicks and Ripley, Newt and Bishop are safe and sound. Now let me talk about the toughest one for me and that's Bill Paxton. Bill Paxton died this year which is kind of depressing much like all celebrity deaths from complications of heart surgery in February 2017. No wonder what is world coming to. He did say a line which I think I've heard from a videogame called Splashdown 2 Rides Gone Wild where Andy Pierce says the line called ''Game over, man. It's game over!'' and when I find out as an teenager, Bill had said it. And this time he says: ''That's it, man. Game over, man. Game over! What the f£$k are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?'' Sigourney Weaver's acting is just phenomenal. I mean, when you look at her acting, this is the kind of actress who really does serious roles really well, and yeah I know other actors and actresses do it. But when you look at the film in acting-wise, that is the purpose of the movie that will keep you interest and they will do it well. The directing from James Cameron is just fantastic no matter what. The spacial effects on the aliens are so fantastic and great especially the backgrounds which I've noticed are done pretty well. But I think this is the only action horror movie that will have an Oscar nomination for Best Actress from Sigourney Weaver which is an impressive move and an impressive feat. Trust me, if I ever watch the Oscars that will have a nomination for Best Action Film and Best Horror Film, this will be the perfect example. Fantastic movie, fantastic effects and also fantastic film making from Gale Anne Hurd and James Cameron.",

Ridley Scott passes this movie to James Cameron to direct this second movie. Ridley Scott made a smart choice not to involve himself in any contracts making him have to direct movies like Alien vs Predator. When I saw this movie I had seen the movies in this order: Alien, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant. I loved the series. The first movie is a slow building master piece, and the two new installments are faster and featuring more effects. I liked all of them. Then I saw Aliens, and I was blown away.\n      This is still a slow building movie, like the first one. The first hour of the movie is just sheer character development, suspense building, and plot setups. And just like the first one, I like it. Despite\n having a brand new director, this movie did a lot of the same things as the original- and I love it. But when this movie gets going, it gets going and doesn't stop. I liked it a lot better than the first movie because the original didn't really feel as suspenseful as this one. It reminds me a lot of Die Hard, the characters just never get a break, and when you think it's finally over there's more complications.\n       The performances are great as well. Sigourney Weaver does amazing in this movie, and really captures the suspense that the script supplies. I also liked the child actor as Newt, she was one of the best child actors I've seen in a movie. The creature performers also do really well, the alien feels very realistic.\n       Like I mentioned earlier, this movie does not give its characters a break. While this did feel repetitive of Alien at first, it overdid the original so much that it wasn't repetitive any more. The mother alien towards the end is super scary and awesome. The execution of this movie is brilliant and terrifying.\n       Overall, this movie is horrifying, well performed, well directed, and exilerating. It starts out suspenseful and slow building, but after that it's non-stop. The characters are likeable, the aliens are scary and amazing, and this movie is a must watch!",

The music by James Horner is absolutely amazing and fits the tone of this film very well. The acting from everyone is also really good, and that's thanks to James Cameron doing a good job directing this movie. I will say that I highly recommend the Special Edition of this movie because it contains a lot of scenes that never made it into the theatrical version (and that's what makes this movie even better in my opinion). So in conclusion, Aliens (1986) is an awesome movie sequel, and just an overall awesome movie period.

            "content": "Say what you will about James Cameron, but he's got a pretty great track record as it relates to successful movies.  Realistically speaking, I think he may be the most financially successful filmmaker of all time.  His films, on a worldwide basis, have grossed $6 billion.  Actually, now that I check my information, Spielberg is the most financially successful filmmaker of all time, as his movies have made a combined $9 billion.  Cameron's is more impressive when you take into consideration the fact that he has made just SEVEN movies in his career.  That's almost a billion per movie.  Granted, those numbers are misleading considering that Titanic made $2.19 billion and Avatar made $2.78 billion.  So more than half of those $6 billion is from just two movies, which is an insane statistic.  Cameron has his faults as a filmmaker, but there's no denying he's always been at the forefront for innovation in special effects and new film techniques.  But I digress, that's neither here nor there, I just felt like starting out with that.  Having said all of that, on to this film.  And I'm gonna start off with something that might be controversial to some, but Alien and Aliens is the greatest one-two punch in horror film franchise history.  It might be controversial to some, but there's really no debate to me in any way, shape or form.  And, yes, I am, in fact, including Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 in that discussion.  I really liked Evil Dead, but I didn't think ever reached the great category.  I felt that it fell just a little bit short of that.  Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite horror movies of all time, so there you have it.  Having watched Alien a week and a half ago, I was aware that its sequel, this film, was a more action heavy affair when compared to the atmospheric and tense-filled original.  I don't know why that, in my head, already created a scenario where this movie just wouldn't be as good as Alien.  Just because a horror sequel (or any sequel for that matter) relies more on action than its first installment does not instantly make it a worse film.  I think this is an assumption that most of us would, wrongly, make.  It's not necessarily the most fair way to head into a movie.  It really isn't.  But, and I don't wanna say I was surprised, this film is pretty fucking great.  While both films take place in the same universe, with the same lead character and the same villains, the similarities end there.  The original was a more claustrophobic and contained experience.  It built up dread through the usage of its atmosphere and the element of surprise, you never knew where the xenomorph would appear in.  He could be in the next room, or in the air duct, or right above you.  That made the xenomorph in the original seem more terrifying.   This movie opens things up, taking place on terraformed colony where the alien eggs and facehugger were discovered in the first film.  The film focuses on Ripley, duh, a group of colonial marines sent to investigate this colony (that has 60-70 families living in it) as no transmission has been received from them for a long time.  I will say that the first half or so of the movie, maybe slightly less than half, is a slow-burn.  Building up to the first appearance of the xenomorph.  It's not a dread-filled as the original, but they do a good job regardless.  I love that when the xenomorphs do appear, and the shit hits the fan for the marines, you're not exactly what happened, how it happened and who actually died.  It's very disorienting.  And I can imagine that, if I was in a wartime situation and the enemy took us by surprising, it'd feel similar to this.  You really don't know what happened during and it's only after the fact, when you've had time to regroup and catch your breath, where you try to figure out what happened and how.  And when the movie does get going, it really doesn't stop with its intensity and visceral attack on your sense.  That's one of the many different things when compared to the original, the film is much more conventionally intense.  The use of the word 'conventionally' might seem like a negative to some, but what I mean is the fact that they throw so much more at you than the original movie and it's pretty fucking great.  The xenomorphs are still terrifyingly designed.  But this is where I have some problems with the film.  The xenomorphs are greatly designed and everything, but they're dispatched of so easily by the marines and Ripley that it takes some of their original effectiveness away from them.  They still do some really cool stuff with them, like running through the air ducts, but some of the scare factor is taken away from them.  Of course, the xenomorphs are really just the set-up for the queen, the one who's laying the eggs, and her eventual showdown with Ripley.  And, really, the film is about one simple theme and that is motherhood.  Ripley takes care of a little girl who survived the attack on her colony.  She grows attached to her and, naturally, wants to protect her from these evil motherfuckers.  The queen, on the other hand, is trying to protect her own children.  Yes, these children are using the colonists as hosts to create more of these xenomorphs, but they're still her children.  The climactic battle between the queen and Ripley boils down to that.  The queen just wants revenge for Ripley's destruction of her eggs via flamethrower.  She's not doing it just because, she's a pissed-off mother, just like Ripley is a pissed-off mother protecting Newt.  The metaphor isn't subtle, but it is very well done.  And Sigourney Weaver is tremendous here, she really fucking is.  She was so great that she got an Academy Award nomination for her performance.  Yes, Weaver got nominated for a HORROR movie.  Well, a horror/action/war film, but still.  This might be her best performance ever, though Weaver has always had a very strong track record.  You know, I've always complained about the Resident Evil movies being more action than horror.  What I mean by that is that they sacrifice the horror elements, there's nothing even close to remotely scary about those movies, in order to make a, more marketable, violent action flick.  But this film proves that you can make a movie that's equal parts horror and action.  Again, the xenomorphs are still greatly designed, which means that they would scare people and there's plenty of shooting and explosions in the film to satisfy action fans.  THIS is how you combine these two genres and I'm surprised that the Resident Evil film franchise has learned absolutely nothing from this flick.  Don't know what else to say about this movie.  The cast is full of memorable characters, great action and great in-your-face horror.  The debate will always be whether Alien or this movie is better.  And, to me, there's no real debate to be had.  I think both movies are equally as great for completely different reasons.  But I can sort of see how some people who loved the original flick might hate this.  Same thing with people who liked this but hated the original.  Though I don't know how you can like this movie without liking the original, it pretty much set the ground for the franchise.  It's just a shame that it was downhill for the franchise from this point on.  At least until Prometheus, which people loved and hated, but at least it took risks.  I've got the other two films with Ripley on my DVR.  I'll watch them eventually, but I certainly don't expect them to compare with the first two films.  With that said, I pretty much loved this fucking movie from beginning to end.  This, along with The Thing and Evil Dead 2, are some of my favorite horror films from this decade.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Make sure you watch the original first, though.  You don't really NEED to watch it, but it'd be a great idea watching them both back-to-back.  Fucking great movie right here.",

            "content": "So, call it bad parenting if you like, but for me, i could not be more thankful enough to my parents for allowing me to watch this. I mean, I don't think they actively sat me in front of the TV and pressed play. I think it was just on terrestrial television and I happened to get glue to the screen. What happened to me after, and gladly to many of my school friends was a new breed of fandom. I had been impregnated. I possibly watched this without realising it was a sequel. \n\nThe film was already six years old by the time I saw it but rate of change back then is nothing like it is today. It was still perfect for it's time, in fact, even by today's standards, it is definitely considered an all-time classic picture. I bought it on VHS (well, Dad got it for me) and I cried my eyes out when I wasn't allowed the special edition with the extra 17mins of unseen footage. I collected the dark horse comics, comics I hold dear still to this day, especially the artwork of Den Beauvais. I had posters, postcards, books and watched Alien. I did of course, eventually own the director's cut and I'm also in possession of an unopened 30th anniversary Bluray. So you could say I am a big fan. \n\nBut what was it that got me so hooked? It was the team of diverse and elite space marines going up against not one, but a hive full of xenomorphs. The bond and camaraderie between the team really appealed to me, somehow relating to them. Their arrogant confidence put up against the most terrifying odds. It was like a disaster movie but with the characters given a slight chance with impressive firepower and credible technology. \n\nThe production was immense. The creatively beside the aliens themselves was incredible. The APC, the drop ship, the pulse rifles and the remote sentries. The power loader, the motion trackers with those haunting iconic sweeps which increased along with your heartbeat. The costumes they all wore, the graffitied body armour and the legendary Stan Winston reworking Giger's Alien. Even James Horner's score is brilliant with that haunting \"Main Theme\" as the title shows itself superbly melded with a hint military band grade drums that get a full grand performance in \"Ripley's Rescue\". This score is definitely Horner's version of Holst's Planets. \n\nIt has a perfect cast! With Cameron's favourite Biehn playing Corporal Hicks, a good or lucky replacement for James Remar. Weaver obviously returning as sci-fi's greatest and most iconic heroine and Henriksen as the synthetic, strangely affectionate android Bishop who isn't bad at all for a robot. The diversity of characters in this film is good also, actually portraying a fairly but not perfect reflection of what space marines might actually be like. Could I be wrong to say, coming from the eighties, this film actually addressed certain aspects of equality. Apone being their Sgt. and having strong female characters in addition to Ripley, mostly Goldstein's Vasquez, who quickly became another cult figure. She really was one mean, kick-ass soldier. Oh, and let's not forget Reiser's Burke who comes in high on my \"Best Movie Arsehole\" list. \n\nWas this a good step up from Alien? It's certainly one of those rare examples where the sequel is considered to be better than the first, if not equal. Personally, Aliens is better to me purely because of bias, having watched this first. But, if I'm honest, they're both very different style of films which actually makes them equal partners to the franchise. My actually opinion is already tainted by seeing Aliens first and find it incredibly difficult to imagine how I would have seen the films if seen in order. \n\nCameron successfully brought in superior action infused with tension and certainly transported the audience to somewhere otherworldly yet believable. It's like the producers and Cameron must have been sitting there discussing ideas for film, thinking, what about the armed forces making an encounter? Against one alien? No, hundreds of them. A war zone. \n\nA terraforming colony goes silent and Ripley is reluctantly sent back as a civilian guide to a bunch of gung-ho bug-hunting US marines which quickly escalates into a fight for survival as they quickly become prey and are picked off one by one in rapid concession. The film has several classic and memorable scenes, like the queen bitch versus Riply, the getaway APC, the knife trick in the mess hall and \"that's in the room!\" Other lines like \"Get away from her, you bitch!\", Game over man, game over\" and \"you look like how I feel\" are just a few of the many quotes that have repeated over the last thirty years. \n\nIt's an absolute masterpiece that still stands up even to today's standards of movies, it's a perfectly balanced science-fiction action horror that paved a path for many films to follow. A film I will always hold in high regard. An essential must-see. \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 10\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 10\nStory: 9\nScript: 9\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 9\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a cult classic and possibly a sequel regarded better than the first. \n\n96% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

The Space Marines are an awesome addition and it's fun seeing Sigourney Weaver return as Ripley (probably THE quintessential female badass in film). But revealing the Alien creature to be a hive that can be mowed down by machine guns makes them less terrifying than they were in the original. While it fits with the story Cameron is telling, it is a drastic tone shift from the first. Also, as awesome as Ripley is, she doesn't quite feel like the same character and one has to wonder how she all of a sudden was able to defeat part of a hive of Aliens and their Queen all by herself.

            "content": "One of the reasons I'm still clinging onto hope that the Avatar franchise isn't a one-hit wonder is because James Cameron has proven how well he can build out a world in a sequel.  He did it with Terminator and he certainly did it with Aliens.  It's not only a great sci-fi thriller, but it's easily one of the greatest action films to date.\n\nWith a much bigger budget and story, Aliens takes everything that was great with Alien, and doubles down on it.  All while at the same time building his own world of Alien mythology that seems similar and different enough from Ridley Scott's film to succeed as a sequel and stand on its own.  It's a hard thing to do, but amazingly Aliens does it.  What's great about this adventure is that we know what to expect with the Xenomorphs.  We know that these explorers and military personnel are in for a rude awakening when they reach the colony, but the film takes us on the journey anyway.  Everything is avoidable, but yet, all of the character decisions feel logical anyway.\n\nIt's pretty amazing what 7 years can do to special effects and production designs.  While Alien was very contained and simplistic, Aliens is just the opposite, bold with a massive scope.  It's a testament to making films with real effects and minimal green screen and CGI, because films (and these in particular) are always scarier and more thrilling when everything feels real.  In fact, you feel like you're going on this journey right alongside the crew, experiencing each gun shot and face-hugging with them.  In this regard, Aliens plays as both a harrowing western, and an electrifying video game for the audience.  That speaks to Cameron's masterful directing.\n\nCameron also manages to write and direct Ripley into one of the most recognizable action stars in film history.  She wasn't granted a ton of action in the first film, and fittingly so, but Aliens turns a warrant officer into the queen of all things Xenomorphs.  Which brings me to the theme of the film, which seems to be motherhood.  It's a nice twist on gender stereotypes and harsh look into the struggle of a \"woman's voice\" in society.  Ripley is questioned at every turn by most of the characters, even though she clearly has the most experience out of anyone.  And I love how Cameron parallels Ripley with the \"Alien Queen\" at the end.  Both of them trying their hardest to save their \"children\".  \n\nAliens, much like Alien, is the perfect example of how to max-out the quality of your film in every aspect.  Everything from the intense score, the gorgeous production design, the endless tension, and unique and memorable performances.  Aliens is quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made.\n\n+New take from Cameron\n\n+Tension\n\n+Ripley is now an action icon\n\n+Bigger scope\n\n10/10",

However, one action hero from that decade would give any of them a run for their money. Weaver as Ripley is definitely one of cinema's ultimate heroines. This is also one of those rare occasions were the sequel eclipses the original. I also think that the Xenomorph looks its very best in the 1986 film. The action is solid and the cast is great. Sad to see the late, great Bill Paxton in his prime. One of the all-time great Sci-Fi flicks.",

The set pieces and the attention to detail to everything is so meticulous, it deserves praise just for that. \n\nThat knife scene is awesome. Definitely a memorable one for the books. Great to see all these new faces with all types of different personalities and quirks. That grainy recording of the outside whenever theyï¿ 1/2(TM)re approaching a planet or station will forever be recognized and embedded in my head. Both spooky, uneasy, and interesting. You can almost feel the atmosphere of the movie. Itï¿ 1/2(TM)s so dense you can almost cut it with a knife. \n\nItï¿ 1/2(TM)s pretty fucking amazing how good the aliens are at camouflaging. Just one characteristic that makes them that more terrifying.  Holy shit, what a fucking nightmare to see that helicopter go down. Itï¿ 1/2(TM)s kind of funny to see how the guys just give up and lose there minds, while the women maintain there composure and seem stronger mentally. \n\nOf course, Burke, being the business side and company man side of everything, has to think about money and is probably going to get everyone killed. Wow, I didnï¿ 1/2(TM)t figure Burke to be so shady and fucking conniving. Watching these alien movies, you canï¿ 1/2(TM)t help but get the feeling of claustrophobia at times.

Ellen Ripley finds herself going back to the planet she escaped from years earlier but this time with a group of marines and more firepower.

Ripley must confront her fears and find a way to save her comrades before it becomes a mass slaughter like before.\n\tThis film certaintly is a classic and it was was awesome! I really liked how we got to learn more about how these aliens operate.Cameron takes what started as a horror type film and made it more of an action packed thriller. that kind of major shift in a sequel is an huge move that when done right becomes an extraordinary feat and something a director can be proud of. Incredible work here from this Oscar winning director\nAt this time I can imagine how unprecedented it was to see this kind of heroic character. a woman who is surprisingly strengthened by her experiences with the aliens and becomes a total badass and a fearless fighter!  Sigourney weaver definitely broke down some barriers here. A tremendous performance here!\nSuch impressive visual effects for this time. it far surpasses what was done before 86. Very good sound design as well.

And the space void. THE SPACE VOID. Ripley in 1979's Alien doesn't dress up in a space suit when she discovers of the xenomorph in the pod just because she didn't want to fight nipples-out, but because she knew she would have opened the door. Ridley builds this scene perfeclty instead of how Cameron does. Remember Ripley puts the cat in the cryo-sleep before she knew of the alien? Attention to details. Cameron's Ripley opens almost impulsively the door and takes her time running out the Rig (finely breathing). \nThe two stars are just for the great ideas and characterization of the xenomorph's society and mother. This thing made me sad and an Alien orphan.",

Terminator veteran Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Jeanette Goldstein whose character owes more to the Expendable franchise.\nThe Aliens themselves are certainly more  'illustrious' with some good special effects (pre CGI) from Stan Winston.\nThe star of the film is Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley.

This movie has a great cast of characters. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley as well is a match made in heaven. She is probably the greatest female protagonist ever brought onto the big screen. The other characters are also fantastic. Each have their own personality that make them all memorable. The film has great action with horror and suspense sprinkled into the mix. The first time I saw this I couldn't even believe what I had watched because I enjoyed the hell out of it and over time it grew to be my favorite movie ever. The score for this film is so beautiful and amazing to listen to. This movie is honestly a masterpiece. I don't think well ever see a new Alien movie as good as this one. If you haven't seen this movie yet then deffenitly check it out because you are missing out on a classic. 5/5",

            "content": "Plainly put, Alien is an old-fashioned scary movie set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, made all the more believable by expert technical craftmanship. Picture isn't quite good enough to be a combination of The Exorcist and Star Wars, but both titles are likely to come to mind.\n\nScript [from a story by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett] has more loose ends than the Pittsburgh Steelers but that doesn't matter as director Ridley Scott, cameraman Derek Vanlint and composer Jerry Goldsmith propel the emotions relentlessly from one visual surprise - and horror - to the next. [Plot has several parallels with the 1958 lowbudgeter It! The Terror from Beyond Space.]\n\nThe price paid for the excitement, and it's a small one, is very little involvement with the characters themselves. But it really doesn't matter when the screaming starts.\n\nIn contrast to the glamorous, adventurous outer-space life often depicted in sci-fi, Alien initially presents a mundane commercial spacecraft with crew members like Yaphet Kotto bitching and moaning about wages and working conditions.\n\nThe tedium is shared by captain Tom Skerritt, his aide Sigourney Weaver and the rest of the crew, played by a generally good cast in cardboard roles. Eventually, it will be Weaver who gets the biggest chance in her film debut, and she carries it off well.\n\nSince they were doomed to get an R rating for gore, anyway, the filmmakers have thrown in some 20th century swearing for Weaver, which seems odd and awkward in the context, plus a bit of a skin show that's fetching but a little far-fetched.",

So knowing that he directed The Terminator and Terminator: Judgement Day before this, it probably got a lot of people excited at that time, but wondered if James Cameron understand what the first film was like, and put the best parts of that film into this. With that said, Aliens turned out to be a fantastic sequel. Sigourney Weaver is just as great in this as she was in Alien, in fact, she's better here. While the film doesn't necessarily have all memorable characters  like the first one which in this one has more characters, it's forgiven by the fact that almost all of the characters are memorable and some of them have really cool introductions. There's more humor here than the first movie, and it's really funny. Aliens doesn't entirely become an action film as it has good suspense and some effective scares. The computer effects still look impressive as of today, but the filmmakers focused more on the practical effects which I was glad to see and they look amazingly creative. The ideas they put in there are really cool, and they put more ideas into this than the first movie. The acting from the other characters is really good, and swing Bill Paxton's character getting whiny at times, it's really funny. The direction and script by James Cameron is very well done, the action scenes are exciting to watch, and the score by James Horner is catchy which in glad to know that consider that this is an action film, he compose mostly action scenes are exciting while putting in some creepy music to the suspense scenes. Aliens is a masterpiece of a sequel that's faster paced which would make more people interested in this, and better than Alien.",

I'll get to that one at some point.\nIt was decided that after Ripley put herself into hypersleep following Alien, that she would finally resurface fifty-seven years later. She learns that the very same planet in which the alien implanted the embryo into Kane, has been colonized with fifty families, there for research. After nobody believes Ripley, she has been asked to assist in a purely advisory manner as some of the best soldiers are asked to investigate. I'll leave it at that.\nNormally, sequels are not as good as their predecessor. More often than not, they suck. Seriously. I am not comfortable saying which the superior movie is. Because both of them are frelling fantastic. What I will say is both movies are completely different. If Alien was the movie where the creature tip-toed in the night and snuck up on you, then Aliens is the movie where they stop hiding. If Alien is the movie where you're cowering into your loved one's arm pits with your hand covering your eye, while surreptitiously splitting your middle and index finger to briefly see what happens, Aliens is the movie where you're eyes are popping out of your skull, missing your mouth with whatever cinema snack is within your reach.\nAliens is a bona fide thrill ride, with an entertaining supporting cast, including Bill Paxson, Paul Reiser, and Lance Henrikson. One of the best parts of the movie is showing Ripley's heart with a little girl, nicknamed Newt, in which she has sworn to protect, since Newt lost her parents to one of the aliens. There is clever interplay in conversation, neat twists, and lots of firepower. LOTS OF FIREPOWER.\nI'm not comfortable saying whether Aliens is better than Alien, or vice versa. I'm very comfortable in saying that you're an idiot if you don't check it out though.",

            "content": "I appreciated Alien for its good mix of the sci-fi and horror genres. While Alien made me sick to my stomach, Aliens entertained me more than it scared or shocked me. More goofy characters and more aliens makes for more fun in my book.\n\nI really like how we don't have a firm grasp on what is reality or a dream in the first few scenes of the film since Ellen jolts awake a few times. Some of the content in the dream, however, is grounded in reality however since it is said she has slept for 57 years both in the dream and reality.\n\nOnce again, however, the entire film could have been avoided if people just listened to Ripley. There would have been no alien on the ship in the first if the crew would have agreed with Ripley's logic following protocol, and here her warning is not heeded since people now live on the planet where she encountered the alien.\n\nWhat is interesting is that while the film has similar elements to the first, they are still different in little ways. For example, this film has a villain who prioritizes capturing an alien to study, but he is human in this one as opposed to the cyborg Ash in the first.\n\nWhile the first film is meant to humanize Ripley, this one humanizes here even more with her effort to protect the young girl Newt. It gets to us when Newt calls Ripley \"momma\" at the conclusion, showing this girl acts as a surrogate child after Ripley's actual daughter died when she was in hyper sleep.\n\nAs for the rest of the film, not too many complaints. The suspense and action is great, Bill Paxton is great as a cowardly hot-head in one of his early roles, and the magnitude of the film is so much higher than the first - they practically fight an army of aliens instead of just one, and I love a good action film that ups the stakes.",

Aliens wasn't just a young gun ripping off the tone and texture of the original. Cameron made Aliens all his own. Where Ridley Scott was all about slow-building tension, James Cameron creates a whirlwind of pure panic and violence. And if you watch Aliens closely, you'll notice that James Cameron never stops the action to tell the story. The action tells the story. Now that is popcorn filmmaking, even if it does sacrifice plot development in favor of  Ripley's kick-ass chick with a grenade-launcher on the altar of gun porn.

Even though I saw this in 2015, it looks just as good as any film today.  It's just a continuation of the original character in a different genre of film.  With Newt,  who many people believe is an annoyance,  I believe is great character.  She doesn't do much,  but she raises the stakes when you put someone that REALLY doesn't belong there in the thick of it.  She also brings out a softer side in Ripley we didn't see in the original.  The only real (while small) issue I have is that these aliens,  who in the original are terrifying, in this they come off as weak and just cannon fodder.  But that's what you get when you make the transition to an action film.  This shows James Cameron's films were a lot better in the past.  This is probably his best work,  along with T2.

You don't need a 3D glass to have that kind of experience, but by just watching it, it is beyond 3D. The robotics, the special effects, everything here are superbly well made. In short, this still tops the list, for the most well made, good looking visually sci-fi films ever. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is one the most charismatic and strong female characters in a Sci-fi action film. I love her character here. Instead of studying the creature. They are forced to invade the planet where her previous crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. I thought this is more action packed than before. Especially the last scenes, that was epic, Ripley is being brave enough to fight one on one with the queen alien creature.

You don't need a 3D glass to have that kind of experience, but by just watching it, it is beyond 3D. The robotics, the special effects, everything here are superbly well made. In short, this still tops the list, for the most well made, good looking visually sci-fi films ever. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is one the most charismatic and strong female characters in a Sci-fi action film. I love her character here. Instead of studying the creature. They are forced to invade the planet where her previous crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. I thought this is more action packed than before. Especially the last scenes, that was epic, Ripley is being brave enough to fight one on one with the queen alien creature. And the futuristic power loader, machine guns, boy this is more of a \"sci-fi bad ass\" as it can get. James Cameron defines innovation, as simply one of the best big budgeted films of all time.

I think that the cast is, again, spectacular.  Nods must go to Weaver, Biehn, and Henriksen in iconic roles, but a standout for me is Paxton's incredibly memorable performance as the mouthy Hudson.

For instance: the aliens are surprisingly weak compared to the ones in the first movie, and given the close range many of these aliens are killed at their blood doesn't seem to be too much of a problem. There are a few cliches that also take a bit away from the movie, but James Cameron does a very good job of keeping the dilemmas fresh instead of making the audience shake their head at something they've seen dozens of times before.

            "content": "Aliens is the James Cameron sequel to the Ridley Scott classic: Alien.  The sequel came nearly seven years after the original because Fox wanted to hold off talks about a potential sequel until 1983 - yeah, you read that right: this film is from a time when a major studio pumped the breaks on a sequel.  \n\nIn Aliens we join space heroine Ripley as she wakes up from cryosleep after drifting through space for 50 years or something, with the crew of the rescue ship thinking \"yeah, bullshit\" when she explains the sequence of events that led her there.  They head back to the planet where the original Alien eggs were found, where Ripley and a rag tag team of mercenaries, including updated android model Bishop, to check out an outpost which has lost radio communication.  \n\nWhen they hit up the outpost, they find the survivors have been cocooned to the wall and they're all \"...kill....me...\" and then all shit breaks loose.  I won't give any more of the plot away, but there's a time constraint that gives the second half of the film a nice bit of consistent tension.  \n\nUnlike the original Alien, which featured a standard drone style xenomorph, Aliens ups the ante and introduces new types of aliens including the now famous Queen.  The overwhelming feeling of being trapped with a destructive stealthy creature is a bit lost in favor of numerous destructive in your face creatures which attack without remorse.  The result of this is that Aliens feels a lot more like an action movie, than the space-horror that Alien was.  Additionally, with typical 80's flair Alien also attacks the corporate world by hiring very-punchable Mad About You co-star Paul Reiser to play a generic corporate dick bag.\n\nSeeing as how the budget for the sequel was larger, Aliens introduces a lot more toys: personnel carriers, dropships, pulse rifles, and the smart-gun, which was made from a jury rigged steadicam and went on to feature heavily in the AVP games as the weapon of choice for newbs.   Also new to the game is a massive EXO-suit, which acts as a large exoskeleton thingy for loading crates in a loading dock.  I don't know how it's more practical than a forklift, but hey, a forklift probably wouldn't look cool cruising around in Aliens.  \n\nThe pace in Aliens is faster to keep with the more action driven plot, and the music and sound effects reflect that.  The lighting is also what I would consider brighter, with the original Alien being almost a film-noir in regards to how sparse the lighting was, Aliens tends to be evenly lit to accomodate the visual action feast.  Special effects on the Aliens is now improved, with more advanced puppeteering, allowing the aliens to run around quickly and evasively, rather than the stealthy style of the original.  \n\nTL;DR - 8/10\nAliens is a great sci-fi action film, and a fairly competent sequel.  I personally still prefer the original for its foreboding sense of dread, suspenseful pace and unnerving feeling of isolation, but this is still as good a sequel as one could really expect, and Cameron holds it all together.  The acting is great, the pacing is tight and it still feels fast by today's standard.  Although the first movie made the Alien a movie monster of legend, Aliens cemented the creature as a franchise moneymaker, garnering numerous academy awards, and smashing the box office.",

When I found out that Sigourney Weaver almost didn't play her part for Ellen Ripley, I realized how this movie would not have been at all the same without her, and that alone could have brought down my rating.   The effects are really good, the aliens are far better looking than the original, less mechanical.  The slime and water on the aliens still adds to their realism, as does their smooth movements. And the queen alien is amazing looking, so real and was not all CGI but actually real.   The story is simple, find and kill the aliens, and starts off right where the first movie left off.  The plot is more action packed and not made to be as scary, and is always tense, with thrills and a great script.  The face-huggers look just as impressive and real the original Alien face-huggers, and still play an important creepy role.  The action is good, with old style gun sounds fitting with the futuristic weapons. Cinematography is great, and I simply can't say anything bad about this movie, and not enough good things.

            "content": "Before really dissecting Aliens, I want to point out that as a whole and on its own, the movie is excellent and nearly flawless. The tension, performances, effects and action were all spot on. That being said, I want to elaborate on why this movie is not as good as its predecessor. At the time of Alien, the first Star Wars had just been made and Ridley Scott was truly a trailblazer alongside the brilliance of an early George Lucas. The only movie that compared to the bleakly artistic tone of Alien was Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey but that lacked the human touch to really connect with the average movie goer. Scott bridged the gap successfully and created a masterpiece. Seven years later however, with all of the Star Wars movies created and Blade Runner in the books, Cameron took over the franchise. At this point, new, original contributions would have and should have been expected from the budding director, who had just hit the peak of his career 2 years earlier. Instead, Cameron played a safe game, with Aliens perfectly matching much of the tone and visual brilliance that defined the earlier Scott movie while dropping much of the artistic flair. Despite the fact that this still makes for an excellent movie, it cannot be denied that Cameron added very little of his own work to the movie, save for his penchant for extreme suspension of disbelief and aggressive over weaponization, cheap tricks of film that would negatively manifest in completely uninspiring future works such as Avatar. All in all, the second greatest work of the most financially successful director of all time ends up being an elaborate copy. It is an entertaining and entirely worthy copy of course, but a copy all the same. Even in this early work, Cameron shows the unoriginal attitude and deliberate neglect for a polished storyline that would haunt his later films. For this, Aliens falls well below Scott's original work.",

Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, and one again gives a great performance, being collective and motherly in one scene, and than being stern and kick-ass in the next. Waking up after 57 years in cryo sleep, Ripley is suffering from not only post traumatic stress disorder, but also has to come to terms with the death of her daughter, who was only 10 when her mother left. Ellen has also learned that the company has started a colony on LV-426 and it has gone missing. So with the help of a very memorable group of marines, including an android named bishop, second in command Hicks, the wise-cracker Hudson, and many more, they set out to find what happened. As they search the colony, they come across a little girl named Newt, who's family was killed by the xenomorphs. This gives Ripley a second chance at being a mother as the two form a strong bond with each other. The memorable characters and chemistry they share are two major highlights of Aliens, but the thing that really steals the show are the Aliens themselves. In the first film, Alien, Ridley Scott gave us one of the most unique and terrifying creatures in movie history; showing that even one is a force to be reckoned with. In Aliens, James Cameron shows us what a whole army of these things is capable of, we also get to see that xenomorphs aren't just mindless killing machines, they have a form of intelligence and a hierarchy of sorts; this makes them even scarier. We also find out that the facehugger eggs are laid by an Alien Queen, which is one of the greatest practical effects ever made, and gives us one of the most iconic battles in Sci-Fi history when Ripley dawns the power loader and battles the overgrown bug. If your into Sci-Fi, action, and suspense I highly recommend that you check out Aliens.",

            "content": "Spoilers within this review...beware. No big surprise that I prefer Aliens over Alien since this doesn't really have a horror feel to it. Instead it is a sci-fi action movie which is a genre I enjoy a lot. I like the fact that they take some time to setup a logical reason for Ripley to get back into a dangerous situation. It works out perfectly and sets up a really great payoff when it is revealed that the corporation actually is up to its old tricks through Carter Burke and wants to harness the aliens as a weapon. One of the things I loved most in Alien was that there was more than one threat to the crew because the corporation was actually on the side of the aliens, and that continues here. However, and this is a superb twist, James Cameron takes advantage of what was established by Ash in Alien and plays with our concern that the resident android will be on the side of the corporation again (to the expense of all humans.) Then he twists that by having Bishop be the single most loyal and trustworthy \"person\" in the film, going out of his way to save the lives of Ripley and Newt.\n\nSpeaking of Ripley and Newt, that relationship was a nice addition to this sequel. It gave Sigourney Weaver some stronger emotional content to work with, and kept her in touch with her innocence instead of always being cold and unfeeling. The casting of the military crew is perfect, as they all seem like competent warriors but they aren't particularly bright. It was impressive that I was able to differentiate them too, since they don't get a ton of individual time on screen. Perhaps it seems a bit forced for Ripley to take control of their operation so quickly, but it seems to work with this cast of characters. By and large I find Aliens to be an excellent movie that really works well for me. Honestly, I'm not sure why this doesn't rank as one of my favorite films of all time. I have a feeling that, if I had come across this series at a younger age it would have been more meaningful. Now when I watch it, even though I do enjoy it, I start to think that some of these same ideas have been explored better in other films. It's hard to say for sure, what holds me back. I do recognize Aliens' quality, though, and it is easily my favorite in the series (although I haven't watched Prometheus yet.)",

Aliens begins after Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found floating in deep space after 57 years. The company (represented by weaselly Paul Reiser) first investigates her story and then, of course, sends in the Marines (I mean, shit, they have acid for blood).  So, the latter half of the extremely long director's cut is simply a military squad figuring out how to battle a horde of H. R. Giger's aliens (and dying trying).  To give this splatterfest a deeper theme, Cameron throws in some mother love - Ripley for her dead daughter and then the orphaned girl found alone and alive on the planet -- and of course the Queen of the Aliens for her brood. Some reckon this is the best film of the four (or five) but I guess it depends on what you're looking for.",

Horror, No it doesn't have the same scary feel as the first film, but it does have it in it's own way. The motion sensors are distinctive and heart stopping. The not knowing where exactly the Aliens are coming from causing the scary and suspense the film needs. Comedy, duh, all the marines have great sense of humors and who can forget Hudson. Action, well yeah, the introduction of the Pulse Rifle, sentry guns, smart gun. Tons of gun fire and plenty of explosions. Romance/Love story, a connection between Ripley and Hicks grows to the point he risks his own life for her and her to him. Lastly, Ripley had a daughter, Amanda Ripley, who died from old age. You meet Newt who becomes a huge motivational character in the film. Ripley feels as though she needs to do what ever it takes to protect her, because she reminds her of her daughter. Aliens takes all these things and puts them in together and does it perfectly.",

            "content": "James Cameron is a master of sequels, among two of the three that I have seen. How a sci-fi/horror classic can morph into a sci-fi/action classic seven years later is only possible through trustworthy, and dexterous, hands. 57 years after the events of the first Alien movie, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has finally been awoken from her chamber, and is medically treated in a Wey-Yu corporation spaceship. Her whole family, including her only daughter, is now dead, leaving her alone with the other survivor of Alien, the cat. When the corporation cannot communicate with its colony of a planet on which the alien eggs did lay, Ripley decides to advise the Marines who are assigned to investigate the scene. Before the aliens appear, the pacing is about the same as the previous movie, without as much attention to the atmosphere. Upon arriving on the planet, the Marines initially find no life, except one human, a little girl named Newt. Pull the string, and she will either scream or not scream. The Marines are mostly tolerable, though if you pull the string of one Hudson (Bill Paxton), he will either whine or whine loudly. Eh, Cameron has never been the best at writing characters, though he keeps the feminine spirit of Ripley's character very much alive. Ripley's motherly fixation on Newt does not delude from how mightily independent and strong she is. She isn't afraid to flirt. It's not \"bad bitch\" flirting. It's silly and friendly flirting. But, y'know, it has to be the right guy. That guy would be Corporal Hicks (Michael Behn). I like the pinch of romance. Too much would be distracting. None would be fine, but the flirting is a sign of friendliness that adds depth to Ripley's already-deep character.\n\nWhat am I doing, not talking about the aliens!? As you might expect, different director, different style. Multiple aliens makes far more sense for heavy-duty firearm action than dark paranoid-horror. And yet, Aliens generously takes cues from Alien to blend the two into a singularly thrilling experience. Anticipating the alien(s) hooks me in, and once I see them, my jaw drops. This time, for the reason that there are so many aliens and, in their first appearance, the Marines' weapons are limited. I know that shit will hit the fan, and I am eager to see what happens. I choose no sides. That did not change throughout the rest of the movie. The climactic battle between Ripley in an anthropomorphic lobster lift machine and the Queen Alien played as two mothers fighting for who's the better mother. Favourite quote: \"Get away from her, you bitch,\" right before the fight. The aliens still bleed acid and use their sharp, whip-like tail effectively. They're costumes, mind you, and to this day, H.R. Geiger holds the title for creating arguably the scariest movie monster. With the abundance of aliens, and incidentally more human casualties, I loved to see why or how each side advances.\n\nIn respect to the \"lore\" of Alien, I turn my attention to what the alien is and what the Wey-Yu corporation wants to do with the alien. In Alien, the \"xenomorph\" was sold as the perfect being. In Aliens, the creature is able to be killed, but it does require about 100 rounds of bullets. Not significant enough of a difference that should turn one away from the action. In Alien, the Wey-Yu corporation programs android Ash to find, study, and capture the alien. In Aliens, the Wey-Yu corporation sends a human, Burke (Paul Reiser), with the Marines to do the same. That's a significant difference, mostly when one considers Burke's actions near the end of the movie. With little to no chance of survival, Burke still recklessly endangers himself and others for the sake of preserving the species. He's as much of a corporate machine as Ash, which doesn't make as much sense. Again, character work isn't one of James Cameron's strongest suits. It's a flaw that hurts Aliens in the same way, but not to the same degree, as it hurts Terminator 2. The calmer moments are dispensable, but not irritable. Ripley may be the only dynamically-written character, but as long as someone is, that's all that matters for a film like Aliens.",

A man name Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) informed Ripley of a planet, where her crew discovered the alien and now being settled by the colonists. Contact has been lost by the colony, and so Ripley, Carter, and a group of marine soldiers go down to investigates.\n\nWhat's the deal:  James Cameron, who writes, and directs this second installment, Aliens may have gotten some viewers disappointed. It's not badly done, by the way. The fact is that there are few jumpy moments to it, and it does play it mysterious as the first one, but the first two alien movies are totally different.  This second installment play it more of a sci-fi action rather than a sci-fi horror, and that's the disappointment for some viewers, but do I feel disappointed with this movie? No. There were actually a lot of great things to really like about this movie. The first one is that the character development is well done. Sigourney Weaver does deliver a stronger performance than the first one. The second one is that the pacing is perfectly pace. I do notice that the film is two and a half hours long, but it does take it's time on it. The last one is the action scenes in the film. It had really great set pieces to the story, and also the editing is well done, which it totally got me highly entertained.\n\nMy full opinion: Now for the big question: Do I think this one is better than the 1979 version? Not really because I just dug more of the creativity to the first one than this one. Other than that, it is one of James Cameron's best films and one of my favorite sequels as well. 9.7/10",

The finale of the film is brilliant, wether it's the remaining marines last stand or Ripley destroying all the eggs to Ripley's classic fight with the queen Xenomorph.

This is easily one of Cameron's best movies and even though the technology and special effects are aged the story is still solid and well paced despite being over two and a half hours long. \n\nSigourney Weaver returns as Ripley to the planet she encountered years before  as a freighter pilot who had an alien kill the rest of her crew one by one. She was a little more than a scream queen if comparison to the Ripley in Aliens who is an intelligence, witty and fully fleshed out ass-kicking take no shit action heroine that will do anything to protect Newt; a little girl who's the only survivor of  a group of settlers on the planet. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. You have Michael Biehn (Terminator) playing Hicks, a tough corporal who's forced into a leadership position who proves to be more than some dumb grunt. Bill Paxton (Big Love, True Lies, Titanic) plays the loudmouth catch-phrase spewing Hudson who's a self proclaimed 'ultimate bad ass\" until he encounters his first alien. Vasquez played by Janette Goldstein (Terminator 2, Near Dark) as the hardened vet of the group who is another strong female character (a recurring motif in all of Cameron's movies). Burke is played by former comedian and sitcom actor Paul Reiser who is the original gangster when it comes to evil greedy corporate goons. Last but not least is Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, Man's Best Friend, a ton of films really) is Bishop, the android who is the only person able to get them off the alien infested rock and all in all a well intentioned robot that Ripley doesn't initially like due to past experience with androids. \n\nWatch this movie. This film was a summer blockbuster made when summer blockbusters actually had good stories, well drawn characters, practical effects and little reliance on CGI to be considered exciting.",

            "content": "7 years after the original reinvented a genre, the xenomorph is back, only this time its not just one of them, its an entire colony. In the 70's Alien created a monster that would essentially rape its victim in order to impregnate it, causing the host to work as a womb for the fully formed creatures that were extremely deadly. Alien was and still is to this day one of the greatest films ever made, look up any top 100 list and not only will you most likely find it in there, but a whole host of films it inspired. Fox knew it had a winner on its hands and it was only a matter of time before someone attempted a sequel. A young James Cameron stepped up to the challenge, writing and directing after his hit the terminator, which had released a few years earlier. Cameron managed to take what was outstanding about the first and ramp the thrills up too 100, this essentially makes for what some believe to be the better film and others to blaspheme its existance as such a wild departure from the source. Aliens takes place 57 years after the original, Ripley has been frozen in space for this time, eventually picked up by a salvage crew. Once back to normality she not only finds out that everyone thinks shes stark raving mad but that a colony was built upon the destination of her first encounter with the Alien. She soon finds herself joining a host of marines as contact is lost with the colony and her worst fears are confirmed, there is an army of these things. As i said this film ramps it right up, to its credit it spends a good hour of exposition prior to any guns blazing. Creating solid characters and setting up the roller coaster which is about to commence. The cast are all superb and of their time with exceptional performances from Weaver, Henrickson, Pullman, Rieser, Carrie Ann Henne and Beihn.They completely envelop their characters and make the entire experience so much more enjoyable. Stan Winston makes his mark too creating a plethora of eggs, face huggers, chest busters, drones and most notably the queen, which to this day is still jaw dropping to witness and downright terrifying to look at. However Cameron decided to change the look of the alien slightly by making it more armored, its not crippling but when compared with the other films in the collection these xenomorphs stand out like a sore thumb. The sets are all built and look stunning and its nice to watch an action film that not only has a bit of brain behind it but doesnt need to throw explosions and gunfire every 2 seconds to get its kicks. Where this film falters slightly is its dialogue. Cameron has never been known for his earth shattering dialogue, give the man some paper and he will create a visual masterpiece with bombast but its common knowledge that his connection to the human language can be slightly stilted. Yet again, it doesnt hurt the film, in fact it gives it a comic edge from a modern day viewing. There are some ropey shots here and there, shots jilting out of focus or effects that havent dated quite so well but its short comings as a film are massively outweighted by its triumphs. Now to wrap up on what i opened this review with, some fans hail it a masterpiece others slam it. For a stand alone film its bloody brilliant, slap it in the franchise and it adds to the mythos, buillding upon aspects, you have to give Cameron credit for being so ballsy to create a completely different experience. However for my money this film starts to take alien down what would essentially be a more brainless and combat heavy route and it would force future directors of the obvious threequal into much more of the same.... had David Fincher not got a hold of the 3rd but that my friends is for another review. So regardless of its departure from the source Aliens builds upon the source and delivers a healthy, thrilling, long and fun ride. Plenty of scares, plenty of gore and plenty of extra terrerstrial slaughter than anyone could hope for. Its not quite the master stroke of genius the original was but who cares, this is a balls out, well made sequel and one im proud to own.",

He didn't make a copy of Ridley Scott's Alien he made his own film \n\nThe Opening Scene is pretty horrifying \n\nSigourney Weaver's Ripley is back of course and her character evolves into a Badass and a full fledged Female Action Hero. Hell she got nominates for Oscar for this film\nIn Alien Ripley was cool \nBut in Aliens she's a fucking Badass and she given more humanity she given something to fight for now and to end all the XenoMother Fuckers \nThis is how you write a Strong Female Character \n\nMichael Beihn's Corporal Hicks is great\n\nLance Henrikson's Bishop is also great\n\nBill Paxton's (R.I.P.)  Hudson giving one of his best performance ever with \"Game Over Man, Game Over\"\n\nNewt is the Adorable Little Badass\n\nYou really don't see the Xenomorphs until almost a Hour in the Film, but its worth it cause until you see them you get Great Character Development and Suspense cause you have literally no idea when their gonna pop out. But when they do There's A lot of these fucking Xenomorphs and they just fucking slaughter half of the Marines and its amazing and horrifying, Cause you see the film is more about Character in this film\n\nIn the directors cut you find out Ripley has Daughter which is a nice edition they put it in there and when you see Ripley and Newt being with each other and makes more sense \n\nThe Colonial Marines are fucking awesome \nIn the making of the movie they filmed the Lunch scene last cause Cameron wanted the whole crew to act like actual team and Family.\n\nSo Quotable \n\nThe End Sequence is some of the best in Film History with Ripley becoming the Badass Hero she is and saving Newt to seeing all the eggs and when the score stops into Silence you see the Queen giving birth to the eggs its Disgusting, its Horrifying and its Fucking Awesome, especially when Ripley just does Fuck You Bitch and Burns the Entire egg Nest.\n\nAnd the End Battle which is great cause you think its over but its never over cause the Biuch Queen didnt die. \nAnd get one of the best Quotes ever \"Get Away From Her You Bitch\"\n\nThe Visuals are some of the best  \n\nOverall: This is one of the Best Action Movies ever made thanks to James Cameron I do prefer this one over Alien cause I just love Quotable Movies and more character development and it still holds up today \n\nOverall Grade: A+",

            "content": "\"THE RETURN TO LV-426: THIS TIME, IT'S WAR!\"\n\n- One of my favorite films (if not, the most favorite) is the 1986 sci-fi action film 'Aliens' by genius director James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2). It's the second installment of the very popular 'Alien'-film franchise and in my honest opinion even better than its predecessor  'Alien' by Ridley Scot (The Gladiator, Prometheus). Where the first movie was brilliant due to the  claustrophobic setting that caused a very scary atmosphere, this sequel takes it one step further as the story takes place on a colonial setting on the planet LV-426, where action, suspense and dazzling special effects will make you sit on the edge of your seat. I just love that we get to see what happens to Ellen Ripley, the only survivor of the first film and cinema's strongest female character ever. \"Get away from her, you bitch\" will forever be engraved inside my mind. Ripley is played by returning cast member Sigourney Weaver (Ghostbusters, Avatar) and gets the support of Michael Biehn (The Abyss, The Terminator), Lance Hendriksen (Near Dark, Man's Best Friend), Paul Reiser (Beverly Hills Cop, Diner), Bill Paxton (Twister, Titanic), Janette Goldstein (Near Dark, Terminator 2), William Hope (Legacy: Black Ops, Captain America: the First Avenger) and introducing Carrie Henn as Newt. Make sure to see the Special Edition; that really adds to the original storyline. Aliens, this time it's war!\n\nAfter drifting 57 years in space, the escape shuttle from the Nostromo is found and last surviving member of the vessel, Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Weaver) and her cat Jones awaken from their cryogenic sleep. At the Gateway Station in front of the Earth, Ripley learns that her daughter has passed away and that she needs to answer to a group of executives of her former employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, to what happened with the Nostromo. She is advised by the Company's representative Carter Burke (Reiser). During the interview, nobody believes her story about the alien life form and Ripley is shocked to hear that the planet, LV-426, is being terraformed by colonist families. \n\nWhen all communication with LV-426 is lost, the Company wants to dispatch a group of Colonial Marines to investigate. Burke comes knocking on Ripley's door and brings Lieutenant Gorman (Hope) to convince the woman to join them on their mission as an advisor and doing so restoring her status. At first she refuses, but after having a tormented dream she calls Burke and agrees.\n\nAboard the warship Sulaco, Ripley meets a dozen of Colonial Marines, including Sergeant Apone, Corporal Hicks (Biehn), privates Vasquez (Goldstein), Drake, Dietrich, Crowe, Frost, Hudson (Paxton), Wierzbowski, pilot Ferro and co-pilot Spunkmeyer, and the android Bishop (Hendriksen), to who Ripley is hostile because of what happened with Ash in the first movie. Arriving at LV-426, the team finds the base of Bradley's Hope intact, but barricaded. There is no sign of any civilian life. It doesn't take long before all hell breaks loose and Ripley is once again faced with the demons from her past...",

The first movie, Alien, was a properly scary film and I figured Aliens would be more of the same. I was wrong, and even though Aliens is technically a sequel to the first film, it really feels like a completely separate production. Sure it had Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as Ripley, but just about everything else in this film is different.\n\nFor starters Aliens isn't science fiction horror , it's all action. Beyond that you'll find the actual aliens look a little different too. In this story, the human characters aren't hopelessly overpowered, they are marines packing state of the art firepower making the odds more even. Aliens also develops Ripley's character a lot more, and expands our understanding of the alien creatures too and we finally get to see what's laying all those eggs!\n\nWhere Alien developed slowly to build atmosphere, Aliens has pace. The action is superbly executed and exciting to watch, and the visual effects are great. I loved the assorted characters, and how they responded under pressure. Especially Hudson (Bill Paxton), who's bravado turns to cowardice at the first sight of an alien. Sigourney Weaver's performance however, is the real stand out here, and James Cameron creates a great story arc for Ripley's character as she faces her demons, and then starts fighting back.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nLiking the first Alien movie doesn't necessarily mean you'll like Aliens, as they are completely different movies. So don't go into this expecting big scares - this is an action movie.\n\nBest viewing format:\n\nThere are two versions of the film to choose from. The original theatrical version, and the special edition that added an extra 17 minutes of footage. My preference is for the special edition, because it develops Ripley's and Newt's (Carrie Henn) back stories more, and does a better job at explaining the deep connection those two characters have. In either case if your local theater were screening this film, certainly try to catch that showing. At home a HD viewing of the film on a nice big TV is recommended. Watching this on a laptop, tablet or phone will reduce its impact.\n\nBest moment: >\n\nThe absolute best moment for me is when Ripley emerges to fight the Queen in the power loader. As she steps forward the camera ends up tight on her face and she says \"Get away from her you BITCH!\" It's just one of the best movie moments ever filmed! EVER!\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Cameron manages to make the Alien just as menacing as before, even tho it is seen much more frequently. the introduction of a child character, Newt (Carrie Henn) who is the only survivor on the terraforming installation adds a sinister vibe to the film, that causes a sense of fear of the unknowing to the viewer.

Now, seeing it again after so many years in limbo, I'm disillusioned and disappointed by its obvious cinematic limitations. Despite all the technical prowess used to erect this movie (special effects), I perceived mostly an amateurish work needy of a lot of polishing all around, especially needy of more intelligent directing and better acting. James Cameron doesn't know what subtlety is nor does he practise particularly insightful filmmaking, not a guy deserving of my admiration, that's a fact. He just turned into almost nonsense gun muscle action what should had been a true Sci-fi Horror masterpiece (Huh?! Who said so?). Well Duh!!, yeah I know! Big and Twisted expectations are doomed to end in disappointment. I guess the first Alien movie was better left alone and in peace, at least until a more talented someone else decided to try his/her luck with an unnecessary sequel... then again James Cameron might have been just the right guy for it. I have to give him credit for his ability to make a movie that can happen, in other words, it's not boring to watch and manages to immerse and entertain me despite all its gut-wrenching limitations. It´s aftermath leaves me with the feeling of having watched something... though much slimmer than the epic extents of Avatar, of which I felt a kind of déjà vu at times...\n\nWhat really grabbed me through the whole experience was Sigourney Weaver believable performance, good work from this actress here. An interesting and eye opening aspect of this movie is the depiction of how a woman, practically alone, is able to face the most fearsome and mortal dangers the human race could ever encounter and still display, or rather, being propelled by her maternal and sentient side towards someone else, something worthy of reflection. It's not everyday we see a heroin display the most lovely attributes of women with such power and determination in this sort of movie. This is probably one of the greatest endorsements of the female being in the history of cinema and deserves it's notoriety just for that. A pity that the rest of the movie didn't keep up with warrant officer Ellen Ripley.\n\nDespite my lukewarm feelings I have to admit that Aliens is one of the best Action movies I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Those of you who know me well probably figured that it was only a matter of time before I reviewed this movie. Before summer 2012, I wasn't even aware that there was a movie called \"Aliens\". I just assumed that every single sci-fi sequel that wasn't part of a pre-determined trilogy was just a cheap way to cash in on the success of a legendary movie, especially in the case of films with different writers and directors than the original. When I heard that Alien had a sequel, I assumed that it must have been no better than movies such as The Fly II or Die Hard 2. However, when I googled the movie, I found out that it received great critical acclaim upon its release, and that some fans even prefer it over the original. How could it be that this sequel, released seven years after the original film, could follow a movie that many consider to be the greatest sci-fi horror film ever made?\n\nAliens doesn't quite pick up right where the first movie left off. After floating around in space for 57 years, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, is awakened from her cryo-sleep only to be harassed by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation executives about the destruction of the Nostromo, the ship that Ripley was stationed on in the first film. The higher-ups at the company, of course, don't believe her story about a hostile alien known as a xenomorph killing off her entire crew before being blown out of the escape ship's airlock by Ripley herself, and place Ripley under constant surveillance. However, when the company loses contact with a colony on LV-426, two men named Carter Burke (played by Paul Reiser) and Lieutenant Gorman (played by William Hope) approach Ripley about returning to the planet with a team of heavily armed space marines to investigate the situation. Ripley accepts the mission, and the adventure that ensues is a very exciting ride that leads up to one of the greatest showdowns in the history of cinema.\n\nThere isn't much that I could say about this film that hasn't already been said. IGN ranked this movie at #11 on their list of \"Top 25 Sci-Fi Movies of All Time\", and #3 on their list of \"Top 25 Action Films of All-Time\". Sigourney Weaver was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, a most impressive feat considering the Academy's tendency to give little attention to the science fiction genre. This movie has definitely gotten all of the praise that it has deserved over the years, and it was a great second film from writer and director James Cameron. There truly isn't much that I could contribute to this conversation without simply repeating all who have written about this movie before me, but I will try to include some information that you might have never heard before.\n\nOne thing that I appreciate about Aliens is that every character reacts to their first encounter with the xenomorphs differently. Private Hudson, played by Bill Paxton, is very cocky about the mission as the troops are landing on the surface of LV-426, only to become the most frightened member of the crew immediately following the his first run-in with the creatures. Gorman becomes completely locked up, while Corporal Hicks, played by Michael Biehn, is able to keep his cool. The team soon comes into contact with a little girl named Newt, played by Carrie Henn, a survivor from the colony who realized that the best way to deal with the aliens is to simply run. As team members are killed off, the nerves of some other crew members become even more undone, and the audience is treated to not only a compelling action movie, but also an accurate presentation of how different people react when they experience something that we previously thought was impossible. I have no doubt that murder witnesses, cancer patients, and war veterans have all gone through similar experiences as the group of space marines in Aliens.\n\nThe deeper aspects of this movie don't end there, however. In an interview shortly after the movie's release, Cameron stated that he drew a lot of inspiration for the conflicts between the space marines and the xenomorphs from watching footage of the Vietnam War. Cameron found the nineteen year conflict fascinating because it was a rare instance where the soldiers armed with advanced weaponry and technology were not able to defeat the opposing forces, and proved that high-tech gadgets don't necessarily win wars. In Aliens, the space marines are sent to a far-off planet where they are short on men, supplies, and training, and they are completely ill-prepared to go up against the foes that they are facing. In addition to this, we also slowly learn that Burke has an agenda of his own, leading many fans of the movie to believe that his character may be symbolic of the politicians who were trying to push young men into the controversial Vietnam conflict. To solidify this analogy, Cameron even drew inspiration from the aircraft used by the American forces in Vietnam for the crew's dropship, and the APC ground unit in the movie looks very similar to the Hunslet ATT 77 Aircraft Towing Tractor. Cameron's re-imagining of this famous conflict takes what we see onscreen to a much deeper level, one that may, at times, hit very close to home.\n\nOne thing that I should point out is that whenever I speak highly of Aliens, I am not necessarily referring to the theatrical version. When Cameron was making this movie, he was fighting with the executives at Fox left and right to try to get in every scene that he had planned. Cameron's films, as we now know, are typically longer affairs, but this being his second movie, he didn't yet have the tenure to convince the studio that everything that he had filmed was necessary. The theatrical version ended up clocking at 137 minutes, a compromised running time that Fox was very reluctant to approve of. In 1992, however, a \"Special Edition\" of Aliens was released onto home video that included seventeen minutes of extra footage. The scenes included in this version make the narrative of the whole movie flow much more smoothly. There is a scene in the beginning where Ripley learns of the death of her daughter while she was in cryo sleep, a sad scene that I believe gives more depth to her character and makes the audience connect more with her when she takes young Newt under her wing later in the movie. Another scene included in this version is Hudson's famous \"ultimate badass\" monologue, along with a later scene where he and private Vasquez, played by Jenette Goldstein, talk about the operation of ant hills, a conversation that foreshadows the final showdown between Ripley and the alien queen. Having seen both versions, I believe that the extended version is far superior because of its smoother narrative and greater character development.\n\nAs many a critic has said before me, this movie is absolutely fantastic. Ripley, who we previously knew only as an employee onboard the Nostromo, shows a more tender and motherly side of her character when she is with Newt. The marines in this movie have much more depth than the cardboard jarheads that we see in other military films, and whenever one of them bites the dust, it hurts. The acting in the film is also top-notch. My favorite performances in the movie are definitely those of Weaver and Paxton, whose characters are on two completely different planes mentally, but have to work together because of the situation that they are in. One of my favorite scenes with Weaver in this movie is when she first comes face-to-face with the alien queen. There is no dialogue, and we can only tell how the two are communicating through Ripley's facial expressions and body language. This is one of the most tense scenes of the film, and I usually have to hold my breath the entire time.\n\nI absolutely love Aliens, but I'm glad that my first experience with the movie was the extended version. Some critics, including Roger Ebert, stated that they would have liked to have seen more character development throughout the film, a complaint that I believe would be mute if Fox had allowed Cameron to release his original 154-minute cut in 1986. Still, this is both my favorite action and sci-fi movie of all time, and I'm sure that it will be for many years to come.",

James Cameron is what Michael Bay wishes he was, a director able to blend the spectacle and humanity with the greatest of ease. Side Note: Unlike Alien, the Directors Cut of this is by far superior to it's already superb Theatrical cut. It's much longer, but trust me it's worth every extra second.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO MACGUFF* \r\n\r\nIn 1979, Ridley Scott brought us the classic sci fi film, Alien, which opened up to a negative response due to many unexplained phenomenon.  Alien brought us The Extraterrestrial Invasion.  A new wave of aliens invading earth films came out literally invading cinema.  Most of these films, besides Predator, were brushed aside and mnay were forgotten.  So, now we have the sequel to Alien with Aliens.  James Cameron, who brought us the only good Terminator films, Total Recall, and Piranha 2: Flying Piranhas (A classic in the B-Movie genre), brings us this film.  I won't say Aliens was a terrible film because it isn't.  It has scenes of pure awesomeness and amazing special effects.  James Cameron is a visual director, of course.  But the problem always lie within his scripts.  Take for account, the 2009 Avatar, another Cameron film, it was beautiful, but it was also very shallow and boring.  Then, take Cameron's other film, Titanic.....Sappy, Sappy, Sappy.  Aliens, while being very enthralling and fast pace, has a very weak script and ditches the atmosphere of the original.\r\n\r\nAliens happens right after the events of Alien.  Ellen Ripley, having surviving the torture of witnessing her friends being helplessly slaughtered, is in space for around 50 years.  Just as she is about to finally cope with the horrors, she learns that the aliens' home world has been colonized by humans.  The colony's communication with other worlds have suddenly stopped.  Due to this, colonial marines are dispatched to check out the area, crawling with your favorite big headed alien!  Ripley joins in on the team to help since she has had a lot of experience with this type of thing.  As they arrive, they soon find out the colony has been ransacked by those lovable Xenomorphs.  Soon, they are left in a fight for their lives, with Queen Xenomorph out looking for \"the one\".  Sigourney Weaver stars as our pretty awesome female lead, Ripley.  \r\n\r\nMy problem with this film is the fact that it ditched the eerie, creepy atmosphere the first Alien had.  The dread in every scene in that film really set a standard for, not only horror movies, but alien movies in general.  This film pretty much has more of a war film-like take on that.  It has no dread, but it is overdosing on testosterone.  Also, the first film had very few aliens show up whereas this had like an army of those aliens.  A major complaint I had with this film was the characters.  They were your typical jarheads who only enjoy blowing things up and going \"AMERICA!!!!!\", even though I'm not sure America even exists anymore (in the film).  Also, the way many people die are by getting burned by the acid blood.  No one remembered the fact that these things bleed acid?  Their too stupid to insult.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is this little girl named Newt, who is absolutely useless in the film.  I guess she was in there to try and make Ripley seem humane, or something, but it fails....it fails pretty badly.  She has dry attempts at some humor, but I definitely didn't crack a smile or anything.  I was literally hoping that some alien would just gobble up Newt and we wouldn't have to deal with her.  Oh, but this is the '80s where children are seemingly invincible to killers.  I actually commended Alien 3 for having the balls to kill off Newt.  It wasn't better than this film, but it at least went for something unexpected.  The script is also devoid of any memorable lines.  You know that whole \"Game Over man\" line?  It was improvised, meaning the actor came up with that on the spot.  So Cameron didn't create the iconic line, the actor did.  \r\n\r\nOverall, while Aliens is a technical marvel, especially considering the time period, it can't help but feel inferior to Ridley Scott's horror epic.  It has some bland characters, who do idiotic things and never seem to learn.  Newt is the female Jar Jar Binks/Jake Lloyd hybrid, even though she was before them.  And there is some laughable attempts at acting from the marines.  James Cameron, I'm a fan of Terminator 1 and 2, and I enjoy True Lies and Total Recall as guilty pleasures, and Piranha 2 is a classic B-movie, but this is bad.  It is very bad.  It's nowhere near as bad as say Titanic (1/10) or Avatar (2/10), but it's nowhere near Terminator 1 (8.5/10).  I'm telling you Cameron: \"That's it man, game over man, game over! What the fuck are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?\"  \r\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "Now that's Kick-alien!!\n\n Firstly make sure you watch Alien (1979) first before reading this review. You may watch Aliens independently but miss out many plot elements key to the franchise. With Alien having established the presence of deadly alien in a suspenseful horror manner this sequel satisfies the kick-alien action which was missing (definitely not necessary) in the first film without sacrificing much of the suspenseful storytelling that made Alien special. Another plus point for Aliens is that it has a strong lead performance by Sigourney Weaver and very impressive visuals for 1986. It has the typical James Cameron touch for both screenplay and direction and does complete justice as a sequel. The movie always has edge of seat thriller feeling with the Aliens getting smarter with every advent thus suspense has a strong hold. The final act is full on entertainer but has feel like the protagonists would escape any kind of dangerous numerous times which has a bit hard to digest apart from that Aliens is among the top lists in sci-fi, a justifying sequel which answers few unanswered questions of 1st film and not to be missed even today.\n\n{{ PLOT - After 57 years after the horrific events of the movie 'Alien' Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is rescued and awakened after the vessel is discovered. The planet LV-426 from the film 'Alien' is now colonized by about 60 families which are terraforming the planet so that atmosphere will be breathable. But suddenly the contact with the planet is lost and team of marines is sent to investigate }}\n\n Aliens also has some amount of humor with some cheesy dialogues and the typical marines conversations. Also another fun element is the nice pacing of the events despite many suspenseful searches for the aliens. The sets are very impressive though they don't give the alone in space feeling of the first movie. The characters are very much lovable which includes all the marines with a heart touching and special performance by Carrie Hen as about 11 year child on the planet. She gives a completely different outlook to the story.\n\n But its Sigourney Weaver who delivers THE performance as Ripley who is now all ready to seek her revenge/vengeance with the aliens. The music is not so haunting as Alien but still good enough for the thrilling action of this film. At the end Aliens strongly installs the Alien franchise (I see bad reviews for next 2 movies but still these 2 movies completely define the Alien franchise) and James Cameron shows why he is such a good action director and this is another of his gems.\n\n Watch Aliens after watching Alien, these two films create one of the best sci-fi-action-thriller-mystery-horror universe in the history of cinema. Not to be missed at any cost and I am going towards Alien3.\n\nRATING - 9.3/10",

            "content": "A few years ago, I was a subscriber to Netflix and I wasn't keen on the whole 'watching TV shows online'--I was in it for the DVD deliveries but when the prices went up, we were done with it. One of the many movies that I had rented was 1986's \"Aliens,\" which I'd never seen before, and--I don't know what drugs I was on--but I disliked the film. Actually, I didn't even watch the whole thing, I guess the first act wasn't compelling enough for me. But shortly before Christmas '13, at around midnight, \"Aliens\" was being aired and I thought I'd give it another try. To keep things short, I saw the action-filled second half of the film and I was just blown away. Then, Christmas comes around, my mom had gotten me a copy of the collector's edition of James Cameron's masterpiece for about $6 bones, and, what was my third viewing of the film, had also been the first time I had watched \"Aliens\" in its entirety. Holy shit. It was like being eight years old again and watching what I have to call one of the most influential films on my childhood, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It was the exact same feeling again. I admire the tension, the eerie atmosphere, the score during the action scenes, the characters (particularly Vasquez, Hicks, and Ripley), and the action-violence. \"Aliens\" is truly exemplary; a precedent among science-fiction action films and cinema in general. I've seen a great number of movies; what separates \"Aliens\" from the countless other action-thrillers is the variety of emotions that realistically displayed. A great example is Hudson's character, because he really captures the essence of fear just by his facial expression. Most action films tend to be one-dimensional with the sole purpose of being explosive and firing as many bullets as possible. \"Aliens\" doesn't sacrifice its kill-count to maintain its tense atmosphere, if anything, \"Aliens\" is a satisfying experience because it isn't afraid to \"humanize\" its characters instead of all of them being heartless killing-machines. Right now, [1/24/14] I just wish \"Aliens 3\" hadn't gone and fucked everything up and no, I haven't seen it, nor do I plan to. But I will say this; I really do hope that someone will attempt to add another installment to the franchise--I'd really want to see an \"Aliens 5\" instead of some stupid \"clash of the monsters\" type of scenario *cough* AvP: Requiem. Overall, \"Aliens\" is an excellent film, it's something that ought to be met with nothing but the most respect, this a film that ought to be inspiring the young mind of a science-fiction writer, and it's a film that gets nothing but love from me. What shocks me even more is that I'm showering a film with praise that was released almost a decade before I was born instead of some spectacle from 2013 or something. Oh wait, that's right, we have remakes because Hollywood just...they have so much originality that they're running ever increasingly low.    .",

            "content": "Bigger and more cooler than the original in my opinion. No cat and mouse game just an all out battle humans v.s. aliens Round 1 fight!. James Cameron completely changes the style up. Where Alien was largely a dark horror flick packed with LOTS of suspense, Aliens is an action adventure, loaded with thrills and wrapped in fun. At the end of the first film, Lt. Ellen Ripley was the only survivor of an attack upon her interstellar cargo ship by an alien creature. She ended up getting into an escape module, getting out of the main spacecraft, placing herself into hibernation, and more or less hoping for the best outcome possible. Fifty seven years later she's finally picked up. Naturally the company she works for is peeved that she blew up an expensive space freighter and is none too willing to believe her story about monsters (They think she's cuckoo). She then gets stripped of her command, demoted, and humiliated. Things are rough for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie starts with a thrill a minute and works its way up. There's never really a dull moment. The only slight blemish on the film is the crew of Colonial Marines that Ripley has to deal with. They are an embarrassment to an otherwise intelligent script, a group of hotshots who are arrogant, immature, wisecracking show-offs with an attitude. Their presence is meant to add color and excitement to the story, but they are just plain silly to me. No serious military unit would put up with their antics for a minute. Ripley is clearly the only capable character in the bunch, and before long she takes over like Sly Stones Rambo. Maybe it's no coincidence that director Cameron was the screenwriter for Rambo II a year earlier (did some research). Ripley gets the green light to act heroically and, as usual to roam around in her underwear :).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames adds a few surprises to Aliens to make it as different as possible from it's predecessor, but basically it's the same idea. Just more ugly aliens everywhere, some of the best monsters ever designed, and followed by more action. It was the right route to take. We had already been served up the suspense of wondering what the alien creature was all about in the first story, so what was left was fighting a battle royal with a whole army of them. That was the biggest issue I had with Alien I didn't get to see enough of him I was craving more of the ugly guy, but thanks to the amazing James Cameron that issue was an after thought in this installment. Due to it's high octane action and multiple aliens that makes this film one of the coolest sci-fi flicks I have ever seen.",

There is too much awesomeness in this movie to identify just one reason why Cameron's 1986 sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien works as well as it does.\n\nAliens continues the story of the number one cause of hurtin' for chicks named \"Ripley.\" It adds a new layer to the Alien's biological cycle, introducing an Alien Queen and ? in doing so ? one of the big screen's best and scariest villains. The hit sequel is a bullet of a movie that packs the perfect amount of character development, horror and action into a story that could have been thread-bare in a lesser craftsman's hands.\n\nRipley's return to LV-426, the planet where she first encountered the alien, is now home to a shake-n-bake colony of families and workers, which is basically ringing the dinner bell for the xenomorphs to prove that, in space, everyone can hear you scream if you die loud enough.\n\nRipley joins an elite group of Colonial Marines sent on a bug hunt, and they quickly find that neither flame thrower nor bug-eyed troopers by way of Hudson are a match for things that bleed acid and sweat slime. Cameron's decision to keep Ripley and Newt as the emotional core of the movie makes the increasing threats around them all the more conducive putting us on the edge of our seats.\n\nThat, coupled with the Power Loader vs. Alien Queen showdown, underscored by James Horner's epic score, is why Aliens is not just a great Cameron film, but one of the best movies ever made.",

            "content": "Aliens. James Cameron's 1986 sequel to Ridley Scotts\" 1979 film Alien. Aliens definitely falls under the category (maybe it invented the category) of not anything like the first film. Well it depends on how you think of it I guess. Not sure if anything like this could be pulled off in today's film climate, but that's another story. The film brings back Sigourney Weaver and the Alien(s) and we go from there.\n\nCameron decided to amp up everything to eleven in comparison to Alien. Did it work? You bet it did, mainly because Cameron kept what helped make Alien what it was and built on it, instead of simply recreating the first film. He and others involved brilliantly kept the characters and changed the game. It was bold and created something so different. Again that is another story for another day.\n\nSigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley was nothing short of fantastic and the film would have been cliché action nothingness without her. I even feel this is a case of two movies. We have the first part of the film. The part with the marines, and then the final half hour of the film. The first part and the final part composing the first of the two movies in the analogy I'm making. Ripley is such a strong character that most of the other characters, fine as they were in their roles, looked bad in comparison. Lance Henrikson as Bishop being the big exception. He looked cut from the same cloth as Ripley and functioned perfectly as something bigger in the film. Mostly based on what happened in the first film. Michael Biehn as Hicks gave another good component to the larger picture to the life of Ellen Ripley. \n\nThe story seemed inevitable, but no less important to tell and played out much like you would expect. This all seemed to take a backseat to the story and relationship between Ripley the young girl found alive at the station Newt and the aliens themselves. It was a great addition to again what would have been cliché action nothingness otherwise.\n\nCameron did a fantastic job filming this one. The sequences played out visually perfectly and added immensely to atmosphere, tension and what was written. He made everything extremely watchable. Avoiding what was not needed and would have amounted to a distraction to what was on screen.\n\nDid the marines seem a little hammy, cheesy or whatever you want to call it? Yes. Did it work? Yes. Mainly because they were nice additions to the film and not the film.\n\nYou sit through the film mostly thinking that this is a good film. A film that could have ended at the escape and we would have went home happy and the film would have faded into mediocrity. Cameron had something different in mind though. That was the final half hour when Ripley goes back in to the facility. What unfolds there is what makes the film as memorable as it is and Cameron creates one of the most tense well shot and important scenes in action film history. It is stark, spine tingly good and seems to pass by in mere seconds. It has so much to it and every second is wonderful, awe inspiring and what movies are all about. At the very least this scene is a must watch for all\n\n\nAliens is a great film. A fantastic film. Quint-essential action if you will. It has and will stand the test of time as one of the best franchise pieces ever made. Cameron and co. make a masterpiece and Sigourney Weaver continues to carve out a masterpiece of a character. An action masterpiece. No more, No less.\n\n4 out of 4 stars.\nWould I watch it again? Yes. I will watch this film (along with the other alien films) until the day I die.",

            "content": "If Alien is the textbook definition of what a science fiction horror film should be (and it is), then its first sequel, Aliens, is the textbook definition of what a science fiction action flick should be.  Though similar to its predecessor in terms of characters and story-line, Aliens is truly its own film in terms of direction and tone, and it works just as well.  Beautifully shot and well acted, Aliens is another of those movies that is often imitated, never fully captured.\r\n\t\r\nThe film begins fifty-seven years after the destruction of the Nostromo in the first movie, due to Ellen Ripley's over-extended hypersleep in her pod that has gone awry and is rescued, by pure blind luck, by a second starship, whereupon Ripley is awakened.  Quickly informed of the severe time lapse, she is eager to warn the crew of LV-246, where a new human colony has been established.  Afraid that the moon is still completely inhabited by Xenomorphs, Ripley joins a military crew down to the moon in order to wipe them out, and finds the colony absolutely desolate.  Subsequent attempts to eradicate the aliens and discover the missing crew follow, and every moment is intense, exhilarating, and generally a fine example of filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe acting in the film is superb.  Sigourney Weaver is still as intense and emotional as ever as Ripley, and I mean it in the most sincere way.  She completely embraces the role as her own, and, while it still seems surprising that she was ever nominated for an Academy Award for the film, she absolutely deserved it, as she is stunning in the role.  Charlie Henn, about ten years old at the time of the release, plays Newt, a new character who is introduced as the story progresses.  Newt is, as far as the crew can tell, is the lone survivor of the colony, and Charlie Henn is quite possibly the second best actor in the movie, with only Weaver more exceptional than her.  Henn doesn't have a lot of charm as the character, as she is a very morbid little girl, but she is one of the most believable actors in the film, and, I believe, one of the best young actors of all time.  Only Bill Paxton, as Private William Hudson, is an unworthy actor in the movie, and his whiny caricature of a character does not well fit the film's tone.  In fact, I would argue that Hudson's non-appeal qualifies him as the single most annoying character in any film, ever.\r\n\r\nJames Cameron, in his third major motion picture (following Piranha II and The Terminator), truly proves himself a wonderful director once again as a brilliant alternative to Ridley Scott in Alien.  The contrast between light and dark is prevalent in Aliens, and the somber attitude truly defines what the film sets out to be: dark, moody, and intense.  And boy, is this film intense.  Every scene, be it a quick conversation between two characters or a full-blown alien attack, is thrilling, and leaves knots in the viewer's stomach that may be hard to unfold.  This may truly be the most exciting science fiction film of all time, a shoot-em-up with heart that never fails to intrigue.\r\n\t\r\nWhile not as good a film as Alien, Aliens comes pretty darn close, with a brilliant script, a neat plot, great acting, beautiful direction, and a daunting score that all form an exciting, heartfelt movie that ought to be seen by even those most averse to sci-fi thrills and that is definitely a worthy sequel to its classic predecessor.",

The majority of the characters are simple caricatures - the swanky black drill sergeant, the stoic veteran (Michael Biehn), the panicky soldier (Bill Paxson), the corporate sleaze (Paul Reiser), the masculine female warrior (\"Vasquez\"), the inexperienced and incompetent officer (\"Gorman\"), etc. The plot also leaves much to be desired given the unbelievable sequence of events that unfolds (e.g. the processing station has become unstable and will detonate in four hours). Best thing I learned from this movie is that Private Jenette Vasquez - the tough Mexican female soldier - is played by Jenette Goldstein, who now runs the store Jenette Bras, a large-size bra specialist known for its slogan \"The alphabet starts at 'D'\".",

I was slightly wrong, because towards the end they seemed alright, i'd much rather just let them do their thing though rather than have some sort of half-assed character development when there's little TO develop. I watched a longer edit of this and i don't know if it's better than the normal version, i can see why fans of the original Alien may not like this considering it's more like an action movie but those creatures are freakin' creepy!

Cameron made the smart decision of transforming the Alien franchise from sci-fi horror to sci-fi action, and after the success of the Terminator it's easy to see why it worked so well. The Alien (Xenomorph as it's commonly referred to) again serves as a brilliant antagonist rivalling only itself in the first movie, Weaver is again superb and should have won the Oscar she was nominated for in this role, but somehow lost to Marlee Matlin, which I can only assume was a sympathy vote by the Academy as Matlin is deaf. The Colonial Marines are the only problem I have with this movie, instead of trying to make them heroic type characters, or people who could (potentially) save the universe and extinguish the Aliens (Ã¡ lÃ¡ the Rebellion in Star Wars), they portrayed them like every other movie does, brainless sophomore-ish cowboys who treat the size of their guns like the size of their junk, as well as the tough Hispanic chick who wants to fight everything and everyone (complete with fingerless gloves and a bandanna), they are just so clichÃ (C), and they brought nothing fresh to the film. \n\nCameron's direction brought a sense of youthfulness that Ridley Scott never did in the first film, it looks like a director trying to have fun and make a bad-ass movie, not someone trying to win an award for cinematography and best director.",

            "content": "For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. \r\nThe Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland-Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there.\r\n         The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. \r\n       The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it.  A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a  flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky,  over confident, marines  going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.)  Were taken from the Vietnam War.\r\n  The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a  thousand.  The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters  are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. \r\n         Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.",

It takes the premise of the first film and effectively executes the action element that can follow the reality of multiple Aliens wreaking havoc on humans.  \r\n\r\n57 years after the ending of the last movie Ripley is found accidentally floating in space.  She discovers that a civilian colony has been established on the planet.  This film begins with the psychological impact on Ripley after her first encounter with the alien.  No one believes that she actually encountered an alien species.  She is trying to cope with life when she is approached to serve as an adviser because they have lost contact with the colony.  \r\n\r\nRipley decides to help as long as the mission is to destroy the aliens.  We are then introduced to the military platoon assigned to the mission.  One of the flaws is that the soldiers are not fully developed so at times, they come off as caricatures, but there was a small attempt to develop them and that helped.  Once they arrive at the colony post they find a 12 year old girl survivor hiding beneath the floor and in the ventilation shafts.  Ripley bonds with the girl who is also trying to deal with the horror of what she has experienced.  \r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the first two films is based on the visceral and consistent reaction to the horror of the reality that such aliens exist (an element that is absent in the subsequent films).  The synthetic robot also provided great mystery and three dimensionality in his character to keep the viewer interested and curious into how the plot would develop.  The only other flaw is the connection of the final sequence and the viability in \"real\" time.  It was not poorly executed, but the link to the amount of time allowed seemed underestimated to make it consistent with the film.  Otherwise, the direction, writing and special effects are flawless. It is a great action film to experience with an effective emotional-psychological connection.",

            "content": "One of the only near perfect films I have ever seen. I've been a rabid James Cameron fan ever since my eight year old mind was blown away by Terminator 2. Now that I'm older and have seen all of Jim's work, his best film is undoubtedly Aliens, with Titanic following close behind. When analyzing Aliens and determining just why Aliens is near perfect, it's not very hard. Aside from the brilliant effects, amazing model designs, and still impressive creature effects, it's the story and relationships between the characters that really carry the film. This top notch character development is present in each one of Jim's films. Without the level of emotional excellence and story here, Aliens would just be a really good looking monster film. Imagine what Terminator 2 would be like without the relationship between the T101 and John Connor. It would have been a groundbreaking special effects achievement, but it wouldn't have been nearly as effective. And that's really why Jim's films work so well, in my opinion. Aliens is the best example of this because the collection of characters are diverse and interesting and the story is truly terrifying. \n\nI don't want to overlook the effects as if they don't matter. For the time and even today, the effects in Aliens is one of the best examples of true craftsmanship in film. With the exception of a few early green screen moments, everything in Aliens holds up to this day. The puppets don't look like puppets, they look like Horrifying Aliens. The sets don't look flimsy and fake, they look atmospheric, moody and sometimes beautifully disgusting. The prosthetics don't look like makeup and rubber, but instead show us the bloody imagined reality of an alien bursting out of Ripley's chest. Every effect is meticulously and painstakingly put together with Jim's knack for perfection. I could write an essay about the special effects in aliens and to be honest, if one wanted to learn about film special effects, I would recommend dropping out of film school and studying Aliens instead. \n\nAliens not only improved upon the original, but it did something completely fresh and new. More than 20 years after its initial release, the film holds up better than any other film from the 1980's, with maybe the tie exception of Blade Runner. If you are interested in film, special effects, terrifying freights, or just an all around good story, Aliens is a film that immediately deserves your attention and one that warrants endless viewings.",

No, he had to build on and improve the extra terrestrial and technological part of the story and to his credit he succeeded.

Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" was a perfect and apparently un-matchable terrifying experience; once i watched it, it quickly entered in my favorite movies of all time list. It was certainly thrilling and atmospheric, if not perfect, and once finished, it seems the sequel might only be able to equal the greatness. But as a matter fact, it way surpassed \"Alien\" in every aspect and also on it's own expectations. \r\nAll of what's good from the first is perfectioned here and creates more percect stuff from the hand of James Cameron. A great classic that stands as one of my favorite movies of all time and transformed Sigourney Weaver into a kick-ass female character and one of my favorite protagonists. To be a 100% honest, i know there's also Space Odyssey and other perfectionist movies, but no other movie has engaged me like Aliens did. The atmosphere, the special effects, the advanced cinematography, the epic and thrilling action-packed score by James Horner, the strong performances, the progression of the story, the epic climax, all ultimately delivers what i call a perfect experience. Sure, perfect doesn't exist, but Aliens is very close to make it so.\r\n\r\nSet 57 Years after the events of the first Alien, Ripley is rescued from stasis in the remaining shuttle from the space ship Nostromo, by The Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the company were she worked. Due to lack of evidence and the destruction of the Nostromo, Ripley's story about the Alien they encountered is quickly recieved with much skepticism and as negatively as Manos: The Hands of Fate and most of Hollywood remakes by critics and audiences (nailed it!). Ripley's space-flight license is revoked and she works as a cargo loader. Contact with the now habitated LV-426 colony (colonized after no Alien race was found what's so ever)is lost, so the Colonial Marines are sent to an investigation mission, while also taking Ripley with them, as there exist the possibility of an Alien attack. After discovering that there are tons of Aliens, Ripley will have to learn that the only way to end with her nightmares are battling them.\r\n\r\nThe plot suggest tons of action, and it certainly delivers some of the best action sequences ever shot. However it still contains the tension and build-up from the first Alien, so it's more like a huge update. Also, there's little quantity of movies that can scare and deliver some good action, while also being overall well done. But Aliens is not only well done, it's mostly perfectly made (\"mostly\" because there's not such thing as perfect). First of all, there's a lot to admire and enjoy in this movie: the scenarios are awesome, they never feel like a park ride, you can feel you are there. Second, the Aliens are barely seen, but whenever they're on screen, they're awesome. Specially The Alien Queen, she's one of the best special effects in movie history. Third, of course, the awesome acting. Sigourney gives her all and ends transforming Ellen Ripley in one of the greatest characters in cinema. The rest is also great: Michael Beihn (Kyle Reese in The Terminator), Lance Henriksen, the crew of the Sulaco, etc. But a speacial mention to Carrie Henn as Newt, she is one of the most credible child actors and her character has a lot of strenght in the story. Oddly enough, she never appeared again in another movie since. But i guess it's because she knew that any other movie will be inferior. Fourth, the amazing score by James Horner. Fifth, the direction by Cameron (i think this is his best work). And last but not least, the awesome climax. I won't give away too much, i'm just gonna say it's awesome.\r\n\r\nThis is easly the best movie i have ever seen and i'm sure it may stay like that till' i die. It's hard to think that something as perfect as Ridley Scott's Alien could ever be surpassed, but James Cameron make it happen, transforming nearly perfect to definitive the closest to perfect as a movie comes. Aliens simply gave me an even more learner and grateful experience than Ridley Scott's original movie, an experience i thought could never be matched. Maybe you're thinkin' i'm way over-glanced by this movie, but time has passed since i watched this and i'm still convinced this is the most perfectionist movie i have seen, and thus, my favorite of all time. Sure you HAVE to watch this if you call yourself a critic or movie-goer. Aliens is for me the best movie ever, but if not for the rest, it can still be one of the best ever made along with The Godfather, Shawnsak Redemption, etc. Cameron, you have made a milestone in cinema forever.\r\nGotta love those Aliens. The bad thing here? What came after it: Alien3 (huh...) and Alien Resurrection (really average).",

The tone he strikes here differs quite a bit as goes bigger and action-oriented but the shift works terrifically because he retains a strong sense of suspense and intelligent restraint even when he delivers some balls-out action sequences. But \"Aliens\" does everything a sequel should; it explores the world established in the original and develops its main characters while giving us new characters and keeping up the excitement. Sigourney Weaver is exceptional as Ripley and her \"maternal\" character arc is a iconic achievement within an action blockbuster (made even better in the director's cut); it showcases Cameron's strengths with crafting such endearing female characters. The rest of the cast is a blast, the visual designs are superb and the Alien Queen looks incredible! Some fans' mileages will varying on the tone and some of the meat-head Marines I suppose. It might not be quite as \"perfect\" as 'Alien' but it is a fantastic crowd-pleaser and my personal favorite of the series! - 9.5/10 (A)",

This is a terrific blend of sci-fi and non-stop action, which makes it one of the best follow-up films I have ever seen.\n\nAliens focuses on Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the first film.  After being in hypersleep for over 50 years, she is traumatized with what she experienced with her crew.  She is informed by company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet where they discovered the unknown lifeforms is now being occupied by colonists.  When contact with the colony is suddenly lost, a group of colonial marines, along with Ripley, are sent to investigate.  When they arrive, they quickly realize that the aliens have completely infested the colony, and the result is an all out war.  \n\nWhat can you say about James Cameron?  He's the king of great sequels.  The directing approach is perfect.  The acting here is also phenomenal.  Sigourney Weaver is once again a complete badass as Ellen Ripley.  I really love that character and the way she has evolved after the terror she experienced with her previous crew.  You also get a great supporting cast here, which includes Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn.  \n\nThe original Alien film is fantastic and has a slow-paced horror vibe to it.  This sequel strays away from that a bit and provides more of an in-your-face, action-packed experience.  I love that, because we get an original approach instead of a rehash of the first movie.  Aliens takes a working formula and makes it a notch better, resulting in this classic science-fiction masterpiece.  5 stars.",

Dark human ambitions still manipulating events. Spectacular climactic event.\n\nThe actors. Sigourney Weaver gives us an other great performance as the now legendary heroic survivor. Michael Biehn is the mellow corporal Hicks who grounds us and Ripley in a solid fashion. Paul Reiser manages a great performance where you just love to hate him. Lance Henriksen, as Bishop, shares with us his calm demeanor while looking completely innocent. And Bill Paxton gives an amazing performance as the high strung over-confident braggart.\n\nThe meh. The power loaders are great, but could have been done just a little better. Some of the special effects are showing a bit of age, but everything taken into consideration, it's barely noticeable.\n\nThe bad. Apone's pre-drop rousing orders.

Because it is everything I want. This film inspires me. From the horror aspect: Alien creatures that are by the dozens maybe more are trying to kill you, you can't see them well because they hide in the darkness. The suspense aspect: You know the Aliens are coming but you don't know from where exactly. You have motion sensors, that give of a loud beep every 5 seconds. The closer they get, the faster and louder the beep. The action aspect: Explosions, gunfights, the music, it all fits perfectly to make and action sequel. The drama aspect: You have a guy in your squad who wants you dead so he can take an Alien back. All crew expendable. The comedy aspect: Come on, if you're not laughing at Bill Paxton's performance in  this film, you're crazy. Science Fiction is obvious. Aliens, outer space. And last, the Romance aspect: Ripley falls for Hicks(marine) and also finds a little girl who reminds her of her daughter who died while she was still in space. All these aspects are perfect and it's amazing how James Cameron incorporated them into one film so nicely and perfectly. Aliens surpasses Alien in every way and is the perfect sequel.",

Instead, Cameron decides to inject action set-pieces coupled with some of the cheesiest dialogue.\n\nJumping right into the film, I noticed a dramatic departure in quality for the cinematography. No more eerily cold shots of space; no more claustrophobic, isolated shots; and when \"Aliens\" draws nostalgic memories of its predecessor, its ghostly qualities are drained out by its cacophonous dialogue. If I were to best describe the quality of its technicalities, it equalizes with many of the homogenized late 80's, early 90's action flicks. In other words, it doesn't stand out. You see where I'm going with this? Cameron does the worst decision possible: He decides to substitute all the horror elements and dread of this universe with finicky action set-pieces. Funny how the one alien in the previous iteration is more horrifying than the hundreds of aliens (including the big mama queen) in this movie. Okay, I understand -- Cameron is going for an action movie, not a horror film. However, the action is not something to behold either. It's sloppy, rambunctious, and boring. Yeah, thinking from a 2012 movie mindset, \"Aliens\" definitely fails to propel action, but I could definitely see how it was revolutionary at its time (C'mon, it was made in 1986). Was the movie as a whole entertaining? Let's just say that it gets the job done, but when \"Aliens\" is clocking in around 2 hours and 18 minutes, you'll find yourself bored for most of the ride.\n\n\"Aliens\" is a baffling departure from its extremely successful predecessor. No more scares, no more atmosphere, and no more methodical pacing. Its coupled with extremely medicore performances, appalling dialogue (Never was a fan of Cameron's screenplays), and a baffling turn in direction. Now, where's Ridley?",

They gave it their own unique style while at the same time keeping everything thematically related. Aliens is a bit more action oriented where as the first one was more suspense/horror oriented so it makes them hard to compare. However, I think I like the first one just a tad bit more simply because of how organic it felt. Although, I will say this movie has some of the most awesome action scenes I've ever seen; especially the one at the end. This is a prime of example of why the 80's is considered to be the best movie making decade of all time.",

Film makers of today should learn of Mr Cameron that suspense/fear are for more powerful in making a film then lots of shooting and constantly seeing the enemy your up against, the fact that you hardly see the xenomorphs gives a real feeling of being scared when you do see them.

            "content": "By 1986, James Cameron had already made a huge impression on the Science Fiction genre with THE TERMINATOR, yet no one could have anticipated the scope of the man's talents before he was approached to direct the sequel to Ridley Scott's ALIEN. In ALIENS, Cameron improves on perfection, delivering all of the same thrills and chills from the original along with blockbuster action sequences and mind-blowing special effects. Not only that, but the film stages an excellent assortment of characters and a gripping plot that dramatically expands upon Dan O'Bannon's original universe. ALIENS is quite simply the greatest Science Fiction adventure the genre has ever known.\n\nWarrant Officer Ellen Ripley has been rescued from deep space 57 years after her deadly encounter with the alien organism that she and her crew recovered from a remote world. Since then, the planet has been inhabited by terraformers sent by The Company to prepare LV-426 for colonization. When communication to the command center is lost, The Company requests that Ripley joins a group of elite military soldiers on a rescue mission to LV-426, but what they find is a planet overrun by the killer alien species!\n\nCameron has no reservation whatsoever in taking his time with ALIENS. Although the first half of the film is entirely without action, Cameron's pacing never falters. The opening act is used primarily to demonize the cold, heartless company, whose bottom line means more than human lives. We are also drawn closer to the character of Ellen Ripley, who is given more emotional depth as she deals with the death of her daughter and prepares to risk herself for the lives of others. The action is stalled even after the marines disembark on LV-426, where we find terror and anticipation stalking the halls of the abandoned colony instead of aliens. Once the first aliens are discovered in the reactor core, however, it is non-stop action from there on out.\n\nThe Colonial Marines of Earth's future are the second key to ALIENS' success. As Hudson so eloquently puts it, \"I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass art! You do NOT wanna fuck with me.\" And he's right. These marines are armed to the teeth with an arsenal of advanced weaponry and futuristic vehicles that make them a force to be reckoned with. Bill Paxton, as Hudson, is loud-mouthed and head-strong. Michael Biehn, AKA Hicks, is the noble guardsman, selfless and brave. Jenette Goldstein, AKA Vasquez, is the ruthless mercinary and weapons expert who prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. Together, they form the baddest team the universe has ever known, but they still can't compare to their civilian escort, Ripley.\n\nSigourney Weaver succeeds even over her previous performance in ALIEN, solidifying the character of Ellen Ripley as SciFi's leading heroine. Ripley outsmarts and outmuscles even the strongest and bravest of the space marines, yet through her maternal relationship with Newt, we find a softer and more vulnerable side to the character that allows her to retain her humanity. These two worlds collide as Ripley arms herself to do battle with the alien menace one-on-one after they kidnap her surrogate daughter.\n\nLike Scott before him, Cameron chooses to keep the aliens hidden throughout the majority of the picture, despite the fact that there are several hundred more of them in the sequel. Stan Winston steps in to handle the creature effects, giving the aliens an even more insect-like appearance that carries over into their hive mentality. With the help of his talented crew, he also brings to life the Alien Queen, a monstrous new addition to the series that is meaner, nastier, and more impressive than the drones, themselves. This towering 15 foot beast required two men in costume in addition to several puppetiers and a hydraulic lift to fully articulate its head and body. In the final climactic battle, Ripley mans a robotic powerlifter in an intergalactic grudge match against the snarling Queen that demonstrates the pinnacle of practical effects. The Academy would later recognize ALIENS with the Oscar for Visual Effects, which it most clearly deserved.\n\nWhile it is impossible to decide which is the better film between ALIEN and ALIENS, each are remarkable in their own separate ways, and must be considered masterworks of the Science Fiction genre. The claustrophobic tension of Ridley Scott's film has been traded in for a galaxy of terror.",

I loved everything about it, I was entertained during the whole 2 long hours, I was scared the whole 2 long hours, I was thrilled during the whole 2 long hours and I was blewed away during the whole 2 long hours. Aliens is an unforgettable movie and one of the best sci-fi movies in movie history. I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't, it's truly fantastic and if you got totally impressed with Alien, well, than here, you'll be amazed, because this is a fantastic movie and one of the only sequels in history that surprases the original, the terrific original. I highly recommend this movie, it's just so well written and directed that doesn't even seem a sequel, this is those kinds of movies that you just can't miss. Aliens stands out, mostly because of Cameron and Weaver, I loved their work and I loved the way they made this movie being so incredible. Masterpiece movie.\n\nJames Camern directed it and wrote it, James did a magnificent job and he must have re-watched Alien thousands of times, cause he did a fantastic follow-up. Sigourney Weaver was amazing, her amazing performance was worth of an Oscar and again, I think Alien(s) would never be the same without her, she is just fantastic and her performance is just unforgettable, Sigourney is known from Alien, Avatar, Paul, Cedar Rapids, The Cabin in the Woods and some other movies. Michael Biehn was great, Michael is known from The Terminator, The Abyss, The Rock, The Divide and some other movies. Carrie Henn was great, she was almost only 10 years old but still, with her lack of acting experience, she had a great and solid performance, Carrie Henn is only known from Aliens, she only starred in this movie, but I think that only starring in this movie is good enough to have an amazing reputation. Paul Reiser was just okay, Paul is known from Mad About You, The Thing About My Folks and some other movies. Lance Henriksen was great, playing a robot/artificial person, Lance is known from The Terminator, The Arcadian and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a great cast, expept for Sigourney, none of the actors from the rest of the cast are really popular or had amazing performances here, but I enjoyed every performance, but Sigourney's is really the one that stands out. Great cast.\n\n57 years after Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) surived the horrible happening, her escape vessel is found drifting in the middle of the space where she was sleeping in cryogenic stasis. The planet LV-426 has been conolized but one day, contact is lost. Although no one on earth believed her story about everything that happened 57 seven years ago, she is requested to aid a team of Marines on a rescue mission. Now, everything is getting worst, for everybody, but especially for Ripley, who is now going to relive the horror of those beasts. This time there's more.(What I thought about the plot) The plot was genius and incredibly smart, James did a perfect job and I think this plot was a great example of writing a plot of a sequel that has many things that can be realted to the first, but still, we know that you're watching a diferent sequel, I completely loved it, the new characters were fantastic, especially Newt and I think James did a remarcable job. Terrific plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack was amazing, worth of an Oscar-nomination, the score was great and was appropriatte to every scene and I think it was very well composed. The action was great, there was probably more action scenes than there were in the first film, there truly great action scenes along the movie. The visual effects were great and even though I'm only blewed away with these days movies because those are the ones that really can blow a person away, when I watched this and I knew it was a movie from 1986, I was just blewed away, the visual effects were awesome and they were worth of a deserved Oscar, they did a tremendous job.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, Aliens it's not just a movie, it's an experience of a life time, it's truly amazing watching a blockbuster that can actually be considered a masterpiece, Aliens was easily the 80s best movie, it's full of entertainment, action and humor, it has a great storyline and it's very well-acted, I completely loved it. Sow, Aliens is like a new (and better) version of Alien, it's scarier, it's more thrilling and it's more entertaining, I highly recommend it, besides, it has an 8.5 on IMDb and it's on IMDb's Top 250 at #58. Overall, Aliens is an unforgettable film, it's a perfect classic, it's an extremely well-achieved movie and it'll always be highlighted in movie history, it has a great cast, (a) terrific performance(s), a terrific plot, an amazing score, great action scenes, amazing visual effects, an amazing storyline and it's highly entertaining, scary, thrilling and stressful by making us try to figure out what it's going to happen. I loved it and I highly recommend it, it's a movie that you just can't miss. Aliens: 9.5/10. Terrific.\n\nTerrific movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: A.",

Al igual que películas brillantes como 'El caballero oscuro', sobresale del género y aterriza con buen pie, firmando un gran filme con detalles únicos. Esto se debe a su estructura y la fórmula que sigue: es lenta, pero sirve para ambientar al espectador y ponerlo en la situación de los personajes, como si estuviera con ellos. Un plus a esto es su \"in crescendo\" de tensión, más astuto que la primera. Pero cómo iba a conseguirse esto sin su apartado visual, muy acertado e impecable (como cualquier filme de nuestro amigo James) ni sin las excelentes actuaciones, destacando a una Sigourney Weaver mucho más fuerte e intrépida, pero también más humana. Todos los personajes tienen un muy buen desarrollo y bien equilibrado y en cierto modo entre ellos hay una moraleja/didáctica (a ver si la encontráis), como queráis llamarlo. El error de su antecesora parece volver a cometerse (la primera hora sin haber visto la segunda puede parecer muy lento), pero no, y de hecho se puede disfrutar de grandes escenas con los aliens. A todo ello se le suma la banda sonora; sabe cuándo entrar en escena y da en el clavo, y además consta de melodías potentes. Todos estos elementos cumplen perfectamente y dejan una cinta redonda. Habrá quienes les guste más el género de terror y se inclinen por la primera, y otros a los que les gustará más la acción y prefieran su secuela, ya estén siendo absolutamente subjetivos o subjetivamente objetivos. Mi criterio deja eso a un lado y elige esta secuela, no sólo por gusto, sino por calidad; me ha encantado, y al mismo tiempo me ha parecido no sólo LA película de Cameron, sino uno de las mejores de la historia del cine.
