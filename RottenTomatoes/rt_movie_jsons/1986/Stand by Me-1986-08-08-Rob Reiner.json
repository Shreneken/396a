    "summary": "After learning that a stranger has been accidentally killed near their rural homes, four Oregon boys decide to go see the body. On the way, Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) encounter a mean junk man and a marsh full of leeches, as they also learn more about one another and their very different home lives. Just a lark at first, the boys' adventure evolves into a defining event in their lives.",

Even worth revisiting is the film's power to capture and resonate without much fuss. It stirs deep within you without being too mushy, makes you laugh without being trying to be funny, and best of all, it awakens a delicious sense of must-have nostalgia.",

            "content": "I am by no means saying that this was a badly made or acted movie, I can appreciate talented writing and acting; this is just my personal opinion. I found it more than anything; depressing and disturbing. A friend described it to me by saying it was \"like the goonies\" to that I say no, no it's not. It had some same actors and some similar themes, that's it. It was a lot more morbid and desperate. \n\nThe main kid is obsessed with finding this dead body, not for justice or for fame but just because he \"needed to see it\". It's disturbing the lengths this group go to to find said body, almost dying in the process. It isn't fun or light-hearted (like the goonies) and it just seemed to me like it explored the tragic abuse, trauma, depression or bullying of four young boys. Many people might enjoy this type of film (very emotional, sad, almost desolate in that way) but it's not something I like to watch so I did not enjoy it at all.\n\nIt's the kind of film that if you're not ready for it will leave you feeling physically sick and like you've misunderstood or missed something (especially when the upbeat happy music starts playing with the credits). In my opinion you would not be missing anything by not watching this movie.\n\nI'd like to specify that it is not emotional in the way that it would make you cry or empathise, but emotional in the way that you have sympathy for the characters in parts and pure disappointment in the people around them. \n\nHaving only just watched it I am left almost speechless, I don't know how to elaborate. I'm going to have to watch another (preferably upbeat) movie before I sleep tonight. (This disturbed me, and I had no problem sleeping both through and after watching things like Jigsaw on separate occasions)",

This was a great relatable film when I first saw it growing up and it still feels not only nostalgic but relevant today.  Kiefer Sutherland is fantastically intimidating as the young tough leader of his gang of friends.",

River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton's connection is the true heart of this film. They both struggle with personal demons that deal with how they are being perceived in relation to their respective families by those within and outside those very families. And through sharing their struggle with each other, neither sees their dilemma cleanly resolved or finds answers for how to make the mess go away. They just gain greater understanding--and greater strength--of how to live with it and persevere through it.\n\nThe real life story behind River Phoenix makes his character's fate that much more difficult to digest. But as film's namesake plays over the ending credits, we're left with a gentle optimism. A bittersweet one, no doubt. But one that's rejuvenating. Full of life.",

            "content": "As you are well aware, there have been many film adaptations of Stephen King's work.  The adaptations have been on both the big and small screen.  They range from excellent (The original miniseries \"The Stand\" starring Gary Sinise, Rob Lowe and Molly Ringwald. \"The Green Mile\".  Both the big and small screen adaptations of \"It\".) to absolutely horrible (\"Graveyard Shift\".  Silver Bullet\".  \"The Lawnmower Man\").  However, there is one that stands above all else and that is \"Stand By Me\".  Based on King's novella \"The Body\" that was originally published in the 1982 book \"Different Seasons\", the movie is, I would say, 99% faithful to its source material but there are some inevitable changes (In the novella, the fictional town of Castle Rock is in Maine.  In the movie, it is in Oregon where the movie was filmed.  The novella is set in the summer of 1959, the movie in the summer of 1960.  In the novella, Ace Merrill and his gang exact revenge on the protagonist and his friends and it is brutal.), but those changes do not have a negative effect on the story or the movie as a whole.  I don't think I have seen a movie more perfectly cast as \"Stand By Me\".  The late River Phoenix was in my opinion the best of the entire cast.  He played the part of Christopher Chambers to perfection.  Why he did not receive an Oscar nomination (Hell, why he did not win!) is inexcusable.  Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman (Easily the best performance of his career.) and Jerry O'Connell (His motion picture debut.) are phenomenal, but Phoenix's performance stood out for me.  Emmy Award winner Kiefer Sutherland was excellent (and even frightening) as rival gang leader John \"Ace\" Merrill.  An excellent display of his acting talent.  His performance send chills up my spine every time I watch it.  In fact I still think he is going to put his cigarette out in River Phoenix's eye.  The scenes featuring the four lead characters are all very well written and even take dialogue from \"The Body\" almost verbatim.  They translate very well to the screen.  As you watch the movie you almost forget that you are actually watching a movie, the performances almost seem real which is just another reason why this movie work so well on just about every level.  Director Rob Reiner has a very impressive resume (Though unfortunately \"North\" is included on that.), but \"Stand By Me\" is definitely his magnum opus.  More than thirty years after its initial release, \"Stand By Me\" stands the test of time.  Even if you are not a fan of Stephen King I highly recommend you see this truly excellent movie.  You will not be disappointed.",

This is a very nostalgic movie for me, maybe I love it so much because it is such a grounded story and maybe I love it because of my friends and how much my friends are like them, and I love how much I can relate to them. Their chemistry really works in this movie and I buy them being best friends and if you can't capture that it won't work but they capture that magic and they make it amazing. This movie really makes me want to grow up in the 80's. The ending some might not like but I think it will leave you in awe for me it did at least.\n\nThe acting like I said before is very good and if the acting wasn't good then we wouldn't buy into the friendships but they do such a good job and we buy into the friendships. The score and the soundtrack is one of my favorites in any movie it feels like the whole movie. The cinematography is pretty good but some things don't hold up and one scene in particular when they are running from a train you can tell they aren't running from a train but for the time that was very good and kinda their version of CGI. The script is very good and it feels like my friends talking and that is very surprising and this movie has one of my favorite scripts.\n\nLike I said before some elements don't hold up like the jokes and some practical and technical things don't hold up well. Overall I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone especially if you grew up in the 80's.\n95%\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udf82",

            "content": "Stand By Me, the 1986 coming-of-age film, directed by Rob Reiner, and based on the Stephen King short story The Body, is one of my so called 'Perfect Films.' A perfect film to me has all of the elements of a good story: comedy, adventure, horror, suspense, and romance. Yes, this movie does not have romance, but in a way it does: in the sense of being in love with your youth during an adventurous summer.\n\nThe film Stand By Me is a timeless one. It's the kind of film that when you see it for the first time, or the 50th time, it gives you that nostalgic feeling of familiarity, that safe feeling of pre-pubescent adventure and care-free outlook.\n\nThe actors are great, perfectly cast, and deliver fine performances across the board. Arguably it is an all-star cast: Richard Dreyfuss (narrator), River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, Will Wheaton, Kiefer Sutherland, and John Cusack to name a few. They all respectively show great range, and are all perfectly cast.\n\nThe film takes place in Oregon, during Labor Day weekend of 1959. Like I said before, it is based on Stephen King's The Body, which is in his short story collections Different Seasons (which also has Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption and Apt Pupil so it's awesome). The adult Gordie Lachance (Dreyfuss) narrates the story via flashback while writing a novel. The flashback tells the story about him and his friends embarking on a quest to find the body of a local, missing boy near the town of Castle Rock. Speaking of Castle Rock, the antagonist here is Sutherland's younger Ace Merrill.\n\nWhile the story unfolds, it is revealed that all of the boys are dealing with their own personal issues, all while helping each other in their own way. Gordie (Wheaton) is still grieving and guilt-ridden over the death of his older brother, Teddy (Feldman) is an abused child desperately in denial of his father's malice, Chris (Phoenix) comes from a broken home, and Vern (O'Connell) is shy and timid, while trying to make his way.\n\nWe learn more and more about each individual as they trek on through the Oregon wilderness in order to find the body, but what they are really searching for are themselves. We start to care more about the characters, and one-by-one we begin to relate to them. The 1950's contemporary rock and roll soundtrack really plays into the story too.\n\nThe film and story age very well, which can be very tough to do when using a period piece that takes place from another decade. They don't need to rely on special effects and technology, and the dialogue from King's work is carefully chose and respective to that time. The set decorations (see the general store), and costumes, are perfectly chosen.\n\nStand By Me is brilliantly woven using comedy (watch for the pie-eating contest scene), horror (the boys' imaginations in the forest), drama, suspense, and adventure. It's reportedly one of the few film adaptations of his works that Stephen King likes, and I think they got it right too.",

            "content": "Stand By Me is one of the high-quality film ever to come from a Stephen King story. The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best buddies in the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was once apparently hit via a train. The boys stumble upon bullies, different trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many different things on their trip. They have some incredibly deep and emotional conversations along the way.\nThis is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The crew is portrayed flawlessly by way of four extraordinary young actors. At instances they laugh, other instances they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, however when challenged by means of the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who performs the adult writer, narrates the motion as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.\nStand by Me is not a perfect movie according to some reviewers. TOMASBBloodhound states, \"Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself.\" A lot of people agree that there is also a whole lack of positive supporting characters for the duration of the scenes set lower back when they have been kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a effective older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them have been jerks! The script makes use of extra swear words than are without a doubt quintessential to bring the anger these children now and again feel. You'd suppose any useless body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they locate out in the woods. Wouldn't this child have heard the educate coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you would think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. Those are some of the only critiques that reviewers have with this movie.\nIt seems like the film is attempting to portray the lifeless Brower boy as the loss of life of these kids' innocence or some thing to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they had been feeling. I totally agree that some of the people you thought have been your best pals eventually simply turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later. Despite its faults, this is a powerful film you are not likely to forget. It is one of Reiner's nice works, and the terrific forged does some high-quality work themselves.\nOverall Stand by Me is a must see. Some people consider that this movie is solely for the boys however in my opinion it is for everyone. It brings back childhood recollections of spending time with friends. Times were different back then but everyone can still relate to this film in someway and experience the film.\n",

            "content": "Review:\n'Stand by Me' is an American coming-of-age film directed by Rob Reiner. It is based on Stephen King's 1982 novella 'The Body'. This is without a doubt the best coming of age movie around, it has good acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you hooked to the screen throughout the film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everybody in some way can relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and the times you had together.\nThe film follows a group of friends Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell) on a journey to find for a dead body they heard about through the town's folk.\nThe acting is just phenomenal, really some of the best child acting I was seen. Now, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits (in a good way). You could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like this.\nAs a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time in a youth's life where they feel free.\nOverall, I believe this film is for everybody. It tells a great story and it's always entertaining and never slows down. It's a classic, and it aged well.\n5/5",

            "content": "It's ironic that the two best filmed adaptations from legendary horror author Stephen King are both dramas (this film and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" from 1994). After surreptitiously overhearing the location of a dead body, four adolescents in the late Fifties take a two-day trek down the train tracks to find it and become heroes. Along the way, they all experience their own painful maturation processes, learning important lessons about themselves and about life in general.\n\nI didn't grow up in the late Fifties, but I can still appreciate the camaraderie displayed by the four lead actors. Every generation has its own trials and tribulations and yet, as unique as we feel they are, they are universally felt. We are not as alone in our experiences as we think. There's something inherently comforting about that notion. As for this particular group of youngsters, each one has their own well-defined persona that never falls into a stereotype of juvenescence. River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton show more honest emotion in their performances than many veteran actors would ever be able to muster.\n\nThere's some genuine humor scattered about, notably in the form of a junkyard dog named Chopper and in the tale of a vengeful overweight teenager Gordie tells his compatriots around a campfire one evening. Dramatic tension is equally represented during a frightful race across a train trestle and a stressful confrontation with the town bullies over who gets to lay claim to the body of Ray Brower. The inclusion of Richard Dreyfuss's narration is a perfect topper to a magnificent work of art. The film's final denouement is one of the saddest, most insightful pieces of philosophy you're ever likely to come across in cinema. I've never seen a better coming of age story on the silver screen than \"Stand by Me\" . . . and I feel it's highly unlikely I ever will.",

There aren't many films that capture the experience of being a kid better than Stand By Me. The four main kids on a quest to see a dead body have different personalities, are relatable, and are not dumbed-down. There is an offensive practice in Hollywood films where children are portrayed as cardboard cutouts with no original thoughts or motivations, but this film builds living, meditative children who aren't oblivious to the harsh reality that life prods at their noses. The kids have real human emotion and address themes such as death, child abuse and family dysfunction through smart, realistic dialogue bolstered by great performances.\n\nGreat child performances. It is hard to watch Stand By Me without the behind-the-scenes reality creeping in of River Phoenix's tragic death of drug overdose at such a young age. The amazing performance he gives as Chris showcases the incredible talent he had for the craft and a true promise of a phenomenal career ahead had his life not been cut short. But it is not just River Phoenix that carries the film, Corey Feldman (Teddy), Wil Wheaton (Gordie) and Jerry O'Connel (Vern) inhabit their roles believably. When existential struggles surface, they react genuinely and evoke empathy because these are real kids dealing with real issues. Without the outstanding performances given by each child lead, the film would suffer and cross into something overly sentimental.\n\nOne of the definitive coming-of-age films. The boys in the film are at a crossroads in their life and despite the complexity/abrasiveness of their situation, they are still normal boys in an Oregon small town. The film is narrated by an adult Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss) writing his memoir, recounting the parable of childhood friends on an adventure to help emphasize that, despite the often gloomy subtext to the boy's lives, nothing will ever feel as uncomplicated or innocent as your experiences with childhood friends because it predates the loss of innocence and the painful circumstances of adult life.",

            "content": "The quintessential coming of age drama.\n\nStand by Me (1986) is a coming of age drama focused in on childhood nostalgia for the good old days of hanging out with your best friends. Rob Reiner directed his finest film with Stand by Me. Reiner recreates the 1950's with the clothing, music, town setting, natural surroundings, and the open journey adventure these children undertake. His long panning shots down winding train tracks and forest paths are as gorgeous as the sun sets and warm feelings of yesterday. \n\nAs much as it is a suspense film based off of Stephen King's novella The Body, it takes a hard look at parents' cruelty and neglect in the 1950s while King demonstrates the harsh bullying and lazy days of waiting around for something fun to happen. Stand by Me is a triumph of realism in kids playing together. They eat, joke, swear, and go on adventures in the gorgeous natural surrounding all while mourning lost ones, building new friendships, strengthening old friendships, telling stories, and dreaming of the future.\n\nStand by Me features an all star cast of excellent child actors. From the dejected, shy authorial type Will Wheaton to chubby goofball Jerry O'Connell. Also, Corey Feldman is the wildly funny and outgoing adrenaline freak with a damaged past. Lastly, the late River Phoenix stars as the tough guy with a heart of gold and kind empathy. I miss Phoenix as an actor for his depth and realism as much as his pained eyes convey even more hurt already. You could already tell he would be the next era of acting after Stand by Me. All these kids were just so believable and likable in Stand by Me.\n\nI must mention Stand by Me also has Kiefer Sutherland as the mean bully with a death wish. His presence is always felt as he exudes menace from the first time we see him. John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss have nicely understated cameo supporting roles too.\n\nI highly recommend Stand by Me to all audiences that are teenagers and older. It is filled with great humor that is easy to laugh along with, while the drama that comes with getting older should relate to anyone.",

I was 13 years old when this film was released and absolutely loved it. Rob Reiner did a fantastic job in directing this masterpiece, especially by getting the most out of his young actors. As a group, all four played very well off each other with a solid supporting cast including John Cusack, Kiefer Sutherland and Richard Dreyfuss. Along with a solid adapted screenplay from Stephen King's book, the movie was backed with a rich soundtrack of period music from the 1950's, including Ben E. King's hit song Stand By Me. In my opinion, what really set this film apart was the late River Phoenix and his portrayal of Chris Chambers. Watching his performance in this film showed us that River was an old soul. I vividly remember that summer before I saw the movie being at the grocery store and looking through the latest teen magazines. As I was skimming through the pages, I came across a promotional cast photo from Stand By Me with the four main players wearing their regular street clothes. This was the first time I saw River and he stood out from the other three in a way I still can't explain. Funny as it might sound, River seemed to have this aura about him. There was just something about him, even in a photograph, such a presence that implied this kid was special and was going to be huge. It still saddens me remembering that Halloween back in 1993 and the news of his passing at only 23 years old. However, Stand By Me will continue to be the timeless classic it has become for future generations to discover.",

The structure doesn't divide itself into various acts, it's just a big marvelous adventure of love, laugh and life. The writing is adaptive and strong with humorous sketchy bits that never leaves the bridge of practicality. \n\nIt follows probably the best structure of the script as in, it starts funny and light and then grows a bit sensitive and sensible with a heartfelt ending that echoes through the audience even after one leaves the screen. The background score may not be up to the mark but the cinematography and editing is purely magical in here. \n\nDevouring the nature in each aspects, the camera work is beautiful with stunning visuals and mesmerizing location that helps foliate it. Having said that, it also has a poignancy that can be inedible for the viewers and some boldy essential questions are raised too.\n\nThe young cast shows some promising skills, if doesn't go as anticipated it certainly works, the performance is in safe hands. Reiner's execution delivers unflinchingly in here and shows tremendous amount of finesse with the help of explicit adaptation.

As they always say, the journey is more important then the destination. Watching these boys grow as human beings during their 2 day walk is simply amazing and needs to be witnessed by every young man going through puberty. The individual scenes, narrated perfectly by the main character Gordy's adult self, showcase each boy as a unique entity and allow for us the audience to truly become invested in their singular stories and to truly feel for these kids.

            "content": "Film Review : Stand by Me\n\nStand by me is an astonishing film based on the novella \" the body\" by Stephen King. This movie is about these four best friends : Gordie Lachance, Chris Chamber, Vern Tessio and Teddy Duchamp who go on this thrilling adventure to find the body of a dead boy, Ray Brower.\n\nEach of these young 12-13 years old boys have an interesting story: Gordie (main character) lived with his mother,father and brother. Sadly, his brother Denny passed away and Gordie felt like he wasn't really paid any attention to. Chris (the leader of their \"Gang\"), has a father that drinks too much and a brother, Eyeball Chambers, who is also leader of another gang and a bully. \nChris is kind of on his own as well. Vern lives with his brother, Billy Tessio who is another bully (in eyeball's gang) and his parents. Then, there is Teddy Duchamp, he has a burnt ear because his dad was an alcoholic who had anger issues and put his ear on the stove.\n\nHonestly, I have some few things I don't really like about the film. For me, the ending was kind of sad... I wish I could change it to make it happier. Then there is a part in the movie that involves a certain animal, which I find disturbing. Expect for these two facts, there isn't more that I dislike about the movie.\n\nNow, one of the things I liked about the movie is that it's well structured ; at the beginning, they are not really grown up, goofing around with each other... and at the end, they overcame dangerous and daring obstacles which made them more mature and they stood up for each other. Next, there is the basic idea of the story (which is all based on finding the body), I really like adventure films, action films but, it's also a comedy film because it contains some funny parts. Also, I really like the characters. Gordie is my favourite because he's full of surprises and unexpected. I can't say more or I will reveal spoilers.\n\nMy favourite part in the movie would be around the middle of the film. They face a great danger containing a vehicle in very ,very high place. It just keeps you guessing : will they get out of it? What's going to happen? And it makes you feel like you're there just witnessing the scene waiting for something to just happen. What's good is that we feel as if we struggle with the boys as they grow older (mentally).\n\nStand by me is probably a film appropriate for young teenagers looking for adventures, action and comedy. By reading the description, you might think that only younger children will appreciate this film but that's not true at all : this film deals with the hard times of change, self acceptance and obviously, friendship. I think that for younger audiences, it would be hard for them to understand the complexity of these themes. And adults would like this film too, it might remind them of their childhood, the adventures they went on as kids.\n\nMoving on, Stand by me is a film with a lot of imagery : there is the narrator's voice during the film, sometimes he talks while describing something like : the weather, how they felt, their surroundings... if we close our eyes, we can imagine the scene, we don't even have to look at what's happening since it's so well described. Besides imagery, You can't really find much of figurative language since it is a film.\n\nNow I can relate to the film in certain ways. When I was younger, I was goofing around lot with my friends (I still do but less) but in a different way. Some scenes of this film made me remember some times I had with my friends that I don't usually think about. \n\nIn conclusion, I think this is a pretty good film that I recommend to a lot of people. It's funny and shows phases of growing up that we can discover. I give it a rating of  ????????/5  because, as I said in the 3rd paragraph, the ending isn't really great and I am not a fan of a certain scene.",

I could also recommend it for older people.\n\nThe film you can see some character development and relationship development. At the beginning that the boys do dangerous and stupid stuff but at the end they are more matured. \n\nThe film scenario is created in a way that it feels it really happened because on of the boys Gordon appears as an adult during the beginning and the end. He also talks in way to make it sound real.",

But they meat some problems along the way like being chased by a train or being covered with leeches all over their body. Step by step the boy's friendship grows and they become more confident in one another. Sometimes they feel very sad but it doesn't stop them from going further. They rely on one another and help each other to survive. They learn many things they didn't understand before.\n\nI recommend this film to teenagers and maybe adults who love adventure and suspense as they will comprehend better than children and sometimes there are violent scenes.\n\nThis film talks about growing up and discovering places the main characters have never been before as they have never left their small village.\n\nGordie(the main character) has a wonderful personality, he loves writing stories although his father thinks it's a waste of time. His brother died in a car accident and since then his life changed. This journey helped him forget all the troubles that were beginning to destroy his mind.",

It is about four boys who are in secret competition against bullies to find the body of a boy who was killed by a train. On the way, they face terrifying dangers in scenes that made mine and will make your heart pound for the safety of the adorable characters from this movie. \n\nMy favourite character is Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton) because he seems shy and is funny, but at one unexpected moment he takes up courage to defend his friend. Gordie's best friend Chris is the complete opposite: he is brave and sneaky. You can definitely see Gordie's character develop into someone like Chris, and their relationship grows deeper and better.\n\nI find the overall storyline intriguing, amusing and exciting. Each character visibly develops into a better person. Additionally, there is a wide range of emotions spread out throughout the movie, but, in a good way.\n\nThe style of the movie is fun with a bit of swearing but a really nice flow to the film making it interesting and very realistic in the sense that you cannot tell that they are acting.\n\nI recommend this film for people who like adventure movies perhaps over the age of 9 or 10 may be more appropriate, but I must say that this has to be one of my favourite movies.",

On their comical journey the boys discover themselves as they conquer fears, test their limits, and bid farewell the last of their childhood innocence.\nEven 30 years after its initial release date, \" Stand by Me\" is still a film worth watching. The film transports audiences back in time to their childhood with its all star cast, and fun 50's music bringing on a feeling of nostalgia.

Out of all the famous films by director Rob Reiner, I didn't expect this film to be the last for me to watch and review it, as I heard that it's basically the first well known that shows what kids actually act like when they're hanging out with friends. In all honesty, I should've watched it sooner as this is a classic to watch. This is the best group of kid actors that I've seen in years as they acted like regular kids, but not the annoying kinds. The writing by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon understands what kids talk like, saying curse words, smoking cigarettes, and about women in general, which they give off some memorable lines. The characters are memorable as they give enough development that got me to learn more about them. The plot is very interesting, and it has enough humor in it that keeps me interested in what's going on.

The plot is fairly straightforward really -  a group of twelve-year-old kids walk 20 miles along a train track to find a rumoured dead body in the woods. Nothing massively dramatic really happens along the way if the truth be told. They take a pit-stop in a junkyard, a train comes when they're crossing a bridge, and they get some leeches on them passing through a swamp. But that's not really where the legend of this movie comes from, I don't think. \n\nThe lasting appeal of this movie comes from the nostalgia that it evokes of a very specific and melancholic time of life. The time between youth and adulthood, when innocence is dying and the harsh realities of life are breaking in. It's one everyone can relate to. \n\nThere's some clever metaphors that help establish the coming-of-age tone too. The kids start their journey in a hot, summer haze, representing the halcyon, care-free days of youth. By the end of the movie, the summer is ending and the kids are going their separate ways. When they find the body, the sun has gone down and there looks like there's a chill in the air. The long journey itself with death at the end is a metaphor for life itself. \n\nNormally I hate movies that end on a note of melancholy. If I'd written it, the four of them would have remained friends for life and (spoiler alert), we'd never have discovered that Chris died young. Having said that, if I'd written the story I'd have drastically reduced the profanity and improved their general behaviour too. It's actually quite hard to like the group at first, especially Teddy. They're mouthy, rebellious brats. I wouldn't say I loved them by the end either, but I could at least have some sympathy for why they were all so messed up. \n\nBut melancholy is indeed how it ends. And that's the feeling that stays with you. And I think it stays with you because within us all there's a little bit of sadness for our lost childhood innocence. This movie just taps into that feeling.",

A simple narrative - four pre-teenage boys in 1959 Oregon go looking for a dead body - becomes the pretext for personal revelation and self-discovery. Richard Dreyfuss' narration and Will Wheaton's central performance are sublime. The death of River Phoenix has only added another layer of poignancy to a very fine film.",

It makes you long for simpler times, where you could while away endless summers with your best friends.  Wil Wheaton, Joaquin Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell are all brilliant as the leads.  They perfectly captured what a group of teenage boys are really like.  The line that the film ends is my favourite and is one of the strongest in the film.  It brilliantly encapsulates all of the themes of the film: I never had friends later on like I did when I was twelve.  Jesus, did anyone?\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/PjDndO",

            "content": "\"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve,\" The Writer (Richard Dreyfuss) reflects at the end of \"Stand By Me.\" \"Jesus, does anyone?\" A story of male bonding that dances to the beat of adolescence, nostalgia, and the 1950s, it is a coming-of-age film of acuity and acceptably genial sentimentality, as oftentimes funny as it is soul-baring.  Adapted from the novella of the same name by Stephen King, \"Stand By Me\" is an uncommonly wise genre film aching with a bittersweetness that manages to get to you without being coy about it. \n\tSet in 1959 over Labor Day weekend, the film stars Wil Wheaton as Gordie Lachance, a vulnerable preteen whose family life has been dramatically deterred by the tragic death of his older brother (John Cusack).  The younger version of The Writer, Gordie predominantly spends his after school hours with a trio of boys who differ in personality but compare in their lack of self-confidence.  There's Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), a ne'er-do-well in the making whose family's reputation precedes him; Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), the cocky but damaged son of an abuser; and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), a stocky jokester who hides his insecurities in humor, intentionally or otherwise.\n\tTheir relationships are tested, though, when Vern informs them that he knows the whereabouts of a missing classmate, whose dead body lays twenty-some miles away after being struck by a train.  It's only a rumor - Vern's grapevine of information came from eavesdropping on his older brother - but all are curious, wanting to have an adventure, see what a dead body looks like, and maybe even become local heroes in the process.  Having terrible kinships with their families and therefore unworried about such mundanities as curfews, they start on their journey without hesitation.  And so begins a weekend's worth of adherence, revelatory exchanges, and golden moments of memory making; all will be changed, for better or worse, after their exploits come to a close.\n\tWhile its premise remains simple, \"Stand By Me\" is the effectual comedy-drama that it is because it's so rooted in accessibility.  Like Dreyfuss's wizened Writer, we can all agree that the friends we make during our youth are perhaps the best friends a person can have.  There's something markedly previous about that short period before puberty when nobody knows anything about life yet, when imaginations still have the capacity to run wild but are restrained by the figuring out of one's identity.  And \"Stand By Me,\" capturing that susceptible time with singular clarity, is all the more impactful because of it.  The screenplay, co-written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, is remarkable in the way it so pitch-perfectly captures the way wily twelve-year-olds interact with one another, jokingly or emotionally.  Rob Reiner, an ace of the 1980s popcorn movie, directs with saccharine that feels completely appropriate rather than helplessly maudlin.\n\tBut we, of course, take such a liking to \"Stand By Me\" as a result of its young performers, who inhabit their characters blisteringly and arrestingly.  O'Connell plays comic relief with naturally humorous flair, more in the spirit of a weathered comedian than a child actor.  Feldman is understatedly poignant as a kid who covers his neuroses with wit that seems to be increasingly lined in self-doubt the more we get to know him.  But especially stellar are Wheaton and Phoenix, whose characters are the closest of the bunch and whose performances are prodigiously stirring.  Whereas O'Connell and Feldman prove to be items (though delightful ones) of background, Wheaton and Phoenix are distinctly three-dimensional, both, on separate occasions, having breakdowns in the arms of the other and radiating sympathetic pain that we respond to with immediacy.  No one in its juvenile cast descends into camera mugging territory - all spitefully mature and all gifted actors, it's incredible that the age range of its central quartet only goes from twelve to fifteen.  Some adult professionals struggle to capture similar nuance.\n\tBut that's why \"Stand By Me\" has lasted so long as a childhood classic for the people who grew up with it: it doesn't know what artificiality is, and doesn't know how to stay secure in the downfalls of redundant formula.  Its sincerity is everlasting, its emotional content invigoratingly unfeigned.  You'd have to be fitted with an ash covered heart to turn your back on its loving melancholy.",

The acting of the four lead boys is average for their age range but the story still comes through.  I expected more from Corey Feldman, but I certainly did not expect to see 20-year-old Kiefer Sutherland!  I appreciate the progression that the boys experience.  Legends (like Chopper) are revealed to be tall tales and the boys discover that you are not always rewarded for doing the right thing.  The film is full of important messages but the content may be too rough for the younger kids who might benefit.  The whole pie-eating sequence feels very out of place and eats up too much of this film's short 90-minute runtime.  I understand that part of Gordie's character is his love of writing and storytelling, but I can think of better ways to spend my time than watching people vomit on each other.  \"Stand By Me\" has its high and low points, but it will remind every man of his formative teenage years and the lessons that guided his path in life.",

This was pulled off by absolutly amazing acting and chemistry between the actors. It almost seems impossible that they aren't real best friends. They provided such a mature performance while holding onto the breath of childhood. I an shocked that none of these actors turned out to be the top of the top.\n\nOne small complaint I had was with some of the characters. At times certain characters just felt out of place and left a sour taste in some of the scenes. I would like to have focused more on the relationship between Gordie and Chris without the interruptions by the other boys. But like I said this is mostly just nit picking and really didn't hurt the film too much in my own opinion.\n\nIn conclusion Stand By Me is a true classic and a must see for all ages.

The camaraderie between Wheaton and Phoenix seems the strongest of the lot, and both boys make the most of it. Both of them are given the film's two most touching moments: Phoenix when he's telling a story about stealing money and Wheaton when he talks about his dead brother. The sheer honesty of these two moments are just so powerful.\n\nThe other aspects of the film are solid.

            "content": "First things first, and let's get this out of the way right out of the gate, but 15-year-old River Phoenix, assuming the film was shot in 1985 and then released in 1986, was an absolutely excellent actor.  I don't want to say that he was one of the elite actors of all time, but he was better than just about everyone BUT the truly elite by the age of FIFTEEN.  Think about that for a second.  FIFTEEN fucking years old and he's already better than a lot of people.  The film may certainly revolve around Wil Wheaton's character, but I'll be damned if River Phoenix isn't the heart and soul of this particular film.  I honestly didn't even find Wil Wheaton's character that interesting.  It's not that he doesn't have an interesting character arc, his parents ignored him after the death of his older brother, who was the apple of his parents' eyes and how he, in his own mind, believes that his parents would rather have him die instead of his older brother.  But, the fact of the matter is that without River's character for Gordie, Wil's character, to bounce that off from then the film simply wouldn't have worked on a deeper emotional level as it did.  It's not that Teddy or Vern, as characters, were useless, it's just that there's not the connection between either of them and Gordie as there is between Gordie and Chris.  So I think that, really, the entire film hinges on Chris being there and, ultimately, Gordie is inspired to write this story, as an adult, after hearing that Chris had been stabbed to death.  So Chris pretty much drives the narrative forward right from the beginning.  And I don't mean to say that Teddy or Vern don't comprise anything to the group.  Because, as a whole, these kids seemed like a great group of friends and I think the film definitely benefited from having both Vern and Teddy.  Particularly Vern, who added a comedic touch to the film.  But, as a whole, the casting is pretty much top-notch all around.  I think the film pretty much, perfectly, captures what it is like to be that age and the importance your friends are, particularly at that age, and how those bonds would change and mold you into the person you turn out to be as an adult.  Though it is also bittersweet in the sense that, even though it seemed to be like this group would be friends forever, how they eventually just drifted apart after their journey to see the dead body.  I think that's an universal theme, honestly.  Life takes you in different directions and maybe that means that you don't keep up with your friends quite like you used to in the past.  So that's quite poignant.  But, again, it also looks at the bonds you forged with these people and how important they truly are.  I think the film is incredibly well-written.  And the acting is excellent.  As mentioned, River Phoenix was just incredible here.  Jerry O'Connell and Corey Feldman are also really good here.  Honestly, I thought Wil Wheaton was the 'worst' of them all and he was still pretty good.  Very little in the way to complain about here, honestly.  This is a great movie from top-to-bottom.  It's funny and it's heartfelt.  The body, honestly, becomes irrelevant, even by the film's own implicit admission.  It's all about the journey for these boys and the journey is definitely worth taking, particularly if you haven't seen this film.  I've seen parts of it here and there, but yesterday was the first time watching it from beginning to end in one sitting.  Kinda ashamed that I waited so long to watch this honestly.  Great film.",

            "content": "Time for an adventure.  So this is about a band of four young boys in a small Oregon town.  When rumors start to circulate about a dead body of a missing classmate just outside of town, they decide to make it a day trip.  Rob Reiner really is one of my favorite sleeper directors; his name doesn't get brought up all that much when talking about the greats, but he has made a number of films that are bonafide classics (The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally...).  The films that he makes are all likable, but one thing I really appreciate is that he doesn't pad out his movies; he makes films as long as they need to be, so they have a tendency to run on the brisk side.  He's not afraid to make a movie 82 minutes long (This Is Spinal Tap) because he has a great understanding of the fact that it is better to leave the audience wanting more and not getting it, rather than risk getting tired of it.  Out of all the movies out there, this is probably the most quintessential coming of age film (when vindictively googling in \"coming of age movies\", this is second only behind The Breakfast Club).  You've got these boys on the brink of young adulthood, and they are getting pushed right over the line when they decide to make this trip.  That's also what helps to make this so memorable: this movie has a dark streak.  It's a very sordid story being told, and when you get to the epilogue, it gets downright harsh.  It makes it feel all the more realistic, though, and you 100% buy that these kids who think that swearing is cool are capable of being thrust into adulthood the moment they lay eyes on this dead body.  The adventure element to this makes it really easy to connect with.  While I would never personally go out on this trek, it is nevertheless fun to see these kids bro out with each other.  It's likable, and really captures what it's like to live in a small town where everybody knows your name.  All of these kids are types, but they are fully developed so they feel like real characters, and you can always identify with at least one of them.  Just as a side note, the visualization of the county fair was a little much, but it makes perfect sense because it's a kid telling the story.  This is great source material, and a wonderful adaptation.",

This is a movie that shows that sometimes simplicity has the greatest power. No thrills here, just good old fashioned storytelling, with a simple driving plot that moves Gordie and the rest of the gang to understanding.\n\nVern overhears where a missing boys dead body is and the gang: Gordie(Wil Wheaton), Chris(River Phoenix), Teddy(Corey Feldman), and Vern(Jerry O'Connell) decide to go looking for it. They follow the railroad tracks for a day, along the way getting into trouble at the town dump, sleeping out in the woods with coyotes around and taking a ride on an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nStand By Me is a great little adaptation of Stephen King's work. It's directed with a simple and graceful touch by Rob Reiner and the acting from the kids is phenomenal. You gotta love River Phoenix.",

Personally I do not have a favorite Character in this Film because each one was absolutely fantastic and they all had their moments to shine. Another thing I liked about this Movie is the beautiful scenery in the Woods as they were all walking on the Train Tracks, not to mention this Film has a awesome Soundtrack.

It has its moments of pure fun and even a little bit of laughter plotted here and there but I did feel the film is overrated, or maybe not but in any case I found it to be pretty good and here below is just why so.\n\nLook the plot is firm and is enjoyable and the whole reason they go out on there little adventure is truly a fun time and almost thrilling at certain points. I particularly enjoyed the more sweet moments but also level with the funny bits and so some conversations can go from problems at home or school to Your Momma jokes in three seconds. It has a creative ending and a sweet finale, one which should, and I repeat should leave you with quite a little sweet feeling inside if not slightly saddened.\n\nThe star of the film is truly River Phoenix who commands and also just generally acts better than the rest, at times he even seems to control not only the other characters but the actors themselves. I wasn't too keen on the performance of Will Wheaton who although of course was a young inexperienced actor back then, still didn't have the knack for being the main actor in the story. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell complete the young boys group and I enjoyed Feldman, annoying character but acted well and he can provide some of the more exciting moments with O'Connell being almost the butt of every single joke.\n\nI think Rob Reiner works it well here and he manages to create a piece not only enjoyable but fun, but a kind of fun where it still leaves a bit of emotion to be felt for the people involved. Getting the most out of such a highly acclaimed writers book is not easy I'm guessing and the two writers and Reiner seem to bring this story more or less to life without me feeling \"maybe the book is better\".\n\nIt's a sweet bit of fun no denying and I feel it's not just a movie for kids or people who grew up in the time its set in, it also brings a true depth and for it's relatively short running time actually creates a rather slow moving but interesting plot. It isn't new ground whatsoever but with the added bonus of the what the boys are looking for, it means that in the more generic scenes, it remains much more thrilling and mysterious than other films of this type. One particular point is that the plot is not only an adventure along a train track where four guys talk the whole way, they do things and they see things which make it much more enjoyable to us and I can't deny I felt somewhat the same emotion as how the characters felt, a scene involving a bridge with a train track on and Jerry O'Connell come to mind.\n\nOverall I felt it to be as I said pretty good and I gave it a safe 7/10 because although it's nearly a good movie, it just isn't quite there and from what some others have said about seeing this is that it's 10/10, 5 stars etc and I have to disagree. By no means don't see it, it's well worth a look and the acting, writing and directing won't let you down too much plus Richard Dreyfuss is a nice narrator.",

They are doing this because they want to become famous, but on their travels they start to become men. And we really get more in depth within the characters backgrounds. \nAll of the actors in this movie are brilliant but specifically River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton. There chemistry and realistic friendship make this movie even more believable, and through the movie we get to see friendships break, and become even more stronger than they already are. \nThe four boys are all physically and mentally different. Corey Feldman's character Teddy is literally mental. He is un-stable, we see this when he stands in front of a train and doesn't get out of the way. and keeps talking about his dad storming the beach in Normandy and is very protective over his dad even though his dad burned his ear on a stove on purpose. \nThere is also a thug group in this movie that terrorises the kids, one of them is Kiefer Sutherland who is brilliant in this movie even though he plays a complete jerk.\nThe movie is narrated by an older version of Gordie, played by Wil Wheaton who is writing a book based on his travels to find the body of a young boy. \nAt the end of the movie we hear an interesting piece of dialogue by older Wil Wheaton. \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\" This quote defines how fun it was when you were a kid and that you will never have friends like that again.\nOverall Stand by me is a beautiful movie that reminisces of the joyous childhood memories of a young boy and his friends going on an adventure, even though the outcome isn't particularly jolly.",

            "content": "I saw this movie for the first time today, and I absolutely fell in love with it.  I think that this movie shows such a boyish charm that not many movies convey.  The entire movie followed these four young boys as they went on a journey in the late 1950's.  \n\nThe story begins by introducing a man in his forties in his car reminiscing on when he was a boy and the adventure he had.  As the screen flashes to his memories, four young boys are introduced: the leader, Chris Chambers; the tough guy, Teddy Duchamp; the smart one, and Chris' best friend, Gordie Lachance; and the chubby goofball, Vern.  Vern overheard from his older brother of the location of a dead body of a boy around their age that the police have been looking for for a while.  The boys decide to embark on the journey for find the body and earn the fame from the town as heroes.  During this long hike into the woods, the boys grow and learn about each other and themselves quickly.  \n\nAfter trespassing on the land of the towns crazy junkyard owner, a fight breaks out between him and Teddy, the tough-guy.  Teddy's day is known as being a drunk and has abused Teddy for most of his life; he even held Teddy's ear to the hot stove, scalding his ear and leaving Teddy's ear looking as if he were a professional boxer.  The junkyard man mocks Teddy's father and calls him bad names, however, Teddy defends his father, he retaliates by spitting out rude and hateful comments.  The boys eventually have to pull Teddy away from the man, and they continue on their way.  Teddy's willingness to fight an adult man shows his loyalty to his father, which explains who he later becomes.\n\nThroughout the movie, Vern is seen as the happy-go-lucky one, he has a good head on his shoulders and is afraid to take big risks.  When the boys are getting close to the sight of the body, they could either take a shortcut through the woods, or keep following the train tracks.  All the boys begin running for the woods while Vern stays behind and shouts, \"It's safer to follow the tracks!  We don't know what's in there!\"  And one of the boys responds with, \"Don't be a pussy!\"  And Vern follows.  I believe that Vern's steady family results in him having a good, solid life, which results in who he grows up to be.\n\nChris Chambers, the leader of the group, is the strongest, mentally and physically.  His family is full of alcoholism and lawbreaking, he has always believed that his future is inevitable, and that he will end up exactly like his father and older brother.  He is known by the whole town for being the boy that stole some milk money once.  He explains later to Gordie that he tried to return the money, but the town still saw him as a no-good, money-stealing, mischief-maker.  During the entire movie Chris is seen as the peacemaker, he relaxes all the boys when their tempers get too high, and helps Gordie as he goes through his mental breakdowns, and Gordie helps Chris.  They make the perfect best friends because they can lean on each other when they need to, and help each other excel and become the best they can become.  It's Gordie's encouragement and Chris' caring words that push each other to grow into the men they are destined to.\n\nFinally, Gordie, the smart and quiet one, and the narrator of the movie, has his struggles revealed to the audience early on, and they affect him for the duration of the movie, but the things that he goes through with his friends help him to grow and learn from his past problems.  I think that Gordie is the one that grows the most from the trip, and is no longer afraid and no longer second guesses himself.  With the help from his three best friends at that time, he becomes a great man.  \n\nOverall, I think that this movie was very moving.  It made me wish I had a really tight knit group of friends that would go on adventures with me, and would want to watch me grow and help me better myself.  I think that this movie shows that we all have a good side, the side that everyone sees, and a bad side, that we never let anyone see.  But it takes an adventure, a campfire, some bullies, and amazing friends to expose that bad side, and change the bad parts of us, the parts we are afraid to put under a spotlight for fear of rejection, into parts we are proud of, parts we can grow from.",

The cast of this film had some of the best chemistry I've seen between any characters. They made me laugh, think, and cry. Stand By Me is based off the Stephen King novel \"The Body\" and it's about 4 kids set out to find the body of Ray Baur (think that's how it's spelled) and end up creating a stronger bond together than ever. This adventure was really heartwarming and realistic. The dialogue is how a preteen would talk when they're alone with friends and the way they act is very kiddish too. The characters were super likable and funny I can't even stress it enough. The struggles they encounter are fun to watch especially the scene when they think they're in the presence of coyotes. The realistic factor this has about growing up and how friends come and go is very heartwarming and tearjerking. All the kids had a tragic background that haunted them especially Gordy who thinks his parents loathe him after the lost of his beloved brother Denny. Stand By Me is a masterpiece. The characters were great, the story was heartwarming and touching, the affect this movie left me with just stays. Love this film. A",

As a result I'm not sure it can possibly have the same impact on me it might have had if I saw it when I was closer to the age of the boys in the film. All I can say is that I found Stand By Me to be a fairly average coming-of-age drama. There are some moments that really shine, particularly when the boys start to open up with one another, but I don't know if those are enough to make this stand out from dozens of other films that tackle the same topic. I think it also helps if you connect with the kinds of activities these boys participated in. I never had friends who were into smoking, cursing, and gambling, so again it was one more point of disconnect for me. The story of the film isn't very deep. You have four boys, three of them with some very complex issues they are struggling with, and they decide to go on a long hike to locate the body of a missing teen. Child actors are always a little hit-or-miss, but I think they did fairly well with these 4. River Phoenix stands out as possibly the most talented, and I connected with his character more than the others because he had some serious demons he was struggling with.\n\nEasily one of my favorite scenes of the movie is when Gordie tells one of his stories around the campfire, and then they show it all on screen as he describes it. This is so perfectly tuned to the kind of stuff boys at that age talk about that I had to laugh. I didn't know what to make of the scenes with the older gang of boys. Perhaps part of my issue with them was just the fact that I'm not a fan of Kiefer Sutherland, and picturing him as some murderous gang-banger kind of made me chuckle. Normally I'd call Richard Dreyfuss a win in any movie, but his voice-over did take me out of the film a couple of times. Of course voice-over was basically a prerequisite in coming-of-age films of the 80s so its not like they could have taken that out, his voice is just so distinctive that you can't really think \"that's Wil Wheaton all grown up.\" Stand By Me is a prime example of its genre, and I'm sure at the time it was groundbreaking. Looking back at it now, I can recognize all the things that people might have enjoyed and connected with emotionally in 1986, I've just grown up too much since then...",

'Stand by Me', a title that made much more sense to the filmmakers, is a very personal and emotional film.\n\nI thought, at first, that the fact that they were looking for a dead body should have been a secret that these characters stumbled upon whilst they went on a camping trip or something. And that they'd find the body in that lake they all fall into or that'd the body be in a big reservoir or a big lake like underneath those train tracks. But it would appear that I have seen one too many parodies of this story because the fact that we know what they are looking for makes the experience for them, and us, all the more different. You wouldn't think that you could get stressed out in a film like this but that train scene, boy, was that excellently crafted. I thought they could just lie down or step on the other rail if a train had have come but I had forgotten how big the train was. The lake scene was great as well, I think we could all work out that they were going to fall in but what happens later in that scene just looked painful. I thought the body would have been discovered there when they say that Vern had something on his neck but it wasn't and shouldn't they have all checked their underwear to see if they had anything? Ouch. Honestly though, the swearing didn't bother me, that's how real people talk and especially with the lack of parents around. No, what bothered me was the smoking. When it was introduced I thought that these weren't going to be likeable characters but that quickly changed, but I did notice how Gordie didn't smoke. Changed to make himself look better in his memoir? Or did he actually not smoke? Who knows? Although, they weren't smoking actual cigarettes either, thanks to Reiner. I did find it funny that there was a joke in there about how being a writer was stupid, given that Stephen King wrote the original story and it's a good job they didn't play around with that gun by pointing it at someone's head because that would have ended nastily for a supposedly empty gun and when the dog 'sick em up' I thought it sounded like 'stick em up' which would have worked in the '50s setting.\n\nThis cast is excellently chosen and it was even Jerry O'Connell's first film! The main 4 feel so real, they have all the wildly varying conversations a child would have at that time in their lives; and it isn't just Goofy that drove a car! You'd have thought that they would have been quiet when they thought there were about to be eaten by wolves but that's children! But that scene does end with a very powerful moment. These characters are excellently written and it is really great to see their journey. While I liked all the characters, and we know about all of them to some degree, although we know more about Gordie and Chris, for reasons the film gets into near the end, I couldn't really find myself liking Teddy all that much. While reminding me of a very young George McFly, I just found that he seemed to provoke everyone in the group and that he generally didn't have anything nice to say, especially when Gordie was telling them a story, (and when it ended the person in the story had a cherry in their ear, which I found funny and something that really fit in the story, although probably a coincidence). Again, I know they're young but you'd think that someone who got annoyed when that man in the junkyard called his dad a, 'loony, loony, loony', wouldn't call his friend a, 'pussy, pussy, pussy'. I thought he would be the one to sit next to Gordie when he was crying near the end just from the way that the conversation sounded but no, and it makes sense why it focuses on Gordie and Chris so much and the way this film ends really solidifies it and it hits hard. I thought I saw John Cusack in this film because of some images we see pretty quickly but a few seconds later, we do indeed see him and he turns out to be the only likeable supporting character. I thought it'd freeze on his name or who was revealed to be the older Gordie in the credits but it didn't. And Corey Feldman was in some classic teen-movies back in the day and they were all released back to back as well.\n\nThe only nitpicks I really have with it are the usual things that King does, like, the one dimensional bullies that literally have nothing better to do then annoy some children as well as the unsupportive parents. While Keifer Sutherland does a typically perfect job, Ace could have sped up and overtaken that truck instead of making it crash but of course, he's a bully, and they even carve tattoos with razor blades. However, with this film I think it works for a couple reasons, one is that it might be from the perspective of what a child sees and it conveys the message about expressing oneself and that we really should listen to our children and support whatever their passion is, well, within reason. Still, I did find it a bit odd that random adults characters just go on rants for no real reason, like the guy in the shop and the junkyard, while the one in the junkyard had some reason to, he still felt a tad mean but the guy in the shop wasn't actually mean to Gordie, he just went on a rant just because. And, yeah, I guess someone could say that the fact that they have this story right before they go back to school was a bit of coincidence but that's going a bit far. But, hey, at least it isn't set in Maine, so that's something. Also, the same year this film came out, 'It' came out which is home to the horrible parents and one dimensional bullies as well. Also, when Vern falls over on the train tracks, his comb looked a tad big. Also, I thought that the bullies were responsible for the death at the end, I know they said that they weren't going to forget what the children did but that would have been a bit extreme, I mean, they held a grudge for that long?\n\nWhile I certainly liked the film a lot and was hugely invested throughout its running time, it really is the final few minutes of this film that really hit me like a tonne of bricks and I lost it. The final lines of this film, that aren't even spoken, really connected with me and the way the song fades in at the end, which I am glad happened because I was thinking about moments before it happened, coupled with the footage behind the credits is excellent. This film is absolutely timeless, well, besides the fact that you could get 4 cokes and some food for 2.50, but besides that, this film will live on forever. You go on a real journey with these characters; sad, happy, angry, scared, you go through it all with these characters. I honestly can't listen to the song performed by Ben E. King the same way anymore and that's a hallmark of a pitch-perfect film; it fits the film to an absolute T. A lot of the charm of this film is how it resonates with us personally and how it has us reflect on our own lives but besides just depending on that, there is a deeply warm, personal story at its centre that we can all relate to. Even though for the 4 main actors this still remains the most famous film they are known for, besides River for obvious reasons, I hope they remember this film and be proud that they were a part of something this powerful and heartfelt. 'Stand by Me', which is a much better title for something like this, as well, is an excellent film, I'm so glad I've finally seen it and it is another film off of the list.",

The youthful cast is engaging whilst director Rob Reiner skillfully weaves drama, comedy, and a hint of darkness, into a story that creates a yearning for simpler, more innocent times.",

            "content": "Based on the novel \"The Body\" by Stephen King, Stand by Me was one of those films that I had heard of but never used to have any real interest in it. I continued to hear good things about it and I eventually decided to grab a cheap copy of it with the plan to watch it sometime to see if it was really as great as I heard it to be. When this \"quest\" then came to mind, I decided there was no better film to start off than Stand by Me. The DVD had been hanging around in that cupboard for years never seeing the light of day. I naturally assumed it would be good but never expected it to be anything special to myself personally. Oh, how wrong I was. As soon as it finished, I realised I had just witnessed one of the greatest films made.\nFirstly the cast is nothing but perfect. Kiefer Sutherland as Ace Merrill excels at really making the audience hate him. You completely forget about his Jack Bauer alter-ego and can't help yourself from despising the character. Richard Dreyfuss bookends the film as an older version of the lead character and young John Cusack also pops in scenes which are sure to make you smile. But, it is the four young stars who really jump out at you. Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and an unrecognisable Jerry O'Connell are such naturals that you forget they are even acting. They are all full of talent at such a young age and are perfect for the roles. They blend together in a way that you would think they had been close friends for years. \nThe film boasts a well written, easy to follow script with some really clever and humorous lines. Dialogue flows so perfectly that it feels like you are watching someone else's conversation. With scenery so beautiful, you at times wish you was on the journey with them.\nNo matter the age, you will relate to the characters featured. The interaction between the four boys and the message about friendship is so true to life, you will end up longing for those years once again.\nStand by Me is a film that I wish I chose to watch years ago, and I know is a movie I will be seeing many more times in the near future. It's a movie that will make you smile from start to finish. Anyone with a heart will not get to the end without feeling some sadness, especially when Ben E. King's \"Stand By Me\" starts up. It also can't help but make you reflect on your past, as well as look to the future. It is only unfortunate that the film showcases what a standout career River Phoenix could have had. \nThis film teaches you so many lessons and is highly recommended to everyone.",

So instead I'm going to give my experience with it instead.\n\nIt was years ago, I was about 12 or 13 and it was Christmas Day. I was opening up one of my many bag of gifts and out pooped the DVD. I stared at it and was confused. I never put it on my list and I wondered if it was for someone else and was put in my bag by mistake. My mother exclaimed \"I thought you might enjoy this movie, it's really good!\". I put it down and moved onto my other gifts, the ones that I had asked for instead.\n\nWeeks went by before I watched the movie. It just did not seem all that interesting to me. Plus at the time I thought the movie was old. Who would want to watch an old movie? Not me of course. When I finally did see Stand by Me, it was like the movie gods came down and touched me. (Yes as corny as it sounds) The reason I say this is because the movie was and still is that good. I fell in love with it right away. Don't quote me on this but I swear I watched every night for the rest of that week.\n\nI have seen this movie more times than I can count and literally could quote it to you if asked(sad I know) It wasn't the story that drew me in, it was the characters. I feel like I can relate to almost every single one of them. We've all been in their shoes at least once in our lives, because let's face it. No one has a perfect life.\n\nIs Stand By Me perfect? No, it's not. I don't think there really is a perfect movie, but damn this one comes close. With the way it makes you laugh, cry, and cringe, Stand by Me gives you the full range of emotions. If you have not seen this movie, you really are missing out on one of the greatest movies in cinema history. Of course I will always highly recommend it to anyone!!!",

This movie is a coming-of-age story about a writer named Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton - young Gordie) looking back at his childhood memories when a close friend from back named Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) dies recently. The story looks back at how Gordy & Chris were going to have one big journey to find a dead body with their friends Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell). On the way, we see how they bond and the perilous journey to find the dead body. \n\nA lot of funny and memorable lines in this movie. All the characters are really fun to watch and it gets deeper into drama with All of them. We learn more and more about them and how their lives are and actually care for them. \n\nThere is just so much to enjoy in this movie that it just had my full attention through the whole thing. The story is much more than just 4 boys setting off to find a dead body. The performances by all of the boys were great. I especially liked River Phoenix's performance. River Phoenix was great in here because there was so much emotion in his character. You have the tough looking on the outside but emotional on the inside with his character. He pulled off his character perfect. Wil Wheaton as Gordie was great as well. He showed range with Gordie. Jerry O'Connell as Vern was just funny to watch. Just the fat kid who is innocent and relatable. Lastly, Corey Feldman as Teddy Duchamp. I really wanted to get more from this character because this one was the funniest and craziest character there was. Teddy was one that I really wanted a bit more from his backstory. Corey Feldman was the most noticeable actor for me because I have seen other things that he has been in (Goonies, Gremlins, etc.) and I haven't seen him that much nowadays. It's a bit of a shame because he does have some talent and it really does show with this role. \n\nWhat really shocked me was that this was based off of a Stephen King work. Now, I am not the biggest fan of Stephen King but this wasn't a horror movie. I just found that real surprising. \n\nI would highly recommend this movie! It is one of those rare films that are so enjoyable and everything works. This film is one of my personal favorites of all time, if not my favorite. I truly mean these 5 stars i gave it. It is a true classic.",

He is absolutely phenomenal here and does a great job playing the role of a troubled kid who is smarter and kinder than people give him credit for. In a small role, John Cusack is also really strong and brings the charisma and charm that makes his role in the story entirely believable. Kiefer Sutherland is also really good here.

Corey Feldman did a fantastic job as a supporting actor and brought a ton of humor into the film. Jerry O'Connell was hilarious in a way that was so innocent  and seemingly unintentional.

I went into this not fully knowing what to expect, but still came out a little disappointed as I had kind of bargained for something a little more gripping. In reality, it was a tale of four young boys who set off on an adventure to seek out the dead body of a local boy who has been reported missing by the police. Motivated by the fame and fortune that such a find could bring the lads set off along a railway line that will lead them to the whereabouts of the corpse. Although there are a few action sequences along the way, the bulk of the film is dominated by the interaction and relations between what are revealed to be four very different personalities, each suffering from mental trauma brought about through their family situations, and everyday life. The trek therefore provides a break from their problems, that is until a rival older gang seek to locate the body as well, and claim its find for their own benefit. Had this been four adults starring in this movie, it probably wouldn't have had the impact it has had, but you have to appreciate the talent that these four young stars possessed in making this a very emotional voyage. It doesn't have the imagination and fantasy of 'The Goonies' which also featured kids as its main cast, but to get across such a powerful childhood experience through four twelve year olds is pretty impressive and showcases more depth to their individual talents. It's not necessarily a must see again DVD, but it's a well produced film that should be remembered for its concept as well as its cast, and the late River Phoenix in particular.",

A quartet of boys, inseparable friends all, set out in search of a dead body that one of the boys overhears his brother talking about. The foursome consists of intellectual Gordie (Wil Wheaton), born leader Chris (River Phoenix), emotionally disturbed Teddy (Corey Feldman), and chubby hanger-on Vern (Jerry O'Connell). The boys' adventures en route to the elusive body are colored by the personal pressures brought to bear on all of them by the adult world. Richard Dreyfuss, playing the grown-up Gordie, narrates the film, while Kiefer Sutherland dominates every scene he's in as a brutish high-school bully.",

Now, as a dude, I must state the inaccuracy of this scene. Spilling out your feelings to another man is difficult and not impossible, but it is extremely rare. This is particularly true at twelve years old. It struck me as very fictional. Other than that, the soundtrack was well chosen.

Its Definitely in my top 20 movies of all time  and is a Heart Wrenching Experience and if you havent seen it , your missing what Film has to offer and how much a film can really change the way you look at things . \n\n\" I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\" \n\nOne of my favorite quotes because its so true. \n\nGood \n\nChemistry : \nThese kids truly seem like there bestfriends and care about each other . They have great Comradery amongst themselves . Feldman,  O Connell  ,Fenix and Wheaton were Outstanding.  \n\nPull on those Heart Strings Reiner ! :\nDamn i ALMOST shed a tear ! i know im a monster for not letting one go , nevertheless this is such a emotional movie because so much of us can relate to these four characters,  whether it  has to do with not being good enough for your parents standards and false  impressions because your family has a bad reputation .When an audience can connect and relate to a film , they feel sympathy towards the characters and when you have characters you care about , its gonna be a quality film .\n\nPerformances \nWheaton A-\nPhoenix A\nFeldman A\nO Connell B\nSutherland B\n\nStory : \nI Loved the story, all these kids were focused on one thing and became obsessed with finding this lost kid, The movie is just one big metaphor and deals with real-life issues. \n\nBad \nNOT A DAMN THING ! \n\nStand by Me is an amazing film and to me its the best Stephen King Adaptation and is definitely is in my Top 20 Films of all time and is Nostalgia Gold. If you havent seen this movie please do yourself a favor and dont watch this movie EXPERIENCE it . \n \n \n9.50 \nCINEMATIC ORGASMS !!",

It's as if the film is blissfully unaware of its beauty; it isn't deliberately and heavily nostalgic, or meaningful, or deep, but it's all there. It makes you wish you had nothing more important to do than sling a rucksack on your back, get your friends together, and wander off along the railroad.",
