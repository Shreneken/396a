            "content": "In many ways I feel like I'm giving it too high of a score, but Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a movie that has a bunch of moving parts, all of which move pretty much flawlessly, and while none of the characters are the deepest in motion picture history, they all work well in their respective roles.  Mathew Broderick is legitimately excellent as the titular Ferris Bueller, a fun fourth-wall breaking character (almost like a semi-slacker predecessor to Wayne & Garth) who is just barely able to ride the line between being Endearing and being Smug.  A lot of this comes from the fact that, despite there is certainly a mild narcissistic element to Ferris' character, he is also almost obsessed with making those around him happy, and honestly, I think it's this facet to the main character that has given this film its longevity.  The rest of the Cast do well with their respective roles, albeit much of them are toned-down caricatures, however the infinitely-underappreciated Alan Ruck deserves some serious props as well, as his character largely lives in a self-induced misery (caused perhaps by some mild but genuine neuroses), however his story is actually one tinged with a soft, long-lasting sadness due to his parents' (unseen in the movie, a wise choice in my opinion) intense emotional distance from him, as well as from each other.  Alan Ruck's Cameron is, in a sense, the beating-heart of the film, bolstering Ferris' more empathetic side, and this allows the movie to feel a lot more endearing by the end than it otherwise would.  And for that, I do genuinely kinda love this movie -- It's breezy, it's fun, it's never mean-spirited (at least never intensely or for more than a few seconds), and it has a softer side that's genuinely welcome.",

Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend. But it is Jeffrey Jones who almost steals the show as he suffers all those humiliations he goes through. In conclusion, I like it a lot and it is one of Hughes' best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American teen comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by John Hughes, and co-produced by Tom Jacobson. The film stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, a high-school slacker who skips school for a day in Chicago, with Mia Sara as his girlfriend Sloane Peterson and Alan Ruck who plays his best friend Cameron Fry. The movie is part of the 80s slap stick era of comedy with home made contraptions and close calls that followed the home alone franchise.\n\nThe films story is about ferris wanting one last ditch day with his friends. Ferris makes his parents and school believe he is really sick and soon rumors state the ferris needs a new kidney which has the repeated joke through out the movie which is the simple phrase \"Save Ferris\". Ferris's sister and principle dont believe that ferris is really sick and that he is ditching. The side stories then follow what the principle and Ferris's sister do to try and catch him while ditching.\n\nFront a technical aspect the movie is also pretty good. It Shows off the downtown chicago really well with shots taken in Sears tower and other skyscraper. It is a blast from the past showing chicago not chriraq as it has been known today. The other settings are really good for example ferris's house is actually in laguna beach and not chicago but unless you know architecture you wouldnt know. It is because of all of these reason i give the movie a 4.5/5",

Well, you're in luck because in the movie John Hudges and starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, we learn just that. Ferris Bueller wants a day off of school, so he comes up with a sophisticated plan to do just that. The problem is that he has been absent for many days, so his principal, Ed Rooney, played by Jefferey Jones, is on the hunt for Ferris and his friends for playing hookey for too long. Will he catch them? Will Ferris come up with yet another brilliant plan? Well, to answer that, you should wait and watch. \n\n\nI enjoyed the idea of Ferris Bueller about to be caught in almost every scene. I wanted how Ferris could've been caught. So many different times in the exact times if someone was looking. For example, when he is on the TV where the principal is sitting and sulking about not catching him. It makes the audience want to scream at the person for not seeing them. \n\n\nOverall, this movie is 8/5 marrons for me because of the constant action and comedy in these high schoolers' young lives. For anyone not watching or was hesitant to watch this movie, you should just watch it. It's a bunch of fun and exciting to see if he'll get caught or if he will get away with it or not.

The film was of a high schooler named Ferris Bueller, who took the day off of school. He was already getting away with not showing up to class and not getting caught with the many tricks he is skilled in. And he took his friend Cameron and girlfriend along to Chicago driving Cameron's dad's Ferrari. His principal was determined to try to catch him in the act because he knew of Ferris' tricks.\nThe single aspect that stood out to me was Ferris having Cameron tag along in his ideas. It was sad that Cameron was always worried to get caught. While Ferris would be having the time of his life. And that despite Cameron being worried he genuinely admires Ferris for not letting anything get in the way. I did think it was selfish of Ferris not to consider Cameron's feelings though he is always worried. It did show how easily manipulated Cameron is though he is aware of how Ferris is. \nThe quality of this movie was good. I would recommend this film to viewers like myself because it was a fun comedy film. I give it a five out of five stars. I enjoyed watching the ways Ferris has used his skills of not getting caught.

            "content": "Think back to when you were a teenager. Remember the times we all dreaded. Waking up in the morning at the crack of dawn only to get ready to sit in boredom in a classroom that took a chunk of your day. Now, imagine if you had the chance to skip a day and have it all to yourself. What would await you? Some dumb fun with friends or the consequences of your own actions. In the Film Ferris Bueller's Day Off It follows that exact scenario. The film was directed by John Hughes and released on June 11th, 1986, and it is considered one of the greats in 80s films. \n \nA single aspect in the film that really caught my eye was the acting, the Fourth Wall breaks to be specific. The film is very comedic, and someone can even say the comedic value is on par with Home Alone, but the comedic moments in Ferris Buellers are enhanced with these fourth wall breaks. Ferris who's played by Mathew Broderik is the only character who's able to break the Fourth Wall and he does it quite a lot in the film. The moments when he talks directly to the audience make him look like a cocky teenager who's able to bend the rules of his parents every time, while also giving the audience something to laugh at. \n \nMy overall reaction to the film was positive. I saw little to no downsides to the film and experienced nothing, but the dumb fun of a teenager's day off from school. Despite being from the 80s the film's comedy has not aged one bit. I believe anyone with a sense of humor is able to come watch this film and have no trouble having a good laugh. If I had to rate the movie out of 5 stars, I would give it a 4.5. I think it deserves a 4.5 because as a good movie for what it is despite being a fantastic film that can have people laughing and smiling it isn't something to write home about.",

They did a good job making it seem feasible that he would actually get caught at some point; there are plenty of movies with similarly untouchable protagonists where the movie doesn't achieve greatness because it's too obvious the good guy will win. I liked this on a personal level in that I was big on truancy in high school and made up a ton of excuses for it too, though I was never daring enough to really do anything with my newfound free time. However, my enjoyment was dampened a bit because I had learned long before watching this about Broderick killing two people with his car and then getting away with it shortly after filming this, so watching him cockily get away with everything here felt a bit weird.",

            "content": "The Ferris Bueller's Day Off movie was produced in 1986. The movie was directed and written by John Hughes. Matthew Broderick played Ferris, Alan Ruck played Cameron, and Mia Sara played Sloane. It got a best performance by an Actor in a motion picture in 1987.  This movie was funny, and it was the perfect length.   \n\n\tSo, at the beginning of the movie Ferris is in bed playing sick.  His sister knew what he was up to.  Then after his parents left for work, he called his best friend.  They prank called the school saying they were Sloanes father because they wanted to get her out of school. They went out to lunch and drove around in Cameron's dad's car. When they were skipping school principal Rooney was trying to catch them and stop his shenanigans.  But he could never catch them, Ferris was too smart for the principal.  Cameron needed to get out of his shell and stop being scared of his dad, Ferris convinced Cameron to steal his dad's car. The movie ends and they didn't get caught. \n\nIt was funny when Ferris was on the parade float. While he was on the float, he was singing and dancing. His dad was in the building next to the parade float and didn't know it was Ferris. It was funny because the dad should know what his kid looked like. I liked that everyone started singing and dancing with Ferris. \n\nAnother scene I like was when they stole Cameron's dad's car and they put extra miles and it.  They were trying to roll the miles back so Cameron's dad couldn't catch him.  Cameron started beating up his dad's car because he was sick of his dad controlling him.  It was funny but cringe-worthy because he ruined the from bumper then it started rolling backwards and broke through the garage wall and fell about 30 feet.   \n\nI think you all should watch the movie, it is interesting. The movie is a perfect length, one hour and 13 minutes long and it took place in Chicago. This movie gives the lesson to not skip school to not get into trouble.",

Ferris has a Simple Minds poster in his room, I don't know if that was on purpose or not but that's a cool nod to John Hughes' work nonetheless. The film is beautifully shot. I love all of the characters. I love the Twist and Shout scene. I love how the baseball Ferris caught at the Cubs game comes back into play at the end.

I didn't know what the heck that meant and eventually found out who he was and watched the movie.\n\nThis is the movie where Matthew Broderick famously breaks the fourth wall. Making comments and giving looks directly to the audience. It's a funny gag, there's even an post-credits scene where he approaches the camera asking why the audience is /still/ there and tells them to go home. While I did watch this movie in my house, the line did get a couple chuckles out of me. The premise is incredibly simple: teen gets friends together, skips school, and causes shenanigans throughout the city while a skeptical principal (Jeffrey Jones) pursues him. Oh right! The dynamic between the principal as well as Bueller's sister (played by Dirty Dancing actress Jennifer Grey) and Ferris creates some of the funniest moments. It's a cat and mouse game, like Tom And Jerry, between them and is incredibly entertaining to watch.\n\nNow I know this will sound iffy, but Ferris Bueller is and can be a positive role model, just depends on how you look at it. Yes he cuts school and makes risky decisions throughout, but it's all in good fun. And for those of us like Cameron Fry, sometimes we need to just let loose and have fun every now and again. Like Bueller famously says to the camera: \"Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off is a comedic classic written and directed by the late 80's icon John Hughes. It's one of those movies that provides something for everyone and this is indeed a feel-good movie. While there's a little bit of language, it's not too bad.",

The development of the character of Ferrie's friend (I don't remember his name, oups) is awesome and you see that for his age, he has no pleasure and that is what Ferrie gives him. Pleasure. They just want to have fun before it is too late and we have fun with them. It is a strongly communicative film that makes the audience developed a sort of link with the young trio.

Probably the most ridiculous scene is the parade. This egomaniac takes over a parade, and everyone happily join including the band with Twist and shout, very realistic.

Alan Rucks character gets a very well realized character arc in this film and it feels very earned and you care about him, he works with Broderick very well and you feel like they really are friends.

It is not until the 3rd act that he becomes a 3 dimensional character, and we begin to understand him, and realize he is not the sociopath we might have assumed he is. While is seems he does all the things he does for his own pleasure, it becomes clear in the last 20 minutes he was really doing it for his friend. At the beginning of the movie, Cameron is timid, constantly worried, and unsure of himself.  We learn his parents argue, and his dad neglects him, and would rather work on his Ferrari instead of spend time with hi son. Throughout the movie, Ferris tries to boost his friends self-esteem, and by the end he has succeeded. His friend is a completely different person, and most of the major characters are, notably his sister. However, Ferris doesn't seem to change at all. He helps his friends become a better people, but in doing so, he isn't changing at all.",

Ferris' Sister, Jeanie Bueller, Played By The Gorgeous Jennifer Grey Of \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987), Kinda Reminds Me Of Candace From The Disney Show \"Phineas & Ferb\", Just By How She Tries To Deduce Her Brother's Lies Just As Much As His Principal, Edward Rooney, Played By Jeffery Jones, Is! And How Jeanie Learns Her Lesson To Not Care So Much About Ferris From The Ruffian At The Police Station, Quickly Becoming His Girlfriend, Haha, It's A Good Lesson For Siblings In Families To Not Worry About What Goes On In The Other's Life.\n\nAs A Whole, The Film Seems To Present Itself As The Jack-In-The-Box Of Teenage Road-Trip Comedies: There's Several Surprises Sprinkled In The Least-Expected Moments. Not As Deep As Something Like \"The Breakfast Club\", But \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" Has A Creative Story That Just Wants You To Come Along With Our Main Trio & Enjoy Their Day Off With Them. I'd Say This '80s Classic Is Definitely Worth 103 Minutes Of Your Time.",

            "content": "I've recently had the pleasure of re-watching the classic cinematic masterpiece that is Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This movie encapsulates the teenage dream, even 34 years after its release. Matthew Brodrick as Ferris Bueller, Mia Sara as his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, and Alan Ruck as his best friend Cameron Frye, are all talented and encapsulate their roles excellently, though they are over aged for these roles. Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney and Jennifer Grey as Jeanie Bueller both do fantastic jobs of epitomizing the insanity of stiff-necked individuals trying to catch a teenager in a lie that only hurts themselves. Ferris, Jeanie, and Rooney's plot lines are masterfully woven together in the end, leading to chapter development for Jeanie and Cameron, even over just a single day. Ferris asks big life questions, leading the audience down similar roads. Overall, this movie can be just about anything you want it to be? A comedy? Check! A fun movie leading to an existential crisis? Also check!",

            "content": "A film as beloved as this one has had so much said about it but I think what it comes down to is that this is an extremely entertaining diversion. It is hardly meaningful and it is not the meaningful paean about self discovery that some believe it to be but it features a great soundtrack, a genius central performance and some beautifully choreographed shots. Few films have made a city look as wonderful as this film makes Chicago appear and as they move through all of the famous tourist sites we realize that we are watching a very well packaged, glossy travelogue. All of this makes the film worth watching and when you want to relax and not put yourself through the emotional strain of Ship of Fools (1965) or Room at the Top (1959).\n\nSmug high school student Ferris Bueller, Matthew Broderick, regularly fakes being sick so he can take a day off school and spend his time with his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, Mia Sara, and emotionally traumatized best friend Cameron Frye, Alan Ruck. This angers his sister Jeanie, Jennifer Grey, who does not break the rules like he does and she wants to see him punished for his actions. Bueller maneuvers to get his girlfriend out of school by pretending to be her father and incurs the wrath of school principal Mr. Rooney, Jeffrey Jones, who tries to track him down throughout the day. Bueller has more of a struggle getting Frye to come with him as he is afraid of even leaving his house and as Bueller wants to use his father's Ferrari which he worries his father will learn about it takes a lot of cajoling to get him to tag along with them. They travel through Chicago and enjoy themselves but at the end of the day they are all almost caught out.\n\nThe fun of the film comes in seeing a figure, a teenager, who is usually in a position where authority figures like his parents and schoolteachers control him is able to manipulate the system to gain freedom. He is smug and taunts those around him about the way that he has succeeded but at heart he does love his girlfriend and best friend and just wants to show them a good time. This is how most teenagers feel and the idea that you could actually control your own life and have fun doing it is appealing to hormonal, angst filled people. The villains in the film are also appropriately caricatured as his parents are politically conservative pushovers and the school principal is the sort of stickler for the rules that we all dislike. His girlfriend is a little too perfect as she is one of those \n\u2018cool' girls that male screenwriters love but this is a minor complaint as Hughes has written female characters with far less depth who face even more abusive treatment from the men around them.\n\nThe one part of the film that I did not like was the relationship that Frye has with his father and it is implied that he is overbearing and controlling but the film applies too much meaning to the idea of defiance. The climactic scene in which he pushes his father's Ferrari through the glass window and out into a ravine annoyed me as the film presents destroying an object valuable to your parents as the correct response to feelings of anger and resentment towards them. To have had Frye actually talk to his father or properly discuss his feelings about him to set up why he is so angry at him and would go to such lengths to attract his attention. I assume that there were a few extra scenes cut out of the film that would have done more to make this scene more poignant and understandable. I wanted to get into this part of the film as Frye is enigmatic at the beginning of the film and we are invested in his coming out of his shell but when the film tries to develop his backstory it fails to put us in his mindset.\n\nYou really will love the experience of watching this film even though it is flawed in developing some of the characters.",

Secondly, in this film  the characters have so much depth and development especially Cameron who gets the most development in the film, he starts off as a person who worries about everything and with Feris and Sloane's help he changes into a more relaxed person who is ready for college [university]. Ferris and Sloane are also great characters in the film. Finally, the comedy in this film is one of the best in the 80s with some of best jokes and lines in film history. In conclusion l have always loved this film and always film it was one of the film I saw and thought yeah that was great. As I grow and will see some of the flaws I will always see past them as I think of this film as one of the best of all time.",

The film was directed by John Hughes, and stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller and Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye.\n\nThe story follows Ferris Bueller a teenager who decides to skip a day off school. The story I found to be very strong and really enjoyable, especially once you hit the second act of the film.\n\nIn most films about teenagers the actors never feel like teenagers, but luckily for Ferris Bueller's Day Off the actors actually feel like the\ncharacters their playing. The acting in my opinion was strong and very believable.\n\nThe characters are some of the most memorable that I've seen from a comedy in recent years, from how well they were portrayed to how much of a blast they were to watch on the big screen.\n\nThe cinematography was sound, with some very good shots of the characters and scenery, but nothing too spectacular.\n\nThe sets and costumes were also very strong, from Ferris Bueller's bedroom design to his and his friends iconic and stylish outfits.\n\nThe style of the film I personally really liked, from the coming of age feel to the fun and inventive fourth wall breaking. \n\nThe film did also have some really quotable and memorable dialogue, from both the students and teachers.  \n\nThe comedy in my opinion is some of the greatest ever put to film, from the great fourth wall braking to the extremely funny Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney.\n\nIn my opinion Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the most enjoyable films that I've ever seen, and I can't wait to watch it all over again.\n\nOver all I give it a\n9/10\n\n\"Anyone\"",

Ferris Bueller happens to be king of the fake sick day and, using his ninth phony day off this semester, decides to show his hypochondriac friend Cameron and level-headed girlfriend Sloane the time of their lives. From admiring paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago to commandeering a parade float to perform in front of an almost magically absurd crowd - all while bending the laws of coincidence - this will be one day our three teenage heroes never forget.\n\nJohn Hughes is the ultimate progenitor of exploring teen angst in cinema and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is just one more in a string of classic comedies (including the oft-overlooked \"Sixteen Candles\" and the legendary malcontent manifesto \"The Breakfast Club\") that stood head-and-shoulders above their contemporaries. Hughes was note-perfect at writing incisive dialogue suited to the varied styles of his teenage protagonists while penetrating the very heart of human nature at the same time. It helps that Hughes always had stellar casts to work with.\n\nThe fourth-wall-breaking performance of Matthew Broderick is one of the best the Eighties ever saw and Broderick's on screen chemistry with Alan Ruck is convincing enough to make the viewer believe these two have been playing off of each other since kindergarten. Jeffrey Jones is a deliciously devilish amalgamation of high school principles while Jennifer Grey does her part as Bueller's sister who simply wants to escape the shadow of her spotlight-stealing brother and find a little recognition of her own. Even Charlie Sheen is on point doing his best Judd Nelson impersonation. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a great example of the kind of heartwarming mischievousness from a more innocent age that we will probably never witness again on the silver screen.",

            "content": "A fun afternoon joy ride.\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off (1986) is director John Hughes slacker anthem on the big screen. It's highly relatable to teenagers that just want out of school and to hang out with their friends. Every time I revisit this film, it always provides laughter and enjoyment. It's a blast of fourth wall breaks, Chicago sight seeing, and gallivanting with your pals.\n\nJohn Hughes wrote and directed this pleasant trip with a nod to films like womanizing romance comedy films like Alfie (1966), which also broke the 4th wall to coming of age risque movies such as Risky Business (1983). It takes the romancing teenager with clever wit and poignant commentary on the social lives of suburban Americans. I found Cameron's monologue about his father's love to be even more biting than ever. Hughes had a knack for realistic dialogue from kids, while always trying to find the humor in odd situations. His direction goes from nice slow panning shots to blistering tracking shots and neat jump cuts between faces. This is Hughes on full steam ahead to nonsense and silly entertainment.\n\nMatthew Broderick was the man after this film. His effortless charm and easy going attitude as Ferris Bueller taught us all to relax and appreciate the finer things in life a bit more. He is cool personified, even while being a truant miscreant of the highest caliber.\n\nHis friends Cameron and Sloane are really interesting unto themselves. Alan Ruck is hilarious as the dour and sickly Cameron. His nervous gasps and incessant hollering about his father's demands is so charming and relatable that Ruck may often steal the show from Broderick, especially towards the second half of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. His big monologue ranting about his father's expectations, wishes, and car is something to behold. He demonstrates not only a comedic talent, but convincing dramatic appeal as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Mia Sara is pretty generic and dull as Sloane. She is certainly pretty, but seems so lifeless compared to the two main boys. While her acting is flat, Jennifer Grey's is so dynamic! Grey is very funny and sympathetic as Ferris' sister Jean. She gives passionate speeches and underhanded comments throughout that always make me smile. Her indignant moaning about Ferris getting away with everything is so funny to me still.\n\nEven Charlie Sheen makes a cameo in the police station putting on his best James Dean from Rebel Without a Cause to funny results. His snark and causal matter of fact delivery to Grey's character remains as funny and strange as ever.\n\nLastly, Jeffrey Jones is great as the stuffy principal, chasing down Ferris, with goofy results. While he is over the top, you could argue the whole movie takes on a life of its own with ridiculous bits that you will just have to go along with and believe. It's more about the adventure of spending time with your friends than just buying into the nihilism of caring that Ferris spews at you.\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off is one of John Hughes' finest achievements, regardless of how well its themes, cast, and situations have aged. I think this will always be a fun movie despite the campy tone and too silly slap stick bits. It is great for an afternoon watch, so long as you are not rooting for Ferris to fail. Just go along with the ride and you'll have a good time.",

John Hughes created a lot of the teenage angst or coming of age films in the 80s and Ferris was quite possibly his greatest creation. Watching this on the big screen last night was a dream come true, but having a film like this remaining so timeless does not hurt. The film is full of heart and the charm of Matthew Broderick is what elevates this from becoming just your average teenage comedy. I wish they would make more fun and creative films like this, no one tackles such a fun concept without falling into cliches and crude jokes. John Hughes created something truly special here. 12/11/2018.",

It has charm, good acting, believable characters and  AMAZING comedy, simply fantastic, I was laughing almost non-stop through the first half and once things started getting more serious, it didn't feel unnatural. the story is ridiculously bland without its characters, which is a shame, but the fact that the characters are so good fixes it. the visuals are that of an 80's movie, no surprise, but the score was noticeably good, I usually don't pay attention to it, but this definitely did, overall the movie was only really lacking in the general story, but the comedic writing, acting and score more than make up for it!",

The script that tells of the acts of rebellion of Ferris Bueller is opposed to the depression of cameron, the pair, along with the girlfriend of Ferris embarks on a journey of fun, after they leave class, in search of amusement and to enjoy life, but between these intervals each one understands a little more about life and about oneself. John Hughes is a director who knows how to talk and broadcast the dramas and yearnings of youth like no one, always dressed in comedy, his films take all audiences and always preach the philosophy of total entertainment, from beginning to end (not stopping even in the credits) , but John also uses his communication skills to talk to his audience (even though the feature of the breakdown of the fourth wall is widely used here), John creates a film of three characters discovering themselves, but of an emphasis mainly on Cameron , he is the character who understands his purpose and makes the biggest break of rupture of the film, the whole movie is based on trying to enter his mind and understand his personality -Vide the scene of the pictures- he is the real protagonist of the film, and John deserves all our respect for including all this layer on the long and cover of fun and comedy. But in addition to that, the feature has a wonderful technical direction, camera angles and cuts of the film are surgical, in addition to those against flat and long plans, not to mention the richness of screen compositions and costumes, and the striking soundtrack, speaking in remarkable things, we can not forget Mattehew Broderick, who plays the role of his life, although all the actors are great in their roles. Lastly, \"Enjoying the Sweet Life\" is a film that transcends generations with fun, good humor and intelligence.",

Not only is this possible John Hughes' funniest feature to date, but there's plenty of heart to be found underneath all the giggles.\n\nFerris, one of the biggest procrastinators in film history, decides to take a day off from school and suggests/forces his closest friends do the same.  What follows is just about the most ridiculously funny high school films to date.  Pulling your parents leg about being sick is one thing, but convincing the entire city of Chicago that you're nearly on your death bed when you're actually singing Twist and Shout in the middle of a parade?  That's another thing entirely.\n\nYes, seeing a principle go to the lengths that Ed Rooney does to take Ferris down is a bit silly.  But when you have a talent like Jeffrey Jones to work with, you have to take advantage of all the physical comedy chances you have.  But speaking of talent, no one could have played Ferris better than Matthew Broderick.  If you don't buy into Ferris breaking the fourth wall within the first minute or so of the film, than the entire story won't work.  But with Broderick's charismatic charm, you buy into every second of it.  \n\nIt's like a great 90's action film, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It knows that most parents wouldn't actually buy into Ferris' \"sickness\", or that he could impersonate a well-known Chicagoan to get into a restaurant, or even lead a parade, but the film exploits every one of these situations.  They take every chance they get in creating a ridiculously humorous moment.  \n\nIt's not going to blow your socks away with a realistically dramatic take on high school or real-life problems (though some are certainly touched upon), but it is a timeless tale of procrastination during youth, and the great lengths that one could go to make their day extraordinary.  The imagination is strong here.\n\n+So ridiculous\n\n+Only works if Broderick is as good as he is\n\n+Fast paced with another laugh just around the corner\n\n8.8/10",

Ferris is the quintessential popular kid who seems to always get what he wants.  He is hedonistic, charming, smart, and consistently does two things to manipulate others:  first, he tells people what they want to hear, and second, he makes and carries out elaborate plans to trick them.  Ferris begins this day by making his parents believe that he is sick.  This is something to which everyone can relate.  Ferris, however, takes it to the next level by making a contraption that will snore when his bedroom door is opened. This way, if his mom checks on him, she will think he is sound asleep.  This is only one of several schemes that he puts in motion to make others believe he is home sick.  After his family leaves the house he invites some friends to join him.  He convinces his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck), who is a hypochondriac, to get out of bed and join him for the day.  Ferris then concocts a plan to get his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school.  This is accomplished with a phone call to the school's dean of students claiming there has been a death in her family.  Sloane is a pretty girl that would never miss an opportunity to spend a day away from school with Ferris.  He then convinces Cameron to take Cameron's dad's stunning red Ferrari so they can travel to downtown Chicago in style.\n\nAfter the three friends arrive in downtown Chicago, they park the precious vehicle in a garage and begin their adventures.  They experience fine dining, professional baseball, and an art museum.  Ferris even sings in a parade.  While all of this is taking place, Ferris's jealous sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who knows that he is faking, is doing whatever it takes to make sure Ferris is caught and exposed as the lying faker that he is.  The dean of students at the school is also onto Ferris and will go to extremes to make sure Ferris gets to enjoy a fifth year of high school.  \n\nThis day off from school is not just fun and games.  The audience really gets to see the development of Cameron's character.  He is transformed by the end of the day.  Plus, the movie utilizes a style of acting in which the fourth wall is broken.  In other words, Ferris looks right at the camera and talks directly to the audience.  There is no separation, or wall, between the actor and audience.  This helps you feel like you are friends with Ferris Bueller and that you too are enjoying the day off with him, Cameron and Sloane.\n\nOverall the movie is lighthearted and enjoyable to watch.  As stated by Ferris Bueller himself,  \" Life moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.\"",

Films like: Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Pretty in Pink, Home Alone, almost all the National Lampoon films, and The Breakfast Club. That and so many are just some of the  films he's wrote/directed for that have not only have been home names today but also resonated with a lot of people growing up in the mid 70's and 80's. And while he sadly took a dark path of terrible films to follow afterwards, i thought it be best to look at his more famous film to date: \" Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" Yet another film along with countless other well know films that i haven't gotten to see till now. And, a bit to my surprise, i was luck enough to enjoy the film for what it was: Classic 80's being young and enjoying life. Basically John Hughes being John Hughes. And yes while i did kind of mind some of the uncanny coincidences that did occur here and there and the already overused story line that countless other films payed homage to, these are just VERY cynical nitpicks that overall don't break the film at all. Because like i said, i was able to enjoy the premise a lot to just sit back and just enjoy John Hughes doing his thing. Great things such as: A very well done and surprisingly charismatic performance by the young Matthew Broderick before doing Godzilla 98 (yeah him in that was....awful.), a very simple but yet entertaining premise, good performances overall from the whole cast, great jokes both from the slapstick and constant fourth wall breaking, and was overall just a fun film to enjoy. And yes it is great, but the film then gives me a sense of sadness as to how John Hughes goes from making cult-classics for over 20 years and before passing made....Flubber and Baby's Day Out. *Sigh* Who knows for sure. Still a great film though.",

This truly is a timeless classic in that it could've just as well happened in the 50's, 80's, or present day as everyone can relate to his fears of life passing him by and wishes to be more in the moment.

Chicago never looked better thanks to it's beautiful skyline shots, it's incorporation of the great number of landmarks and (of course) the parade scene. Fun fact, this movie was one of the first films to incorporate an after credits scene and that scene in question, was the inspiration for the after credits scene in Deadpool (2016).

Matthew Broderick was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy because the humor was enjoyable and the main characters, very likeable. \n \nThroughout the film, Ferris Bueller is trying to make the best out of the last day of school he feels he can get away with skipping. He fakes sick, gets is best friend to help him get his girlfriend out of school, \"borrows\" a Ferrari, and attends a parade among other things, all the while dodging the pursuit of his principal and avoiding running across his parents, and bringing humor to the table. \n \nOne thing that really worked was how Ferris addressed the audience with humor. This breaking the fourth wall is a unique thing that really works in this film. Matthew Broderick's charm and the time he acts like a baby in front of his parents makes you like him right away. The misfortune of Principal Rooney throughout the movie also adds to the humor.  \n \nThe movie is worth the watch if you have the time. Expect an awesome performance from Matthew Broderick.",

It's actually amazing that I enjoy this film, because high school was not a happy-go-lucky time for me, but the brilliance of this movie is that the carefree Ferris really isn't the most important character in the film. It's the story of Cameron that really makes this movie shine, and made it an emotional touch-point for a generation. He is the change character, and the one that many people (like me) can connect with so closely. While I find Ferris' antics silly, and occasionally hilarious, the movie has heart because we see Cameron learning how to grow up. The other character who experiences growth in the film is Jeanie, and her story is also handled brilliantly. I like how Charlie Sheen actually teaches her the pointless nature of jealousy, and simultaneously teaches us as well. I could go on for hours just detailing all the things I love about this movie, because every single scene works for me. It has funny parts, it has dramatic parts, and it has emotional parts. The total package is a movie that I can watch any time and it actually makes me nostalgic for those days. I wonder if the movie would be as engaging for teens of this generation, or if so many of us connect with it merely because it was such a product of the 1980s. I'd recommend it to anyone because I love the movie, but I have a feeling only those of us who saw it when we were in high school will form that same emotional connection.",

The funniest parts of the film, are Jeffery Jones and Edie McClurg who are a lot of fun together and I find a lot of delight watching them. The movie has a lot of moments that feels relatable, like not wanting to go to school, getting bored in class, and being like Alan Ruck's character.

This comedic and slightly romantic movie offers everything a good teen movie should have and will also be a good time for parents. However might want to leave the young ones at home.\n\nIn Ferris Bueller's Day Off we follow Ferris Bueller(Matthew Broderick), a cunning young man who has decided that today just isn't a day to be wasted at school. With the help of his best friend played by Alan Ruck and his girlfriend who is played by Mia Sara, they plan the perfect day off full of activities. However, they have to stay alert, there are people out there that would like to see them in trouble such as the slightly crazy dean of students. Along the way the trio will learn all about the city of Chicago and about themselves.\n\nThis fantastic movie not only has everything you would expect from a funny movie and don't forget a little romance, but it also has many lessons that a growing teenager should have and others that are probably things (such as learning how to fake an illness to get out of school) that parent could do without. However, overall the good lessons far outweigh the bad ones making this movie a great influence for your young teen.

As for the jokes, the scene where Rooney is informed that Ferris is on line 2 (prompting him to have a facial expression that just screams \"Oh, crap\") and the scene where the nurse is about to say \"I'm the nurse to likes to f---\" but gets the door slammed in her face right before she can say the last word are both hilarious. As for writing, it's very quotable. Just look at the quotes that are on here. Finally, the plot. Ferris fakes sick to his parents, and as soon as they leave, he takes an eponymous day off. He calls his best friend Cameron, and Cameron reluctantly agrees. He also gets his girlfriend Sloane to come, much less reluctantly. They go out into the city and have a hell of a time.

And then there's Grace...\nAlso, young Charlie Sheen? Hell yeah.",

I will admit, this film promotes skiving school way to much and little emphasis is put on the repocusions of doing so, however it is too busy giving us a glimpse of what life is actually about, that every child had nothing to fear, its a big bad world and all you have to do is just grab onto it and shake it for all its worth. Ferris decides to hatch a plan to skive off school one morning, after twisting his parents into his web of deciet, he then manages to enlist Cameron, his best friend and Sloane his girlfriend, to bunk off of school with him, so they can spend 1 day living it up, before school ends and their youth is spoiled. It's played totally tongue and cheek and all for the better, the cast is chalk full of 80's goodness but Matthew Broderick is clearly the captain of this ship. What i love about this film, is not its ability to be hilariously funny or even a non stop thrill ride, it actually has some deep and meaningful undertones running in its veins, The character of Cameron for example, so tortured by his fathers love for his car more than his own son, resonates with how bad parenting can effect a human. Also Ferris Bueller shows how mundaine and unexciting some teachers tend to teach their students, with monotone voices and patronising tones, while Ferris and co are out living life to the full, pulling pranks, looking at art and contimplating life in general. Their is an innocence about it that just charms the entire way through. It also has a Charlie Sheen cameo to die for. It is full on 80's cheese and completely of its time, but for people of that generation, it is pretty hard not to fall in love with Ferris Bueller.",

But here we're with him only for a day - precisely a day when he decides to skip school (again) and make a big day out of a potentially big day.\n\nBroderick was a really brilliant Bueller. He's as captivating, energic, spontaneous and sympathetic as demanded by the role. If you don't keep this movie in your heart after watching it, at least Bueller you will remember with some inner joy.\n\nDo you know when you want to say the most obvious thing because you think it's too important, but it's been said for ages? Ferris Bueller's Day Off has that challenge accepted. The point is simple: LIVE your life. Ok, but HOW can you make that be any good or fresh to audience? Bueller's got it on lock.\n\nTo bring out its message, the movie picks up some cool creative ideas. I point out Bueller's dialog with camera to establish a conversation with us and the film direction (paternal pamper, musical takes, road takes).\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off doesn't have a super-original message to give you. But it finds its own way to make it sound fresh enough for you to like it and keep it as a reference for its rank.",

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller\" has its moments, and most of the best ones are of its own making. The much greater number of moments that don't work are a mix of atonal original content and otiose memes of better films.\n\nAlmost immediately, Ferris sets the movie outside the bounds of realism by talking to the camera. The technique suits Matthew Broderick's characteristic sense of detachment from the process of acting, his ability to exist on screen without seeming to even try to act but without seeming at all natural either. The cold eyes and feces-eating grin that accompany his verbal asides, though, give the impression that something more is going on in the film than whimsy. There is a darkness-not exactly a darkness, but a kind of menacing quality to the movie, as though it were a prank, and the audience is forever suspended in the instant of dawning horror and appreciation. It as as if John Hughes and a real-life Ferris Bueller are out joyriding in our cars while we are trying to figure out what we are watching, and realizing that it is both a joke for us and a joke on us.\n\nThe laugh-out-loud bits are played fairly straight. Ben Stein's steady drone in front of catatonic students. Charlie Sheen's cameo in which \"drugs\" is an inevitable but perfectly-timed punchline. The cheery profanity of a seemingly old-fashioned school secretary. A glorious song and dance number in the middle of the movie fills the streets of Chicago with color, and the spectacle seems as rich with directorial intent as it is with pure exuberance. John Hughes' placement of WASP city fathers on one side of the street, the ethnic European element of the city in the center, and the black community on the other side is undoubtedly conscious, and is appropriate for Chicago. There is probably no attempt at a social message here; it is part of the movie's non-judgmental celebration of the Windy City, and to portray the city as integrated would have been false.\n\nA gawking fixation on Chicago adds to the sense that there is a movie going on beneath the movie, because there is no way that a kid like Ferris would choose this itinerary for his dream day. The Sears Tower? It's only for tourists. The Art Institute and its collection of 19th and 20th century masterpieces? Please. A black tie restaurant? I'd expect a real teenager to prefer deep-dish pizza and brats. Maybe the secret to understanding Ferris is that he's having the dream day that adults wish they had had, but only if they had known then what they know now.\n\nBut if Ferris is such a figure of fantasy, and so above the movie, why does Hughes burden him and his friends with the serious suburban anxieties that some people decades later derisively dub \"affluenza\"? Hughes had covered that ground very well in \"The Breakfast Club,\" a film whose kids are much more real. In this movie, with its cultivated sense of superiority and apathy, the periodic downshift produces whiplash and slows the pace to an intolerable crawl. Alan Ruck is a good actor, but his best friend character is designed to be a drag and succeeds at it better than intended. Mia Sara's idealized, sexualized girlfriend character is a drag, too, because she has so much less mold-breaking individuality than Ally Sheedy and Molly Ringwold had brought to their earlier collaborations with John Hughes and Matthew Broderick.\n\nYet \"Ferris Bueller\" prefigures 21st-century entertainment in a way that the thoroughly dated brat pack films do not. Its use of antihumor, wherein a joke is held in abeyance for a long time while anticipation builds, and in which the big payoff is often understated, paved the way for postmodern high school comedies like \"Napoleon Dynamite.\" This approach to humor is best exemplified by the additional content that plays during the movie's closing credits. Such stingers are rarely seen before \"Ferris Bueller\" but became a staple of the genre afterward. Instead of using 80s hits, the movie's musical cues are more timeless, like John Lennon and the theme from \"Star Wars.\" Frequently, though, its pop culture references feel arbitrary and meaningless. Why bring \"Alien\" or Wayne Newton into this? They're drawn from a hat, like a \"Family Guy\" joke or an internet gif. Like them, the uneven \"Ferris Bueller\" is sometimes funny, sometimes obnoxious, and sometimes just puzzling.",

Its a high school kid who is determined to get another day off of school at any cost while his principle tries to prevent that.  This film was written and directed by John Hughes who before this directed films such as Weird Science, The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles.\n\nFerris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) loves to miss school and he doesn't just miss school he goes all out when he does it.  This time he has gotten it so that the entire community believes that he is on his death bed and needs help.  On this day off he forces his best friend Cameron Fry (Alan Ruck) to come along on his journey even though he is sick.  It takes Ferris some time to convince Cameron to join him but he finally does.  The two of them come up with an elaborate plan to get Ferris's girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) out of school and in on their day of fun.  They need principle Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) to believe that Sloane's dad is picking her up from school so they take Cameron's father's precious Ferrari for transportation.  After they pick up Sloane they start their crazy fun filled day all the while, the principal Ed Rooney is determined to prove Ferris is faking his illness and Ferris's agitated sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) also has a goal to catch Ferris off guard.   The gang all enjoy their day off from school that is until they realize that there is a lot more mileage on the Ferrari than there should be and Cameron loses it.\n\n \n\nbucketlist\n\n \n\nFerris and his friends did so much, its crazy how they actually fit it all into just one work day.  Watching there were so many times where you thought they were definitely going to get caught because his parent's either saw him or were right there next to him.  The best scene in this film had to be when Ferris and Cameron set up to get Sloane out of school.  Getting principle Rooney to believe that it was actually her dad calling was genius, Cameron calling as the dad and using a fake voice to make it sound like him was just another clever trick that Ferris had up his sleeve to fool the Principle, not to mention they made sure that any number that he called was covered so he couldn't confirm that Ferris was lying.  After they get out of school they start their fun filled day that involved going to a museum, a high class restaurant, a baseball game, even watch a parade.  The restaurant scene was classic because it showed again how clever Ferris was as he convinced the host that he was someone that he wasn't.  Things get intense for them though when they decide to go home and they realize that the car has twice the miles on it that it did when they left.  That is when Cameron loses it and they have to figure out what to do to make it seem like today never happened.\n\nOverall I would give this film a B-.  I do believe that it was an amazing film and a classic but one thing just bothered me the whole movie, I really don't think that it would be possible to get everything that they did done in the time frame that they had.  Especially since they had to also drive around town eventual time would have caught up to them and some of the stuff they would not have been able to do.  Other than that it was a good movie and one worth watching.",

Alan Ruck, and Ben Stein became well-known after this fun, and witty film.

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"  While it's a great message, I don't think you need to be a school-dodging high school senior with money \"borrowing\" a 1961 Ferrari from a friend's Dad without the Dad knowing it and engaging in loads of other mischievous behavior (not that all mischief is a bad thing.)\nDespite all that, it was still enjoyable.",

            "content": "\"A high school wise guy is determined to have a day off from school, despite of what the principal thinks of that\" (IMDb). Yes, I'm talking about Director John Hughes greatest creation, Ferris Beuller's Day off. Bringing in over six million dollars during opening weekend, Ferris Beuller's Day Off dominated theaters. Since June 11, 1986 we still can't get enough of this humorous, relatable, and alluding film. With an enjoyed audience percentage of ninety two on Rotten Tomatoes, Ferris Beuller was THE movie.\n\"Teenaged Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a legend in his own time thanks to his uncanny skill at cutting classes and getting away with it\" (Rotten Tomatoes).  Ferris is not only the big man in school, a consistent ditcher, and sneaky. Ferris Beuller is hilarious. Between finessing his oblivious parents, annoying his sister, pressuring his pessimistic best friend, and getting under the principals skin. From the Economics teacher not recognizing his name, resulting in the famous line \" Beuller? Beuller?\" (IMDb). From stealing the Ferrari of his best friend's father, to getting it stolen by parking attendants. From his amazing lip- syncing rendition of \"Twist and Shout\" during a parade to running through backyards of the neighborhood to beat his parents home.  His humor, sarcasm, and witty comments made each scene ten times better. Ferris Beullers day off has you laughing from beginning to end. \nFerris Beullers day off is relatable to every teenager. Nina Darnton states that, \"Mr. Hughes is at his best in creating the nitty-gritty realism of the teen-age world, dealing with problems that really bother them: groups, parents, pressure, self-definition, much as Judy Blume does in her best-selling books\" (Darnton, New York Times). This film portrays the oblivious, push-over, fun loving parents. Mr. & Mrs. Beuller easily fell for Ferris's \"cough cough, I'm sick mommy\" scheme. A scheme we've all pulled on our parents yet didn't go on such an adventure as Ferris did. Ferris Beuller didn't exactly give into peer pressure. Ferris was the peer pressure. It's not every day your friend pressures you into taking your dads three hundred thousand dollar car to go on an adventure in Chicago. Cameron, the best friend, was seen as giving into peer pressure throughout his day with Ferris. Some saw that his decisions were solely based around Ferris, as others saw Cameron as finding himself through these decisions.  Self- definition is also a big pressure portrayed in this film.  Throughout this film, Cameron and Ferris are finding themselves through this adventure. Hoping this would be his final game of hooky; Ferris just wants to be relieved of all the pressures of school and finding himself after he graduates.  Ferris Beullers day off is not only humorous, but relatable for teenagers. We all just need to escape every once in a while.\nFerris Beullers Day Off is alluding and a little inspiring to us onlookers. Haflidason states, \"Matthew Broderick takes the type of day off that all of us aspire to but somehow never quite replicate in this famous 80s comedy\" (Haflidason, BBC). It's a movie that makes you think about your life, wishes, and regrets. Like Haflidason said, Ferris had a day we all fantasize over. Setting everything aside, he just wanted to feel alive this one last time with his best friend and beautiful girlfriend. Many viewer reviews agreed that not only teenagers but also adults could learn something from Ferris. Most of us teenagers are too busy studying, reading chapters, freaking out over exams, and drowning in energy drinks. The film alludes that everyone needs to live every now and then. A day from school to explore your local cities may be the little adventure you need to stay sane. Like Ferris himself said in the film, \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it\" (IMDb.)\n\tWhat is a great movie without Humor? Laughing from beginning to end, Ferris Beulllers Day Off was a crowd pleasing movie. Its humor may have played a big part in drawing the audience, but it's relatable scenarios won over the audience. Teenagers indulging worldwide will be able to relate to the pressures Ferris wanted to escape. Describing the day many wish they could live, Beuller alludes that we all stop, bask, and enjoy our lives. Given eight stars out of ten, Ferris Beullers Day Off was marvelous.",

            "content": "After watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off, my opinion of it is very similar to Groundhog Day. It's a good, well written fun comedy that doesn't need to be taken seriously. The story is straight forward and takes place within just 1 day, meaning that there is not much to take in. The film plays out with a good pace with it only slowing down slightly before it reaches the final lot of scenes. The film shouldn't be taken seriously with some over the top scenes, but that's the style John Hughes decides to showcase his story as the focused more on the teenagers rather than the parents. \nOther than the script, it is the selection of actors cast in the roles that keeps the film flowing. Matthew Broderick in one of his early roles creates one of his best roles and the lesser known Alan Ruck brings a fun character to his scenes. If i had to be disappointed in anyone's character then it would have to be Jennifer Grey. I'm not saying she was bad, but I just didn't really enjoy the character too much and felt some of her lines could have been toned down in performance. There is also a nice small appearance from Charlie Sheen that is quite ironic when knowing about his personal problems. However, I felt the highlight of the film belonged to Jeffrey Jones as the Principal. Some of the best scenes and lines were from his character and I would have loved more of him featured.\nFound in many favourite film lists, Ferris Bueller really does gives you a movie worth sitting back and enjoying.",

But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.\n\nMy problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.\n\nFirst let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.\n\nNow let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.",

            "content": "I appreciate the irony in the fact that after this film, Matthew Broderick, as far as we knew, was the only one in this film who didn't get a day off, because everyone else in this film seemed to all but fall off the radar, which is surprising, considering the impact that this film had on a lot of young folks. Yeah, nothing says, \"coming-of-age film\" quite like skipping out on responsibilities, kids. Yeah, an education is pretty important in life, too, although I am all for youths embracing life in all of its glory, especially if their revelatory adventure makes Chicago look a little less scary. People, we all knew that John Hughes loved Chicago, but wow, this is about as much as love letter to Chicago as it is a love letter to youth spirit, which I suppose makes it the definitive John Hughes film. Not unlike youth, you've got to embrace this film while you can, because after this, Hughes took himself a break from coming-of-age films and started making movies about grown-ups and stuff. I can't believe Ferris Bueller went through all of the trouble rebelling against both the fourth wall and grown-ups, only for Hughes to end up rejecting youth films... although, in all fairness, he was 36 at the time of this film's release, and he was getting a little old to understand young people problems of the '80s. Well, at least he had enough of a grip to make a film that can be enjoyed by kids, grown-ups and Barbara Bush alike (Way to stay relevant for the Wellesley College kids, Barb), despite having problems beyond a questionable coming-of-age moral (Forget you, Pink Floyd, the kids do need an education).\r\n\r\nSaying hardly anything off the bat, then proceeding to give only so much exposition as it progresses, the film probably doesn't need to say much as an almost inconsequential young adult character piece, but developmental shortcomings make it a little difficult to get invested in, or even buy into characters, only so many of which are morally relatable. Storytelling is sharp enough, and acting is charismatic enough, for the characters to endear pretty thoroughly, although there's something a little sleazy about the most major ones, and that's, maybe not distancing, but a little obnoxious at times, in a manner that would be easier to get past if the characters were more fleshed out or, for that matter, organically juggled. While the film is, on the whole, minimalist as a character-driven affair, it will often bring in some layers to its cast and focus, only to find trouble in keeping up with it all, resulting in a certain focal unevenness which makes it even harder to get invested in the characters. Perhaps the film would be a little more even if it was tighter in its storytelling, being not especially overlong with its 102-minute runtime, but still with certain touches of filler that outstay their welcome and thin already uneven focus, which would, of course, feel tighter if this narrative carried more intrigue to justify its execution's length. There's simply not a whole lot to say with a story like this, and that's fine, considering the entertainment value of the idea's interpretation, yet the inspiration that backs this flick most every step of the way can carry the final product only so far. The film is fun, make no mistake, but it's not much outside of that, and when inspiration fails to meet the ambition which begets too much bloating for consistency in focus and pacing, it's hard to not be reminded of the limited potential here. With all that said, the film entertains pretty thoroughly, so much so that it borders on rewarding, and stands as worthy of certain recognition, even for its story.\r\n\r\nNo matter how inconsequential, this film's story concept is relatively solid, as far as comedic narratives are concerned, being colorful and even unique as a portrait on youths' somewhat reasonable, if a little convoluted mission to embrace life while there's still plenty of it, even if it's for only one day. This story is both refreshing and relatable, and that's respectable, as John Hughes seems to understand, even as writer, offering snappy, often even, for a young adult film, gutsy dialogue and lively humor, all behind memorable set pieces - such as unique fourth-wall breaks that give you insight into the mind of the titular character - and, of course, memorable characterization that, while focally uneven and sometimes a bit obnoxious in its intentional drawing of flaws, presents generally charming and distinguished characters. If nothing else brings color to the characters, it's the characters' portrayers, with standouts including a Jeffrey Jones who convinces as a clumsily bitter antagonist, and an Alan Ruck who convinces as a self-conscious voice of reason with his own charming faith in fun, while Matthew Broderick, in a breakout performance, truly drives the film with his butter-smooth charisma and slick energy. While his charm doesn't find its share of challenges in this cast of limited star power, but abundant color, Broderick more-or-less carries the film, which also owes much of its liveliness to style, even musical. Flaunting a trio of composers which includes Ira Newborn, Arthur Baker and John Robie, the film's score is diverse, yet consistently stylish and lively, with moments of borderline killer flare that joins a couple fun tunes in the unoriginal soundtrack in drawing you in almost as much as dynamic locations that paint a handsome and immersive portrait on the distinct setting of Chicago. The film even offers a fine deal of style that, quite frankly, perhaps would be as effectively lively if it wasn't so well-orchestrated by Hughes, as director, whose plays on the aforementioned musical and visual style, and even on Paul Hirsch's snappy editing, keep pacing brisk, and whose occasional thoughtful moments ought to immerse you into the thematic depth of this portrait on coming of age and achieving independence. It's hard to fully agree with a lot of the characters' actions, but the overall theme in this coming-of-age flick is surprisingly subtle and worthy, thus giving the film a heart to go with all of the fun that may not exactly be substantial to the point of seeing the final product transcend its natural shortcomings, but certainly make quite the memorable comedy classic.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the characters are a little underdeveloped, sometimes obnoxious, and occasionally unevenly handled, while storytelling proves to be repetitiously overdrawn enough for you to think about the inconsequentiality of the narrative concept that render the final product kind of underwhelming, but hardly so underwhelming that a unique and thematically worthy story, on the backs of clever scripting, charming performances, sharp style and colorful, when not thoughtful direction, fails to be enough to drive John Hughes' \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" as a classically fun, if near-inconsequential study on embracing life and youth.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

Matthew Broderick is great in the movie, he's a bit of an asshole but he's so likeable. Cameron and Sloan are also great in the movie and they all make a great group. Mr Rooney is also great, it's funny to see him try and catch Ferris and by the end it's just hillarious to see him fail. The film is also laugh out loud funny. I love the scene in the Art Gallery, it's so strange and I don't know why but I love it. The Ferrari is also amazing in the movie and by the end you do feel sad to see it go. I also love how stupid the parents are it's just great to see them get fooled. His sister is also great, the scene where she kicks Rooney in the face is really funny. Charlie Sheen is also in the film for one scene and he's absolutely hillarious he's a bit creepy but he's so funny and likeable. I also love Rooney's secretary, she's such an idiot and it's really funny to see her in scenes. John Hughes brilliantly directs the movie, the parade scene is a prime example of that. The parade scene is absolutely brilliant it's funny, entertaining and just fun, if it had been any shorter you would have felt like you missed out and if it was longer it would have been boring. The scene where Ferris runs home is also great and it has a brilliant use of slow motion. This film is an absolute classic and I love it, without a doubt in my top 20 favourite movies of all time.

For him he skips school for a day and he takes two of his friends with him. The antagonist is the principal who is trying to actually catch Ferris Bueller in the act. But Ferris Bueller has set up a plan so wonderful, that he is able to fool his parents, friends and the school teachers.\n\nWhile the movie was fun to watch, because who doesn't like the idea of a student who is able to get away with everything he is pulling off, but I can't say it was amazing. I did laugh a few times. And in general I was happy watching the film. But there wasn't anything that really stood out to me. I enjoyed it when he sang and danced in the parade to the song of twist and shout. That was awesome. But overall, I have to wonder how many more times I would ever watch this movie. Maybe one of my favorite parts of the entire film was recognizing Charlie Sheen who was playing a druggie in the movie. It was really cool seeing him outside of 2 1/2 men.\n\nSo overall it was a decent film to watch to pass the time, but it is not one I would ever buy or watch again more than once.",

Throughout the entire film, the sense of fun is never lost at any point, and that has everything to do with the young Broderick.  Everything about his performance is smirking and self-aware; the sheer number of times he breaks the fourth wall to address the audience is only made possible because of his natural charisma (also, this movie has one of the best stingers of all time).  You also have the principal, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who plays one of the more underrated movie villains; just because your movie is a comedy doesn't mean you can't have a quality villain, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off never forgets that.  The focus on the movie is always on the best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck), who is an interesting character to watch, because it is never completely clear how much responsibility lies on his shoulders; sometimes, he plays the victim, and sometimes he is the cause of his own demise.  It's always funny to see how pointless high school can sometimes be, and Ferris Bueller serves as a reminder that it is good for your personal mental health to call out for no reason every now and again.",

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" features Matthew Broderick as the titular character Ferris. On a school day where Ferris is supposed to take a test on a subject that frankly he doesn't care at all about he decides to fake an illness and go out and have fun with his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck). The three decide to go out in style by \"borrowing\" Mr. Frye's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 FT California Spyder convertible an proceed to explore the city, spending their day sightseeing, visiting attractions, spinning circles around the adults that would send them back to school. Meanwhile the school's Dean Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) tries to bust Forrest, as he is determined to expose him as a juvenile delinquent so he can hold him back a year.\n\nThere are two kinds of people that will leave the film, the first are the ones that will leave thinking that Ferris actually is just a juvenile delinquent and the second are the ones who will get swept up by the protagonist's charms. It's easy to see why you wouldn't enjoy the movie at first. Why does Ferris get to fool his parents and skip school while everyone else goes to class? Doesn't he know he's making his parents worry? What about the staff who are just trying to do their job? This kid's just trying to get his friends in trouble by stealing the car! someone catch up with this guy before he hurts someone for goodness sake! To those people, I say calm down for a second and really take a look at the movie. Ferris has a point early in the film when he comments on the test he is supposed to take that day. The test is about a subject that will have no bearings on his life whatsoever; it's useless information and even the teachers that are dispensing the lessons have no interest in it so why bother? Instead of staying at his desk all day and simply learning about life outside, Ferris actually goes outside and lives it. An example is at the Art Institute of Chicago where the trio go to admire some of the pieces on display. It's a beautiful sequence where the characters look at paintings and really analyze and appreciate them (it's done through a montage but you can clearly see Cameron inspecting \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" by Geirges Seurat). Set to the music of The Smiths, it's moving to see because of the combination of subject matter, music and cinematography. Sure the group get into a couple of situations where they trick adults but for the most part they're not causing any trouble at all. The reason why you're put off by Ferris' behaviour at first is because none of us were that cool. No one dared to skip school so they could go on an adventure and see everything there was to see out there. None of us had the beautiful and dedicated boyfriend/girlfriend that was ready to drop everything and go off on a crazy notion that we had, none of us had the guts to laugh at the authorities and not get caught. You're jealous of the guy but once you learn to just accept that and go along for the ride as his friend Cameron does, it's a heck of a lot of fun.\n\nThe film is extremely well written, with many quotable lines and memorable moments. This movie is so iconic that you've seen it parodied at least a dozen times and probably never even knew. Ever seen a movie where there's a car flying over a jump in slow motion? Ever seen a character fail miserably at something and have a musical note laugh at them, \"sad tuba\" style? Or even more iconic, ever hear that porno-sounding track \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello, while something awesome is going on? Check this movie out. You'll notice the scene where the Frye's car is flying and the scene where Dean Rooney gets busted at the arcade just as the game of Pacman next to him ends (with the iconic death rattle playing as he realizes how badly he's screwed up). As for the song with Yello, well you'll just have to see for yourself. The characters are iconic and you'll relate to them very well, be it because you want to be like Ferris or because you're seeing a part of yourself in the other characters around him. As the movie progresses his friends and his sisters get a new take on life and while you're sitting there appreciating the movie, you will too. I'm making it sound like the movie is very deep and thought provoking but really that material is a subtext in a very funny and lighthearted film. It's filled with clever one-liners, close calls and smart commentary on the way life treats teenagers. It's a treat to listen to.\n\nThere are a few moments of bad over-acting and at least one scene where the movie goes a bit too much into fantasy land but you won't really mind. Even if at first you didn't care for the film, give it another shot and particularly, pay attention to the scene where Jennifer Grey (playing Jeanie, Ferris' sister) is stuck at the police station. There's a nice exchange of dialogue there that will really turn you around on the whole \"juvenile delinquent\" thing and it's such a crowd pleaser that the material is sure to grow on you. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out and if you have the opportunity to see it for the first time when you're still in school it will really resonate with you. I can't recommend it highly enough. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 13, 2013)",

            "content": "Comedy is arguably the most difficult movie genre to get right. Finding a character or brand of humour that is going to mass appeal , and last an hour and a half, is no easy thing to do. But occaisonally the stars align and a film, and character, is born that will forever remain a timeless treat. Step forward Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\nFerris Bueller is arguably the greatest creation of writer/director John Hughes, the man who ruled the roost of '80s teen movies. Personified by Matthew Broderick, Beuller was the \"righteous dude\" whom everybody in high school loves and it's easy to see why. The character is such a likeable slacker that even though we ought to tut disapprovingly at him for fooling his parents into thinking he's ill so he can bunk off school, he does this so he can help out his best friend Cameron who's having a rough time. We all want a friend like Ferris.\nOut to catch Ferris is Mr Rooney, devious and slimy high school teacher. It's basically a rip off of Tom and Jerry with Ferris in the mouse role, continuously outsmarting Rooney. It doesn't descend to the cartoon violence levels of Hughes' Home Alone but the animation influence is felt.\nHughes has put together a flawless script for Ferris Bueller. It's full of proper characters, even those who only get a few lines you feel that you could paint a rich back history too. The dialogue is some of the best ever committed to celluloid and at times is extremely funny. The interplay between Ferris and Cameron, and the two with Ferris' girlfriend Sloane is pitch perfect.\nTo top it all off there's a street parade, dance sequence to The Beatles Twist and Shout, that is even better than it sounds.\nFerris Bueller is the crowning comedy moments of the 1980s.",
