It hits different out there. \n\nNothing matters, existence is absurd, yet in our own personal universes everything matters. We can't change the crazy swirling universe/s around us but we can make an impact on the the swirling universes of each person by listening to them, seeing them, treating them with kindness. That is our only hope- no one gets out of here alive.\n\nThe movie seems to take absurd to an extreme at some points but then again, does it really? Think of the absurdity of human construct. We have created a world where we dress up our natural bodies in uncomfortable clothes and spend most of our time alive inside a cubicle until almost the time of our demise for pieces of paper to buy large homes we spent in less time than we do going to the cubicle to buy them. Our existence is scientifically proven to be nothing short of miraculous and this is what we have designed to pass the time of our miraculous existence. We are absurd. Everything is.

The attempted storyline surprises and low budget visual effects caught my heart not because it's the best, but because it's their best from what they can offer. In fact, more than what they could offer. The story is so deep and heartfelt, for me it's not telling just about the mother-daughter relationship but a deeper understanding of a pain felt by people who lost hope in the low point of their life, it's bizarrely speaking to those who had lost their passion in living in any universe (being portrayed so painfully through the antagonist), and the \"O\" bagel (such a humorous element, a bagel as empty as it seem literally made me laugh in the mid of teary scenes) assuming it symbolising the emptiness in all universes is what many people face in this colourful society nowadays. And in the end the story hints about holding the very moment and seeing the beauty in all emptiness, if to be digested well, this story brings so much hope, love, in-depth view of life and some entertaining action scenes and plebeian moments that humble people can relate to. This movie is a masterpiece of bringing the theme of love without even mentioning the word \"love\".",

It starts out incredibly slow with the story of an Asian washeteria owner, her husband, her Americanized daughter, and her wheelchair-bound, disapproving father.  At an IRS audit, her husband switches bodies with his counterpart from another universe where things are a lot more exciting and some unknown force is trying to end all other parallel universes. (SPOILER AHEAD).  He's come to convince the washeteria lady to join the fight and at first, she has no interest or belief in his antics.  Turns out, as part of switching between universes, you have to do something totally random and silly like sticking a foreign object up your backside while whistling The Star Spangled Banner.  That's not in the movie, but it's an example of how silly things can get.  Much of the movie falls back on stereotypical wire-fighting like we've seen in so many previous movies like another Michelle Yeoh vehicle, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably like this movie because it has a lot of it.  (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER).  Turns out the force trying to end all of reality in all universes is the daughter of the washeteria owner and the rest of the movie is Michelle Yeoh's character trying to make up with her daughter and form a bond even though everyone else is telling her that, in order to save reality, she has to kill her daughter in every universe.  And so, that's it.  That's what won the Oscar.  Big disappointment for me and I'm a huge Michelle Yeoh fan.  I was even excited to see Ke Huy Quan again and he did a formidable acting job in this movie.  My biggest disappointment was the story.  Acting was fine from all involved.  While the story was somewhat original, it seems like it's just one of the pack of movies coming out lately (mainly from Marvel) where a multiverse is involved.

Could've won 4 Oscars (editing, costume, set design, supporting) + 2 nominations (screenplay, direction), but it's only above-average as an overall movie or experience. Not even close to the best movie of 2022 so the record-breaking number of awards is head-scratching. It's extremely derivative (the plot is The Matrix) & there are too many references to other better films throughout as it jumps from 2001 Space Odyssey reference to Matrix reference to 'some other movie' reference.\n\nOverall it's a very silly movie, that gets stuck between two conflicting tones (melodrama & slapstick comedy). Imagine the plot of The Matrix mixed with the tone of Scott Pilgrim. It's jocular tone doesn't match it's disconsolate themes (regret & nihilism). It contains strong components, but might've been better if treated more seriously, dramatically. Allow characters, themes, & actors to create tone so your fun can be earned through story. Instead it's forcefully directed like, \"let's try to make it fun.\" Reminds me of the quote, \"there's a difference between being smart & trying to be smart.\" So on one hand it's a somewhat fun movie, but on the other hand its fun is a contrivance.\n\nWhat worked least for me was: two rocks talking with subtitles, the personification of eternity as an everything bagel & the main character. One of the worst lead characters you'll see: completely cowardly at every turn & a nearly unbearable attempt to create an anti-hero. Thematically it's so heavy handed, it's nearly preachy. What worked best was the first few minutes of act 1 (how it was written, acted, executed). The opening character introductions, pacing & writing are excellent in a complex 'show don't tell' type manner. It quickly devolves into a slapstick time travel romp & lost it's steam once it started 'verse jumping.'\n\nIt's not a bad movie, but it wasn't a great movie like I was expecting from all of the awards and the price to rent. Nicest way I could say it is it wasn't for me. To be fair, that could be due to demographics. If you're under 30, especially female audiences, you may connect with it better. For viewers over 30, especially male audiences who's tastes might typically align with the critic scores more than audience scores, it likely will not reach your expectations & you might even find it growingly frustrating as it continually falls short of those expectations. It's best suited as a mother/daughter bonding movie with some popcorn, but it's not as universal, original, or good as it's score might have you believe.",

To not have you wait for my honest feedback I'll give it now and then explain why. In all of the movies I have watched, enjoying everything from comedies to action films, sci-fi and dramas, this is absolutely the greatest masterpiece I have ever had the pleasure to watch. If I could, I would love to watch it for the first time again - such an emotional journey it takes one on.\nI have to mention one thing to set your expectations straight: - do not go into this movie aching for a logical, realistic, planned through story to be told- if you do you'll be very disappointed. This is not like any other movie, this is a piece of film - the conglomerations of visuals and sound that produce tension and get the audiences attention. \nBefor watching this movie, I did not know why this movie won so many Oscar's, I was more pessimistic on the overall quality of the movie. The reason why i believe it's one of the greatest film artworks ever is because the absence of rationality and logic, of structured content and foreseeable behaviour allows the creation of feelings and a connection with the overall human emotions portrayed like no other movie has done. Because it does not make sense it feels so close to us. Most of what we experience, what we truly feel does not make sense - we can be angry but still love a person, we can have an abundance of things but still feel empty- unfulfilled. The movie creates so many different scenarios into which we can portray ourselves into, that it connects everybody to the plot ( hell I could not take my eyes off of the screen in the last 30 minutes). This gives everyone this (joy)ride of fast emotions that everyone has - the movie makes you feel happy, sad, disappointed, content, confused, orderly, scared all at the same time. The first half takes getting used to, but if you embrace the confusion, the chaos and watch the second half you'll have the absolute mesmerising experience of a wave of emotions coming over you, being captivated by the pleasure of what it feels like to be alive.

The movie started out a bit slow and confusing for me, vaguely reminding me of the Matrix, but got more interesting. The bizarre sense of humor was a welcome break from typical Hollywood tropes. I liked how the philosophical questions were posed whimsically instead of in a stereotypical pseudo-intellectual indie film way.\nThe cast's acting was excellent but I don't know if any of them were necessarily Oscar-worthy. Maybe it's the halo effect idk.\nLike a good novel, interesting enough to be watched several times.",

Stephanie Hsu is the heart of the movie together with main character played by Michelle Yeoh, and both give wonderful performances. I thought Hsu is the most incredible actress of the movie. She is a huge and brave talent. This will touch anyone dealing with disappointments and missed opportunities in life as well as their relationship with their moms. This movie should only be watched in cinemas. There is no way to appreciate it at home.",

I'm sorry, but this was a pooper. \ud83d\udc4e Highly would NOT recommend.  It really could have been good. It's a shame\u2026",

I don't see what's so great about the film. Yes, it is somewhat funny with a heartwarming story that unfolds; however, about 45-60 minutes into it, I was already done. You're not supposed to say the quiet part loud but I'm going to: this won at the Oscars for one reason and one reason only, DEI. It's an average film at best that won due to weak competition or films that were overlooked that should have easily won but were snubbed for Best Picture and Best Director (and yes, I'm talking about THE WHALE and Darren Aronofsky). Within a year this film will be forgotten. Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely happy Laurie Strode won an Oscar (surprised in fact as the buzz heading in was Angela Bassett would win), as well as Ke Huy Quen who will always have a special place in my heart like so many others for Data and Short Round. Finally, isn't it cultural appropriation for Daniel Scheinert to direct basically an all Asian cast? Just asking.",

First you think that this is intentional, so as to convey the chaotic situation, and once it is established, the pace and tone will settle down. Nope. This is the entire film. \n\nThe film is a nonsensical mish-mash cacophony of frantic, hectic, hyper, non-stop dialog, noise, lights, people, and things. I understand that this is the point, and it's supposed to be Funny & Satirical & Smart & Weird & Sweet & Edgy & Silly & Serious & Meta.\n\nHowever in my opinion it tries way, way too hard, and ultimately falls flat on its face in all its aspirations. At least the title is apt.\n\nSurprise-Surprise, trying to be Everything Everywhere, all at once... doesn't work! At least not for me, as I see that it does for many others. (I will leave the audience cultural psychoanalysis to others \ud83e\udd2a)\n\nThe film is simultaneously sensory overwhelming, and very boring. Dumb, but pretentious at the same time. Both branching & multi-verse hoping, but also repetitive and so very predictable. Quite the accomplishment.\n\nMy quick summary of what I watched:\n\nA high budget student film- bad imitation Woody Allen meets a bad imitation Rick & Morty meets a bad imitation Jackie Chan\n...on coke\n...and LSD\n... and partially in Cantonese\n\nWritten in a parallel universe by Alex Kurtzman and directed by Michael Bay, after they had both been lobotomized with a wooden spoon.\n\nThis actually sounds cooler than it is. Ha! So if this sounds like your cuppa tea, and you are not epileptic (seriously), then... hey go for it. It is certainly an experience! \n\n* Still, I am happy that Short-Round won an Oscar \ud83d\ude09",

The Daniels, above all, are incredibly hilarious with their independent style of filmmaking, nothing is definable and everything is original, thoroughly earning their incredibly moving film's ambitious title.",

The multiverse theory is just a mathematical way to explain the way a universe that favors life could come about randomly and is actually a way to show a way to satisfy the Cosmological Constant and the infinitesimal chance that life could have come about:  Parallel universes containing other versions of ourselves is not a part of the theory.

I would rank this one right up there with any films the great masters ever made. It's not for the people who love \"Cocaine Bear\" or franchise sequels Like marvel movies. It's made for people who love cinema.  It's a Comedy /sci-fi / action film based around a story of a struggling immigrant family on the verge of divorce and their daughter's nihilist attitudes. If you can watch this movie and not laugh and cry at least once, you need to check your pulse, cause you might be dead. \nIt's easily going somewhere in my top 10 list of favorite films of all time...

Furthermore, it is absolutely blasphemous that Jamie Lee Curtis could win best supporting actress over Angela Bassett. Yes, Jamie Lee Curtis's role was very diverse in Everything Everywhere All At Once, but it certainly did not deserve recognition over Angela bassett's performance and Wakanda Forever. More credit should have been done to the costume and makeup team for Jamie Lee Curtis's character. It was not emotional, it was not groundbreaking, it was not moving, and you would barely know she was in it because it was such an insignificant role as far as impact is concerned. On the other hand, Angela bassett's performance was emotional, it was heartfelt, it was strong, it was passionate, it was memorable, and she was absolutely snubbed. The academy should be ashamed of themselves because this choice seemed more of a racially biased move or political move, I can't put my finger on it but they definitely got that one wrong and missed an opportunity to give a premiere actress her flowers while she's still with us. I noticed that there's been criticism of the movie Wakanda Forever as there are many people in the United States, and across the world, that have a hard time grasping the idea of an elite African nation, on top of the food chain that, couple with the fact that the movie highlights some injustices on behalf of the white man. I get it, but let's take off our blinders and be real. Conversely, EEAAO is receiving positivity biased kudos due to the industry's recent infatuation with Asian inclusivity. And don't get me wrong, the actors in this movie are absolutely phenomenal and this is nothing against them, this is against the academy, this is against the biased critics. Yes, the movie is different and refreshing but that does not make it a better movie than some of its competing films.",

I believe they chose a heroine and a storyline in general which provided a lot of social commentary about modern American life, and the overwhelming nature of our capitalist culture and how it punishes minorities the most.  \n\nUnfortunately, the film seems to lack an articulated or properly-maintained plot at points, and tries to juggle way too many different themes and directions at the same time to be comprehensible.  I was very frustrated by how often the plot took off ramps onto another theme or action scene, without fully developing and explaining what was going on (descriptively or symbolically) in the previous scenes.  I'm guessing this may have something to do with the average American's ever decreasing attention span and critical thinking skills, which seems to have negatively influenced Hollywood film directing over the years.  Regardless of the real reason behind these directing decisions, it made it very difficult to absorb the material at times.\n\nI was also disappointed with the character development of Jobu Tupaki/Joy.  I never felt the audience got sufficient explanation or context behind /why/ she was so suicidal and hostile toward her mother, beyond some superficial information detailing typical parent/ teen child antagonism, or the story of split personalities due to too much multiverse switching.  Someone who is going through complex suffering and struggles to develop into that character deserves a comprehensive backstory and contextual interpretation.  Perhaps some of the explanations for her pain lie in inter-generational conflicts within Chinese American families, in which case that explanation may have been lost in cultural translation.  But I also think aspects of her backstory and character may have also just been poorly written.\n\nAlso, there are far too many kink and BDSM material to make me feel comfortable. Unless these BDSM scenes were poorly-developed attempts at satire, the film seemed to otherwise be promoting a culture that for many people is often one of out-of-control consumerism, exploitation, and abuse.  I get it, adding this material gives the illusion of adding prestige, exoticism, or 'intricacy' to a film.  That's often the effect BDSM references have on general audiences, since that culture is taken at face value as a 'rebellion against normalcy'.  Introducing BDSM themes out of context also has some kind of shock and awe effect, and can be injected in content that may not otherwise be sufficiently thought provoking.  But that's just it, the real value of this material is illusive, and putting motifs of kinky practices in film to substitute more powerful messages or ideas can't fool everyone.  That's not including how gross and disturbing a lot of the kink content was to begin with.",

Did the directors feel the story was too boring and decided they needed to entertain the audience with parlor tricks and a ridiculous marvel like scifi plot? I became so annoyed and frustrated like I was purposely being distracted and denied the actual story. These are the kind of movies I just hate, that make me feel I'm wasting my time in order for the director and actors to seemingly just show off and enjoy themselves.

It's like people are running out of ideas! But not with this movie - it was the most unique movie I can remember watching. It had everything: humour, sci-fi, action, martial arts and so much raw emotion. The emotion was so strong that I cried one minute and was belly laughing the next. At one point I didn't know if my tears were from laughing or feeling emotional. All thanks to the incredible acting and brilliant script! It must be so difficult for the actors to do comedy acting one minute and then pour so much emotion into the role the next, not to mention all of the action scenes. I appreciate some won't get it, for me and my easily bored ADHD brain it was absolutely perfect! I wonder if the ones that walked out did so when the movie pretended to end! I've watched it three times and could watch it many more. You always see something different the next time you see it. I'm so glad something so unique has won so many awards, and I was rooting for them all during the whole awards season and so happy with the Oscars wins. Although I would say Stephanie Hsu should have got best supporting actress at the Oscar's over Jamie Lee (even though she was excellent too).

Also the rock metaphor didn't track cause she lets her fall off the cliff and then  when she's convincing her to stay she falls off the cliff after her? Didn't really make sense.

            "content": "This masterpiece is all about everything happening everywhere, just like the title. And I assure you that you will feel the same way as I do when you watch it. So there will be a question about what is even \"everything\" to start with. Everything is about your life and those people who you are surrounded with. This movie may be fictional by the inclusion of a multiverse but the depiction of underlying philosophical meaning about the realistic view of family issues, life choices, and all the possibilities we could create from small insignificant decisions in our daily lives reflect and wonder about our lives a lot. The whole plot itself takes place in the multiverse which might be something confusing when people who are unfamiliar with the concept hear that but surprisingly it is very simple to comprehend the whole plot. \n\nIt will give you a tremendous amount of different emotions, some of them which you might not have even experienced before. At least, it was that way for me. Many types of comedy also take place in the plot frequently and all of them are fantastic and in perfect timing. Despite having so many funny and ridiculous scenes, the plot itself is very serious to the point everyone can relate to either characters or situations in their lives such as the scenes when the movie depicted the young couple making \"wrong\" choices in this universe, the parenthood focusing on both the perspective of the wife (Evelyn)  and the husband (Waymond), their teenage daughter (Joy)'s problems concerning her life choices being unaccepted by her mother, ruined and shattered hopes from a young couple,  their business situations, the typical dead romance between the long-married couple (especially Asian couples), and many other characters' plots and viewpoints.\n\n\nThere are no villains in this movie. At the first glance, you might probably think (as it is stereotyped) of the mysterious character who seems to have bad intentions toward the universe, Jobu Tupaki (Joy) as the villainess. But if you can truly apprehend the way she becomes who she is, her actions are not justifiable but are understandable. Then, her mother would be the one you would want to blame for making Joy the way she is. But turns out, that is also not the case as everyone always wants the best for themselves or their loved ones. Her mother's action is also understandable but not justifiable. So in short, either her father, her grandfather and his organization, her mother, herself and everyone and every version of them in different universes cannot be blamed as it is going in a circle, and not one person can be blamed for one exact cause. \n\nLast of all, \"Nothing matters\", the main concept of this movie. This line mentioned by Jobu Tupaki(Joy) is a very simple yet powerful line for everyone everywhere it also shows her belief in one of the most famous philosophical branches called Nihilism. She tried to end the whole multiverse and universes by sucking everything into the giant bagel with her superpowers because nothing really matters to her anymore. But the fact that she wanted to end it together with her mother from the far multiverse shows that someone still matters to her and if we think carefully about Joy, she is doing all these things because of the concept of \"nothing matters\" matters to her. And yes it actually feels nice to think that way because if nothing matters, all the pain and guilt we feel from nothing of our lives go away as it is stated by Jobu Tupaki. But on the contrary and concluding from the ending and Evelyn's fighting scene against her daughter to stop her from going into the bagel, we can say that because nothing really matters, it is our choice to decide what and who matters in our daily lives and give and try our best for them no matter whatever the hardship we may face. I think that everyone should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime. You will get an unbelievably amazing experience and feeling in the duration of these 2 hours.",

It's a story about a mother of a depressed, anxious suicidal young adult, but the treatment is so shallow that if you try to dive in you'll break something. \n\nDaughter: The writers never really get into the daughter and present her as a flapping conundrum for the mother. The writers see fit to laminate a layer of gay in the daughter as if somehow that helps support the daughter's feelings (offensive meter is ticking), but never really delve into the experience of being gay and they never show a moment of gayness in the film, they just slap a label on her, make her hold a girl's hand and the job is done. Instead they focus on presenting the daughter as a writhing ball of whimsical existential angst - and that's it.\n\nOn to the mother: Just a trope of a character. Maternal angst meets bored middle aged woman stuck in a rut. Yay.\n\nTheir relationship: They don't have one. It's just two shallow characters, one pulling away and the other trying to cling on, \"SAVE\" the other from themselves and neither really understanding the other. Hot tip for the writers: without you guys writing these characters as more than a window shop painting, you can't write true connection between them. How do you display human understanding between two characters if there's nothing for the audience to understand either?\n\nThe rest of the movie was shiny and silly. \n\nThe shine: The shine was pretty. Lots of pretty things. They were shiny. They were well done. I liked them! But you can't watch 2:20 of shiny things alone\u2026 well I cant. Gummies aren't legal where I live.\n\nThe silly: The kind of silly people who wear Depends appreciate, but for everyone else it's like trying to share a meal with the same person after they've taken their evening Xanax.\n\nI have no idea how this movie won so many awards outside of the visuals.\n\n2/5",

Overall, I am just left sad for all of the other worthy nominees passed over for this overwrought mess.",

A lot of them very likely older people who, I suppose unstandably, can't keep up with a movie like this. Probably sensory overload for some of them. Others are probably the kinds of people who completely shut down their mind the second they see anything they think is weird. While others are shallow, superficial, skin deep kinds of people who can't appreciate something that has to be digested by the brain. The plot is VERY much present all throughout and VERY easy to understand. If you you can't follow this fairly simple plot of someone learning to accept where they've wound up in life and finding that they actually already had everything in life that they needed to be happy, then that is entirely a you problem. From the moment I saw it in theaters, it became an absolute all time favorite and still an emotional gut punch on numerous repeat viewings. Yes, it's very weird, goofy and absurd. It's those things while also being emotionally heartfelt with a powerful message of love and acceptance for one's self and towards others. And that life is worth living and should be embraced. Too bad some people are too emotionally shallow to even be able to grasp that from the movie. The movie has earned every bit of praise it received from its fans. I am legitimately surprised a movie like this swept away so many awards as they generally don't give movies like this any recognition, but I'm genuinely happy they've gotten gotten it and no other movie was anywhere near worthy of more accolades. This movie will go down as a classic, I guarantee it thanks to its wonderful blend of its absurdity and its heartfelt and sincere message.\n\nJUST IMAGINE IF THESE OLDS SAW SWISS ARMY MAN INSTEAD.

There's barely any connection or flow or logic (<--- things needed in a story), it's just a chaotic long fighting scene.

That's a huge wow to me! \n\nU thought, the directors, the Daniels, must be so squeezed out dried by little over half of the movie with so much going on, already so many classic & epic scenes, it will start to die down? Nope!  Not this movie!!!! \n\nIf Jamie Lee Curtis steals the show, pairing Michelle Yeoh as no screen lovers in their virtual world, giving us really hilarious and catty scenes, with her ever so intimidating dominance as a tax officer chasing after Michelle's tax submission, giving us such visual craze, is all the movie gives?  Well well well, good girl good bad Stephanie Hsu reprises herself catching us all off guard with her sudden dominatrix personality with her bad ass demeanor, together with Michelle giving us a whole fresh wave of more insanity! \n\nThis is the type of movie u would make so much funny sounds because of so many amazing scenes or exciting moments, u just couldn't help but to cheer at the very moment at the very time.\n\nWith all the super fun elements, this movie gives us something that makes it even more precious & powerful, the multiple messages that come with it just as the multiverse of various settings. It really depends individually in how to perceive the movie, getting what the message that crosses you, but for sure, everyone leaves the cinema with something to talk about, and many more to share with, that's the insane part about this movie, the fun continues with you even the movie may be ended! \n\nNo wonder it's the hotter contender with the most Oscar nominations this time, let's hope this movie win big, Taking home all the major categories with all the talents with their well deserved statuette. Only distinctive part is, two crazy ladies getting recognized and competing in the same category, neck to neck, hand in hand. It's either Jamie or Stephanie to take this supporting role home, either one still means victory to the movie and cast for sure! \n\nAll the best u guys!",

Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong. Jamie Lee Curtis, each and everyone in the cast is so good that there is not a single loose thread in the acting. they're all just perfect.\n\nthe story, phew. I can't really describe it to you but just to summarize, it's essentially a story about a mother who is a failure but doesn't want her daughter to be the same, but even if she's a failure, it doesn't matter because it does not change the fact that she is always gonna be her daughter and nothing in this vast multiverse can change that unconditional love a mother has for her child. michelle yeoh literally travels the entire multiverse to save her daughter and is stubborn (as she should be) in not letting her precious child go.\n\nI didn't think this film would manage to make me cry when I stepped into the theatres to watch it for the first time. but so happened the first and, lo and behold, even after rewatching it today, I cried. the film manages to tap into every human emotion possible and makes you feel things. makes me happy, sad, angry, surprised, bitter and so much more.\n\nthe aspect which I loved the most? the editing. if this film hadn't been edited the way it has been. I think it wouldn't be able to achieve the status it has achieved as of now. It's so good, it's mind-boggling. I will try my best to recreate some of this in the future if I can because this film really opens up a lot of editing techniques which I've rarely seen before.\n\njust watch this guys, it might become your favourite film of the year. a huge shoutout to A24 for producing this risky project and releasing it before the over-hyped Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness which, let's be honest, was barely about the multiverse and straight up disappointing.",

I wish the whole thing had kept my interest as well as the 1st 1/3 of the film.  Acting was fine, even exceptional.  It did drag at times and I lost the plot too; and it has a feel good ending.  Sadly the who thing was tainted by what I consider an obscene scene involving two \"bad guys\" who gain power by jumping rear end first onto the butt plugs and fighting with these things explicitly hanging out from their rears.  This was not funny, nor did it advance the plot nor make the film more entertaining.

The scenes in the first half of the movie appeared incoherent and it was hard to understand what was going on. But then I discovered that this incoherence was consistent, like some mathematical constant and came to realization that maybe I should not approach this movie with logic and I should not try so hard to understand it, but rather let the movie take you in for the ride and get into it for the sensation of it all and see where it goes. And oh my, how it delivered. I wasn't expecting such an epic emotional rollercoaster experience, even with all the crazy over the top things happening on screen, it blended very well together. It literally included everything, everywhere, all at once that you ever wanted in a movie. This was a masterpiece of a movie. Instant timeless classic, and topics touched upon that are very relevant for our times. This also shows you that representation matters!

Beyond that opening shot though, is a VERY meh movie. The idea of this film is incredibly creative and very ambitious. To the editor for splicing together so many multiverse shots and to the Daniels for writing and directing said shots, I commend them. However, to do a multiverse film and simultaneously address the meaning of life in a profound way\u2026I don't think they quite pulled it off. The character of Joy represents our modern society and every classic young adult today that feels hopeless and doesn't have another deep thought afterward. This is supposedly a film about a mother and daughter who can't quite understand each other or love one another well. To properly resolve such a broken relationship, the emotional scene at the end would sound something like this: Evelyn saying, \"I'm sorry. I know that you hate your life and that things are hard. I don't want that for you. I love you. We can make this relationship work and try to help each other out,\" with Joy replying, \"I love you too, mom. And I'm sorry for everything before. Yes, let's do this. Let's make this work.\" Instead, we get Evelyn saying, \"We can do whatever we want. Nothing matters,\" with Joy replying, \"This is so embarrassing.\" This is not a character arc where flaws are conquered and a compromise is made between two colliding personalities. This is simply a brief addressing of an existing pain, followed by a sarcastic ignoring of it. I also do not understand the hype over the acting. Don't get me wrong, Ke Huy Quan plays his part perfectly, is quite endearing, and the best character in the film. However, his role is not a hard one to play nor demanding of an Oscar. Stephanie Hsu plays her part very well and has the most depth to her character, but the character is poorly written, over-ridden with attitude and spite and robbed of the sympathy and empathy that would make an audience root for her. Michelle Yeoh does not stun in a complex, awe-inspiring role. She does just fine in the role of a mom who gets to be a comic-book hero for a day. And Jamie Lee Curtis does not transform herself into a SAG-award-winning IRS agent. She simply is her funny, goofy Jamie Lee Curtis self making us laugh because she's Jamie Lee Curtis. Yes, the comedic elements of this movie and some of the jokes and gags that come around are hilarious and quite clever. But, if Ke Huy Quan needed me to commit an impossibility to travel to an alternate universe, for me, it would not be to confess my love for Jamie Lee Curtis or to stick a cone up my ass, but to say with confidence that Everything Everywhere All At Once is the best picture of the year.",

The multiverse concept lets the viewer understand characters on a deeper level in a rather unique way that I haven't seen utilized in many other multiverse movies (which tend to use alternate realities simply as cool backdrops). Since my first viewing, I've watched the movie as least 3 more times and each time I end it bawling. I will admit sometimes the humor can be a little bit excessive, but I don't think at all that it takes away from the emotional experience.\n\nMy favorite movie of all time!",

The story explores the nature of self and being through the story of one family, and the multiple lives they lead in the infinite multiverse, ultimately helping our hero find joy in her (meaningful/meaningless?) existence.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the multiverse in film, but this movie brings entirely new elements to the table, and the set of rules introduced to jumping from one universe to the next keeps everyone on their toes.\n\nThe value of the serious and silly is evident here and balanced in a way that is rarely done well.

From Michelle Yeoh's exceptional (as always) performance and Ke Huy Quan's underdog of an unexpected comeback performance allows the film to sail into your heart and leave you thinking about the things that really matter in life. Personally, when I walked out of the theatre, I was awestruck. I loved every minute. I overheard a woman talking about the film, claiming she found no message. I am here to say that is not the case whatsoever. The film has multiple messages for the viewer to cling onto and relate to.

In short, it follows a Chinese immigrant family dealing with tax issues and relationship problems, but it's so much more than that. The movie is a unique blend of originality, creativity, heart, and absurdity, with Michelle Yeoh's Evelyn and her daughter Joy (played by Hsu) at the center of the story. The relationship between Evelyn and Joy drives the narrative through its multiverse-spanning journey, with help from other characters like Waymond, Gong Gong, and Deirdre. Yeoh shines in her role as she portrays multiple versions of herself in an action-packed and emotionally charged performance. The movie is filled with weird and wonderful characters, situations, and lifestyles as the Daniels (the filmmakers) fully embrace the madness of the concept. Despite the absurdity, the movie never loses sight of the importance of family and provides a deep look at generational trauma, existentialism, and identity. The movie also takes the audience on an emotional journey, culminating in a tear-inducing finale. It's a truly impressive feat given the eccentric and outlandish nature of the movie, and in a time where audiences are craving originality, Everything Everywhere All at Once delivers with a fearless and nonconformist approach. It's a cinematic maverick that's bonkers, chaotic, and wild \u2013 a rare treat.\n\nSPANISH REVIEW\nEverything Everywhere All at Once es una pel\u00edcula que se experimenta mejor sin saber demasiado al respecto. En resumen, sigue a una familia de inmigrantes chinos que se enfrenta a problemas fiscales y de pareja, pero es mucho m\u00e1s que eso. La pel\u00edcula es una combinaci\u00f3n \u00fanica de originalidad, creatividad, coraz\u00f3n y absurdo, con Evelyn de Michelle Yeoh y su hija Joy (interpretada por Hsu) en el centro de la historia. La relaci\u00f3n entre Evelyn y Joy impulsa la narrativa a trav\u00e9s de su viaje que abarca varios universos, con la ayuda de otros personajes como Waymond, Gong Gong y Deirdre. Yeoh brilla en su papel al representar m\u00faltiples versiones de s\u00ed misma en una actuaci\u00f3n llena de acci\u00f3n y carga emocional. La pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 llena de personajes, situaciones y estilos de vida extra\u00f1os y maravillosos, ya que los Daniels (los cineastas) aceptan por completo la locura del concepto. A pesar de lo absurdo, la pel\u00edcula nunca pierde de vista la importancia de la familia y ofrece una mirada profunda al trauma generacional, el existencialismo y la identidad. La pel\u00edcula tambi\u00e9n lleva a la audiencia a un viaje emocional, que culmina en un final que provoca l\u00e1grimas. Es una haza\u00f1a realmente impresionante dada la naturaleza exc\u00e9ntrica y extravagante de la pel\u00edcula, y en un momento en que el p\u00fablico anhela la originalidad, Everything Everywhere All at Once ofrece un enfoque intr\u00e9pido e inconformista. Es un inconformista cinematogr\u00e1fico que es loco, ca\u00f3tico y salvaje, un placer raro.",

            "content": "Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (A.K.A Daniels) bring audiences a fascinating film about a Chinese immigrant who becomes entangled in a multiverse-spanning adventure after trying to do her taxes. BAFTA nominee Michelle Yeoh stars alongside Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis in one of 2022's most exciting films.\n\n\u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once' follows Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), an overworked Chinese immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband Waymond, while also dealing with the strained relationship she has with her daughter and her judgemental father. Amid juggling her personal issues, Evelyn must attend a meeting with the IRS to discuss her business' web of finances. However, what occurs during this meeting will change the course of Evelyn's life forever, taking her on a mammoth journey across the multi-verse that makes for one of A24's craziest films.\n\nEven though \u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once' is a film that features wacky, unpredictable action, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Schienert direct a film that, despite its crazy fight sequences is packed topfull of complex emotion. The directing duo bring audiences a film that manages to inject powerful emotions into some of the wackiest scenarios you'll ever see. Perhaps the film's ability to balance heart-wrenching sentiment, outrageous comedy and erratic action is what makes it such a unique film, even by A24's boundary-pushing standards. \u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once' does carry a hefty runtime with its daring storyline, coming in at 139 minutes, even longer than this year's other multi-versal event, Sam Raimi's \u2018Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' which is only 126 minutes. However, unlike its Marvel counterpart, it audiences a more thorough insight into the world's many universes. We get to see universes where Evelyn (Yeoh) takes on careers like being a professional singer, acting and a Teppanyaki chef, as well as worlds where humanity evolved to have hot-dog fingers or places where life was never born, thus resulting in Joy (Hsu) and Evelyn taking on the form of rocks. This scene between Evelyn and Joy surprises viewers who will end up crying at two rocks engaging in a subtitled conversation about the complexity of life.\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu both give magnificent performances and by the end of the film audiences will be excited for their next outing together, which as of May 2022, the pair have both been announced to star in the new Disney+ series \u2018American Born Chinese'. Hsu's performance as both versions of Joy make you feel like you're watching two vastly different actors and makes for performance you can't draw yourself away from. Ke Huy Quan also delivers a brilliant turn as both versions of Waymond, one as a feeble and wimpy version of Evelyn's husband and the other as a skilled fighter and multi-verse traveller. However, the highlight of both Quan and Yeoh's performances comes towards the end of the film in which alternate versions of Waymond and Evelyn discuss what could've been in a scene that emanates films from acclaimed director Wong Kar Wai. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a hilarious performance as Deidre and the alternate versions of the mundane IRS officer\n\nAudiences are thrown in for an emotional rollercoaster when they sit down to watch \u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once', dealing with themes of acceptance, divorce, love, and the complexity of mother/daughter relationships. So not only does the film deliver on it's promise of an \u2018insane adventure', but also tugs at your heartstrings. The film is filled with top-notch craftsmanship, ranging from clever editing that elevates the project to another level and an impressive screenplay from Scheinert and Kwan. This is a film that isn't afraid to be unapologetically silly or ridiculous, and perhaps that's what makes is such a special film.\n\n\u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once' is a film that puts a wacky and refreshingly unique spin on the idea of a multiverse, made popular by Marvel's ever-growing universe of films. Directing duo Daniels create a film that not only entertains with it's interesting and thought-provoking story, but also with its impressive technical factors and performances that will hopefully make it a contender in the 2022/23 awards season. The film joins the ranks of some of A24's best films, sitting on the same shelf as films like Greta Gerwig's 2017 coming-of-age film \u2018Lady Bird', Mike Mills drama \u2018C'mon C'mon and Ari Aster's terrifying horror \u2018Midsommar'. Taking its audiences on a wild ride across the multiverse, \u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once' takes its spot as one of 2022's best films already and brings a ground-breaking story to audiences across the world.",

It is up to a middle-aged Chinese immigrant (Michelle Yeoh) to save the universe! Also involved is Jamie Lee Curtis as an overzealous IRS auditor! To me, it seemed like being in an overlong acid trip (although I have never taken LSD, it seemed like something one might experience on that drug!). So, I am not sure I can recommend this movie, except that Michelle Yeoh and especially Jamie Lee Curtis's performances are very good. I found the movie itself to be overstuffed, overlong and ultimately ridiculous. 5/1",

I struggled to suspend my disbelief because the writing was so stereotypical that I just assumed they were going to pull back the veil to reveal they were parodying bad science fiction, but no, they spend two hours on this weak plot. Most frustratingly, Ke Huy Quan (Waymond) mumbles and rushes through most of his lines and switches frequently between Mandarin and English, making his frenzied explanations incoherent and hard to follow. This was an annoying and disappointing watch and I found myself constantly checking to see when it would be over.",

A lot of it works, and a lot of it just comes off as someone thinking about why his life stinks while standing in the shower. For one, I just don't buy Michelle Yeoh's character. She fails to deliver the intended comedy in this story. Even if her reactions are meant to be those of an \"everyman,\" I don't believe her performance. There is a rumor that they wanted Jackie Chan at first. With that knowledge, you can see how this character was almost tailor-made for him; he would have been glorious, and he could probably spice up those low-budget martial arts scenes they had. However, on the opposite end of the spectrum from Michelle is Ke Huy Quan. He is just marvelous and, in my view, carried the movie. In the end, the glitzy editing and too much stuff being thrown on screen dilute the movie. And with so much buildup, one might even expect something other than the simple principle of \"Be good and find your own meaning.\" But alas, the movie spends too much time on the sausage finger gag. One of the Dans absolutely adored that joke.",

Additionally, they use humor as comedic relief every now and then to keep people engaged. One thing I wish it had is a little more clarity on some of the metaphors that they were trying to use. It did get a bit confusing at times, and I would get lost in where the plot was going. I think that might have been intentional, and that is what made it stand out so much.

At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comment: this is the latest from writers-producers-directors Daniel Kwam and Daniel Scheineret (a/k/a \"the Danierls\"). This is only their second feature length movie, after 2016's critically acclaimed \"Swiss Army Man\". Like that movie, in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" they bring a highly original premise and story line. Frankly, the plot is so off kilter that it doesn't even make any sense, nor need it be. Instead, one simply sits back and enjoys whatever is unfolding on the screen. Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as Evelyn. I didn't realize that the IRS auditor is played by Jamie Lee Curtis until the credits rolled. I don't know if others felt the same, but I felt a bit overwhelmed, if npot exhausted, by it all and I watched the entire movie over two equal parts on consecutive evenings. That does not mean that I didn't like the movie, let me be clear.\n\n\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" was an unexpected box office hit during its US theatrical run that started last Spring, For whatever reason I just didn't feel drawn to it. Then earlier this week, it gathered an amazing 11 Oscar nominations, more than any other film, and I told myself I really needed to find out what the buzz was all about. I watched the film earlier this week (it's streaming on Showtime). Glad I did. If you are in the mood for truly something very different and uniquely original, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

            "content": "The film is a sly parody of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's (MCU) \"What If\" series in its exploration of alternate realities, but quickly switches tracks to ground the narrative and its characters in our reality to explore many themes that are close to home. Chief of those themes is the importance of priorities, with filmmakers writing a good chunk of Evelyn's dialogue to emphasize her desperation on keeping the family business afloat while facing the consequences of her decisions. This is further explored in the early flashback scenes of Evelyn's and Waymond's relationship, the birth of their family business, and the birth of their daughter.\n\nThroughout the film, filmmakers also allude to the importance of acceptance. We see this play out with Evelyn and her father, tiptoeing around the topic of her daughter dating another woman. This theme is also echoed by the constant shift in Waymond's personality, who alternates between his present non-masculine self, and his alternate reality personality who is a confident and skilled fighter, whom Evelyn falls deep in love with. The biggest thing Evelyn had to come to terms with throughout the film was accepting that she was burned out, that she couldn't shoulder all the family's responsibility on her own, and that it was okay for her to ask for help.\n\nThis leads to the other theme that was explored in the film - the strength to rely on others. Throughout the film, we see the effects of Evelyn shouldering everything on her own. We see everything around her starting to crumble, figuratively and literally. This eventually leads to her falling apart, not knowing what to do. These scenes contrast drastically with the final few scenes of the film where we see Evelyn happy, having those weights lifted from her shoulders.\n\nOne other theme that filmmakers chose to explore with this reality-bending film is the importance of facing reality. This is seen throughout the movie with the intercut scenes of the other realities, which Evelyn slowly begins running away to when things become too overwhelming for her. Eventually, with those realities beginning to fold into her own, she is forced to return to her reality to address what she has done and what she has to do.\n\nThis film is a wonderful exploration of both reality and alternate realities. Every scene is meaningful and well-paced, with a great blend of well-choreographed and whimsical action scenes. Despite being conceptually brilliant, the film's villain is plagued by the \"MCU villain\" problem, being two-dimensional in portrayal and dialog. Filmmakers had a golden egg in their hands with the concept of the film's big bad but failed to leverage more on her backstory to make her more relatable, especially to younger teenage audiences who could see themselves in the villain's shoes. What made it worse was the overwhelming contrast between the main character and the villain of the film, with the main character's performance and dialog outshining that of the villain. Nevertheless, the heart of the story remains clear and simple for audiences of most age groups to understand and appreciate. With a personal rating of 4.5/5, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a must-watch film for parents and teenagers alike, especially in theaters with the right audio and video formats.",

The performances were great. The multiverse concept intriguing. The fast-paced scenes and elaborate settings were amazing. My gosh, the shooting script must have been 400 pages.\n\nBut the point of this film, which is disguised as a sci-fi comedy, is essentially a dysfunctional family coming together to forgive. Plot-wise, that's about it, although the filmmakers kept hammering lines like \"nothing matters\" and \"be kind\" and \"we're all small and stupid\" and even the \"F\" word all by itself on screen for us to treasure. \n\nA mature Michelle Yeoh stars as the overwhelmed Evelyn Wang who's in tax trouble with IRS, divorce trouble with her long-suffering husband, and relationship trouble with her daughter. Yeoh deserves an Oscar for her exceptional performance as a woman who discovers her true powers.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis camps through the role of a frustrated IRS agent and might take home a trophy for best supporting actress. Stephanie Hsu manages not to mess up her dual roles as Evelyn's lesbian daughter and some sort of evil goddess called Juba. The male actors were all fine in their roles.\n\nBut for some reason, other than when Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis were on-screen, I found myself bored with the film's existential platitudes and truly wanted it to end. Okay, so I at least found the spinning bagel funny. (I won't explain.)\n\nThe Academy's Oscar \"representation\" requisites were fulfilled by having a mostly Asian cast, a female lead, a disabled father, and several gay-girl scenes. You might find it interesting to review the Academy's recent \"representation guidelines,\" which in my opine are over the top. However, they do explain why you're now seeing so many gay-girl scenes in films.\n\nThe most disposable scenes were two rocks in the desert discussing the futility of their existence. Heck, cutting that scenario might have reduced the run time by at least 10 minutes. Truly: was this \"Waiting for Godot\" in rock form? I got the feeling those scenes were added in post by someone who thought using rocks was a brilliant idea.\n\nForgive me for being either too jaded or over-lit-majored or envious of the filmmaker's amazing ability to put this thing together and win an Oscar, but the Pat-Oh-Meter gives this highly rated, highly touted film only 3.5 out of five stars.\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but originality in film should include creativity in what words emanate from the actors' mouths\u2014and especially what emotions those words instill in the audience. A great film should not be an endless melange of bizarre, creative, and entertaining scenes.\n\nI kept asking, \"Is it over?\" And when it finally was, I asked, \"Was that it?\"",

It uses things like the multiverse and martial arts to help tell the story, which I don't think it needed, but it was what the screenwriter and the director wanted to use, possibly to make this a unique premise, something never really tried before - though in different ways it has been done in other movies to different extents. The basic gist of the story is a mother who is trying to connect with her husband and her daughter, and how in all the different universes they find that connection, and where they lose also lose their connections to each other. It is also a very philosophical movie, touching upon the absurdity of life and our humanity. It takes awhile in the movie to get to that point. You have to deal with the odd and sometimes confusing plot points to reach it, but if you can get through all of that mess, there is a gem there. But not everyone will find it or maybe even understand it. I think the people making this movie wanted to be unique, and did so to a fault. I think it could have been toned down a bit, without all the odd extras. The essence of the story was pretty good, but the execution was somewhat off. But I do think if you can get to the end, and you can finally understand the true message, it will impart a good impression on you. I think the acting was very good overall. Now if you are one of the people that started the movie, but couldn't get through it the first time, skip forward about halfway, and rewatch it. I think you'll really start to understand it from that point on. I think the movie might start to make more sense to you.",

The movie begins simply enough: a Chinese immigrant family who owns a laundromat gets audited by the IRS for overextending the definition of the phrase \"write-off.\" When they have to go speak with an IRS agent (played magnificently by the great Jamie Lee Curtis) the result is anything but simple. Evelyn Wang, the family's matriarch (played by the exceptional Michelle Yeoh) is approached by a different version of her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). This version is from an alternate reality and he warns that there is a multiversal force that threatens the existence of every reality and that this version of Evelyn Wang is the secret to defeating this ominous, evil force. This threat turns out to be a version of Evelyn's daughter, Joy (played by the scene-stealing Stephanie Hsu), who is capable of tapping into other versions of herself in order to borrow their skills to ensure that her abilities are limitless. What results is a surprisingly intimate look into family, potential, and self-worth against the backdrop of infinity. It's a film that defies any sort of pigeonhole; viewers will laugh throughout, be amazed at the choreography of the fight scenes, and will even cry when the total weight of everything starts to be addressed. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a movie who's title can be believed, it's a visual spectacle that is sure to stick with you well after the credits roll. It's a thematically rich tapestry that proves just how big a single film can really be, I can't wait to watch it again.",

The story was so creative, and as it got more and more complex, I became more and more invested. So many different avenues were explored, and so many weird ideas were brought to fruition and I loved it. There were a lot of little touches that I liked, too, not the least of which were the two little rocks and Randy Newman voicing a freaking raccoon. That man doesn't miss. Aside from those oddball moments, the movie's message (one that you had to cut back a lot of madness to see) was really great, and the performances were outstanding. Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan were phenomenal, but really no one slacked. My only qualm with the movie, and the reason that it's not getting 5 stars for now, is that I'm 100% positive I didn't fully understand everything, and now I'm going to have to find a YouTube video to break it all down for me. Once I watch that, though, I may come back and change my rating. What a fantastic movie.",

But after rewatching it after some time, I am convinced that it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across. Granted, I haven't watched, read or played every movie/show/play, book or game ever created in the many languages that exist. But of the significant portion of my life I have spent experiencing stories and my subjective & biased parameters for what an exceptional form of storytelling should ideally be based on, I am certain that this movie is the best I've come across yet.\n\nWhy do I think that?\n\nBecause it combines the most investigated philosophical question of the purpose of life, the most complex metaphysical theory of multiverses and the most consistently prevalent emotions of hope & despair, all together, in 150 minutes that span almost every storytelling genre there is.\n\nAnd it does this with a series of truly extraordinary & powerful acting performances, elegantly simple yet extremely compelling dialogues, absurdist yet coherent editing & transitions and one of the most narratively complementary cinematography ever.\n\nFurthermore, the exceptionally intelligent use of various styles of humour, balanced with a metaphorical yet deeply compassionate use of relationships, to construct a narrative that - though may appear comically-absurd & entertaining on a casual first-watch - is actually so much more; being consistently deliberate, methodical & profound on a second viewing.\n\nAll this coalesces into a unique emotional journey - with an abundance of excellent humour - that inevitably transitions to a rollercoaster ride of hope crescendos & despair diminuendos, while offering convincing justifications for these ebbs and flows, concluding in an extremely cathartic & appropriate ending.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once - as the title suggests - is truly a story about everything, everywhere, told all at once. It's the most conclusive story of existence. And as cliched and inaccurate its ultimate moral may seem, it ingeniously conveys it in the single most hopeful & captivating manner possible.\n\nAnd that's why it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across.",

            "content": "In the competition for the Oscar this year, the highest number of nominations was won by \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\", which I did not think deserved any review, but since there is really no reasonable achievement in the offer for the award, here are a few words about it, and some attempt at analysis everything that will possibly happen to us at the assignment.\n\nThe theme of parallel worlds is not new either in science fiction or in the film industry. The revived interest is due to the influence of the late-phase Marvel movies. So, if this film wins some awards, it will be a kind of victory for Marvel, since they didn't manage to push their \"Wakanda Forever\", which should not be at all in this year's competition. By the way, it should be said that the nomination of Angela Bassett for supporting role is controversial, because no matter how good the actress is, the film for which she receives the award should still be good, which is not the case here. And Chadwick Boseman was a good actor, but no one thought of nominating him for the highly overrated first part of the \"Black Panther\" series.\n\nWhat to say about \"Everything...\"? The film is technically excellent, the camera and direction are outstanding, the inspiring ways of filming deserve all the praise. But that would be all about it. Short cut shots, jumps from universe to universe, kaleidoscopes of colors and a variety of scenography, all of which would make it seem as if something is actually happening, cannot be a substitute for an overly thin script (if there was one at all). Anyway, the awards follow him in any case, because the film is sufficiently \"woke\" and feministic, and the actresses Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis were up to the task. As someone has already noticed, Jamie Lee could be easily a tax collector in a parallel universe, if she hadn't been acting.\n\nAs for other accomplishments in the competition, there is little positive to say. \"Triangle of Sadness\" is a bad amateur film, it will be really sadness if it really wins an award. Spielberg definitely failed with \"Fabelmans\" (already nicknamed \"Boremans\" by the audience who watched it), the idea that three or four segments of the film be directed as different genres from the history of cinematography resulted in only boring cliches, without any sense, except perhaps for the author himself. \"Babylon\" is a total failure, and will be remembered only for the director's fascination with human (and animal) fluids. For a reason, it wasn't nominated for anything important, except for original music. But in that case, it would be better if they made a movie about a black jazz trumpet player (one of the secondary characters), if it is their original music, because the mindless repetition of \"Singing in the rain\", which they drowned out in the movie, was probably not the reason. \"Banshees of Inisherin\" with its extraordinary scenography and costumes, did not reach the level of even a third-rate film. The only Oscar, as far as can be seen, should go to the donkey, who, through no fault of his own, dies in the end, because he lasted so long to be in the movie. The other candidates hardly deserve to be mentioned, or I have already mentioned them in other places.\n\nI would not talk about the films that were the only commercial success, such as \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and \"Avatar 2\", on this occasion. It seems that Hollywood is left only to reward achievements that are technically well done, good stories and interesting topics should be given up, because no one picture them anymore, nor does they take them into account. Sad days for cinema lovers.",

I read somebody said that its flow of events were such a mess that they cannot follow but I didn't have any problem understanding it. The life of main character is scattering unsolved layers of problems so it's supposed to be chaotic, and in chaos and frustration and fear and despair that we find ourselves, if we hold on to our core value strongly enough. I'm so happy to find such a strong message being conveyed through a story of a domestic Asian immigrant family where the mother is the hero and the father, opposite to Hollywood's formula of supporting role who are so bland and unimportant, helps the mother every time she's in critical moments to see through herself and figure the right track. No success is achieved alone! \nIt also tackles the generation gap question that a lots of Asian have growing up with their families, to let them be or to direct them in a supposedly good track. Can't say enough of my thinking after watching this movie but go into it cold and feel it yourself. Don't go to a movie after watching tons of reviews and a judgmental attitude to compare the movie with your favorites, or even too highly expect from a lot of praises, it'll ruin your genuine experience with a good, or if I would say, a great movie.",

We all knew (yes, you're included in this) that her IRS trophies that adorned her administrative office resembled giant buttplugs \u2014 I appreciate that \"The Daniels\" followed the \"Chekhov's Gun\" rule in that regard. It's not the easiest to review, but I will say this, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the kind of movie that gives me hope. It's original, comprehensive in approach, but simple in message, fun, and funny. It can be enjoyed at home, but perhaps bolstered by a theater viewing. I love Swiss Army Man and didn't realize EEAaO was only their second full-feature collaboration. When I had been set in my thinking that anything original will only come from foreign filmmakers, I finally get to this. I hope it comes away with some hardware at the Oscars. There's also lots of Kung Fu.",

It's a rapturous cinematic experience that takes the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster through existential dread, the crushing burden of expectations, and the overwhelming nature of life. It's funny, ridiculous, poignant, and, above all, unashamedly hopeful. In spite of its themes, Everything reminds us that, even when the world overwhelms us and brings us to our lowest, there are moments, moments when, sometimes, just sometimes, we can overwhelm the world.\n\nFor a more in-depth look and more posts like this, visit my site: https://thephoenixprjct.com/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-in-depth-review/",

It ultimately completely lives up to it's name, because they certainly threw just about everything everywhere all at once. It had me in the first half, I could follow it, and I even found it was a really cool concept. but somewhere around an hour 15/ hour and a half it just totally lost me. I think the cast was actually really great for what they were given, but I don't understand how this movie scores so high with everyone everywhere. Personally I think that people latch onto the bizarre spectacle that it definitely is full of, things like Dirk Gently or Rick and Morty are full of. It just got a little muddled down by this for me, and the grounded story it was trying to tell ultimately just fell away - by the end I couldn't care any less for Evelyn or her little family. Maybe that's the point - the multiverse is so big, so why care about these small parts of it - but I like to think this film was trying to tell the opposite, and perhaps it succeeded in doing so for all those who rate it higher, it just didn't for me.",

This connection had a nice arch throughout the story but failed to draw me in emotionally. I understood what I should feel in those impactful moments but had a hard time connecting.\n\nThe performances were great. Ke Huy Quan was incredible and one of the highlights of the entire movie. His switch from clueless doppy husband to multi-versal warrior had me hysterically laughing. Michelle Yeoh is fantastic and deserving of all her praise and award buzz.\n\nDespite my problems with a lack of connection to the story, the action really raises this movie as a whole. There is something so captivating about 60-year-old women performing incredible complex kung fu against one another. The brutality is superb and incredibly fun to watch. Another layer to the action is the actions our characters must perform to tape into their mulit-versal selves. These are crazy, vulgar, and some of the most shocking things I have seen on screen.\n\nScore: 85%\nVerdict: Great",

It told a simple story of the love and miscommunications between an immigrant mother and her gay daughter, as well as a distant wife and sensitive husband (both hardworking), in a crazy complex and confusingly beautiful way. The visuals were just as amazing. I was drawn in the whole time and sobbing through half of it. It was truly an experience and something more screenwriters and directors should look up to.

            "content": "The plot itself is extremely simple (not sure why a few have issues with understanding it).  If you don't want to follow the crazy universe hopping, which I can understand for older folk, it can be broken down to it's most simple of parts into a story about a fractured family with one single character in the very middle and mostly the cause of said familial problems.  The main character goes on an absolutely crazy adventure through different universes where they experience their life in completely different ways from the one they currently lead and the story plays out showing the effect of knowing such information has on them.\nHeartfelt moments throughout the movie just made everything come together so perfectly. \n\nThis movie deserves awards.\n\nThe movie has a  \"Multiverse\" like element but it doesn't bring it up multiple times. It allows us to absorb that information without it being annoying. This is how a Multiverse movie should be in my honest opinion. \n\nThe movie does start off slow but it's to get a feel of each character and their personalities giving us an insight on how they behave and adapt throughout the film. \n\nThe Action Scenes are Jackie Chan meets Kung Fu Hustle and it's done so well that you welcome these moments within the movie. \n\nThroughout the movie there are some moments that are uncanny, but to be honest. These moments don't come off very welcoming but they serve a purpose later on in the movie that provides an important role later on in the movie making it very hilarious, it gives you that \"Oh now I see why that was placed there.\" \"Oh that's why (Dot Dot Dot)\" It doesn't make sense but later on it will add further humor to certain scenes throughout the movie. \n\n You'll see exactly what I mean if you do decide on watching it.  \n\nIt does have some dark comedy, so this is not something for children. \n16+ should be fine. (Swearing) (Some Blood During Fight Scenes) (Mild uses of certain erotic toys) But (No Nudity) \n\nThis movie was just outstanding overall. I loved the Characters and the Actors felt natural and the emotions were genuine. You can feel for each moment good, bad, awesome, weird, and understand that this is how a movie should be. \n\nI wouldn't skip on this movie. This truly deserves awards for its hard work and the great acting.\n\n\nIt's absolutely hilarious, gut-wrenching, wholesome, and even full of fantastically choreographed fight scenes all in a fantastic blend.  Even in the times when things become sad, they throw in some comedy that doesn't truly feel like it takes away from the moment but it does help alleviate the \"feels\" a bit. (Especially when the plot hits close to home for a lot of people)  I was able to laugh and cry at the same time without feeling like I was stretched too thin.\n\nWhile I feel like the message behind the movie is extremely simple and can portrayed even without the crazy shenanigans of universe-hopping, this insanity is what gives the movie the character it needed to really elevate itself into something special.  Hell, the most touching moment in the movie for me was in one of these different universes and even though it was hilarious, I was still touched by the moment despite being able to laugh.\n\nHeck, even though the movie is quite long (for me at least) it never felt like it was overstaying it's welcome and I never had that feeling of \"okay, let's wrap this up.\" that I feel with 90% of movies in the theater.\n\nHeavily recommend to most people, if they can deal with the off-the-wall shenanigans that occur. \n\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" is an absolute tour de force on every sense you could experience from a film. In spans of less than five minutes, you could experience laughter, joy, confusion, anger, depression, fear, etc. as the story tells itself. The visuals, camera work, acting, choreography, costumes, lighting, sound design, set designs, EVERYTHING are flawlessly executed. There isn't a single moment where the movie isn't screaming for your attention. Through all that noise, there is a very deep, relatable, and real story of generational trauma, finding yourself, dealing with your flaws, and fighting to be who you are and for your family to understand you for it. Daniels have wowed me before with Swiss Army Man, my favorite movie of 2016. And now this film is my favorite of 2022, and perhaps even if the last five years. Do yourself a favor and give yourself a night to watch through this film, chew on it, and ask yourself if you're living your best life. A beautifully masterful film, a true masterpiece of it's time for sure, and hopefully will inspire other generations in the future.",

This happens every now and then when a film garners support to such an overwhelming degree that I grow more worried to actually see it. I guess what I'm saying is I don't like having expectations; yet another reason why  I avoid trailers like the bubonic plague. So I, regrettably, walked into this movie filled with expectations. I am happy to report that some were irrefutably fulfilled, and some were not. The unsung heroes of post-production are largely responsible for the former as Paul Rogers delivers a stellar performance in the editing chair. Speaking of stellar performances, it is about time that Michelle Yeoh be recognized for her immense talent. Oscar-winning talent as Evelyn? I'm not so sure. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed her \"baby deer learning how to walk\" in the context of a multiverse---pure entertainment. Stephanie Hsu as the ironically named Joy and Ke Huy Quan as Waymond fill in the gaps beautifully and bring the screenplay back down to reality in moments where it is needed most to reveal a touching familial undertone that is crucial for the success of the exposition. My issues arise in pacing. After doing the intense field work of asking two of my friends it is clear that I am not unique in thinking this way. While this is certainly not the first film to deal heavily with a multiverse, introduction to said multiverse is key. As viewer of generation z, it seems concerning how often I had to play catch up. I think this issue in understanding begins at the first sight of the multiverse. There is not enough time for audience digestion of one particular plot point so when it comes time to introduce another (which is extremely quickly with this film), it seems easier to just give up and be confused. I shouldn't have to rely on my own willingness to decode to enjoy the supposed, \"most entertaining movie of the year\". This said, the innovation and just flat out ridiculousness of Everything Everywhere All At Once far outweighs any conception issues I had with it. You know a movie is keeping you engaged when you stare at two rocks in conversation completely enamored. Is this the greatest movie ever made? I don't think so. Will it make you feel something? Yes. Definitely not one to miss out on.",

It felt like I knew the ending before it came. Usually this wouldn't bother me, but I thought about the ending because I wanted it to come faster than it did. Most of the meat of the movie is good, but nothing is ever great. \n\nWith an almost no first act, it's like a tripod with 2 legs that slowly toppled over.

For the next hour I was waiting for the mayhem to die down so that something could happen with the plot. Nope. It just keeps going. I had to fast forward to the ending, which was dull in itself. \nThe one shining moment is when the movie gets quiet, and a scene between the main characters (as rocks) in a 'dead universe' is animated entirely using subtitles on the screen. No audio. It was daring for a modern film, and it stands out in my memory as a truly original idea. The rest of it? Everybody was kung-fu fighting, and for what, I don't know or care.",

I thought that this movie was a fantastic model of embracing the hecticness of the multiverse and creating beautifully crafted scenes that meshed so well together. I also thought the choice of cast was great. The only superstar actress being Michelle Yeoh, it goes back into us showing Hollywood that we don't need the same traditional actors to make a great movie.",

Your spouse gets on your nerves, your kids drive you crazy and vice versa, and yet you find the thread through all the drama to maintain your love for your family. That was the real part. \n\nThe action sequences and the take on dimension hopping was crazy and fun. The most original take I've seen in scifi so far. I'd like to see a physicists take on it. Those may have been the funniest action sequences ever put into a movie. Jackie Chan meets gross out humour. Hilarious. \n\nAnd Ke Huy Quan did an amazing acting job. I didn't realize he was the kid in Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom. He got on my nerves in that movie. But here as a husband, father, and fight scene actor he was incredible. He switched personas, kicked butt, and was tender sometimes in the same scene.\n\nSpeaking of acting, this may be Michele Yeoh's finest acting job. She was great in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but here she plays a very flawed person coming to grips with her failures and successes. \n\nShe and Quan were great together and the entire cast was a hoot. I totally did not recognize Jamie Lee Curtis until I saw her name in the credits. Stephanie Hsu deserves more work. Great movie. Well worth your time.",

I cannot express how perfect a movie this was for me. I was cut apart by the sadness. The existential dread becoming apathy. Depression delivered so expertly. And that love is not always about holding someone safely away from harm, but sometimes to jump into danger with them. To hold them close as we all fall together through the many tragedies we live through. And not being lost in what ifs, but in finding the joy in the fact it could only really be this way for us. Amazing. And delivered in a way that was deep but not without joyfulness. Serious but not without mirth. Amazing.",

This film is like watching Neil DeGrasse Tyson's \"Cosmos\" on molly.\nWhile the acting is uniformly excellent, and the action sequences are well directed, the weak screenwriting belies Daniels' apparent confidence in their art. The \"grand statement\" that subjective experience and emotion gives meaning to an objectively meaningless existence is  questionable, as this worldview has no greater philosophical power than the conventional worldviews that Daniels' spend two and a half hours gleefully undermining. This could've been an excellent family drama that engages maturely with the philosophical questions that Daniels' seem so keenly aware of.

It's incredibly inventive film making that is at times so inventive that it is difficult to keep up with. I, let alone anyone, is wholly unfamiliar with movies like this because they just don't exist. On top of being innovative, EEAAO is funny, smart, and feels like a grand adventure of epic scale with its grandiose visuals and  sweeping musical score. I don't think I could praise an edit of a movie more than this one. That said, it's middle third is tough to for me to remain wholly invested in due to its sheer absurdity.

I think the people who like this movie simply haven't seen enough movies and TV shows. \n\nHonestly the plot wasn't hard to follow and its not hard to understand. It is just a basic sci fi multiverse plot with a family relationship thrown into the mix. Its not super deep. \n\nThe acting was ok and so was the special effects/choreography. however the character development was extremely lacking. it was hard to root for a winner when you cant connect with the characters in a meaningful way. which was ironic in a movie that is basically all about how we are  all seeking connection and love. \n\nas for humor,.. well sure a good ol' shock value sex toy scene or politically incorrect animal abuse type of thing can elicit a reaction but only once. After that it just gets awkward and dumb. Kinda like the fight scenes after awhile they all blend into one another and its gets tedious. \n\nhonestly this movie was one big hodgepodge of Asian stereotypes, sci fi, drama, feel good drama, slap stick, crude humor, LGBT, and artsy philosophical stuff. An LSD/ADHD nightmare that got thrown into a computer that used random code to spit out a movie that the masses would instantly deem a cult classic.\n\nbig fail for me.",

What you do understand though is the heart of the movie. It never leaves behind, I suspect in no small part because of the excellent performances of the leads, that core anxiety of ordinary problems.

            "content": "Usually you watch a film because you're curious over its story or/and potential synergy and dynamics, then mostly the second time or more upon further viewings you'll start to notice things you didn't know previously because you have time to consider another sort of angle to what you've experienced. That is what led me to give 2022's Best Picture winner \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" a second chance, or more formerly a re-evaluation after witnessing its awarded accolades and hearing their vocally vibrant appreciations that were genuinely felt, thus convincing me to re-watch the weird picture. Initially didn't range under my radar due to its absurdity despite it being their directorial aesthetic. Even though there was a good reason why while still drawn due to its critical acclaim, I was still rewarded for taking the time to witness something original, something fresh, tackling our own multiverse supposedly according to our reality with wild defying ideas. Like the multiversal question of life, what if rewatching the film certifies actual pure enjoyment with thoughtful room while finding justification over its awarded, highly-honored title? (And why wasn't \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" nominated for Best Song?)\n\nThe multiverse concept mainly specialized exclusively sorting out all existing storylines for comic books with different seriality under separate canonships. Once the connection been established vividly during their own crossover events, it was possibly thought provoking regarding our alternate selves through different directions that weren't taken in our lives. Different platforms adapted the vastness over selectively few storylines that are proven organically connected, but few months after \"EEAAO\" released, Marvel formally explored the concept through \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\". Both scopes applied similar rules but of course under their paraphrasing perspectives. The Daniels encrypted the codes and won the favorable reception over Sam Riami, though their incoherency awards the superhero flick the edge over its best logic in branching alternative worlds and connecting our senses speculatively. Personally prefer the mystic endeavor over the surreal approach, but in the fatigue times a continuously interconnected narrative stirs needed freshness which \"EEAAO\" delivers.\n\nSwamped with taxes and unaware of the changing family drama around her, Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), a middle-aged Chinese immigrant, sometimes wonders what her life would be if lived differently. A wish like that inadvertently swept her into a fight for survival across different universes over an unstoppable threat putting an existential end to living. Alone in this fight keyed positionally towards hope, the insane adventure opens Evelyn's mind into her different lives, connecting those skills in the fight and learning how to embrace her current life along with the people closest to her.\n\nIt turned out half fun and entertaining over its balanced concept, per the usual reception, between sensibly distorting visuals and taut writing as both synergically created wild creativity in stirring up the action in unexpected, skillful ways and the underlining drama. The distortion links to the other discomforting half from the over-the-top weirdness, whether or not it serves uniquely and contributes to the heard embrace. Then there's the convoluting incoherent shifts as the story reaches its climax mainly set in the main plotline, it settles elsewhere then resolves there while the main branch became a dumping ground for multiversal selves to jump and fight the battle as countering obstacles, damaging the setting with consequential acknowledgement immediately dropped during the fading transition. The Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) reflectively established the rules and did their best to maintain concentration towards them with expressively remarkable scope. Though when referring back to \"MoM\", Riami provided another set of rules that should've also been considered without much effect when putting both sets together with few cautions similarly. In this case, the Daniels didn't go all the way in their vision and only focused bizarrely on circumstantial distress, meaning what would've made the absurdist picture less and better is to not go with the generic harm.\n\nOn the other hand aside from the conceptual execution, the incomplete oversight lost in translation allowed writing room for seamless thematic hefts noted developmentally and across philosophically, therefore enabling blends of genres under genetic lineage. The list of themes ranges from existentialism and nihilism to neurodivergence and depression stemmed from generational trauma. The most common thematic subtextual trait across those analyzed themes is discussing identity, which both mother and daughter, Evelyn and Joy (Stephanie Hsu), grapples with as the soulful central conflict. Their pending estrangement is the actual story spearheaded through all the exaggeratedly metaphorical illusions as Joy's a teenager with a differing perspective that's generationally distant from Evelyn's conservative views she unable to escape from but wonders otherwise. May not be explicitly stated, but Joy's hopeful lean towards her mother does describe their relationship prior to the story, which by the way were expertly glimpsed.\n\nNarratively unrestrained with acceptance, it seems the filmmaking experience did more than just storytelling but also respectfully speculated alternative dimensions towards the cast, mainly the familial key and minimally for the pawns with cringeworthy results. The action's nonstop, faithful to the roots aligned with the main cast's previous experiences, particularly Michelle Yeoh magnificently braving with tolerance whilst blurring fictionalization, performing in accumulating her skills and heart for resonance and charismatic amusement. Stephanie Hsu performed a more memorably definitive breakthrough as she convincingly connects with her character's beliefs and otherworldly but grounded motives, enabling relation to those who too questionably grapple their identities without a firm grip till blessed. In an ultimate comeback since his mid-80s and early-90s fame, Ke Huy Quan returns to the cinema as Evelyn's hopelessly kind husband Waymond, who half the time been possessed by his alternate self who's speedily knowledgeable of the multiversal threat, and he performed exceptionally with recognized energy of a dimmed light that now shines brighter. Jamie Lee Curtis has ethical professionalism next to against-type quirks before unfolded humbly; and James Hong is the commanding veteran deeply rooted till he too humbles.\n\nIt's an open-ended recommendation for unique discoveries as \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" tackled the multiversal idea with all kinds of weirdness that may be unappealing for some, but it impresses greatly over its finalized delivery in perfecting details, mostly in part with the thorough concentration albeit the incoherency, and excellent performances carrying the story nicely. Its fellow Best Picture nominees, no matter the level of superiority, are accompanied with contributive cinematic statements, but this weighs more between thematically, visually by practicality and culturally at a balance. Then upon re-evaluating, I admittedly realize its deserving lineage along the past winners, even if it's not quite stellar. (B)",

(Played for laughs) where the small dog on a leash is swung across the room, first being thrown into a refrigerator, then again being swung around by the neck and thrown across the room, slamming into a wall divider and crying. \nThe worst part of this though, was it was clearly written by two men who have zero understanding of the severe consequences of mother-to-daughter emotional battery.  Script seems to have been written to appeal to the same Boomers who said millenials were lazy and poor because 'they ate too much avocado toast'.  Skip forward a decade, replace 'avocado toast' with 'everything bagel' and now it's Gen Z who are selfish, lazy, self-centered, cruel, while 'poor hardworking ma' tried so hard despite her vicious, ungrateful loser of a kid bla bla bla.  \n\nNotably, the mom never apologizes or makes any kind of amends for the damage she did and continues to do to her daughter, but apparently imagines her daughter as a sad, tacky, angry dump in attention-grabbing outfits, and the mom openly resents giving birth to her. \nThe scene where she comes at her daughter with a box-cutter razor, also punches her daughter in the face, and the daughter lies and tells her dad she fell on the sofa was the end for me.  I kept watching, hoping this was the run-up to some drastic turnaround and self-realization at the end... but no.  \nBoth the mom character and the writers seem to have no clue as to why abuse victims leave their abusers. Being male writers, they understood why the abused *husband* filed for divorce papers, but couldn't quite grasp why the abused daughter would also deserve to leave. The rock scene was a great example of how much they failed to 'get it'. Could have been poignant if it weren't for the fact the mom couldn't do basic, fundamental things to make her daughter feel safe, like supporting her against her abusive grandfather, supporting her choice to date another woman, or at least at the bare minimum, stop calling her fat and destroying her self-esteem.  But we're supposed to believe the mom would jump off a cliff to follow her daughter LOL.  The sappy ending where the daughter shrugs off all of this lifetime of abuse and parental rejection as 'just me being dramatic... awkward' was pathetic and the upsetting downer of the whole film.  Never saw the abused dad figure saying, 'gee, let's call off the divorce and be a happy family again, this divorce stuff was just me being too dramatic'.  No. This if anything underlined the worst part of the film, the stereotypical expectation that women, especially, girls, are supposed to accept abuse and forgive their abusers and 'let it go'.\n\nPositives: I liked seeing diverse Asian representation in film. Good special effects. \n\nWould I recommend it: NO.  This movie tried to appear 'deep' but was ultimately shallow and stupid, repeating harmful and degrading stereotypes. Visuals are creative but even those veer into the grotesque too often, like the naked man jumping on a butt plug. The normalization of family abuse and animal abuse was absolutely the most grotesque and unforgivable things about this film and I am sorry I spent $5 renting it.  Instead of watching this drivel, I'd suggest Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  At least in ESotSM the characters do spend some time reflecting on how their behavior has negatively affected others and why others would choose to leave them.",

The visual effects are great - I liked the cartoon strip feel to some effects in particular (I won't elaborate so as not to provide potential spoilers). \n\nI found it difficult to follow all the plot details but I certainly wouldn't say that affected my enjoyment of the film overall. Watching the fast paced fight scenes reminded me a little of kung fu or samurai films of the 1970s. At times Chinese songs are played in the background and it was nice to see the various family members speaking in their (I assume) mother tongue. As over the top as it undoubtedly is for the most part, there is a point in which things slow down significantly - that is somewhat poignant. I should perhaps note that a fair amount of the dialogue is in either Mandarin or Cantonese, hence subtitles are often present, which may or may not put you off it. Its a very engrossing and yet also somewhat baffling film, with a quirky, arty feel to it to an extent but enough mainstream CGI to entertain the audience well, I reckon. It's definitely a film to re-watch, as I was left thinking 'what did I just see?' by the end.\n\nNeedless to say, I would definitely recommend this film, yes.",

As my mama would've said, this movie FLOORED ME. Another reviewer stated quite aptly I think that it's a philosophical argument between existential despair & Buddhist acceptance.\n\nThis movie is STILL making me laugh...I just looked the main character's husband's name up to make sure I remembered it correctly before typing it - I thought I remembered it being Raymond the whole time, and it's \"Waymond.\" I think that's the point - hahahaha - pet rock - after you watch it, you'll get that:) This movie takes itself so VERY seriously, and then turns around and makes fun of itself and life. And it does it again and again and again, much to the delight of the unassuming viewer. About the pet rocks y'all, I thought I was gonna pee myself I was laughing so hard at that plane of existence. I guess they weren't technically pet rocks, but that is exactly how I saw them:) I was born in 1968, and some of you may not believe this, but we had pet rocks back in the 70s. Again, hahahahaha!!!! Humans - we crack me up.\n\nI bawled like a baby when \"Waymond\" stopped one of the battles, begging everyone to just be kind. I think that scene captures so beautifully and sadly how we're all so stressed, tired and scared of living in the times we're living in. We are falling apart and have become quite combative from the stress, lack of sleep, lack of human connection, and any number of other traumas. There is more than one way to be a warrior...\n\nOMG!!! when the mom/daughter story becomes clear, it reveals the catalyst for the whole movie IMO. She's reaching out for her mom across every plane of existence to try to be heard, which I think hits on the despair and angst of our youth - that broke my heart to pieces. For me, this movie really reinforces that we need to let our kids know we love them no matter what, even when they are acting evil and trying to drag us into their bagel hole;) It also points out how hard it is to not parent like your parents parented.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis as a milk-guzzling IRS agent with her damn wig and tight-ass sweater was fucking hilarious. The alternate plane her and Michelle Yeoh inhabit was nothing less than bizarre. Mmmm, hot dogs with mustard. This movie is an assault on the senses in the most enjoyable way you can imagine. Like a roller coaster ride! Thank you for making this movie:) It truly is one of a kind, and I hope it wins LOTS of awards. Joy to the World - hahahaha. Really though.",

Do you need more edits? Faster action? More kablooey and kablam? Well, to paraphrase SNL's Stefan, \"America's hottest movie, Everything Everywhere All At Once has everything! Talking  Rocks! Hot dog fingers! Backwards whooshing office chairs! A Sharpie wielding Halloween star!\" Who knew, however, that it would live up to that hype and more, easily becoming one of the best films of 2022? \n\nThe Daniels, Dan Kwan and Daniel Schienert, who last brought us the delightfully fantastical Swiss Army Man, return with an explosive (although with no farts this time) yet beautifully character-driven film which is literally about, as the title implies, EVERYTHING. Michelle Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a downtrodden laundromat owner who lives a financially desperate, hard-working life with her husband Waymond (the triumphant return of Ke Huy Kwan best known for his roles in Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom and Goonies), daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) and Grandpa Gong Gong (James Hong). \n\nWhen we meet Evelyn, she's exhausted from her work load, strained in her marriage, and dreading an upcoming meeting with the IRS. Enter Jamie Lee Curtis, in an unforgettable performance, as Deirdre Beaubeirdra, a joyless tax auditor who has never met a part of her body she hasn't scratched. She has it out for the Wangs, issuing an ultimatum to get their receipts together or face the consequences. With all of the pressure reaching a boiling point and seemingly no way out, a surprise twist throws Evelyn and her family into one insane adventure after another, fracturing timelines, universes, and offering up a \"Sliding Doors on Acid\" premise guaranteed to make the most kinetic of directors green with envy. It gets very complicated with its kitchen sink approach, with some interludes feeling random or interchangeable, but I found it worth the ticket price alone for the image of Curtis flying in slow motion through the air to face off against Yeoh in just one of many heartstopping moments. Special mention must go to Larkin Seiple for his phenomenal cinematography, Shirley Kurata for ten films worth of insightful, memorable costume design, and Jason Kisvarday's production design, which features an impressive, memorable array of styles. \n\nThrough it all, Yeoh navigates the impossible, playing a huge swath of characters, explosively executing complicated action sequences, and making us feel something deeply for our central heroine. She's giving the performance of her career here, able to capture our hearts while concurrently displaying the entire gamut of brittle neuroses in her wheelhouse. She plays so many different characters, some seemingly autobiographical, all of whom have a level of confidence and empowerment lacking in Evelyn herself. \n\nWhen Waymond steps in to motivate her, the movie really takes off with a series of brilliantly executed action sequences. Kwan, whose voice seems to have not aged a day, keeps up with Yeoh, delivering a heartfelt, fun, fast and furious performance all while doing flips and kicks guaranteed to earn him Instant Hunk status. It's so wonderful to have him back after years of giving up on acting. Here's to many more films to come. \n\nAlso of note is Hsu, who starts off as the detached daughter who her family for not fully supporting her queerness. She, like the rest of her relatives, finds her own special superpowers, elevating her to icon status before the film ends. Who wouldn't want this badass to kick down a few doors for them? I was also very touched by the mother-daughter relationship depicted here. It succinctly gives so many young queer people the tools and language for having tough conversations with their parents. Kudos to this slam bang film for having educational purpose too, filled as it is with nuance and grace far beyond what one expects from a genre film.",

But as it is so overhyped and overrated, I kind of start to hate it.\n\nBut to not waste a lot more time on this nonsense, I will just point out the main reasons why the movie failed for me.\n\n1.) The movie failed to establish an emotional connection between the viewer and what is happening on the screen i. E. in the movie. One of the reasons for that being: the movie was driven by nonsense. Whenever the main characters are stuck in a situation, the have to perform some nonensical bullcrap, so that they can crazy-deus-ex-machina their way out of the situation. Again and again and again and again and again.\n\n2.) The other reason for the failed emotional connection is that there were no sympathetic characters given to connect with. Everyone is just a self-absorbed a-hole or douchebag. What they are fighting for is a chaotic piled up mess (because they are unable to fix anything and to improve, so they prefer having a meanignless mess to having nothing).\n\nSo, my main problem was: I just didn't care for anything happening in the movie.\n\nIf you think that it is a profound philosophical question to ask how your life would be if you would have sausages for fingers (just to give you an example), this may be a movie you. But if you think that such a question is just stupid and stopped being funny since you turned 8 years old, maybe you should avoid spending timeor money on this movie.\n\nBut there are some few reddeming qualities of this movie, hence I did give it 3/10.\n\nWhich are:\n\n- The cinematography isn't bad.\n- It doesn't look like a trash movie production-value-wise.\n- Some of the acting wasn't too bad, if you can look past the garbage mess the actors had to work with.\n- It has some funny moments, if you can take the nonsense and the stupidity.\n- But again, at the end of the day, I didn't care for the pile of nonsense that the movie is.",

Michelle Yeoh, who in the last few years is finally getting the recognition she deserves, plays a downtrodden laundromat owner who is introduced to the secrets of the multiverse. The film has a similar problem to Inception and Tenet, in that the story is so complicated that lengthy scenes of exposition are required, and even those can make it feel more difficult to comprehend. But as the story progress you do develop something of a handle on things, and when you grasp the core concepts the film really comes into its own. I loved the way it handled themes of nihilism, family acceptance and the importance of understanding a person despite their differences, and while the middle section of the film can feel long and directionless at times, as it enters the 3rd act the film delivers some serious emotional gut punches, and everything that we've seen falls into place. The actors do a great job, the script is funny, insightful and cleverly constructed, and the lessons we learn come about completely organically. It's a film that many will find hard to digest, but if the cinematic medium is going to continue to evolve, we need films that are going to push boundaries and break new ground, and that's what this one does. If you can embrace its wackiness and accept its unconventionality, then you're in for a real treat.",

That being said, I am an author of numerous books and have written screenplays and appeared in a movie myself for what that is worth. Now to the film... I found the plot extremely confusing to follow and that is being generous. I enjoy a good SF movie but this one made so little sense that I quickly found myself struggling to understand what I was seeing. The acting was okay but whoever edited the film created something that for me at least, was incredibly uninteresting. The character development was nearly non-existent. I found myself not caring a bit what happened to anyone in the film because everyone was frankly lacking in any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  It reminded me of a similarly distasteful film called MOTHER with Jenifer Lawrence. It is astonishing to me why talented, well-known actors would agree to appear in such a bad film. But even more astonishing is what great ratings the critics are giving it.  Makes me feel like a stranger in a strange land. No, I would NOT recommend anyone waste their time watching this film. What little message it contains regarding mother-daughter relationship struggles is entirely lost in all the chaos and stunningly schizophrenic behaviors of all the characters.",

            "content": "The film title for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is its best possible plot summary.  The film is chaotic, disorienting, innovative, thought-provoking, undisciplined and profoundly moving.  It's impossible to summarize briefly.  But \"Everything \u2026\" is also the best reason to venture out to a movie theater since the pandemic began over two years ago.\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert \u2013 the Daniels - who co-wrote and co-directed this film, are veterans of several movie shorts and music videos.  Their previous feature film, 2016's \"Swiss Army Man,\" is summarized by IMDb as follows:  \"A hopeless man stranded on a desert island befriends a dead body, and together they go on a surreal journey to get home.\"  In \"Everything \u2026\" they graduate from mundane topics like human mortality to tackle the multiverse.\n\nThe idea of the multiverse posits that there are an infinite number of universes \u2013 \"alternate universes\" or \"parallel universes\" \u2013 where the consequences of all the choices we make or don't make are played out to their logical conclusions.  It's an idea that has been endorsed by Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson.  But philosophically, it's a pretty depressing brand of nihilism: how can life have meaning if none of our choices really matter?\n\nThe Daniels use the multiverse for two purposes.  First, when characters jump from one alternate universe to another, the moviegoer can explore the alternate life stories of the primary characters, particularly Evelyn (a spectacular Michelle Yeoh - 2000's \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\") who is an unhappily married, dissatisfied co-owner of a laundromat whose main achievement has been disappointing her father.  But in alternate universes where she has made different choices, Evelyn is, variously, a famous singer, a star of martial arts films, a sign-twirler on the street, a resident of a universe where everyone has hotdogs instead of fingers and, most poignantly, one of two sentient rocks on an uninhabitable planet (the most touching scenes in the film).  Evelyn bounces from one universe to another to help her struggling daughter Joy (yes, I do see the irony) who, as many parents would predict, is both a confused young adult and also Jobu Tupaki, an arch-villain bent on destroying the multiverse.  In one scene, Joy/Jobu confides that she has used her superpowers to place all the important things in the world in a bagel (you got it:  an \"everything bagel\").\n\nThe Daniels also use alternate universes to explore core concepts around family dynamics: the paralytic effect of parental disapproval; the notion that a family member's quiet inaction sometimes represents kindness and strength, not passivity; and finally the strong suggestion that parental love is the most powerful force in the universe.\n  \nAt the end of the day, this weirdly wonderful film shares a powerful theme with the Bible, the Torah, the Koran and almost any good Kurt Vonnegut novel: in a confusing, scary, sometimes brutal universe, we'd all be better off if we all treated one another with a little more kindness.",

The mother/daughter relationship (and really the whole movie) was riddled with \"hysterical woman\" moments, ending with 30 minutes of cliche Pixar movie lessons that never seemed to end. This was very clearly written by two men with little to no understanding of the feminine experience. Lest we forget the addition of absurd frat boy humor that adds nothing of value to the movie.",

It is visually amazing, the costumes are inventive and incredible, the editing is like I've never seen the acting is unmatched in any movie and the screenplay is profound.  How you can end up bawling your eyes out about two rocks on a cliff with subtitles is beyond me, and yet - there it is. You can't help but love and care about every character.  It is a mother daughter movie, it's about conflicts between generations - espcially in the Asian community, it is a love story and not just between husband and wife but between more complicated relationships.  It is about what if.  It is about the road not taken.  And it takes on multigeneraltional trauma and changing the narrative (a word I never say, but it is the right word).",

However, remove those stylistic choices and there's not really much story or even setting here, and what is on offer is unfocused and shallow. A lot of spagetti was thrown at the wall to see what sticks; some see a brilliant pattern in the mess, others will just see the mess.

The plot was tackled beautifully, almost better form than an NFL player.

The intro with the writer/directors is fun and the wrap up at the end helps to make it more understandable of what they were trying to do here and the points they wanted to make.

Oh, and it definitely throws some punches!\n\n- Kung-Fu Hustle - For those who want more silly Kung-Fu fun. That coincidentally also has a lovely story and can appeal to a wide audience.

Starting slow to help you learn the roles of the characters. \n\nAs I am not an Asian living in the US, I still found this film to be engaging and allow audience members to share the experiences of each character through the medium of the multiverse segments. \n\nAlso includes scenes that relate to the dynamics of every family's peaks and troths: love, becoming misunderstood/estranged, and the battle to uphold their roles in the relationships that are shared between them. \n\nAnd then. 'Everything...' moulds itself into the fun and ridiculous. I was captivated and felt connected to the multiple story arcs that are presented to us. Always returning to its 'That is just silly' method.\n\nThis film will make you laugh and cry. I was utterly captivated. \n\nAlthough, it does have A LOT to say.

One can argue that the great Guardians of the Galaxy has a similar subplot.

Guardians of the Galaxy is clearly fantasy whereas the characters in this movie are meant to be relatable and, to a unhealthy person, a bit too real.\nMass shootings anyone?  It's got plenty along with vulgar sex toy murders and blood and \u2026why waste time telling you more?  \"Nothing matters\" as is repeatedly proclaimed in self-destructive justification.  That it excretes a happy ending simply confirms the sad delusion of those who envisioned the story.  There are a lot of special effects \u2013 intentional sensory overload - that do a good job confusing the sane viewer of what the heck is going on.

The digitally aware self meets the self reminiscent, combine that with the duality of the chaos and order of life, and you have a brilliant film.  Humor intertwines this epic tale of life; equal parts tormentor, and angelic savior, the main character bouts with not only their internal narrative, but also that which seems to order and disorder the universe.  Intermixed with this narrative is a parents look at their own dreams through the life of their daughter, who becomes their own duality.  Projecting the dreams of one onto the decisions of another.  Once again chaos intervenes.  This repeats itself until the creator relents, the protagonists find peace, and two rocks find moments to simply be in the existence.  This would be a fine place to be, if not for the chaos of life drawing one to be more than just a rock, but to be both active and aware, not only presently but infinitely.  And that is the conundrum of what it means to be human.  To be Everything, Everywhere, All At Once.  Aware of who you are now, what it took to bring you to today, all of the possibilities that could have made up to tomorrow, and you here we are now, experiencing it, all at once.  This movie could define a generation and yet define everyone.  Like Citizen Kane, or The Matrix, Everything, Everywhere, All at Once provides a glimpse at what it means to exist with more knowledge than ever, of what our existence could have been, meanwhile in our actual existence, we are in ever more demand, if only we were present to feel and absorb what that should mean to, both the ying and the yang.  The order and the chaos, the joy and the pain.  The duality of mans existence.  Rarely does a movie summarize such valuable truths, and ever rare is it that said truths are displayed in a captivating and visually entertaining narrative.  I fear only that we won't really understand what it means, but then again, why should anyone be so silly as to assume they do.",

Michelle Yeoh, who in the last few years is finally getting the recognition she deserves, plays a downtrodden laundromat owner who is introduced to the secrets of the multiverse. The film has a similar problem to Inception and Tenet, in that the story is so complicated that lengthy scenes of exposition are required, and even those can make it feel more difficult to comprehend. But as the story progress you do develop something of a handle on things, and when you grasp the core concepts the film really comes into its own. I loved the way it handled themes of nihilism, family acceptance and the importance of understanding a person despite their differences, and while the middle section of the film can feel long and directionless at times, as it enters the 3rd act the film delivers some serious emotional gut punches, and everything that we've seen falls into place. The actors do a great job, the script is funny, insightful and cleverly constructed, and the lessons we learn come about completely organically. It's a film that many will find hard to digest, but if the cinematic medium is going to continue to evolve, we need films that are going to push boundaries and break new ground, and that's what this one does. If you can embrace its wackiness and accept its unconventionality, then you're in for a real treat.",

This is one of those movies that you can't easily summarize, some would say it's irreducibly complex. Honestly, I was a bit tired during the watching so I still don't really get all the metaphors --e.g., everything bagel ect. \n\nThe transition from mundane life to verse jumping, psychedelic trips to across timelines left me a bit unnerved and overwhelmed but in a good way, kinda. The movie was packed with action, comparable to a Marvel movie --hmm, makes me wonder which brothers helped to produce it. \n\nThe scene that stood out to me the most was the existential bit when Waymond explains how his way of exercising human freedom and choice in the midst of the abyss of 'everything' is to express kindness. This had me feeling all sentimental and soft, lol. \n\nOverall, great movie and excellent acting! :)",

Michelle Yeoh plays the entire gamut of emotions in addition to various personalities and skill trees. The plot is a bizarre hybrid of sci-fi, fantasy, martial arts, but is used as a vehicle to tell an incredibly human tale of family and identity. The humor is intelligent (even when crude) and is never just as a gag. The funny \"bits\" often play a part in the plot in that moment or in the future. I loved it.

            "content": "Everything Everywhere All At Once\nIn just about every sense, this movie delivered what the title promised. It's so easy to get sucked into with all there is to appreciate about it. Michelle Yeoh leads the cast in her portrayal of Evelyn Quan and her multiverse counterparts. The version of her we focus on is a middle-aged mother who immigrated to the United States from China with her husband, Waymond Wang. They own a laundromat, raise a daughter, struggle to pay bills and spend their days daydreaming of all the things that could have been, while trying to find some level of joy in each other. Evelyn has revelations about herself and her motherhood, largely to her daughter Joy, played by Stephanie Hsu - a now-adult who is very different but also, in so many ways, an image of her. Hsu does a good job at playing all the different versions of herself, with emotional vulnerability, depth, and emotional range. The character felt very raw, real, and there was lot to explore about her.\nThe editing did a brilliant job in illustrating an incredibly believable multi-dimensional world all colliding into these characters' love for each other extending across space and time. As the aspect ratio shifts, the tone switches; in 16:9, it breaks itself from the world and switches into a more comic-book feel. The characters are almost in a cartoon and this makes this medium and theme an engaging way to tell the story. Not a whole lot of CGI editing was used in this movie but they still did a really good job at accomplishing a fantastical world and all its different possibilities and timelines. The repetition of the front desk marks the beginning of each chapter while representing a story that goes backwards and forwards in time and space, yet is experienced by one character sequentially. The emotional depth makes everyone watching feel seen in their raw humanity.",

Even as multiverse movies have become more familiar over the past four years, this one stands apart from all the others in that we see parallel universes at the same time. The way this is handled is incredible and makes for some interesting story elements and some amazing visuals. Being able to see Evelyn conscious of herself in two universes simultaneously was clever, trippy, and as the move goes on, very chaotic. At time there's numerous characters doing this at the same time and it's just bonkers. In the end the story is quite simple and has a good message, but the journey is such a fun time!\n\nThe creativity in some of these scenes is often so insane that it's just hilarious. The actions required to transport from one universe to another, to gain a particular skill or ability, can be painful to watch and sometimes so absurd that it will, without a doubt, spark laughter. I love the story it tells, the emotions it kindled, and was such a fun theater experience. If I had to complain about anything it would be the runtime as it felt long at times even though it was never boring.

Unfortunately I was not one of those people.\nDon't get me wrong, Michelle Yeoh is fantastic in this role it really lets you see her talent in a new way, but the story is not only preposterous, even for a sci-fi lover like myself, the movie so desperately wants to be meaningful but in my opinion fails miserably. \nI am obviously Lonewolf here given the ratings for this film and acclaim from so many people not just Asians, but as a 'deep thinker' and spiritual person in pursuit of constant improvement and personal development, to me the message in this film is just laughable, it said nothing and it was not inspiring at all. In my opinion it also makes Asian children raised in America seem lost, useless and foolish.\nMaybe I am just too jaded and find many films and series that try to be meaningful and incorporate spiritual elements fail miserably, Raised By Wolves included. I think it's just a symptom of a lack of true spiritual awareness in the world and it's too frustrating to me.\nBut don't listen to me you'll probably love this film like everyone else.",

They essentially take all these ideas and mash them together with a little bit of kung fu and cheap potty humor. (I mean wow, the jokes were soo bad in this movie I felt embarrassed) Predictable plot line (main story line if you can call it that) and unleavable (and mostly silly/stupid) action.\n\nMichelle also doesn't deliver in this, the action is great (but completely unbelievable) , but her acting and delivery of her lines is lacking of emotion and believability, I still don't think she is a very good actress.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie but it was lacking in most respects, the entire movie was full of moments i've already seen in so many other movies and shows that it felt repeated and boring. I don't understand why so many people are giving this such high reviews. (I was also constantly taken out of the movie with over the top action scenes or failed attempts at humour)\n\nI'm adding this after the fact, there are many moments in the show that actually have no grounding in reality. Yes I know it's science fiction, but it was based in our reality, with our physics and laws. How can a women who has never worked out, thrown a punch, done a pushup suddenly able to jump off walls and throw people around. Sure she has the knowledge and skill, but not the muscle mass or body. There is one moment she throws a POLICE SHEILD like its captain Americas shield, hits multiple people and then proceeds to catch it. Completely took me out of the moment, and there are a lot of these moments. I know I'm supposed to suspend my believes for movies but this just takes it too far. They try to be the matrix but fail hard. You cant just suddenly know how to weightlift and do it. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.\n\nThis movie has so many borrowed ideas and stolen moments from other shows and movies its embarrassing, this is only the directors second actual movie and really shows how they should have stuck to music videos. Yes people will argue there are no new stories, well this movie goes to prove that.\n\nThe sad part is so many people enjoy this goes to show how out of touch people are and how starved they are for something different even if its a heaping pile of garbage.",

Dumb shock value crap that did nothing to further the little story it had. the characters had no real depth and came off stereotypical to me. I would of turned it off but my bf wanted to finish watching it. He fell asleep, I was not so lucky. It did not get better, this movie was pointless, stupid and it completely lacked anything original or interesting or inspiring. I think the movie tried really hard to pull together some kind of inspiring message at the end which was, wait for it;\u2026. \"Be kind to people\" a very kid poster on a wall in a kindergarten classroom kindof message. I liked the sentiment but That was the best they could come up with and the film doesn't even deliver that message very well, it never really comes together. Nothing ground breaking here, It was not unique or inspiring in anyway\u2026 just a pile of junk. If your not really high or an 8 to 15 year old boy, I would say skip this movie and go watch something else. I really wanted to like this movie but I honestly can't find anything good to say about it. I guess I thought the actors did a good job with what they were given which wasn't much (really not a whole lot of dialog in this film).  But even the fight scenes, which I normally like in movies, were just ruined because of this films attempt at humor. Not only was it not funny, it took away from the action too. All of this is just my opinion and if you liked the film thats cool. Everybody doesn't have to like the same things. Peace \u270c\ufe0f.",

Michelle Yeoh in the leading role gave the best performance of the year so far along with Ke Huy Quan. It is a shame that this one will most likely get lost in the shuffle next award season because it is going to be hard for anything to top this. This reason that this film works so well, is that it resonates with people in such away that they see themselves on the screen. The main characters are going through the same personal struggles that so many others have, and when you can connect with characters in this way it makes the film 10 times better and 10 times more impactful.

I watch a film just about every week or two weeks depending on what is on. \n\nTo be honest with you I have absolutely no idea how this film got such a great review. Clearly I was watching another film because I was so bored. Then again I don't agree with a,lot of reviews out there. The trailer is a good indicator of what to expect most of the time. Reviews are a bit hit and miss because everyone has their own personal taste. \n\nI think the world changed after covid in a very big way. More than people think. Marvel films are really bad right now but still getting rave reviews and I don't understand why. It's like people just don't recognise a good film anymore, this film is no exception. \n\nIn my opinion avoid this film. There is absolutely nothing that makes it worth watching.

Like, if you looked at only the tax paperwork universe plot, it's weird. The IRS agent gets *punched*, but then just forgives her.",

The story told here and the themes presented moved me to my core. It was executed masterfully, and I was deeply affected by it. The film is a perfect allegory for what it's like to live with depression. It also defies genre classification; it's comedy, action, sci-fi, romance, drama, thriller, tragedy -- all rolled into one. There are some bold and over the top choices made in this movie that won't land with everyone, but they sure as hell landed with me. Metaphors and allegories galore, everything said and done seems to have multiple meanings. Re-watchability is very high. This film is poetry in motion, a feast for the eyes and soul. I left the theater feeling like I would have paid twice as much for what I'd just experienced. Highly recommend watching, and going in with as little knowledge as possible. 10/10",

            "content": "While the movie might take a lot of time and go through a lot of complex and confusing scenes, they all add up to a wholesome ending that's sure to make anyone appreciate the movie. In my opinion the best thing this movie does is find a way to explore the dynamic of family relations, and it's portrayal is more than realistic, the directors are grounded in this regard, from the precarious and   love- hate relationship Evelyn and Joy have, to the problem filled marriage between Waymond and Evelyn, surprisingly enough it even shows the anxiety Joy has in navigating loving a girl and coming out to her grandfather; that is one of the best things about this movie. The next thing I think it explores really well is the idea of free choice, (not to be pretentious but) it does make the Kierkegaardian point that anxiety is the dizziness of choice, by showing the protagonist, Evelyn, explore all the choices she ever made in her life, and how by making different choices her life led to completely different paths most of them being more successful than the life path she currently was in, and how this affects her psychologically. We then get to see the difference between her reaction to that and her daughters' reaction to finding this out, landing her daughter to arrive at the classic cosmic nihilist point \"That nothing in the world matters,\" while this has been explored in so many classic movies and Tv Series so may times, the feel of this movie is different because for some time the characters do agree with this, until the climax of the movie happens and takes a turn in the direction of Existential Nihilism, and tries to save all the characters. This movie, at first almost seemed like Rick and Morty (which I am a fan of) but unlike it the family dynamic is more realistic, I digress. While the philosophical idea of the movie and ideas brought up are handled well, the next thing I would like to address is the sheer cinematic and directing style of the movie, the choreography, acting and emotions expressed are truly magnificent and aid towards the story telling. This is an instant classic movie in my opinion, it's not too heavy and not too light, honestly my best movie of the year. I have to admit this movie would be hard to make, it introduces so many ideas in so little time, even the way it divides the parts into three is brilliant, did I say it was a good movie again.",

This one brought me back again and again in a matter of a week. \n\nThere is a challenge with this movie though, and that is to get through the first half of the movie without falling for it thinking some kind of a usual superhero discovering her true power and defeating a mysterious villain. It is strange that a movie truly starts after a full 90 minutes, and shows its splendor and creativity in a jam-packed 45 minutes peak that keeps on going afterwards. In the first one and a half hours though, there are parts where the pace drags, and the fight scenes repeat and distract from the movie's setup. But once you get to the 90 minute mark (Yes, it's almost specific) it becomes impossible to not enjoy every minute from there on and smile at the cleverness, creativity, emotional exploration, and not to mention fantastic visual cues.\n\nIt does of course help that both Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu were killing it.

A little hint for who's going to watch: don't even think to compare \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" with \"Swiss Army Man\". There are two totally different proposals, and I confess I took a while to fully embark on the story here, while the 2016 film hooked me in the first two minutes. The beginning is a little messy and the multiverse plot is kind of sneaked into the narrative, but when the film finally consolidates its tone, it never falls, on the contrary. The universe conception here is one of the best I've ever seen, the creativity level here borders on the unbelievable (I think it can rival only \"Millenium Actress\" and \"Spirited Away\"). The concept of multiverse here is the same used in the MCU, but while at Marvel the concept is still theoretical, here we can see it in practice. There are at least six parallel stories that never run over each other and are extremely well developed (if this movie doesn't win Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards there's no justice in the world). I have a lot to say about the cast but this is a movie that doesn't allow spoilers. It's normal to feel that the third act is a little dragged, I felt it too, but as in \"Uncut Gems\", it's an understandable decision, because the rhythm is in line with what the character is feeling and the situation she is going through. I would say something about the ending but even the minor comparison can be a spoiler. In a nutshell, watch this film as soon as you can!",

I would've recommended for high schoolers if not for the sex stuff thrown in. (Some audience members found those funny, but others just found it gross.)

I would've wrapped things up with more on the cutting room floor, no matter how well done those extra, \"oh, here we go again\" scenes were.\n    It sure is a different movie!

This simple, but powerful theme though is presented in one of the most creative, imaginative, visually stunning ways I've ever seen on the big screen.

If you empathize with this/you have a brain and are watching the news and have parents, this movie will likely poke at some of your deepest insecurities (in the best way). It may point out crushing, immense fears but will quickly double-down, reassuring you that you are not alone (I've never sympathized to intensely with a rock). It is an immensely pertinent commentary on our most impactful interpersonal relationships, wrangling in comedy with compassion. Loved this movie with a first watch and it became one of my all-time favorites with a second watch. Finally, I need to say... It's hilarious. Literally laugh out loud funny.

Beneath its dazzling surface, this movie teases out deep questions about modern life.\n\nUntil recently, all of human history was a struggle for survival. Today, our lives are so comfortable that we are faced with a completely different kind of problem: too many choices.\n\nIs our multitude of choices a blessing, or a curse?\n\nLife in a hunter-gatherer society was nasty, brutish, and short. Our path in life was mostly predetermined: just try to survive and reproduce. But the few good moments could be fully savored and enjoyed, because that's all there was.\n\nWe evolved to survive as hunter-gatherers, so we are maladapted for modern society. With all of our survival needs met, our biggest challenge is to wrestle with our own vestigial cognitive biases. \n\nWith so many life paths available to us, our cognitive bias focuses on the drawbacks of the choices we make, while conversely focusing on the benefits of the choices we didn't make.\n\nShould I have chosen the other University? Did I choose the right course of study? Is this really my most self-actualizing career path? Should I have married the other person I dated? Do I want to have children, and if so how many?\n\nThe presence of these choices is an indicator of a pretty good life.\n\nBut if we get stuck doting on choices not taken, it's harder to appreciate the positive aspects of the life we chose. In this way, having many choices is a burden, because when the path we chose turns out to be imperfect, we blame ourselves for not having chosen differently.\n\nIn reality\u2013in every possible reality, there are always imperfections. If we can learn to accept that every choice, even the best choice, has drawbacks, then we can free ourselves to more deeply appreciate the benefits of the path we find ourselves on presently.\n\nGo see this movie while it's still in theaters!",

            "content": "It's hard to give an objective opinion on this movie other than that this masterpiece will be remembered as one of the most exciting, unique, endearing, philosophical and influential movies of 2022, if not all time, giving each and every one of us on this tiny blue dot in the ever-expanding universe something we didn't know we needed, everything everywhere all at once.\n\nYou will laugh. You will cry. You will cry and laugh at the same time. You will smile. You will frown and smile at the same time. You will smile, frown, laugh and then cry and more. You will experience it all. You will go through trough everything everywhere all at once.\n\nHere's how this movie talked to me, personally.\n\nThe movie couldn't have come out at a better time. The last few years have been tough for all of us. It feels as though we've been served all the bad everything everywhere all at once. Not a single stone has been left unturned. After the last few years of a long, wild and scary rollercoaster of worldwide struggles, this movie comes out to remind us that nothing matters, but not in the extreme nihilistic way you'd probably expect.\n\nIt teaches us that there's beauty in nihilism to be found. We just need to make an effort to search for it. It reminds us that our little struggles or big world problems don't matter. \n\nThey say that your life flashes before your eyes upon your death, reminding you of everything everywhere all at once - your life, the joys of life and the struggles of life, things you may have long forgotten, decisions you made, both good and bad, and past experiences, both positive and negative. Some may experience regret but most certainly hope to experience happiness and feel a sense of fulfilment at the end of their journey, as they get closure to the light at the end of the tunnel (bagel). \n\nIf this is all true, then, to me, this magical movie is the embodiment of that experience, with a little twist. It pulls us out of the void of the bagel. It pulls us away from the light at the end of the tunnel back into our bodies, creating a much stronger sense of self and giving us a second chance at our life. It teaches us that at the end of the day, it's the people closest to us, our family and friends, and our relationships with them are the only thing that matters. It gives us a second chance and an opportunity to experience and flash through our lives, everything everywhere all at once, and go back and make peace with ourselves, who we are, and amend relationships with the people that matter the most, our family and friends, and start truly and genuinely appreciate what we have so that when the time comes, there's no space for regret, but joy! There is not a single negative thing about this movie and this whole experience, not even one thing to nitpick.\n\nNow, I think that some people may take points away for the length of the movie, but for me personally, length is rarely an issue, especially if the people behind the movie have evidently this much genuine passion, love and respect for the arts of movie making and have put this much blood, sweat and effort into it. And especially if the people and the movie are as bold, unique, resourceful and creative, willing to compromise and explore interesting ideas and serve them to us. Extremely talented, resourceful and creative artists, visionaries and risk-takers such as \"The\" Daniels and their crew of world-class actors such as \"The\" Michelle Yeoh, \"The\" Stephanie Hsu, \"The\" Ke Huy Quan and \"The\" Jamie Lee Curtis and \"The\" wonderful stunt people, SFX and practical effects crew must be celebrated. (\"not to their recent interview\")\n\nI wish, no, I beg everyone to go and support this movie so that Hollywood starts making more movies like this one. Hence, I wouldn't dare to take away anything from them. Definitely not because they try to entertain me for 10 more minutes with an actual,  well-thought-out and complicated piece of art that was challenging to make. And most definitely not in a world where random 15-60 second videos are overtaking the world of entertainment and the world's attention.\n\nI've never written a review, not to mention a review of this size, but I absolutely loved the movie, feeling compelled to support the movie as much as possible, including writing this review, buying the movie and seeing it in the cinema. I was in awe with it, was blown away by everyone and everything in the movie and will most certainly forever remember it!",

I saw the multiverse sideshow as reflective of her own regrets at the choices not taken, how she wished to impose her desires on those of her family, and how little she actually knew about theirs.\n\nThe extended metaphor goes on much too long, with a few totally unnecessary sidetracks. For example, a good ten minutes is devoted to the man with a raccoon on his head. All of this could have been left out, and the film still would have kept its narrative arc and made its points. The Daniels had a lot of fun riffing on kung-fu movies, film noir, and a raft of science fiction from the past (Matrix, anyone?)

If those scenes lasted maximum 15 seconds each and only one time - then yeah - but the recurring silliness just makes it so exhausting to watch. Cringe scenes and way to long pauses between some conversations just makes the movie 40 minutes longer than it ought to be. I can honestly say that i watch ALOT and have a broad view and taste - but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  :(",

            "content": "Multiverse of madness without Marvel\n\nGetting a ten from me and being one of my favorite films had every chance and the first work of the Daniels - an eccentric and young duo of directors with a crazy and original style. But Swiss Knife Man didn't make it to the end and only got a nine from me, which doesn't stop me from considering it an extremely original and funny film that I can recommend to many. However, after 6 years, the Daniels were able to beat me to perfection.\n\nThe very title of their new film fully describes the essence - it really is everything, everywhere and at once. A riot of fantasy, absurd humor and sci-fi at the level of the best Rick and Morty series is beyond description - this is what you need to see. Doctor Strange will have to sweat a lot to surpass the local concept of the multiverse and especially madness.\n\nThis film has all the ingredients to keep me satisfied: a surreal farcical comedy, also a great drama about the generation gap and the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe value of the family, the most difficult script that Nolan would envy, its excellent execution, strong acting (Jamie Lee was especially pleased Curtis, who is not immediately recognizable here) and a wonderful message, even some kind of philosophy of its own. It's a movie that combines hilarious jokes, selective action, and at the same time raises questions about the meaning of life, the universe, and all that.\n\nAmazing. I am delighted. I think the multiverse is the future of sci-fi in cinema, and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is a pioneer in that. And the Daniels, I'm sure, will still show the world a lot of goodness. Very inspired by them. I'm looking forward to their next works (it's a pity that they come out so rarely) and I advise everyone to go to \"Everything, everywhere and at once\". Of course, the oversaturation of this film and the intensity of the absurd may seem excessive to someone (in my session, for example, people just left the hall and I heard that this happens often), but such a movie should be given a chance. This is truly something special and amazing.",

I am not saying Dr Strange is a masterpiece but while watching Everything, Everywhere, All at once you will start to feel it comparatively is. Such a boring movie, lacking a good story. There may be a bare bones good plot here but it is lost under the poor narrative choices and the decision to be arty and bizarre at the sacrifice of a compelling, interesting, and coherent movie. I will take a more traditional styled film over one that tries to scew conventions at the detriment of producing a decent end product. Self indulgent pretentiousness at its worse.",

            "content": "This film is astounding.\n\nDaniels have managed to give the concept of the multiverse (a trope already starting to overextend itself) new life and new purpose on film, which is no small feat. Wrapped up in this insanely frenetic and propulsive film is a story that centers on family, catharsis, love, kindness, violence, nihilism, acceptance, friendship, hope, loss, and\u2026 buttplugs.\n\nReading that last sentence, you might get the wrong impression that this movie feels somewhat unfocused or too widespread to connect all of those dots. But like the movie's multiverse, they all stem from one single point in the narrative, and that focus aids in creating a story that flits easily between each emotional beat Daniels have lined up for the audience.\n\nThe main character of Evelyn Wang is the central focus of the story, and Michelle Yeoh is the absolute perfect actor to play her. This is undoubtedly her best work in years, not only showcasing her still incredible prowess as an on-screen fighter, but the depth of her ability to bring characters to life\u2014sometimes with laser-focused nuance, sometimes with wild hilarity, and sometimes with unabashed heart. She breathes the air of this film and it's story so easily.\n\nAnd the rest of the cast\u2014Stephanie Hsu as Joy, Ke Huy Quan as Waymond, James Hong as Gong, and Jaimie Lee Curtis as Dierdre\u2014are so perfectly cast it's impossible to watch this film and not be bowled over by the sheer talent they have. Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu are particularly effecting in their roles as Evelyn's husband and daughter, respectively, and they have moments in the third act so full of genuine honesty and emotion that it brought me to tears.\n\nAlso notable is the unbelievably good stunt choreography, the special effects, and the editing. The fight scenes are married with brilliant practical effects and CGI (done by just FIVE people!) and together, they call back to the best of Hong Kong and American action cinema\u2014from Jackie Chan's entire career of frantic-seeming choreography, to Yeoh's own masterful display in \u2018Crouching Tiger', to Keanu Reeves in \u2018The Matrix', and many, many others. It's a love letter to movement and action, and it feels so good to watch unfold. All of this is held together with some of the best editing I've ever seen in a film. With pacing that ratchets back and forth between methodical to otherworldly, Paul Rogers' has done a perfect job marrying each of the emotional story beats and action set pieces into a cohesive and eminently watchable work of art.\n\nLastly, the film looks amazing. It's lush and beautiful, with shifting colors and textures mixed into a kaleidoscopic experience. Larkin Seiple deserves every accolade for making multiple universes feel grounded and somehow real.\n\nI loved this movie. It has a way of worming into you with its weirdness and its everything, everywhereness and, once it does, what it has to say tends to hit very hard and very fast. I found myself crying at scenes featuring the oddest things: Rocks with googly-eyes. Hot-dog fingers. Black hole bagels. But it makes sense somehow, and that weirdness only proves that the central themes of the film are so strong and so true to life that nothing Daniels throw at you detracts from them; together, it all builds to a stronger, more effecting climatic finish that left me so glad to have experienced it.\n\nGo see this film, and go see it in as full a theater as you can. Half the delight is watching something beautiful with other people who see the same thing, all at once.",

It went from full-on action to genuine horror to intensely emotional to utterly ridiculous in minutes, and I love every second of it. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Ke Huy Quan all gave such beautiful, heartwarming, and epically insane performances I laughed, cried, and laughed again. The central theme of the movie is what seriously surprised me. I never thought a silly multiverse movie would tackle such a heavy topic so effectively. Who knew a scene where two characters were rocks could make me emotional but it did! Never in a hundred years did I think I would enjoy this movie as much as I did.

This film is based on a typical first-generation Chinese immigrant family, living in a cramped apartment, running a laundry room that is almost broken, trying to merge into American society but always keeping their cultural background. Marital problems, generational problems, cultural differences, and tax troubles literally make their life worse. The director used an absurd narrative skill, especially multiple universals, to tell a touching and reasonable story. I strongly resonate with this story since we share the same cultural background. As a Chinese girl, also a single daughter in my family, I totally understand the parent-child conflict presented in the film. Our thoughts, feelings, and opinions don't make sense to our parents in some ways as the rapid changing and development both in China and America, but they are always there no matter what and support us for no reason. They always try their best to give us the best. \"It doesn't make sense but I am there.\"\nI was also touched by another thing that the director wanna deliver, \"What if\". What if Wang didn't abandon all they had in Hong Kong and come to the US from the very beginning. Maybe she won't need to accept that her daughter is dating another girl and deal with the shit like tax report. \nIllusion is always perfect since it isn't real. \nWhat if I stay in China? IDK......\nI am so happy to see there are more high-quality Asian cast movies in Hollywood. We are no longer invisible or forced to present our culture under the white gaze in movies.",

I also thought that the reaction to this movie in my immediate social circle was weirdly over the top positive in a way that made me itch, and I wondered if this movie was kind of a flash in the pan that no one would want to think about in two years. Possibly, but what I came back to is the sense in which the movie is about roads not taken and how to be emotionally present your life despite resentments, regrets, and deflation.

It was an hour of \"being artsy just to be artsy\", with very little storytelling. The last twenty minutes was the only worthwhile part of the film honestly. This could have been really good but it was just desperate to be eccentric and SUPER repetitive and redundant. I'm not sure how many times we need to be told the same story to understand the depth of the trauma between the main characters but apparently it's like 100 times in 100 different realities. The actual conflict of the story is a pretty simple one and yes it is relatable but the hours of theatrics was not necessary to get the point across.",

The always fantastic Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan are the Wangs who run a family laundromat being audited by Jamie Lee Curtis's IRS agent. Throw in Stephanie Hsu's lesbian daughter and James Hong's traditional Gong Gong and what we have is a well-observed Asian-American intergenerational family drama dressed up with science-fiction bells and whistles and what's technically classified as fairly lo-fi special effects, though they're no less effective for it. With the rules of the multiverse and increasingly ridiculous instructions for jumping between them subversively dispensed with in the duration of an elevator ride, their screenplay manages to just about contain itself within its own logic and make it makes sense, and with that exposition out of the way, the rest is a fast-paced kinetic joyride (with an exhausted editor afterwards) through alternate universes where a brilliant and gamed cast are given ample opportunities to play distinctively different characters while the Daniels lobe everything from cinematic riffs on Ratatouille, 2001, and naturally HK cinema as represented by the extremities that are Jackie Chan action comedy and Wong Kai Wai's melancholic romanticism to random surrealism like hotdog fingers and subtitled rocks onto the screen. If admittedly it drags a little towards the end as it piles on very conventional and sentimental cliches to concoct its crowd-pleasing love-is-the-answer ending, it remains bizarrely entertaining, visually arresting and narratively chaotic and bonkers all at once, and I can't wait to see it again.",
