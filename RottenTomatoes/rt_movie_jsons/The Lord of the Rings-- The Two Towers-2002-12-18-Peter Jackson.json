The battle of Helm's Deep is also an epic conclusion to the middle chapter that can't be forgotten. 9/10",

The cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority. The visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema, whilst the action set-pieces continue to dazzle. The finale Battle for Helm's Deep is jaw-dropping in its delivery. At three hours the film still manages to grip the viewer throughout and skillfully sets up its audience for the final segment.",

Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come.",

The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!",

Newcomers like Miranda Otto (lovely), horror icon Brad Dourif, Karl Urban and Bernard Hill (wonderful) make solid impressions. But Andy Serkis is downright mesmerizing as the motion-capture creation Gollum. He completely sells us on this CGI character as flesh-and-blood, with depth and maybe even a soul. The evil our heroes faces grows, but so does their determination. And the thrilling finale is enough to make one say \"I can't wait until 'The Return of the King'!\"",

            "content": "My personal favourite of the trilogy\nI do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.\n\nWhen it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.\n\nThe acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.\n\nIn conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10",

The soundtrack was composed by Howard Shore. The film was realised in 2002. The main actors are Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen.\n\n\"The Two Towers\" follows the continuing quest of Frodo and the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring. Frodo and Sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn, the Elf archer Legolas, and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose once great King Theoden has fallen under Saruman's deadly spell.\n\"The Two Towers\" received 75 nominations, 65 wins with 6 Academy Awards.\n\nThe acting is realistic and outstanding. The screenplay is very enigmatic and entertaining. I find the soundtrack beautiful and gripping. The atmosphere is epic and manipulative. \n\nFor me, this film is a truly great piece of filmmaking. Also, I give this film a 5 !",

And also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow, change, and become more likeable. It's a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together. Some movies succeed at that and some fail. But Peter Jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more. There is more action in this one and I loved that. The battle for helms deep wasn't just a minute and I liked that because it's a big thing that happened. And I was intrigued through and through. Gollum I think was properly introduced in this movie. The adventure advanced really well compared to the others. The other movies have great adventure but I like this one a little more. If I had to critique one thing, I think they spent a little to much time with Rohan. Some of it was engaging but after a while I think they should've moved on. In the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while I felt like they should've moved on. The acting was great and I think if you loved the first you'll love this one.",

There are obvious new characters and locations, there is much more CGI and the battle scenes get much bigger. The battle of Helm's Deep is just truly epic and well choreographed.\n\nI must say, Gollum is exceptional. He was a HUGE technical achievement in 2002. His character is meant to be a villain, yet he is very sympathetic. And yes, \"My precious!\" is one of the best lines of this century. The Two Towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy. It ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost. This will make their victory in the final movie much stronger. Frodo and Sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally, Gollum.\n\nHonestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing. Even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s. It really shows what a great trilogy this is. Everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel.",

The flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and Frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers.

        },
        {
            "content": "The Lord of the Rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. I have already written a review for The Fellowship of the Ring, in which I talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. That is why I won't talk about those things in this review. Rather I will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation.\n\nPercy Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White.\n\nThe thing I really like aobut Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself.\n\nSpeaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you.\n\nAnd that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo.\n\nThe movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which I was thinking would be answered in Return of the King. It has something to do with Saruman. So don't make that mistake. I'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch.\n\nThe Two Towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really wish it was talked about more. Only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's bad. That just means this trilogy should be watched more. Since The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the adventures and The Return of the King is the conclusion, The Two Towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. But in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. It is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.",

The Uruk-Hai are menacing in this movie along with Saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of Fellowship.

The worst offenders are the additional scenes of Merry & Pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. In this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film.\n\nThere are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which I feel should have been included in the theatrical version. For example, we get a much better explanation of Aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of The Return of the King.\n\nOverall, I feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. It may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better. I think I'll continue watching the extended cut though, purely because it has more content.",

The biggest problems inherent are in regards to pacing, and establishing the new characters in a way that works as well as in Fellowship (which had considerably more to introduce but somehow did a far better job).  The Extended Cut of The Two Towers still doesn't do as good as Fellowship (or Return, for that matter) in terms of its character dynamics or its extension of world-building, but it is a vast improvement and certainly does an overall good job with both of these.  Simply put, this is one of those movies (like Troy & Chronicles of Riddick) where the Extended Cut's additions are so good at adding much-needed context that, despite their increased run-times, actually feel like much shorter films than their shorter versions.  Like the other two, the Cinematography, Music, Production Design, Sound Design, Acting and Action-Sequences are all top-notch, still effective to this day, and serious props to everyone for managing to successfully make a 45-Minute Action Sequence that managed to keep the stakes high.  It's needed viewing to experience the whole story, and while it's the weakest of the three, it's still usually Very Good quality, only sometimes dipping into \"Good Not Great\" territory from time to time.",

The biggest issue is the pacing of the movie. It drags on in the middle for quite a lot and being the middle chapter, it lacks the setting up of the first movie or the pay off of the third movie and we don't get as many locations and we spend a bit too much time with the Rohan subplot but it's still an emotional, suspenseful, satisfying and exciting second chapter with great characters and moments.",

What this movie is most famous for - the battle at Helm's Deep - earns its reputation and is the pinnacle of high fantasy action to date.",

The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.\n\nThere are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.\n\nElijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding.\n\nOverall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. One very much worthy of following 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', despite a few 'issues' I have with it.",

            "content": "The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is honestly a brilliant sequel and it's even a masterpiece and a half. The movie's got a brilliant story, which follows on straight after the first movie and it's about Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) arriving to Mordor with the help of Gollum (Andy Serkis).\n\nA number of new allies join their companions team to defend the well known Isengard, while Saruman (Christopher Lee) deploys an assault from his territory.\n\nThe cast are all honestly brilliant with their performances throughout this movie and the same goes with their dialogue. All of the characters dialogue which is given throughout this movie is all honestly great and non of their dialogue feels weak at all.\n\nThe cinematography which was shot by Andrew Lesnie, who did the first one's cinematography does another brilliant job at capturing the scenes so smooth and so beautifully. He does it so well and he makes the scenes look so amazing.\n\nAlso, there's a lot more of the action sequences throughout this movie and they are very clever, very graphic and very unique just like the first ones were and they are all very well choreographed.\n\nThe movie's even got such a beautiful soundtrack, the score which was beautifully composed by Howard Leslie Shore OC. He does such a great job with the soundtrack and it goes so well with the scenes they've been placed within this movie.\n\nThe movie's even got some brilliant humour, which always hits and it never misses. That's mainly from Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) his character adds some really funny humour throughout this movie, which adds to his character quite a bit.\n\nThe movie's even got more dark themes (In my opinion), they add a lot more to the different locations which we end up discovering throughout this movie and it's done so well, which I really liked.\n\nFinally, the love interest in this movie is very well built up and it doesn't feel rushed at all, it's a very interesting one and I think it works quite a bit.\n\nThe pacing which this movie's got is all honestly brilliant and all of the moments are all built up very well and non of those scenes fail in any sort of way because they are all built up brilliantly.\n\nThe orcs throughout this movie have got more of a darker and more of a graphic look to them, which I think added a bit more of a disturbing look to them, which I really liked.\n\nOverall, Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is honestly a brilliant sequel. The movie's got a brilliant story, brilliant performances, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, clever action sequences, brilliant pacing, a beautiful soundtrack, brilliant humour, dark themes, more disturbing looking orcs and an interesting love interest.\n\nI'd honestly recommend this movie, if you enjoyed the first one and if you're into fantasy/action movie's. I think this movie is honestly worth the watch and you'll probably enjoy it as much as the first one.",

The special effects are really well done for a 2002 movie, and the score is absolutely flawless. My favorite part of this film is the anticipation that builds for the battle at Helm's Deep; it really feels like the whole story is leading to that scene. My only complaints are that things feel a little rushed (and as a disclaimer, I watched the theatrical version, not the extended edition). Character motivations are often lacking, so a lot choices don't always make sense and character's seem to do this just for the sake of advancing the plot. Similarly, the character development all felt a bit rushed, especially compared to the wonderfully rich development found in the novel version. But overall, these are minor criticisms. This movie is still incredible.",

            "content": "I absolutely loved this film and I love Lord of the Rings so much. I love that they put Gollum on the front row and some of my all-time favorite scenes are the scenes with Gollum. I love that this takes place right after fellowship it really feels more like a journey. I can't get enough of the amazing score its just so good. Some say this is the most perfect trilogy and I see why it is literally perfect. I love the makeup and prosthetics it is so good and the orcs look disgusting because of that and I love every single second of it I'm glad they didn't use motion capture suits for the orcs as the Hobbit did. These films are an achievement in storytelling in keeping a whole journey and feeling like your really there and connected with them over three years. I can't get enough of the absolutely amazing worldbuilding it is literally amazing and nothing else can top it at all. Peter Jackson really did something amazing with this film that I don't think can be done again and if anyone else would have made this it would be so different and it would probably be worse. I'm so excited to see Andy Serkis as Alfred in The Batman he is such a good actor and needs an oscar nomination by now. I'm glad that they only do one thing that really is CGI throughout the entire movie and that is Gollum which I love and I love the practical effects and not the CGI and green screen. This film has so many iconic things like the lines and everything about it is iconic from the characters to the score its all amazing. They try to humanize which Gollum which I didn't think they would have but I love that they showed him in human form and Andy Serkis did an amazing job outside the motion capture suit which gets me more excited for The Batman. This film has some of my all-time favorite lines as does the whole trilogy. Smeagol is one of my all-time favorite film characters and he is so iconic. There are so many amazing grand-scale shots that show off the grand-scale of New Zealand and they all look beautiful mixed with the film they shot on makes it look amazing and adding the score to that makes it some of the best shots of all time. I love the buildup for the battle of helms deep and it is one of my all-time favorite battles. This film again has one of the biggest cliffhangers of all time and I wish one of the companies would come out with the 9 hour and 30-minute version of it I would watch that so much.\n\nLike the last one they don't use sfx only but one time and that is for Gollum which the sfx really holds up for all of the sfx now with endgame and lion king. I really cannot get enough of the amazing score I could listen to it for hours and not get bored it that's how much I love it. Like before the sound mixing and editing are on point with the battle at the end sounding amazing and the elephant looking things too. I love the locations they used it this getting more into Mordor and the color grading making it look like more of Mordor it looks fabulous. The cinematography looks amazing. The script like the last film is amazing and it baffles me that one trilogy can earn 30 nominations/wins it just is outstanding that a film trilogy can do that and if you don't think this trilogy is perfect look at the Oscar love that this got. Like the previous film they develop their characters out so well I just love it and when characters have those heart to heart moments I just love those scenes and those are some of my favorites. The acting is on point and everyone is giving it their all especially Elijah Wood if just like the previous film if there was anything snubbed it was Elijah Wood's acting he actually is a really good actor and I wish he got more major roles after Lord of the Rings but he didn't he could have been a major Hollywood star. The editing mixed with the suspenseful score creates these tense full scenes that I just love. The action scenes really hold up after all these years. Overall I absolutely loved this film and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

When Gandalf or Sam or Merry or Faramir speaks they're speaking using Tolkien's words through time and talking directly to us. Undoubtedly the success of this and the other Rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game. However, it's enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that The Two Towers had, and still has, a reason to exist in the world. It speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding, forgiveness and love.\n\n\nThere's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of CGI and characterisation of Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. It gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to Return of the King. His arc from Gollum to Sm\u00e9agol and to Gollum again is sad, important and due to Andy Serkis also hilarious. It does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. The battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one. \n\nThe extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. Boromir and Faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of Th\u00e9oden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent.",

        {
            "content": "I was even more befuddled by this film than I was by it's predecessor. So, so many characters exist in this film and yet none of them are particularly interesting and the obstacles they face are poorly made up monsters with silly names like Nazguls and Uruks. Unlike the first film very little time is given to character development here and I felt as though I was watching a montage more than an actual story. If I were into the books I probably would geek out when they eat elfish bread but because I'm not I found the most interesting parts of the film to be those that involved Eowyn and Arwen who each only appear on screen for a few minutes. I have really enjoyed films with all male characters in the past, 12 Angry Men (1957), Secret Honor (1984), but there they are interesting, flawed men who don't speak in riddle. I needed something to latch onto and if it was Aragorn awkwardly swallowing Eowyn's terrible cooking so be it.\n\nGollum, Andy Serkis, finally appears and he attempts to steal the One Ring from Frodo and Sam before he decides to guide them to Mordor after they manage to tie him up. Merry, Dominic Monaghan, and Pippin, Billy Boyd, are captured by an anthropomorphic tree and are the comic relief throughout the film until they get tied up in a battle. Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen, and other men with long white hair end up in Rohan when Karl Urban's dad has become controlled by Saruman, they free him and we prove that Aragorn is perfect because every woman loves him. In the end we find out that Gollum is betraying the two friends, Frodo, Elijah Wood, and Sam, Sean Astin, and is going to try to get the ring back, duh?\n\nThe visual effects are incredible again and we get to see more of the beautiful New Zealand landscape and scenery, good for our tourism industry. I appreciated how great the tree-man looked and the Nazgul, I think that's what they are called, were equally scary. Clearly Peter Jackson is a great director when it comes to capturing landscapes and creating a beautiful fantasy world but he failed to make me engaged with a story that I was not already invested in without reading the books. Had he taken a cue from Victor Fleming and made the film more accessible I would have been more interested but no, this is for the fanboys only.\n\nAnother criticism I have is the awful screenplay, the fact that four different people including Jackson and his wife worked on it didn't make it better. Every line seems to be exposition as we get characters who already know one another explaining to each other who they are and what their backstory is. It was so unnatural and left me so uninvolved in their stories or their plights as characters that it ruined the film. The plot just sort of ambles along as we get an awkward blend of bad slapstick comedy from Merry and Pippin and deathly serious scenes of Aragorn giving speeches about the evil of the One Ring. Maybe this is just the way that all fantasy films are written and I understand that they significantly simplified the plot from the book this film is based on but still I expect the film to seem coherent.\n\nThe only fun parts of the film to me occurred when Miranda Otto was on screen as she was such a luminous, female presence amongst all of the seriousness and masculinity. Her character is underwritten and she falls for Aragorn immediately, because of course, however Otto makes the film worth watching for just a few minutes. Tyler does less with her character but the base instinct in me enjoyed seeing two attractive people kissing, something I wouldn't be so into in a better film.\n\nI gave the first film a pass but I really don't think it's worth continuing with this trilogy, even though I will because I hate myself apparently. This was a mess of a film that wastes it's best elements and caused a person who was really trying to get into the film to completely turn against it.",

Tolkien's novel, screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair and Peter Jackson. All of them are the same from the first one, except for Stephen Sinclair. Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin.\n\nThe story continues with Frodo and Sam trying to destroy the ring, during the journey they met Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, drawing closer to his kingly destiny, rallies forces of good for the battles that must come.\n\nIf you read my first review of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so you already know that I loved how they set the characters and how they made the special effects, etc... And you also know that I didn't like the performance, and the direction sometimes wasn't good for me. So I watched this one and I was hoping to see these flaws got fixed. So, did they fix it? Not that much to be noticed, but as a middle chapter of a trilogy setting all paces for the final one, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is completely amazing, also for the fans of the book and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has lots of amazing special effects just like the first one, I was still amazed of how talented and unique the creators of this movie were, I mean some movies were released in the same year but the special effects weren't that good, not even close.\n\nThe performances on the other hand are the same, the only one that was brilliant is Andy Serkis as Gollum, all the others are the very same, and I didn't like them before, so it's the same problem, but Andy Serkis improved it.\n\nI liked the direction a little tiny pit more than the first one.\n\nSo technically, as it's obvious, I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers more than The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, especially the story, which was fast-paced and better than the first one. So as it's improved, it's definitely getting a higher grade, so I'm gonna give The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers an A!\n\nI really had lots of fun, while talking with you about The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and I'm so excited to talk to you about The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and it's gonna be very soon.\n\nAlright, guys thank you for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, please, support my work to encourage me to carry one.",

Intanto parto col dire che \u00e8 la Trilogia fantastica per eccellenza, ormai divenuta cult, perfetta sotto quasi ogni aspetto. Ogni cosa \u00e8 resa al meglio e non ci sono difetti dal punto di vista tecnico; regia di Peter Jackson perfetta, fotografia bellissima e effetti speciali da paura. Le scenografie, le ambientazioni, il trucco e i costumi sono eccellenti. Le musiche e il montaggio delle musiche azzeccatissimi. Dal punto di vista narrativo nulla da dire anche perch\u00e9 non ho letto i libri, purtroppo. Il personaggio che pi\u00f9 mi \u00e8 piaciuto \u00e8 stato Samvise, interpretato da Sean Astin che \u00e8 stato semplicemente magnifico; senza di lui Frodo non avrebbe fatto tutto quello che ha fatto, il vero Eroe della trilogia, soprattutto nell'ultimo film (\"Il Ritorno del Re\"). Spettacolari anche Ian McKellen (Gandalf), che ha regalato diverse perle divenute cult, e Andy Serkis che ha interpretato Gollum, personaggio bello e brutto allo stesso tempo. Di grandissima potenza i dialoghi di Gollum che ha due personalit\u00e0, Smeagol (il suo nome originale) e appunto Gollum. Ottimi anche gli altri personaggi.

When comparing it to its predecessor, only barely is its predecessor better. The first film is the coming together of all the characters and how the story became to be, but it's still hard to say because The Two Towers still offers great and emotional storytelling along with incredible performances from it's whole cast. I would say just barely because it's really hard to say that the first is better by any more than an extremely tiny amount. The visual effects are again outstanding and Peter Jackson does another great job with directing and co-writing the screenplay with three other people. He does the film so well just like the first one and he's able to get everything that's needed to make the film as food as it is and satisfy audiences again. We get to see more epic fight scenes that will keep you wondering if the good guys will win or loose which is definitely something that adds to the greatness of the film. Overall, it's definitely another movie that audiences can enjoy that will keep them eager for the final chapter!",

First, there's Frodo and Sam, joined by Gollum, who are traveling to Mordor to destroy the Ring. I enjoyed the dynamic among Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. In its predecessor, we only see a glimpse of what the Ring can do, but here, we witness the effects of the Ring through Frodo and becomes a means of character development. Second, Merry and Pippin regain their freedom after being in the hands of Saruman's army. Third, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to rescue Merry and Pippin. On their quest, Aragorn's group learns from the Rohirrim that Saruman has influenced their king Theoden. Along the way, they meet a resurrected Gandalf, and together, they set out to break Theoden free of Saruman's influence. The group encounters many obstacles, with one nearly killing Aragorn. The reoccurring theme of resurrection is fascinating, but I am not convinced by the way Aragorn was brought back. I am still confused about what happened with what seems to be a dream sequence. Moving forward, the battle with Saruman's army begins, and this may be one of the best battle scenes ever shot in movie history. It is also clever that the villain is only uttered by name but still largely impacts the story. The overall film progresses fast enough to include many details and aspects to their story. However, it can become overwhelming. Their dialogue is very poetic, and the imagery is very detailed. Again, the franchise leaves the audience with a lot of hope despite the obstacles they have yet to face. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers lives up to its predecessor in many ways and brings forth twice as much energy with captivating visuals and an action-packed story. Just when you think the franchise cannot get any better, it just does. \n\n---\nfollow https://www.instagram.com/movietvstance/",

When we're introduced to Gandalf the White, Christopher Lee's voice and image are superimposed over Ian McKellen's. Rather than delay the big reveal and add suspense, it came off as patronizing. Same with the music. Dramatic/suspenseful notes are played when we are uncertain of what's lurking, only to be a fake-out when something harmless is revealed. This is cheap and manipulative. In Jaws we only hear \"da-duh da-duh da-duh\" when the shark is actually approaching, but not when there's a false alarm.

I don't want to spend pages about the differences between Lord of the Rings movies and book, but I'm here actually to celebrate this motion picture: we left Frodo and Samvise sailing from the mountains just after the Mines of Moria to Mordor, and we left Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas looking for Meriadoc and Peregrin, who had been kidnapped by Uruk-Hai. So this movie follows separately this three different plots. The two Hobbits meet Smeagol/Gollum (I'll call \"him\" Gollum) who helps them finding the way to Mordor. But Gollum is not a valid ally: in fact, he's kind of crazy because of Frodo's One Ring, he wants it, he cannot live without it; after that, he is a really good orator who convinces Frodo to forsake Sam (Sam does not abandon his master anyway). In the meanwhile, we see the Man, the Dwarf and the Elf looking for the other two Hobbits. They reach the Land of the Horse Masters, called Rohan. There, there is a corrupted king, (not politically but spiritually speaking) whose name is Th\u00e9oden. He is being controlled by Gr\u00ecma, one of Saruman's slaves. But with the help of Gandalf (he didn't die, the group finds out) Gr\u00ecma is defeated. In the meanwhile (it's always a meanwhile story), Peregrin and Meriadoc found Treebeard in the Fangorn wood. What kind of creature is he? He's an Ent, i.e. a huge anthropomorphic tree who claims to be the oldest creature in Middle Earth. At the end, Frodo and Sam succeed in arriving to Mordor, but now they have to front the Dark Lord Sauron. What can I say about this movie? Nothing that I've already said. This is obviously a masterpiece and the question is: how did Peter Jackson pass from \"Splatters\" to this pieces of art? I honestly don't know, so I just suggest you to throw yourselves in your couch and enjoy this technical art.",

            "content": "The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful. This film left me breathless. I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely. I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.\n\nLet's start with Gollum. Gollum gave an astonishing performance. The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring. The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor. For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.\n\nOn the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening. There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli, and Legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times. Aragorn's performance is outstanding. He has proven that he can be put on an A-List of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance.\n\nGandalf \"the White\" in this film was a twist. We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard. Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking \"leaf\" as explained in the novel. There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard. No fireworks, or pipes. Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.\n\nVery dark are the times for Frodo, and Samwise. Gollum seams to give Frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well. It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo, and our hero is slipping. But the surprise was aimed at Samwise. Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend. Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment. This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair.\n\nMerry and Pippin's story is very odd initially. The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others. The Ents were very well done CGI wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience. They are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor. Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them.\n\nThis movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could. I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent. This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away. There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10",

All is done in service of deepening the mythology and narrative of the series, but it isn't necessarily much fun. It proves nearly a drag, albeit a gorgeous and epic one, in the over an hour climactic battle that has no reason being as long as it is. While the conclusion is powerful and beckons the audience to join them for the final outing, The Two Towers is long and ponderous but so well-filmed and engaging for fans of the series, it is hard to fault it completely.

We follow the fellowship that has now broken off into 3 distinct groups, Frodo and Sam head towards Mordor, Merry and Pippin have been taken by the Uruk Hai and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have set off on foot to rescue their hobbit friends. We're also introduced to quite a few new characters, the most interesting of which are Theoden, played by Bernard Hill and Gollum/Sm\u00e9agol, played by Andy Serkis. Gollum is one of the most astounding achievements of this film, the mixture of motion capture, cgi and Andy Serkis' performance creates a character that is so engaging, pitiful and complicated that he steals every scene that he's in and shows the audience what could happen to Frodo if his mission fails. The Two Towers also ratchets up the fight scenes from the previous film with the attack on Isengard and the battle for Helm's Deep, the latter or which has an excellent balance of tension, humour, action and real heart to it as our heroes are heavily outnumbered by the enemy. Just as good as the The Fellowship of the Ring, if not better, Peter Jackson continues to push the boundaries of filmmaking in scale and excellence.",

The preeminent science fiction film made it's debut on December 18th, 2002 and continued to be a close contender with Minority Report, along with Men in Black. The ensemble reunites once more with Viggo Mortensen; Orlando Bloom; John Rhys-davies; MckeMcKellen; Elijah Wood; Sean Astin; mordorBilly Boyd; and Dominic Monaghan who are left in the fate of Frodo Baggins vigilance throuMordor.\nTwo Towers Progresses the already established narrative of Frodo and Sam venturing on their perilous expedition to Mt.Doom to destroy and forsaken the Ring. Along with their journey, their are two other expeditions that are explored; fangornAragorn, Gimli, and Legolas scouring through the forFangorn in search for the orcs who have captured Pippin and Mary, as well as Mary and Pippin acquainting themselves with Treebeard; a fellow ent. For all that enchanting is not only seen throughout the main characters; but also visited within the supporting characters. Gollum, the race of the ents, and the kingdom of Rohan are testaments of Jackson's solicitude for Tolkien's masterful Folklore.\nWhere fellowship summons Emotional storytelling; Two Towers summons War, violence, and action to entice it's audience. Battling is a predominant aspect of science fiction, it's a facet where directors can really demonstrate their prowess through the staggering size and scopes of mise-en-scenes--which is the arrangement of everything that appears in the framing: actors, lighting, decor, props, scenery, and costumes. Jackson is no neophyte; furthermore, he makes no mistake of having incontestable fidelity for Tolkien's most paramount chapters. From Helm's deep to The Road to Isengard these are the sequences that undoubtedly pass the brink of being visually sensual.\nIn conclusion, Two Towers is an exemplary film with few rough edges from absent chapters; but this sequel still triumphs in a demonstration of Jackson's plenary indulgence within Tolkien's mythology.",

Overall this isn't really \"bad\" it's just something that should have come out after the ring story was told, like a sequel, not something that should have happened while we're in the middle of telling a story. I'm not thinking this rating will change, and unless Return of the King is worse this is my least favorite. (I've never seen Game of Thrones, but I feel like it's probably something like this. Royal is a description I'd use for this. I think that's one of the different feelings I couldn't describe from above.)",

Frodo and Sam were both much braver and even Merry and Pippin stopped being losers and that was quite refreshing to see. Treebeard was a great addition and I am surprised to know the voiceovers of both Gimli and Treebeard was done by the same actor.

Well over 3 and a half hours, the second film in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy definitely meanders more than the first film in the series, but there is still so much here to recommend, starting with the amazing CGI creation, Gollum.  Motion captured by Andy Serkis, Gollum is a pathetic, frightening, and desperate creature.  His desire for the one right completely consumed him, driving his personality to split into two.  The animation for his character still holds up pretty well these twelve years later.  When he is on screen, you just can't take your glance off of his large, expressive eyes.  \nAnother excellent CG character is Treebeard, a \"Treeherder\" who protects Merry and Pippin and eventually gets pulled into the fray himself.  He sings, tells stories, and questions the Hobbits in a slow voice that sounds like a record player slowed down.  \nThe slowest parts of the film involve Aragorn's relationship with Arwen, the elf from the last film.  She has to contemplate leaving him or facing a future where he eventually grows old and dies, but she never does.  These scenes add little to the narrative and are a bit boring.  \nThe film does take off for the last 40 minutes, when the Battle of Helm's Deep begins.  It is really rousing with a great sense of geography that a lot of large scale battle scenes like this don't have.  Score: 9",

Viggo Mortensen's character dies, but comes back to life. We are introduced to the king who is under an evil spell, but the spell is broken. Frodo and Samwise are captured, but then released. In between all of that, long battle sequences are shown that really don't seem to contribute much to the plot, and in reality, the only part of the plot I was actually interested in was the story of Frodo, Samwise and Gollum, but it only took about a quarter or less of the film's runtime. I would be much happier if the entire trilogy were shortened to one two-and-a-half-hour-long film, that didn't feature any of the Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom subplot. I mean seriously, other than the story of Gollum, the only thing that advances in the story of Frodo taking the ring to Mordor is that they were briefly captured, and that plot point really only merits 20 minutes, not a whole 3-hour-long film! In addition, the screenplay really isn't very good. The dialogue features extremely basic, single-clause sentences that are used only to explain the plot. Nothing is said that makes me think, \"Wow, that was a good line\" or made me think twice about any belief I ever had. The dialogue is not complex, and any attempts at humour went over my head. Credit to the amazing set design, visual effects, costume design and makeup teams, but this film was content-less. Put it next to any actual great film in history, and it should be clear other than to fantasy fanboys that these Lord of the Rings movies are empty and unimportant. Even the cinematography is a result of good CGI work and expensive camera equipment. Yes, Peter Jackson did a great job to create this world, and clearly the films pay tribute to the novels, which is why the films have such a huge fan-base, but for someone who isn't easily impressed with fantasy elements such as the many creatures, the complex names or the fictional locations, there is little to be gained by watching this film.",

So much so, that even the film's three hour run time doesn't drag on like you'd think it would. The final act of the film is so incredible that it has caused me to invent a new word, \"Climaxgasm\". A climaxgasm is when the climax of a movie is so great and awe-inspiring that it is akin to that of a mind-blowing orgasm. I'm talking about a toe curling, balls-emptying, rocket-blast-of-cum orgasm! It's also incredible how well the special effects have aged from a movie that's over 12 years old. The perfect rising-action to the eventual end of the story.

It looks like I need to take a note as from what I saw. It is the most epic fantasy film I've seen for a very long long time. The gothic art of a visually embodied film is just breathtaking to watch. Every single scene has it's own color. The gorgeous locations are stunning. Camera shooting of every angles is just brilliant. Why I wouldn't care about the pacing? Because it is that good, the execution is very well made that you don't mind what's going to happen. Your so into story and hungry for it's plot. The extended edition is a must watch for fans thus this serve as the whole cover up of the book. The musical score is outstanding and give me that chilling feeling especially the elvish scene. Andi Serki's portrayal of Smeagol is priceless. Elijah Wood, Viggo, John Rhys-Davies, Ian Mckellen and Orlando Bloom. These people right there give the most of their performance. To think this is a well budgeted film and became one of the most top grossing films of all time. An epic proportions that you would never forget. With the most unforgettable battle scenes that you have seen for your whole life. Perfect 5 stars!",

            "content": "Peter Jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished The Fellowship of the Ring. After having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did, he was almost setting himself up to fail; giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking: a sequel. Not just any sequel; a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius. This sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to. Almost.\u00a0\n\nTaking up where its predecessor left off, The Two Towers follows Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they chase down a troop of Uruk-Hai, Frodo and Sam as they journey further towards Mordor and Merry and Pippin as they, well, get into lots of trouble.\u00a0\n\nThe story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans. This is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker Peter Jackson: how to tell all these stories in under four hours? Not only that, but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1) making it boring and 2) losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material: Frodo and Sam's trek towards Mordor. After all, how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they don't actually reach by the time the films finishes?\u00a0\n\nIt's almost as if Jackson hasn't noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and story-driven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry. Yes, technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of Helm's Deep and no we don't get to see Merry and Pippin in Treebeard's house or talking to Quickbeam but in the end, Peter Jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease. This is a reflection on Jackson's instinct for pace, as the extended edition shows that these time-consuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed, but were left on the editting floor. Jackson's fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact; enough to appease any fan. Jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well, revelling in the joy of discovery when Merry and Pippin first encounter Treebeard and having time for jokes between the double-act which just keeps getting better of Legolas and Gimli. Jackson doesn't forget about his characters either, keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful Miranda Otto as never-to-be love interest Eowyn and the abandoned-by-his-country Eomer as well as extending his existing characters in Merry and Pippin who only get more endearing, Frodo and Sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain. And even though Gandalf's character goes under a major revamp he's still the same enigmatic mentor as before, albeit slightly more badass. It's this attention to detail which makes Peter Jackson's work so watchable, all the way through the crazy runtime.\u00a0\n\nShore's score is as strong as ever, this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore. Shore's understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here, even more so than Fellowship as the story isn't as driving as its predecessor. Because of this, Shore's score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film.\u00a0\n\nThe performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film. Not only that, but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more, in particular in the case of Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. The two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough. Ian McKellen's Gandalf is still the standout of the series but it's great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression. His presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original; more difficult to read. Elijah Wood has much less to do in this film, leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film. While this may be true to story, it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while. Sean Astin's Sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story, you sometimes wish that we'd move back to the interesting parts a little sooner. Bernard Hill makes a great addition to the cast as Theoden as well as his onscreen daughter Eowyn played with fragile strength by Miranda Otto. Brad Dourif's Grima Wormtongue is fantastic; a slimy, manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene he's in.\u00a0\n\nAnother of Towers' achievements lies in another of its new characters: Gollum. Gollum is a completely CG creation, performed by Andy Serkis with groundbreaking technology, enabling Serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real. This innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of Tolkien's work is brought to life onscreen. Serkis' performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but it's incredible to see. His work here set the benchmark for motion capture.\u00a0\n\nBut all these technical factors fade into the background at the Battle of Helm's Deep: a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it. Ten thousand Uruk-Hai facing off against Rohan's much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film. Jackson seamlessly blend CG with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like Legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from King to King. Jackson's sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic, moving from the Entmoot to Sam and Frodo without ever losing momentum. And the coup-de-grace of Gandalf's arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films.\u00a0\n\nWhile this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films, the fact that I'm still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series. The fact is that, despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first, it's still a better film than 90% of the blockbusters Hollywood vomits up on regular basis. Truly incredible filmmaking.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe Battle at Helm's Deep. Of course.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the middle chapter of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson, based off the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. After being impressed and swooped away by the beginning chapter, I had high expectations of this film; I had seen the film before but I have forgotten my feelings towards it, ergo I was practically coming into the film blind.\n\nThe film started off strong, continuing on the story that was left by the end of the first film; where Mary and Pippin have been taken by the raiding orcs, Frodo and Sam have divided from the fellowship and attempt to enter Mordor on their own, and the remaining of the fellowship have embarked on a quest to retrieve back the abducted hobbits. Fuelled by the hype left by the previous film, I was optimistic and content with the first 30-40 minutes of the film, continuing their intended journey, but then new story elements begin to appear; side-tracking these characters and piling up new and sudden threats. It was like a long distraction or bypass that would ultimately land on the same goal as intended.\n\nThe film also changes its pacing from the previous film, where now it is displayed in a cross-cutting method in narrating the three stories. It severely slowed down the film, with one story beginning to take flight, only to be diverted to another that is still lingering on the ground. Due to the film becoming more and more larger in scope, character development have become less and less present; the first film was such a terrific film because there was emotional connection with the characters, and supported with internal friction and threats that are layered with depth, elevating the film's overall story. Jackson dwells so much with the key members that reside in Rohan and Gondor, largely speaking about the threat of extinction for men and the greed for power. It wouldn't have been too much of a chore to go through if they were established better and were forced to show empathy for their cause.\n\nThankfully, the visual aspects of the film are still stronger than ever, blending practical and special effects to create Middle-Earth and its inhabitants. Supported with glorious battles that are large in scope, demonstrating the pure epicness of its story; the battle scene in Rohan during the last 40 minutes was fantastic, showcasing the characters' fighting abilities at their most peak; also displaying a sense of balance of seriousness and comedy between Legolas and Gimli, counting the orc bodies they have slain. That is what I think was purely missing during the bulk of this film, humour. It is understandable that this chapter is much darker, obviously pointed out by its grey and steely blues in its photographic imagery. This lack of humour does make a large impact on the film's pacing and it does make it more difficult to keep one's attention during the quieter moments of the film; which is plentiful in this film.\n\nThe score in this film is great, hearing the classic tunes crafted by Howard Shore, at times evoking a sense of chill and excitement within me. It elevates the film's tension and scope through the loud brass instruments and hard hitting strings; and during moments that are much tender and emotional, which is severely few here, the music hits with full effect, without feeling a drastic sense of shift between the two opposing tones.\n\nThe acting performance in this film is as great as it was found in the first film, showing full commitment to their roles, but never to the point where it becomes overwhelming and stripped of that sense of fun. They completely understand that they are playing make-believe and Jackson completely understands this when directs his cast.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has fallen short of my expectations, telling multiple stories that are paced together in such a way that it comes off as emotionally convoluted. I am sure everything Jackson had to do here plays an important role to the final instalment but as a standalone film, it isn't a glorious one. I hope the next film would capture the excitement and wonder that I had during the first film.",

The Two Towers is based off of the second Lord of the Rings novel which entails our main protagonists being separated and striving to complete their goals in saving Middle Earth while the dark forces begin to close in on them at all corners. Out of all of the films, this is by far one of my top 5 for various reasons. One of which being the plot of this story and that it brings everyone to a turning point in their lives to where they would have to make big changes for themselves in order to save the world that they live in. \n\nOnce again; everything from the special effects, to the score, and even the characters are dead-on perfect throughout this film. One of the best characters in here is Gollum who becomes absolutely obsessed with The One Ring and will do anything he can to get it back all the while arguing with his other personality. I also loved the CG work that Andy Serkis did to make him so lifelike that it would make you believe that Gollum is a real person. Aragon had the second best plot in the story where he has to do whatever he can to make sure the whole country of his people do not get annihilated by ten thousand Orcs that are barreling through the countryside. The battle at Helm's Deep was another great war scene in this movie as the humans and Orcs fight the hell out of each other and made it look very brutal especially for PG-13 standards which  almost felt like they were kind of pushing it, but in a good way. There are some moments in here that I felt where kind of pointless like Liv Tyler's appearance in here which felt really wasted. Overall, this movie is a nice little stepping stone which builds everything up to the finale of this trilogy which goes all out and that is why I give this four and a half out of five stars.",

The population of the home of the Horse Lords, Rohan such as the reluctant King Theoden (Bernard Hill), the slimy   Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) and the shieldmaiden Ewoyn (Miranda Ottoman) help to establish both the frail, yet hopeful role that humanity can have while also giving the audience the chance to fully explore a human culture in a world populated by fantastical creatures.\n\nAlthough the score is amazing and the setpieces such as the infamous Battle of Helms Deep are stunning to look at, the biggest achievement in terms of visual effects comes in the form of Gollum. Being the first character in a live-action film to filmed in the revolutionary preformance capture system, Andy Serkis's physical and emotional performance captures both the good and evil sides of the tormented creature, with the conversation sequence being one of the most intense psychological sequences put to film ever.\n\nOverall, despite the Treebeard scenes sometimes dragging the film down, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is still masterful filmmaking in terms of worldbuilding and character development and helped audiences get excited enough for the epic conclusion...",

The extended edition is a must watch for fans thus this serve as the whole cover up of the book. The musical score is outstanding and give me that chilling feeling especially the elvish scene. Andi Serki's portrayal of Smeagol is priceless. Elijah Wood, Viggo, John Rhys-Davies, Ian Mckellen and Orlando Bloom. These people right there give the most of their performance.

It keeps in suspense the whole time and keeps your attention like crazy. We also have the Ents going to avenge their fallen brother trees at the hand of Saruman. And not to forget about Frodo and company going through the marshes of dead people and Sam's never-ending suspicion of Gollum/Smeagol's plans of leading them to their doom and steal the ring. And i love how in Fellowship it ended on a bad note with the fellowship being separated and all hope being lost and Two Towers ending on a good note with being victorious at the Battle of Helm's Deep and the destruction of Isengard thanks to the Ents and basically, there was hope by the end of the movie.

            "content": "\"FRODO AND THE GUIDANCE OF GOLLUM\"  \n\n- Based on the second volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel trilogy is this 2002 epic fantasy adventure 'Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers' from director Peter Jackson (King Kong, Brain Dead). The story goes on where the first part had ended, as Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the Ring in the land of Mordor. Visually stunning and with great-scale epic battles, this film brings the work of Tolkien to life. And although the length is impressive, there isn't a dull moment in it. Starring Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Ian McKellen (X-men Trilogy), Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violece), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean) , John-Rhys Davies (Indiana Jones films), Christopher Lee (Star Wars Prequels) and Andy Serkins (King Kong) as Gollum. Beware of the Precious! \n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring has fallen. Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) has given his life in the battle against the Balrog and human Boromir was killed when the forces of darkness attacked.  While Strider Aragorn (Mortensen), Dwarf Gimli (Davies) and Elf Legolas (Bloom) are pursuing the Uruk-hai Orcs who have taken Merry and Pippin , Halflings Frodo Baggins (Wood) and his loyal friend Sam (Astin) continue their quest to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. On their journey they encounter the ring's former owner, the creature called Gollum (Serkins). After capturing him, the two persuade the schizophrenic Gollum to guide them to Mordor. \n\nIn the mean time, Wizard Saruman the White (Lee), who is in service of the Dark Lord Sauron, has send an army of Uruk-hai and Orcs to conquer the land of Rohan, where King Th\u00e9oden has been enchanted by an evil spell...",

Gollum is the ring obsessed creature, while Smeagol cares for \"Master\", the name he calls Frodo Baggins by. The story could be interpreted as a reflection on how the one ring managed to change Smeagol entirely from a normal breathing person to a deformed monster who only keeps on being preserved by the ring's powers.\n\nI highly recommend The Two Towers for anyone who loves great fantasy movies or epic movies.

When there are so many faces and people and races, it is hard to appreciate the human cost (and cost to other races) of the entire tragedy the ring has wrought. Fortunately, Jackson didn't forget to humanize the characters involved, up to the heroes driving the action and down to the petrified infants clumsily wielding swords  to survive the terrors of the night.

Far too often in the LOTR series I think the story builds up these great idea's or characters and them lets me down whenever something big is supposed to happen.\nFor example: The Ring Wraiths.  Great name...great design..great backstory and they do a good job of showing how afraid of them everyone was.\n\noh...let me put it out there that I never read the books and I think any discussion of the books is irrelevant since I'm watching a movie and that's what I'll judge it by. Back to the wraiths..\n\nI LOVED these guys and couldn't wait to seem them flex their muscle (or bone).  In the first movie, a big wave in the river washed them away.  In retrospect it wasn't even all that impressive.  I'll call that a flawed execution of the idea (water will get rid of them).  There was a scene where they came upon the hobbit in a derelict tower and I don't remember anything cool about (I need to rewatch these films I agree..it's just I've never been interested enough to spend that much time again).  ANd finally at the end of the film during the big battle scene it looks like we're going to get to see them do something really cool and what happens? He gets killed before he ever does anything cool. \n\nGandalf?  HAH!  I love the idea of the most powerful wizard and he certainly looks the part but aside from one scene where he was swinging his stick what giant magical things did he do?!  He made his staff into a giant flashlight.  That's it! I waited hours upon hours to see him make a big flahslight?!  Huge let down!   Yes the Balrog was cool and he has a great line in the scene but we don't get to really see what makes him so magical.  \n\nI've got more but I'm sure no one will read this.\n\nI want to add that I am shocked by how much I absolutely love the 2 new Hobbit movies (Hobbit and Desolation of Smaug).  Hell..I give those films 5 stars.  Love them and I can easily say that I think Desolation of Smaug is the best of all these films.",

Once again, the visuals aren't just a gimmick, they are used in a way the aids the story and adds to the experience. The story feels very much like a continuation of the last movie's story without feeling like a rehash. Frodo and Sam are still on their journey but their companions have split off and out going on their own quests, trying to find ways to aid Frodo even when they're not by his side. It's well paced, well directed, and has an interesting story that ties in to the first and third movies very well. The one flaw in the movie is Gollum. I don't care how integral he is to the plot or dear he is to the fans, he's just annoying. \n9 out of 10",

            "content": "\"I have returned to you now... at the turn of the tide.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fellowship of the Ring, the first film in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, was an impressive and revolutionary fantasy epic still regarded as one of the best fantasy epics ever. It's sequel, The Two Towers, takes what made the first epic, adds more depth, and creates a stellar sequel that outdoes Fellowship in every aspect.\r\n\r\nWhen Fellowship left off, one member is killed by Urukai and the Fellowship has split. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the One Ring before it's master Sauron regains full power. They come across Gollum (Andy Serkis), who previously was corrupted by the Ring and knows the way to Mordor. Frodo gains his trust, but Sam is suspicious that Gollum might betray them. Elsewhere, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) escape from the Urukai that captured them and end up with the tree/Ent Treebeard, who leads the ultimate council deciding if the Ents will go to war. And last, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Legolas (Orlando Bloom),  Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and the resurrected Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen) prepares the land of Rohan for battle against Saruman's (Christopher Lee) forces, who intends to wipe out the world of men in Sauron's fight for domination.\r\n\r\nThe Two Towers also features Liv Tyler as Arwen, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Benny Hill as King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan, Karl Urban as the kin's nephew Eomer, Miranda Otto as Lady Eowyn, Brad Dourif as Saruman's servant Wormtongue, and David Wenham as Boromir's brother Faramir.\r\n\r\nIf Fellowship was the beginning of the fight for freedom in Middle-earth, The Two Towers is the development of the ultimate battle. There's quite a bit of subplots in the preparations for war, such as the Ents and Rohan. While some might be annoyed at these subplots, I believed these subplots helped add a sense of development in preparing against Saruman's army. I also applaud Jackson for how he handled the transitions between stories from Frodo's journey to Aragorn's. For those who've read this book, you know the first part is Aragorn-centered and the second is Frodo-centered, which causes the book to not tell it in chronological order. Jackson fixed this and told these character's journeys in a better order that doesn't feel clunky.\r\n\r\nAs with Fellowship, the cinematography remains stunning, with New Zealand still looking beautiful as always and behold. Weta Workshop's visuals are simply outstanding and are a step-up from the already-impressive marks left in Fellowship. We get to see more Gollum in this one, and the motion-capture created here is stellar. You actually believe that Gollum is a real creature cause he's done so well. And no one can pull off the personality of this complex character as great as \"Motion Capture King\" Andy Serkis, who's extremely unforgettable in this role. Plus Jackson continues to combine CGI with practical effects in the best way possible, creating an unforgettable experience that we'll never forget. It also features likely the most incredible battle sequence ever put in modern film, The Battle of Helm's Deep. There will never be as epic a battle sequence today as this scene. Jackson clearly had influences from the Star Wars trilogy when creating this scene, cause it's filled with epic action and moments that Lucas could have filmed.\r\n\r\nThe casting is once again excellent. Elijah Wood is once again brilliant as Frodo, and Sean Astin is great again as Sam. Serkis is, as I said earlier, stellar as the creature Gollum, and brilliantly creates Gollum's complex split-personality. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are fun again as Merry and Pippin. Other noteworthy performances include Orlando Bloom as Legolas (who gets to slide down stairs with a shield during the Helms Deep battle; really awesome), Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Christopher Lee as Saruman, and Viggo Mortenson giving his all as Aragorn. John Rhys-Davies is funny again as Gimli. He also voices the tree Treebeard, and is fun in that role as well. The animatrolic designs for the trees are well-done. I also enjoyed Benny Hill as King Th\u00e9oden and Karl Urban, before his scene-stealing role as Dr. Bones in the Abrams Star Trek films, as Eomer. \r\n\r\nHoward Shore returns to provide the score and it's fantastic. Great themes from Fellowship return, plus new themes are introduced, the most stunning being from Rohan, an emotional violin-heavy theme that's really strong. Shore knows what he's doing here, and the score does not disappoint.\r\n\r\nPeople might disagree here, but I found The Two Towers to be an improvement over Fellowship. Peter Jackson brilliantly took what made Fellowship great, added more depth in emotional storytelling and more character development, and creates a worthy middle chapter that's incredibly awesome, leaving us all excited for what happens next in the final chapter. As Gandalf says, \"The Battle of Helm Deep is over. The Battle for Middle-earth... is about to begin.\"",

            "content": "The Two Towers is awesome. I could end it here, but let me school you through why it's awesome. Well, to begin with, it has Gollum in it. I swear to god, one of the reasons why i watched the series was because i wanted to see Gollum, and he didn't disapoint. Gollum might seriously be on the run for best character ever put to film, right up there with Hannibal Lecter or Jules Winfield. The story that Gollum has is just so sad and mind-blowing. Every time he does something evil in Return of the King, im like \"Fuck you Frodo\", but i'll get there in a sec. Secondly, i think this is the darkest film of the trilogy. Return of the King had it's dark moments, but i think this one is on a whole different level. I love dark stuff, and in this movie it works. Then we have the technical stuff (eg the visuals, directing...), and here, i think Lord of the Rings, as a trilogy, it just changed the way this stuff was handled. It's that good. And in the Two Towers it's more visible than in any other film. They toned down those horrible close-up shots, thank god for that, and with those swooping shots, that get more time to shine, cuz of Helm's Deep, the camera work is out of this world. I will not go gush over about Elm's Deep, cuz everyone already has, so i'll keep it short and sweet: It's the best battle ever put to film. And on top of that im one of the 2 people who actually really likes the Tree Beard story. or at least the character, i still think Merry and Pippin are way to annoying in this one. I think that Treebeard can provide some cool comic relief (damn John Rhys-Davis cant get enough of it in these movies). And finally, I especially like the whole Gollum, Frodo and Sam story. Gollum's take was especially interesting, since i think Andy Serkis (and im calling it right now the BIGGEST OSCAR SNUB OF ALL TIME) really captured the tragedy of the all thing. Frodo is getting weaker and weaker, and Elijah Wood really captures this well, specially when out of nowhere he has those rage attacks, it really shows how the ring affects him. This also gives Sam more time to be awesome, as by the third movie Frodo is so weak that Sam is probably the coolest character of that one. So, with me gushing over this film, you would think this is one of my all time favs, and are probably scratching your heads as to why is this getting 4.5. Well, there are some problems, and one of them is probably my biggest complaint with this series: The storytelling. dont get me wrong, the story is awesome, it's the way they tell it i hate. In the first movie it was very focused, you followed the Fellowship. In this movie, since the Fellowship broke, They splitted the story into 3. First you have Frodo, Gollum and Sam. You follow them for like 10 minutes. Then you cut to the rest of the Fellowship, and this takes up the most time, cuz it has the most stuff going on. Then you still have to cut to Merry and Pippin being annoyng with Treebeard. The Fellowship angle i especially dislike, i just get SOOO bored when they get to that stuff, i almost fell asleep at one point. I guess the main reason is that, while the pay off is awesome at the end, with Elm's Deep, the build up just goes on, and on, and on. I saw the extended cut, and i think that out of the 3:45 hours, maybe 1:30 to 2 are spend with this part of the story. It doesn't help when the Frodo/Sam/Gollum part is probably the coolest part of the entire series. The rest are just minor problems, with the exeption of one particular moment: When Frodo betrays Gollum. I'll tell you why i hate this: I hate this cuz througouth the movie you get the feeling that Gollum was on his way to being a good guy again. You can tell that Gollum has found a beacon in Frodo, like a dog attahes itself to it's owner. Fuck, at one point, Gollum's second personallity disapears, and he becomes Smeagol again. But then when Frodo betrays him, it's all over, cuz Smeagol realizes that Gollum was right, that his \"master\" could not be trusted, and at that point i feel that Smeagol fully becomes Gollum. Cuz you know that througout the movie, Smeagol and Gollum are in the same body, but after that Gollum is all that's left.\n\nOverall, this movie is awesome. I think they got a notepad, in which they wrote down all the complaints they got from the first movie, but the way they told the story (which probably was the only way they could tell this story), and that fucking moment, just weights it down a noch for me. Still, easily Top 20 of my favs",

The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey.\nMy Review\nFans of director Peter Jackson's big screen adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring have been eagerly anticipating The Two Towers - its action-intensive follow-up - for a year. But even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair, very basic questions. Chief among them: \"Can Jackson do it again, or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess, like so many other films of this nature have in the past?\"\n\nThey need worry no longer: The Two Towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor, but it succeeds in very different arenas. Where Fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth, such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur. With a two-hour and fifty-something minute running time, TTT is remarkably well paced, and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in. Those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find The Two Towers much more tightly focused and hard-driving. Those who felt Fellowship's greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find TTT a bit remote - more distancing, and not as uninvolving.\n\nBut such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us. Rarely (if ever) in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen: tens-of-thousands of soldier-creatures storm an imposing fortress called Helm's Deep, where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom - a fanciful riff on the legendary Alamo. Armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain Saruman's lair, exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren. Orcs ride herds of horsy-sized helldogs into battle against our heroes. The list goes on - this thing is big.\n\nVisual effects by WETA are generally top-notch, although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the film's VFX team may have, simply, just run out of time. \"Halo-ing\" around character's hairlines (a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite) runs rampant here. \"Animated\" objects (such as the Ents - the walking, talking \"tree creatures\" mentioned above) sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds (the different \"layers\" of the effect are obvious), and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem \"cut out\", or \"flat\" against a background of different texture or depth. But for every shortcoming, there is a triumph. And, despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above, the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named Gollum.\n\n\n\n\n(l-r) Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Wormtongue (Brad Dourif): mobilizing their army towards Helm's Deep, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.\nInterestingly enough, Gollum himself is imperfect: his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy, squirrelly movements in long shots. But when we see his face, up-close, his is instantly believable, and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling. Taunted by a seemingly unceasing internal-conflict (he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized - and decidedly psychotic - inner monologue), Gollum gets more character development than anyone else in The Two Towers, and quickly puts Star Wars \"writer\"/\"director\" George Lucas' Jar Jar Binks to shame. Looking like an Ethiopian Steve Buscemi, Gollum may well be the first digital creature put on-screen who completely sells himself (itself?) as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a \"real world.\"\nThere's not much to say about the returning cast - they are all pretty-much what they were established to be in The Fellowship of the Ring, and rarely move beyond that. Newcomers include Bernard Hill (Captain of James Cameron's Titanic) as Theoden, ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness; genre freakazoid Brad Dourif as the duplicitous Grima Wormtongue; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn; David Wenham as Faramir (brother of Sean Bean's Boromir, who checked-out in the first film. Although Wenham looks like...and pretty much acts like...Sean Bean, so I'm at a bit of a loss here); and Andy Serkis as the live-action motion template (and voice) of Gollum (both appeared briefly in Fellowship, but Gollum is a full-fledged character here).\n\nViewers who find the The Two Towers spiritually unengaging can take heart. In a recent interview with IGN FilmForce, Peter Jackson reveals that The Return of the King - the trilogy's final installment - is his favorite film, describing it as \"incredibly emotional.\" Despite the more cursory nature of TTT, it's beginning to look like oddball Jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable, and knocked one of history's most challenging literature-to-film adaptations clean out of the park.\n\nNo matter what one ultimate feels about The Two Towers, one consideration shines brightly above the rest: it will show you things you've never seen before. And, in this day and age, that's not an accomplishment to be taken lightly.",

All the other characters are revisited right from where we left them - reluctantly - in the last film.  The epic adventure continues, spanning off into many different storylines - some of which are better than others - and numerous more characters (such as the show-stealing Smeagol) rekindle and carry the flame with admirable strength.  It isn't right to call this a sequel, as it merely continues where its predecessor left off, and very little inherent in the last film is lost here.  I do, however, have some minor issues with 'The Two Towers.  I think the sense of adventure somewhat diminishes this time, because most of the movie takes place in Rohan, which I personally think looks pretty bleak and boring.  While I loved Smeagol when I was younger, I now find the \"my preeecioussss\" routine a little overbearing.  Legolas starts to get a little too prancy; Gimli is stripped of all former honour, turned instead into a joke; and Aragon suddenly seems all about invincible.  I'm not too bothered by the infamous gayness between our two main Hobbits, though their little exchange at the end of the movie always makes me cringe.  But overall, this was - and always will be - a fantastic movie.  And for every feature that doesn't quite work, there are always ten more that are nothing less than perfect.",

While it can be overlong at times, it worths the nearly 3 hour trip, thanks to that final battle in Helm's Deep, which i qualify as one of the best war scenes ever in history of cinema.

            "content": "The second installment in the trilogy such a great movie, that's it's hard to know where to start. This movie continues where the last movie left off. Frodo and Sam are on their way to Mordor and meet Gollum, who still is attracted to \"the precious\" but leads the two closer to Mordor. The multi-race trio (Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas) tries to find Merry and Pippin but meet someone else on the way.  Meanwhile, Sauruman is planning the ultimate destruction of Rohan, one of the few good kingdoms that stand in the way of Sauron. It sounds complex, but he story is told in a way that all these plots are cohesive and equal.\n Again, let's start with the cast. In my FOTR review, I commended all the actors and all I have to say for all of them is that the character arcs for this movie are well performed. Legolas and Gimili expand from minor characters to more front line characters, showing some friendly competition and bonding together, showing how different races can get along I do have to go over the new/reformed characters. Let's start with Gandalf. Gandalf in this movie resurrected and is now Gandalf the White. He's a more stern and authoritative figure. Gone is the wit and charm of Gandalf the Grey. A lot of people didn't criticize the acting of Ian McKellen, who I believed was superb, but the direction of the character. I'm not complaining. He needs to be different in times of war. Moving on to Bernard Hill's Theoden, he gives a fine performance for a character that shows so much pain and guilt of his actions that hurt his people. Karl Urban's Eomer is fine but his character doesn't do much, which is a minor nuance. He also only shows up in the beginning and the end, but it works. Miranda Otto's performance of Eowyn is just fantastic. Otto brings a certain charm and innocence to the character but at the same time could kill you (which is shown in the next movie). David Wenham's Faramir is also well done. The brother of Boromir, he strives to be better than his brother. His character isn't as interesting if you don't watch the extended edition, which explain his backstory. Still, he gives a decent performance, showing the same qualities as Boromir who can be kind, but also can be quite evil and menacing. I don't blame the writers for the liberties they took with the character, who wasn't seduced by the ring. They needed obstacles for Frodo and Sam and that was fine. Moving on to the performance that inspired me, Andy Serkis's Gollum. It's not just the voice, nor the CGI, but his commitment to the character that was great and inspired me. He gives Gollum the childish side, but also the corrupted evil side. All in all, you just feel a lot of pity for Gollum. \nThe Battle of Helm's Deep is the climax and is just breathtaking. Tens of thousands of Urks on the big screen is just jaw dropping. The ending of the battle also choked me up, as did Sam's window speech. The music just made the movie ever so grand as it did before. My only problem, low survivors! The original Helm's Deep army had about 600, there were only about 10 left, which sucks! But that's fine.\nLet's talk about the themes. First of all, that good can survive. Sam's quote \"That there's still some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.\" really resonates with the audience. Whatever bad happens around us, in this case, 10,000 Urks about to wipe out Rohan, good will prevail as long as there's still one good person alive. Another theme is the conclusion of the environmental theme. The first movie shows the vulnerability and the sadness of cutting down the trees. They're cut down to fuel industrialism and raise an army for Sauraman. This movie establishes how the forest now fights back and totally wrecks Isengard. Mother Nature always wins. These themes again, might not be apparent but come up after watching the movie.\n All in all, go watch it. It's one of the best movies out there.",

            "content": "The Two Towers is a great film, a technical and visual masterpiece, but in my opinion, it is the weakest of the trilogy. It is may be the most ambitious of the three though, it tries to take on too much of the story, and leaves some important plot points very brief and without as much detail as other parts. For example, Frodo is hardly in the film at all, yet he is the most essential part of the story. The scenes with Frodo only exist when something is going on with Gollum or if the ring is toying with his mind. The film starts out as if it was going to be the best of the trilogy, the first hour and half is very intelligent, dealing with themes of faith, hope, courage, bravery, and the nature of evil. However, by the end, the film slips into a conventional blockbuster. The last hour of the film trades all its wits for chaotic action sequence after chaotic action sequence, and drops pretty much every theme except faith and perseverance. Although, the action sequences are very well directed, and at times are very exhilarating, but so much action was not necessary. The first half also features stunning photography by Lesnie again, it is \nmuch more visually dazzling than the first, mainly because the natural landscape becomes more important in this film. But towards the end, that beautiful photography has been replaced by very well photographed action scenes that depict the sheer magnitude of this massive war. The acting is the same as the first one, Mckellen, Wood, and Astin give great performances, and everyone else are just kind of trying their best. Jackson again succeeds at creating an atmosphere and a world that we have never seen before, a world that is about as detailed as you can hope for. The editing by Michael Horton is very good considering he had so much plot to try and condense into an enthralling 3 hour film, which he succeeds at. Overall, I'd say that The Two Towers is a very good film that relies too heavily upon its action sequences to pace it, and it is a confirmation that Jackson's trilogy is more about men than it is about the innocence and overwhelming goodness of the hobbits.",

While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation.",

One of the great things about middle acts is that all the setup has been done for you, and none of the cleanup is going to drag on at the end. It's like coming to a dinner party right as the main course is being served, and leaving before the dishes have to be done. \n\nThe movie does have some exposition of its own. We are introduced to many Rohan characters, as well as some from Gondor. The film's primary villain, Saruman, gets a lot to do here as well. \n\nIt is a little jarring to constantly cut back and forth between Frodo/Sam, Merry/Pippin, and Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli. It does keep the novelty high, but if you're not paying attention, you can forget what each wing of the cast is up to. Be prepared. \n\nThe new additions to the story bring some excellent actors into the film. Andy Serkis, in his breakout role, shows us that physical and voice acting can really sell a character. Bernard Hill is a very human king, Mirando Otto tries really hard (and sometimes succeeds) at showing \u00c3?owyn's heartache, and Karl Urban is resolute as \u00c3?omer. \n\nThe movie is quite a thinker of you notice. It raises questions about leadership, integrity, character, and trust. These themes are buried, but fun to discover on your own or with friends, rather than by having some hack of a film review writer tell you about them. \n\nThe Two Towers has action, plot, and a splendid cast of interesting characters. This makes for an extremely enjoyable and suspense-filled film. \n\nEXTENDED VERSION: This extended cut has more meat to it, with several new scenes, and more elongated scenes. In particular, it accentuates the relationship Boromir and Faramir have with their father (which is very interesting), as well as a bit more about Aragorn and his destiny. It also cleans up a few scenes, which helps with continuity for me.",

This time the length doesn't feel like an issue because there's more going on but the action gets old after a while and isn't what the spirit of Tolkien's work was about. The Hobbits are also annoyingly outcast as nothing more than bystanders who spend most of the time crawling rather than standing.\n\nIt improves on the first in the important areas but then replaces those improvements with some new issues- in both cases it just feels like Jackson is over-playing his hand. The upsides to that though are the thrills, the epicness (yes, it's not a word, boo-hoo) and the stunning visuals that Jackson creates so well. \n\nI prefer it to the first but I'm left with the same feeling in the end- it could've been better and with less effort too.",

I am not too fond of a film that is purposely drawn-out, has banal storytelling and characters, except for maybe one or two computer generated ones; Gollum is as fascinating a creature as Dobby was in the \"Harry Potter\" series. It's well written contrary to \"The Fellowship,\" also better acted. Orlando Bloom and Hugo Weaving just look awkward in their respective roles; two characters who do not feel natural in an artificial world. It's only great attributes are everything related to visuals; the computer generated effects are awe-inspiring, especially when the film is coming to an end. I wonder how Peter Jackson and his staff imagined and choreographed all of the detail shown in the battle scenes, even if it was done with a computer. To me, the actual fighting is not interesting at all; it's where these creatures are running to, where they are falling; the several objects used by them, and so on. Some of the shots of locations (castles, and what not) done by CGI are gorgeous to look at, too. As I said earlier most of the characters were unappealing to me, only rarely did I care for a few. I've seen them countless times before and did not like the way they were presented, still I did not expect anything different. The three storylines and what happens in them were mostly predictable, somewhat boring, and not really entertaining. It's style over substance, difficult to catch its pulse.",

This film doesn't stay at just keeping the tension and the cinematic brilliantness from the previous film, but it simply denses and polishes it. This one was the hardest to adapt, indeed, because it has too many plots, it has a complex situation, a chaotic and complicated structure, and too many details to be exposed. It was also so hard to express what this story should mean, and to make it both dazzling and thougtfull. Again, Jackson's team made it. Concerning, dramatic, but also evocative and inspiring. This film focuses more on the purely pictorial aspect, on cinematography and score, edition and careness of the environmental atmosphere. Pure Art, in the classical sense. But probably, the greatest things of this film are two: the power of its narrative pulse, and also the introduction of one of the best supporting characters ever: Gollum, both in the psychological and interpretative way, as well as in the digital and creative sense. Every single instant of this classic film, than can be hardly (when not just impossibly) criticized, because of its practical absence of mistakes, is full of the most highly inspired and exquisite artistic taste and sense of heartfulness and beauty.

While the first film started off on a lighter note, The world of The Two Towers is entirely immersed in the War of the Ring, the fellowship has broken up, and Sauron's power is growing across Middle Earth. The film is more complicated than the first, with more subplots relating to the war shown. Frodo and Sam's journey with Gollum is a highlight, and their unique relationship is captured masterfully. The mood of the film is great, the emotion present, and the victories at Helm's Deep and Isengard set up the final push against Sauron and Mordor in ROTK",

            "content": "There's no doubt about it that this film is a bridge between Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. I'm not usually not the biggest fan of bridge stories since all they do is just set up the finale without adding anything new. For example, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix's only purpose is to prove that Voldemort is back and to set up the final battle, making this the worst of the Harry Potter series. However, The Two Towers is completely different from most bridge stories. The film continues where Fellowship of the Ring left off with the Fellowship broken up and Sauron beginning his attack on Middle-Earth. Frodo and Sam are lost on their way to Mordor and ask Gollum/Smeagol to guide them. Merry and Pippin have escaped their captors and are kept safe by Treegard, a talking tree that is the eldest of his kind. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are assisting a town under attack by Orcs at their fortress in Helm's Pass. While all of this is occurring, Sauron is growing stronger with the ring approaching closer. I thought that Two Towers was an improvement over Fellowship. Unlike Fellowship, while it does have a long length, I was able to keep my interest the entire time with clever dialogue and a smartly written script. There's not many action scenes in this film, so the story relies on the dialogue to establish characters and set-up what will occur in the Return of the King. The character that shines the most in this film is Gollum. This is the first time in the series that he's seen entirely. Every scene that he was in, I was clinging to his every world. Andy Serkis does a great job portraying the character and the ending shows that there will be a lot more of him that could be just as exciting as in this film. I'm glad that I was able to finally see this film because it just leaves me, as well as newcomers and fans of the series, in anticipation for Return of the King and the epic conclusion.",

            "content": "The captivating thing about Two Towers is the fight choreography and the battle at Helm\u00e2(TM)s Deep (which was kind of the movie\u00e2(TM)s climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what Peter Jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more CGI (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but Two Towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).\n\nAfter you have watched The Fellowship of the Rings, you are ever so eager to see what the Fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups Frodo with Sam, Pippin with Merry and Aragon with Legolas and Gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. The interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) were moving closer to their target.\n\nThe movie\u00e2(TM)s plot is focused mostly on the battle at Helm\u00e2(TM)s Deep. The other fellowship members except Frodo and Sam and after the fall of Gandalf when he battled the Balrog, chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin so as to rescue them. While they chased Merry and Pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. The rescuers Aragon, Gimli and Legolas found themselves in Rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from Saruman\u00e2(TM)s forces, this defense and intense battle happened at Helm\u00e2(TM)s Deep.\n\nThe three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that I picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. In the book Theoden is just depressed and deluded by Wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by Saruman. The second is about Theeoden, who didn\u00e2(TM)t just run to Helm\u00e2(TM)s Deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. The last was the exclusion of Shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy.\n\nNot winning as much as the first, Two Towers won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best sound Editing. It was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost.\nNot as much of a powerful score like The Fellowship of the Ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the Return of the King). You can\u00e2(TM)t watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the DVD box set and enjoy.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

Of the trilogy, I think that this is my favourite movie as I love the segments set in the kingdom of Rohan with its troubled ruler Theoden, magnificently portrayed by Bernard Hill. This is a sweeping epic of a film with every dollar on the screen creating a truly immersive experience. The climax of this movie is the Battle of Helms Deep, the fortress that the people of Rohan take refuge within. It is a staggering action sequence that just builds and builds. This movie also features the first proper appearance of Golem after the fleeting glimpses in the first film. This is still a magnificent CGI creation and Andy Serkis imbues the character with a malevolence and slyness that is amazing to watch. The rest of the cast from the first film return and are put through the mill. Sean Astin really comes to the fore as Sam in this, proving himself to be a very capable actor. As the second in the trilogy, this film bridges the other two perfectly and pushes the story onwards, giving the characters plenty of depth and development. This is one of those movies that is both long and complex but is just a joy to watch and bears repeated viewings.",

But no, it's easily my favourite of the trilogy progressing the story nicely and introducing more characters and creating more of a character of 'Gollum'. \n\nThere's a greater sense of size and epicness of the world in 'The Two Towers' its done on a grander scale - probably due to the success of the first film. There's more of the world to see and a larger emphasis on the task 'Frodo' and the gang are up against. It also contains what I consider to be the greatest battle scene of all time - 'The Battle for Helms Deep'. That last hour is a magnificent feat in film making.\n\nWhereas 'The Fellowship of The Ring' was relatively dark and miserable throughout, 'The Two Towers' as a happier ending and is the part that shows that there is hope and they finally believe they can accomplish the task. There's a greater feeling of togetherness throughout then film 'Legolass' and 'Gimli' start to become friends. The king of 'Rohan' is returned to the crown and 'Gandalf' returns. Despite the appearance of what some perceive to be a darker film it is not it's quite the opposite.\n\nUnlike then previous film the 3 running time for 'The Two Towers' works perfectly it doesn't drag, everything is necessary. The CGI is clearly improved and considering its only 1 year later it's quite remarkable. \n\nAn improvement in every way on the previous film a greater emphasis on the world and an all together brighter and happier outlook on what they're facing - and containing the greatest battle scene I've ever seen. This really is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.",

            "content": "The Two Towers is an epic continuation of everything good from Fellowship of the Ring. Peter Jackson seems to ratchet it all up a bit with this movie. But also, the story gets a lot bigger. And while this helps in some areas, it also detracts from others. The Fellowship of the Ring was a rather focused movie that followed our hero's. In this movie, our hero's are scattered all across Middle Earth. Then Jackson introduces a whole slew of new plot-lines and characters. This makes the scope of the movie unbelievably massive. And in my opinion, Jackson isn't fully able to balance the entire story until the third movie.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up right where the first left off. Frodo and Sam are on their own, heading towards Mordor. Merry and Pippin are captives of the Uruk-hai, with Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli in pursuit to save them. Gandalf has returned from his battle with the Balrog as Gandalf the White. While traveling, Sam and Frodo are confronted by Gollum, a deranged creature who may be their only hope of getting into Mordor. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli journey with the people of Rohan to Helm's Deep. Here is the only place where they might be safe from Saruman and his army of Uruk-hai.\r\n\r\nElijah Wood really comes into his own in this movie. A lot of emotional weight is being thrown on Frodo, but Wood is able to handle every facet of the character. Sean Astin also gets an opportunity to improve his character, and he does. I especially love Sam's speech at the end about the stories that really matter. It nearly brought me to tears.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen is the same great character that we met in the first movie, but now he is Gandalf the White. While he is a more powerful character now, he is still the same great, fatherly wizard. McKellen is always tremendous!\r\n\r\nViggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and John Rhys-Davis return as Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Mortensen's Aragorn is struggling with the decision to take responsibility. The character is written and played so well. Legolas and Gimli aren't round characters, but they are great sidekicks. Legolas probably gets his second best moment of the trilogy when he rides a shield down a flight of stairs while firing arrows.\r\n\r\nAnd there is one huge addition to the movie that makes this movie even better. Andy Serkis is the absolutely astounding as Gollum. He easily became my favorite character of the series. What's there not to love about the bi-polar, bedraggled little monster! This is the film that ushered motion-capture into movies. Of course that feat is amazing, but Serkis's performance is really the highlight.  The movie's always a bit more interesting when he is on screen.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson comes back strong in every area. The special effects are as stunning as ever. Calling the script, 'well written' is an understatement. Howard Shore returns to the high-caliber score writing that he did for the first. Introduced in their full glory are the themes for Rohan, an epic theme heard often on the violin, and Smeagol's haunting theme, often mixed with the themes for the One Ring. Shore also stays true to his themes from the first movie, developing them accordingly with the story. And though the movie does not have as many action scenes as the first, the action is still very well done here. What really blows the doors off the movie is the battle for Helm's Deep. This may be the finest action scene of the entire trilogy. It's a colossal scene that makes up for the slower parts in the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut the movie does have flaws. This is why I cannot grant it my highest rating. First and foremost, the movie does lag at times. And while I certainly wasn't bored at any part of the movie, the pacing isn't as crisp as the first movie. There also isn't as much action this time around. The quieter moments are used for character interaction. And while I love that, it does make the movie slow in parts. Another thing I didn't like was the way the final action scene was fragmented. They have this huge, epic showdown at Helm's Deep, but the repeatedly cut to Merry and Pippin talking to the Ents. This somewhat ruins the pacing of the action. Still, these are only minor complaints.\r\n\r\nThis movie is exceptionally enjoyable from start to finish. The characters are well written, and the emotional parts of the movie are handled terrifically. The whole experience is dripping with epicness. And watching this movie (and the entire trilogy) is really an experience. And while The Two Towers may be the weakest of the three, it still strongly holds up the story. Peter Jackson hits almost all the marks of a great movie with this one!\r\n\r\n\"Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you...that meant something.\" 9.5/10",

The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is a superb fantasy adventure sequel.  The film is based off the second book of Tolkien's classic series.  It picks up right where Fellowship left off and keeps the audiences attention from beginning to end.  There are a few more battles this time around including a gigantic one in the final act.  The Two Towers is a bit more violent and has somewhat of a darker tone as well.  There are some new characters including walking, talking trees, more warriors and of course Gollum, the former owner of the ring, turned into a creature.  Gollum is one of the most interesting characters in entertainment history played awesomely by Andy Serkis.  The story sees the group split up and getting into different adventures which is fun.  The great cast return to reprise their roles including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom.  Also getting more screen time are the hobbit duo of Pippin and Merry, played by Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan.  This film got nice praise as well including six Oscar nominations including Best Picture.  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a hell of an entertaining ride and sets us up for the grand finale.\r\n\r\nGets A-list Rating of: A-List Approved!  \r\n\r\nyoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\r\nfacebook: facebook.com/Westroopalist\r\ntwitter: @WesAlist",

The first acts do start to drag at points, especially during the time spent with the Treebeard and the hobbits. I was extremely interested in what was happening with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, but my interest with the hobbits and the Ents was waning as I heard more and more dull dialogue. I understand that the audience was supposed to understand the frustration of having to hear Treebeard speak so slowly, but the time spent with Treebeard was too frustrating and overlong to be appreciated for what it was meant to do. The third act really picks up, and it is clear during the action sequences that Peter Jackson has improved as a director; they are more comprehensible and therefore more enjoyable. It is still obvious that most of the action sequences are simply meant to move the plot along, but the filmmakers still put in effort to make them exciting. I was a bit underwhelmed by the action sequence with the Ents, but the battle of Helm's Deep was well-choreographed, well-directed, exciting, and fun; it overshadowed the forgettable fight sequence. The cinematography, costume design, set pieces and makeup effects are excellent; more impressive than that of the previous film. The cast is still outstanding, but the script doesn't match the quality of the acting. The acting is still impressive, but the surplus of exposition and bad dialogue holds the actors down. The special effects range from impeccable to mediocre, while the motion capture is extremely impressive.\r\n\r\nThe Two Towers isn't quite as satisfying, well-written or interesting as The Fellowship of the Ring, but the cinematography, direction, effects and action sequences are definitely better than that of the first installment in the acclaimed trilogy. I'm excited to see The Return of the King, and if the final installment is good, then The Lord of the Rings trilogy can rank as one of the best of all time.\r\n\r\nRating: 8.75/10",

            "content": "The perfect movie trilogy continues with \"The Two Towers\", which splits the rather single minded narrative of \"Fellowship of the Ring\" into 3 separate arcs - Frodo and the Ring; Aragorn, Gandalf and the Battle at Helm's Deep; and Merry and Pippin and the Ents of the Forest.\n\nReturning cast members Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchette, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan and Christopher Lee are joined by some new perfectly cast members to the trilogy. Andy Serkis, while he appears briefly in \"Fellowship\", comes to his own as the creature Gollum in this film, while Bernard Lee, Karl Urban, Miranda Otto and David Wenham all fit their roles really well, especially, in my opinion, Wenham, who is believable as the brother of Sean Bean's Boromir.\n\nSome classic scenes appear in this film. My two personal favourites are: the scene where Gollum and Smeagol have the discussion with one another about whether or not to trust Frodo is inspired film-making, portraying a complex plot point regarding Gollum's psyche on screen very effectively. Also, the scene towards the end of the Battle for Helm's Deep, when Gandalf, Eomer and the Horsemen arrive to turn the tide of battle (closely followed by the Ents storming Isengard) evokes the spirit of old epics, very effectively.\n\nAnother classic trip to Middle Earth.",

It is essential to keep up with this movie as the members of 'the Fellowship' are split up across the lands, leading to many storylines and the introduction of many new characters. Elijah Wood once again plays Frodo (as he and Sam attempt to complete their journey), Viggo Mortensen excellently plays Aragorn (heir to the throne of Gondor), but it is the character of Gollum that steals the show (as well as trying to steal the Ring!). Glimpses of the creature were seen in the opening movie, but here the audience really get to know the character through a brilliant performance from Andy Serkis and the help of incredible CGI. The movie climaxes at the Battle of Helm's Deep, with every attention to detail present as thousands of Sarumen's minions descend upon the fortress. But the story is not over yet as Gollum leads the Hobbits towards Mordor...",
