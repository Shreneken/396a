            "content": "\"The Terminator\" is a 1984 sci-fi/action film directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. The movie is widely regarded as a classic and has become a cult favorite among fans of the sci-fi genre.\n\nThe plot follows a cyborg assassin (Schwarzenegger) who is sent back in time from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Hamilton), a waitress who will eventually give birth to the leader of the human resistance against the machines. A human soldier, Kyle Reese (Biehn), is also sent back in time to protect Sarah and ensure that the future does not change.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of \"The Terminator\" is its excellent pacing. The film moves at a breakneck speed, with tension and suspense building throughout. The action scenes are well-choreographed and visually striking, particularly for a film made on a relatively modest budget.\n\nThe performances are also strong across the board. Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the emotionless killing machine, while Biehn brings a sense of vulnerability and humanity to his role as the time-traveling soldier. Hamilton also shines as the initially helpless waitress who must quickly adapt to a dangerous and uncertain new reality.\n\nThe film's direction and cinematography are also noteworthy. Cameron's use of low-angle shots and close-ups during the action scenes gives the film a gritty and visceral feel, while the use of blue tones and neon lighting throughout helps to create a distinctive and memorable aesthetic.\n\n\"With themes of fate and determinism, the dehumanization of technology, and sacrifice and selflessness, these elements are woven into the story and characters, adding a layer of complexity and significance to the film. The movie suggests that, despite our best efforts to alter the future, certain events are predestined to happen.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to the film as well. The special effects, while impressive for their time, do show their age in certain scenes. Additionally, some of the dialogue can come across as cheesy or over-the-top.\n\nOverall, \"The Terminator\" is a highly entertaining and well-crafted film that has stood the test of time. Its strong performances, excellent pacing, and distinctive visual style make it a classic of the sci-fi and action genres. While it may not be perfect, it is certainly worth a watch for anyone who enjoys thrilling and thought-provoking cinema.",

            "content": "Overall I thought Terminator was a decent movie, not anything spectacular, but the solid plot and a great villain make this movie fairly entertaining. The acting overall is pretty lackluster and keeps Terminator from being more than a generic action movie in my opinion.",

            "content": "The Terminator, directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, is a low budget sci-fi thriller that has become a cinematic masterpiece since its release in 1984. The film tells the story of a cyborg assassin sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, a woman who will one day give birth to a son who will lead a rebellion against the machines.\n\nDespite its low budget and relatively unknown cast, The Terminator is a cinematic triumph that has influenced countless films in the sci-fi and action genres. The film's script is tight and well-structured, with a clear narrative arc that builds tension and suspense from beginning to end. The characters are complex and believable, with Schwarzenegger delivering a standout performance as the emotionless killing machine.\n\nWhat sets The Terminator apart from other low budget films of its time is its groundbreaking use of practical effects and innovative camera techniques. The film's action sequences are visceral and intense, with Cameron using tight close-ups and handheld camera work to put the viewer right in the middle of the action.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive aspect of The Terminator is its underlying themes of fate and free will. The film explores the idea of a predetermined future and the power of individuals to make choices that can change their destiny. It's a thought-provoking theme that elevates the film above a typical action movie.\n\nIn the end, The Terminator is a masterpiece of cinema that proves that a low budget film can still be a groundbreaking work of art. It's a thrilling, suspenseful ride that delivers on all fronts, from the script and performances to the innovative camera work and practical effects. Even almost 40 years after its release, The Terminator remains a timeless classic that has left a lasting impact on cinema.",

The sound design is excellent, surprisingly good considering the age. The music fits with the tone but I did find it a touch synth which comes across as a bit cheesy. The story is actually really strong and incredibly well told. I love time travel and robots! The future war scenes compliment and contrast the eighties perfectly. The slow menacing stalker makes this feel a little like a slasher horror movie, again a very good thing. My only real gripe is that it is occasionally a little slow.

The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.\n\nThe Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.\n\nAction fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Kyle & the Terminator more than make up for that along with a very strong supporting cast. Editing, Pacing and soundtrack are exceptionally done., along with very good cinematography. That being said the only complain I had that persisted through the film was while 80% of the special effects looked incredible. There were at key points throughout the film where the special effects didn't look good at all (The eye scene & the stop motion Blue Screen at the Door are perfect examples) and it came at key points. But that doesn't take away overall from the phenomenal Action sequences like in the Club, the Shotgun Duel and the Police Station. And one can tell these are clearly because of budget constraints rather than laziness. Overall an absolute classic of its era and genre with a minor flaw that keeps it from being an all time great like its sequel.",

            "content": "The movie that started it all and launched James Cameron's career as a director. This film was better than it had any right to be considering its limited budget. The story is tight, centering around a woman who would become the mother of the future, being hunted down by an unstoppable machine and needs to be protected at all costs. It also touches on the concepts of artificial intelligence, technology and it going too far. \n\nThe characters all play their part well. Linda Hamilton grows from a \"down on her luck\" waitress to a stronger, independent woman. Michael Biehn sells it as a scruffy soldier who's just survived a war and is determined to fulfill his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger is pitch perfect as what is now his most iconic role. He's imposing not only physically, but audibly as well. You would really think he's a cyborg, a brute force which will not stop and it works well.\n\nThe pacing of events is perfect. Not one moment feels unnecessary. It's tight and straight to the point, never dragging and making the most of its material. It manages to balance tones of suspense, tension and action without them feeling as if they're in conflicting. While it's successor is a Sci-Fi action film, this is more of a Sci-Fi horror. I also appreciate the use of special effects, much of which holds up fairly well and for what doesn't, we can forgive it considering the budget and time period. It's refreshing to see the use of and actual endoskeleton and puppetry for the Terminator and the make up used for eyes. It's so much more engaging to know they actually did this and wasn't merely generated on a computer.\n\nWhile there is an exploration of technology going to far and artificial technology becoming self aware, the relationships and the humanity of our heroes in contrast to the cold and calculating nature of machines, I think another message which can be pulled from this film and the really the whole franchise is one of survival and what we'll do to survive. The humans of the future and in the present of the film are trying to survive against the Terminator, the machines of the future also waged a war against the humans to survive their extinction, even if it was against the very thing which created. We can enjoy the film but also take away a very memorable message.\n\nIn summary, \"The Terminator\" is a timeless film which manages to blend sci-fi, horror, action and a bit of tragic romance and delivers a tight, captivating thrill ride from start to finish. It's one of film's best and one of my personal favourites. It's crazy to think James Cameron managed to somehow top himself with the sequel. Even so, don't sleep on this film, it was the genesis of the story and in a sense, of James Cameron's career.",

            "content": "The Terminator is like the greatest student film ever made.\n\nDirector James Cameron's romantic science-fiction action-thriller The Terminator (1984) is all raw moody style with Cameron's clear passion of directing and science-fiction. Cameron's direction delivers a touching romance between the heroine and unlikely hero from the future to creative sci-fi concepts and unreal action. The sheer endless volley of bullets and explosions is spectacular. I love the car chases that are fast, exciting, and look dangerous in the erratic driving and reckless gunfire. The Terminator shows Cameron's style is already established early on in his career with a grounded feeling all the time.\n\nJames Cameron shows off his dark atmospheric direction for his grim 1984 cityscapes as well as his post-apocalyptic future world ruled by highly advanced, ruthless robots. How can you not enjoy The Terminator? Arnold guns down the entire police force with ease with a shotgun and machine gun! He feels unstoppable, menacing, and cunning. \n\nWriters Gale Anne Hurd and James Cameron use efficient minimalist dialogue as they opt to tell this scary and crafty futuristic story with visuals instead. They do provide several neat monologues like Sarah Conner wondering about her future or Kyle Reese monologuing about his poor living conditions in his robot ruled post-apocalyptic future. The one liners are cool, iconic, memorable, and hilarious whereas the romance feels resonant and thoughtful. The Terminator is a groundbreaking concept about cunning robot overlords from a corporation sending a relentless killing machine in the form of the cyborg assassins called Terminators. All the sci-fi ideas are thought out and intriguing to think about as you watch Arnold shoot people with no mercy in his villainous and unfeeling quest to destroy Sarah Connor.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and iconic as The Terminator. His ruthless pursuit of Sarah Conner is vicious and cold as steel with Arnold's steely glares and funny coldhearted remarks as he guns down all in his path. Arnold makes The Terminator feel both robotic at heart, but also coldly heartless as he'll shoot first, then continue onwards without warning. The Terminator mimicking voices and killing with purpose might have influenced Predator a bit. Arnold is perfect as The Terminator.\n\nMichael Biehn is cool as future resistance fighter Kyle Reese. He's a neat hero with romantic chemistry with Linda Hamilton. His dialogue feels genuine and considerate as he's kind to Sarah Conner and earnest with her about his love and reverence for her. Linda Hamilton's action heroine Sarah Connor is endearing. She's beautiful, relatable, concerned, terrified, and brave as she evades and retaliates against The Terminator's relentless pursuit of her with lethal intentions. She's not just a gun shooting hero, but a regular woman finding herself in an impossibly dangerous game of robot cat and human mouse.\n\nPaul Winfield is interesting and commanding as Lieutenant Ed Traxler. Lance Henriksen plays the sarcastic jerk well as Detective Vukovich. You're happy to watch every police officer get brutally gunned down by Arnold as they're not competent or helpful to Sarah Conner at all. Rick Rossovich is funny as Ginger's horny boyfriend Matt. Bess Motta is pretty and flirty as Sarah's best friend Ginger Ventura. Earl Boen is hysterical as the skeptical psychologist Dr. Peter Silberman. Dick Miller is super funny as the unfortunate pawnshop clerk Arnold happens to acquire his guns from early on in The Terminator. Bill Paxton cameos as the blue mohawk wearing Punk Leader. Brad Rearden and Brian Thompson's punks are so fun in the opening arrival of Arnold's nude cyborg assassin The Terminator.\n\nEditor Mark Goldblatt lets the unsettling future scenes play out for eerie establishing scenes, whereas the visceral action sequences are cut fast and slickly. I appreciate Goldblatt's tasteful cuts during Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese's love making scene. The Terminator moves at a breakneck speed for a fast feeling for 108 minutes. Adam Greenberg's cinematography has dark shadows and exposing lighting everywhere. The Terminator has a bleak and dark look for that grim vibe, but still feels lighthearted enough to be a thriller. The close-ups of the puppets and animatronics are brave and look incredible. There's outstanding visual effects for The Terminator's red robot vision to the stop motion puppetry from visual effects artist Bob Williams.\n\nArt direction from George Costello, Shay Austin, and Maria Caso has neon city nights, ruined futuristic cities, and dirty streets for a gritty aesthetic for The Terminator. There's cool computer visuals that look like something from TRON, but the practical miniatures and Maria Caso's set decoration models that look outstanding to this day.\n\nComposer Brad Fiedel's clunky synth score actually adds a heavy atmosphere to The Terminator. His swirling melodies soar over the pounding synth rhythms with menace as The Terminator approaches. Sound designers James Fritch, Greg Dillon, David J. Hudson, Mel Metcalfe, Terry Porter, David Campling, Karola Storr, James J. Klinger, Gabriel Guy, Mike Le Mare, Gilbert D. Marchant, Gary Shepherd, and Horace Manzanares mix bursts of shotgun fire with creaky robotic movements. I love the laser blasts and roaring car engines among all the gunfire.\n\nCostume designers Deborah Everton and Hilary Wright find every 1980's black leather jacket and grey trench coats among all the blue jeans for Arnold's Terminator and Biehn's Reese. I like Linda Hamilton's cute 80's colorful outfits from her waitress uniform to her nightlife party outfit. The Terminator design is brilliant to whoever made the chrome reflective surfaces and glowing red eyes. Make-up artists Jeff Dawn and Kyle Sweet nail the massive 80's hair and colorful hairstyles. Hamilton's make-up is lovely and suits her.\n\nIn conclusion, The Terminator may very well be James Cameron's finest film. It's certainly ambitious and entertaining.",

The idea of being chased relentlessly by a killer cyborg is something we have all dreamed of in one way or another. It taps into some of our deepest, most natural fears: things that go bump in the night and things we can't escape from. With what was a relatively low budget, Cameron managed to extract a modern masterpiece that is part sci-fi, part action and part horror film. Arnold Schwarzenegger was cut for this role, and its hard to imagine that the film would have succeeded without him. Linda Hamilton also works well as Sarah Connor, a character that traverses the spectrum from a sweet innocent waitress to the tough action heroine who finally puts an end to the killer cyborg. The special effects are what you would expect from a budget film in the pre-CGI era, good enough for you to suspend disbelief and be taken into the world of the Terminator. Cameron does a great job of introducing the characters and narrating the story as it builds to its climatic end. The final scene with Hamilton's character doing the modern equivalent of riding off into the sunset rounds off the film nicely, and leaves you wanting to know what happens next. The Terminator is a classic science fiction action film that is the movie equivalent of a thrilling roller coaster ride.",

The story is simple: in 2029, a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels through time to 1984 Los Angeles in order to change the course of history.  The movie has its flaws: the synthesizer music score during the actions scenes is horribly dated and many of the special effects are less than convincing.  However, the movie is so full of infectious energy and flows at such a steady high-octane pace that it is almost impossible not to get hooked by the action.  Something else of interest is the fact that the cyborg is such an uber-cool character that it is hard to figure out who the protagonists are or who the antagonist is, which leaves the viewer cheering for pretty much everyone in the movie.  Even if action films aren't your thing, The Terminator is certainly worth checking out.",

            "content": "What is there to say? This is a classic because despite its age and the dated effects used, it's a movie with a sketchy concept but done so well you can't help but buy into it and become enthralled by the journey.\n\nIt's often debated if this is better than it's first sequels and it's a debate that could go either way, but there's no mistake about it that T1 and T2 both stand not only far above their sequels, but far above most other Sci-fi and Action movies period. In my estimation this is because of four reasons\n\nFirstly, it takes itself seriously. Yeah, time travelling robots, everyone reacts the same way even before Time Travel is becoming the common clich\u00e9, which is one of the legacies left behind by this film. Even with a concept as cringe-sounding as this, when it's done right almost anything can work provided you don't overload it or belittle it. That's what The Terminator get's right perfectly. It doesn't lessen your impression at how dangerous the terminator is at any point by mocking it or by throwing in a joke for a cheap laugh. The only laughter in the movie is done at the expense of the protagonist in a way that makes sense when the police psychologist is told that they are from the future and is, understandably, sceptical to say the least. \n\nSecondly, every actor in the movie does a good job and are supported by a strong script. This seems almost a given as many of these went on to have very successful careers but that is in no small part due to their performances here. When you give a good actor a good script, building up their characters in a way that makes complete sense while also giving them their own unique personalities you are well on your way to an amazing movie.\n\nThirdly the music. I can understand if some people think that this is dated as it, like the special effects, is something that has moved a great deal in the time between then and now. Even with that being the case, the music is masterfully crafted, ushering in a cold sense of dread when needed, that low beat we all now immediately associate with the terminator when the machine is even hinted at, is almost like hearing the Jaws theme at times, when you are just waiting for it to strike. \n\nFinally the concept, while it sounds silly at first hearing, it doesn't overload itself and make itself too complicated, limited itself to just one impossibility \"What if this was the future and it could be brought into the present\". It runs with that concept, following the logical route of how it would turn out, from the police realising the names of the murdered girls to Reese being limited to stalking her until the terminator made its move. It doesn't write itself into a stupid situation and while Sarah does made some bad decisions, like calling her mother at the cabin, it's something you can see she might do, that you might do even. \n\nAll this together makes for a masterpiece that at least four of its five sequels failed to even come close to. Terminator 2 is an amazing follow up, but for me only T1 captures the true horror of the concept of being hunted down by a relentless machine that can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with. It doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.",

Other than that, this film is incredible and a definite must watch for all movie action/sci-fi fans. For that, I give \"The Terminator\"... 4 stars.",

Conceito maneiro, premissa intrigante, um antagonista Badass e momentos ic\u00f4nicos fazem desse filme memor\u00e1vel. Mas depois de 36 anos, qual a vis\u00e3o primaria que algu\u00e9m como eu tem ao assisti-lo pela primeira vez?\n\n\u00c9 ineg\u00e1vel que a dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 atenta, brincando muito bem com subvers\u00e3o de conceitos e clich\u00eas. A lore \u00e9 bem explorada, com bons di\u00e1logos expositivos e uma possibilidade de ramifica\u00e7\u00e3o enorme. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do pequeno universo apresentado tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito legal, com figurinos e maquiagem muito bem feitos. Os efeitos pr\u00e1ticos foram uma boa tentativa na \u00e9poca, mas envelheceram muito mal, ficando claro que o que estamos vendo \u00e9 um boneco, ou um \"projeto de CGI\".\n\nA interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o do Arnold Schwarzenegger \u00e9 muito ic\u00f4nica, assim como suas falas, modo de andar e figurino. N\u00e3o posso dizer o mesmo dos outros personagens, que n\u00e3o me convenceram, soando bem desinteressantes. Inclusive, n\u00e3o gostei da performance de Linda Hamilton, que parecia um pouco perdida em cenas dram\u00e1ticas, mas n\u00e3o posso cobrar muito dela, pois sua personagem \u00e9 fraqu\u00edssima, sendo muito mal escrita e desenvolvida. J\u00e1 Edward Furlong esteve no modo autom\u00e1tico por todo o filme.\n\nQuanto aos aspectos t\u00e9cnicos, a mixagem de som soa muito for\u00e7ada, o que atrapalha muito a experiencia. A imers\u00e3o espacial se perde em diversos momentos, o que tira um pouco do aprofundamento na cena. A edi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1udio \u00e9 t\u00e3o ruim quanto, ficando muito aparente quando algo era adicionado na p\u00f3s-edi\u00e7\u00e3o. Tanto a fotografia quanto a OST n\u00e3o me chamaram aten\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nDito isso, acredito que vale sim a pena ver a obra, mas sem expectativas altas, pois voc\u00ea se decepcionar\u00e1 facilmente.\n\nAudio: English, with original subtitles.

A sleek, visceral and cool-toned movie that's razor sharp, quickly paced, and has an iconic grittiness to it that still hasn't been replicated to this day. Arnold's role as the Terminator is amazingly executed. His character is completely void of any emotion, and the way he pierces straight through other characters with his gaze is immensely intense. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn also put in strong performances, especially  Biehn who pulls off the timidness and paranoia that someone who genuinely suffers through PTSD tend to go through. The overall attention to details are amazingly done. The guns, practical effects, costume design, musical score fit together perfectly tie everything together. One scene in particular at the night club where the Terminator finally has a visual on Sarah and slowly approaches her, the music is very eerie and as he's about to draw his weapon, the sound goes crazy as if a predatory animal is about to pounce from out of the bushes. With an emotional arch with the protagonist and an explosive violent ending, I believe this classic has something for every lover of film. Sure, a movie that's 36 years old is going to look dated in some areas. For example, the eye surgery scene and the ending where the Terminator exoskeleton is limping after Sarah. However, these effects are still amazing for their time and somehow are more effective than most modern day CGI. \n\nAnyway, I could keep going on but you get the point. The movie is a 10/10 and is one of the best movies of all time. No debates",

All is not lost, however, when mankind mounts a bold strategy to save their race from the utter destruction of the machines.\n\nVisually, Terminator boasts classic guns-blazing scenery set in in the street, in the club, and at high speeds - all in a film-noir esque 1984 LA. The score is most often subtle, but terrifying in its own right. Anytime Arnie is around, you'll feel it in your bones. When the suspense ramps up, expect not only dramatic strings but a wonderfully 80s techno to appear\n\nCharacter development is simple but as fleshed-out as it needs to be. Linda Hamilton, Arnie, and Michael Biehn provide a small but effective ensemble that drive our plot toward humanity's potential doom. The humble everywoman thrust into an unfamiliar role for mankind's survival strikes a chord in anyone who dreams of being part of something larger than themselves. \n\nNotable is the occasional joke that break up the otherwise bleak atmosphere. Although minor, they bring a sense of humanity to the film's robotic drama.\n\nComplete with a CSI: NY-style ending that ties the plot together with a pretty pink bow, Terminator is a must-watch for fans of action, drama, thrillers, and the Governator himself.",

I don't know...  the tone, atmosphere, and soundtrack all separate it from most of those others so it's likely better than all of them.  The over-the-top portrayal of the\nterminator by Arnold Schwarzenegger is another thing that puts this a notch above the rest.  Most likely, this movie really lays it's claim to all it's praise when the game of cat and mouse begins with the T-800 giving chase to Sara Connor with Kyle Reese... and then comes the police station and, holy shit, that's when this movie takes it to another level.\n\n4 of 5",

When I did watch it, it was a hell of a thrill ride - scary, tantalizing and unlike anything I had seen before. Nearly thirty years and many sequels later, I've finally watched the original.  Terrific design on the machines and cool, still feasible, exposition help keep this classic aloft.  I smiled when I heard the few familiar one-liners and grinned broadly at Sarah's own at the end. The stop motion and makeup effects are super cool and effective, and the exposition about the future (that's a bit of a mind f- to write) works in its flashback delivery. Some of the dialogue falls flat, but I buy what the cast is selling.  Also, outside of the theme, the synth-music hasn't aged gracefully.  All right, James Cameron, well done.",

Having a story of futuristic concept about computers, robots and machines in a war takeover during that time is probably what sets it apart from other actions film. I think those kind of themes were not fully explored during that year - 1984 which made this film having an edge or ahead of its other same sci-fi genre of movies. I'm also amazed by the work of tricks and effects that were put into this film for I've seen it was flawless with minimal fakeness to it considering the year or era it was made - 80s. The plot is interesting about robots which is highlighted by the suspenseful action chase and thrilling climax. Arnold Schwarzenneger is the icon of Terminator in this film. He personified the ideal cold and emotionless cyborg arsenal in film that up to this day remains a classic character of this sci-fi film.",

'T2: Judgement Day'\nIn the post-apocalyptic future, tyrannical machines teleport a cyborg back to 1984 to kill a woman whose unborn son is destined to lead the Humam resistance. That's the gist. I like everything about this picture. The score is great. The acting is dramatic. Biehn gives a really believable performance. Linda Hamilton really goes through a transformation that culminates at the end and into the sequel. She starts off as an innocent girl who's caught up in a war she cant control and knows nothing off. But she becomes a real badass. Brad Fiedel does a great job with the music. The special effects are good for 84 I think. There's some humour in the film which is great. I like the dark foreboding feeling this film has. Some prefer the sequel because the same feeling is less present in that film. I prefer T2 for the rapor between John and the machine and also because I like the T1000 as portrayed by R. Patrick in that film. However this is a fantastic piece of Sc-Fi thriller work too. And I can totally understand why someone might prefer this picture. James Cameron and Bale Anne Hurd brought us a fantastic film. \n\nAll in all, I cant reccomend it enough.\n\n\"I'll be back.\" - T-800",

With her dead, no John, and the Machines win. So Man sends a man back in time (apparently, 10 years from now, in 2029, we'll be able to time travel) to stop The Terminator so John can be born. The story holds up nicely, but the action sequences have been done to death so many times since, they don't fare as well. Yet the movie manages to give you the feeling that the studio had no part in the creative process, and let them just make their little movie. Here's $6 mil, Jimmy, go out and play. I just read that James Cameron had the image of the metallic skeleton killer robot first, and worked backwards from there. And because of budget constrictions (he couldn't have a future that looked all that good, in the movie, not in real life), so he made it a time travel story so he can shoot in present day. Pretty cool, if it's true. I wonder if that happened to him with TITANIC?\n\nSo like I said, some of the movie doesn't kick the way it did in 1984. For that matter, what does? David Lee Roth?

The movie's strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas. This isn't a run-of-the-mill turn-off-the-brain collection of chases and fight scenes. The plot, which involves time travel and the paradoxes inherent therein, requires viewers to pay attention or risk having no idea what's happening. The casting is so good Arnold will forever be associated with this movie and this role. The themes and ideas presented in The Terminator hold up well today, even though we have moved into the post-Cold War era and only the most nihilistic individuals could see 2029 in such bleak terms.

As a matter of fact many today consider it a better film than even its sequel T2 which was a far bigger commercial and critical hit upon its release. Arnold sizzles in the role that truly defined him and it is easy to see why- He looks and acts exactly like a robot, right down to facial expressions(or lack thereof) and the stance of walk. Linda Hamilton and Michael Beihn are really good and it is a testament to Cameron's innate talent that he got such great acting from largely unknown actors. The pacing is excellent and the cinematography is suitably gritty and grainy. More than 30 years have passed since the film's release but the Terminator hasn't lost any of its punch and remains a science fiction classic. (James Cameron's first of many films that are modern classics).",

            "content": "In regards of every single aspect, The Terminator is the textbook example of just how much can be done with as little money.\n\nWith a simple, yet innovative use of camera movements, and different camera angles, James Cameron shot some of the most impressive action sequences and car chases. The use of zooming technique, in particular, in chases scenes also created a great deal of tension.\n\nSimply put, The Terminator is one of the best paced action movies ever. It's not fast as most of the cheesy action flicks of the eighties, nor slow-burning like Blade Runner's that definitely wouldn't suit the movie's tone. It's just perfect!\n\nSome may say the special effects are dated and don't hold up very well, but I don't mind them at all. In fact, I liked so much the visual effects, and I found them pretty convincing. The makeup is also remarkable for its time.\n\nWhat dazzles me aren't the effect, though, but the not-a-word-wasted dialogue. There is no line of dialogue that has been wasted. Every line or even gesture is as short as it's powerful as you can ever imagine.\n\nThe movie isn't without its flaws, though. I found the way we got to know for the first time about the background story pretty lazy. Also, the whole situation was unsuitable for giving us information, but, nonetheless, the time was perfectly enough for us to know the most important things. There were also a couple of times later when the luck played a vital role in saving the protagonist's life. Besides, there is a glaring plot hole at the end of the movie that really drove me crazy till the credits roll.\n\nThe movie features Arnold Schwarzenegger in his career-defining role, and I can easily see why. Casting him was a perfect choice to portray a relentless, rigid, indestructible cyborg. From seeing her vulnerable to accepting her fate, and trying to convince herself of it, Linda Hamilton is absolutely terrific as Sarah Connor. Michael Biehn is fantastic as well. Kyle Reese is my favorite character from the movie.\n\nA great score that just hits the right note by walking a fine line between the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world and the cheesiness that distinguishes the movie's nature.\n\nUnpretentious filmmaking at its finest!\n\n(8.5/10)",

This movie is wildly entertaining and still holds up as a fun & exciting action movie! A couple effects don't look all too real by today's standards but are still impressive nonetheless.

            "content": "The Terminator: 10 out of 10: Time travel meets a future dystopia meets eighties hair in one of the best B-movies ever made. Considering this was directed by a guy whose only film at the time was Piranha 2 the Spawning.it seems like a miracle.\n\nThe Good: Repeat viewings will clue one in on a couple of things. For starters, this is a tightly made film with great pacing and foreshadowing. Little things (Arnie running over a toy truck in one of the first scenes as an example call back to themes and scenes later in the film.) The film is so well paced that when it turns it up to eleven (Police station natch) the surprise in genuine and in-universe.\n\nThere is also a surprisingly successful time travel romance film. It handles the conundrum of time travel much better than many films for whom time travel is their raison d'\u00eatre. Despite some occasionally clunky dialogue, the romance between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn really works. One can imagine that film sans the whole end of the world unstoppable Terminator part. (As an aside Gene Siskel in his review of the movie said as much wishing they had dumped the Arnie character and concentrated on these two kids. Roger Ebert for the record disagreed).\n\nThe Bad: Okay I love practical effects. You love practical effects. Let us be honest the Terminator in the first film goes a little skeleton from that Sinbad movie at the end. In addition, Arnie's mask/makeup when he is fixing his face makes him look a little too much like Michael Myers.\n\nThe Ugly: Like Jaws and Die Hard, Terminator has spun off some subpar sequels and a ton of god awful ripoffs. Some of the original OMG factor is invariably lost with the familiarity of the plot and the sea of pretenders.\n\nIn Conclusion: There is a scene early on in that wonderful eighties bar Tech Noir Where Linda Hamilton finally gets hold of the police and they tell her don't worry, stay in the crowd, and we have someone on the way. You will be safe. When I first watched the film I really believed that. The film kept selling me safety only to pull the rug out from under again and again. I have seen few films who have played that parlor trick any better. Not a cheap trick of the killer pretending to be dead but a real one of a truly relentless machine After all as Michael Biehn says \"That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!\" The sequels have lessened that message and blurred those lines. This film gets to the heart of it. It is an action film, a romance, a sci-fi thriller, but most of all it is a horror film about something that can't be stopped and where you are never truly safe. A great movie.",

            "content": "This is a near perfect 80's action movie. A very violent and chilling thrill ride that is expertly written and directed.\nThis film is often overlooked now because of the big budget sequel that followed it but this is the film that shows why they have had such a hard time building a franchise and carried on rebooting it.\n\nThis film is a classic of its era and that is very important. James Cameron, I am very sure was aware of similar type films failing because they become silly and dated quickly. You can see a lot of decisions for the villain and the future were probably due to budget constraints but with hindsight they kept the film focused, gritty and real.\n\nCameron decided he wanted this to be gritty and believable, people have to buy into it from the get go and not laugh at it. A lot of films about time travel fail because of their vision of the future or what they bring back from the future. So as a plot device Cameron kept it simple. The two characters sent back from the future arrive naked, no futuristic weapons or clothes and just a name of a woman They both have to track down the same woman, one to protect her and one to kill her. Its very simple and it keeps the film grounded.\n\nThe sequels (bar T2) have failed because this film was not written to have a sequel, it is a stand alone film. It says that at the beginning. The fight for the future will be fought tonight, in our time.\n\nWe are given a brief outline of a future. There was a nuclear war, Skynet, a defense system attacked the human race after becoming self aware and caused a nuclear war. The few survivors band together and hid underground, so Skynet built infiltration units, cyborgs to blend in and wipe out the few survivors. The T-800 sent back through time is a newer model. Undetectable, it has living skin over a metal skeleton.\n\nWe are not given much else. Skynet HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN THE FUTURE. The war is over. The survivors formed the resistance to fight back and they broke into the lab with Skynet and blew it up. It's over. Again, \"The fight for the future will be fought tonight\"\n\nThe resistance is lead by John Connor, After getting into Skynet they find out Skynet as a last act and chance of defeating the humans has sent a Terminator back through time to kill John Connor's mother-Sarah Connor, hoping this will alter the war in the future.\n\n\nDue to the nuclear war the records were lost. The film is set in '84 and the war began on August 29th 1997 so it is believable as most records were paper and we did not have the internet or social media like we do nowadays. The year the Terminator is sent back is 2029 so John Connor is the leader of the resistance but was very young when the war began and there were virtually no records on him.so his mother is a viable target.\n\nThis is all told through Kyle Reese's character and very quickly. The future is never dwelt on and other than a few visions of his nightmares this is all the information we are given. He is later arrested and explains a little about time travel and the Terminator but this is not world building, Cameron wanted the focus on the here and now.\n\nWhen questioned by the police he is asked why he did not bring back \"ray guns\" he replies \"nothing dead will go\" (The Terminator has living skin)\nThey can't go back to the future \"It's just him and me\" as after he was sent back they blew up everything, including the time displacement unit. The war was over and Skynet had lost. He does refer to skynet as a villain but it is left to our own imagination as to what Skynet actually is.\n\nThis film was never written to have a sequel. It works very well in the era it is set and the villain, Skynet is really just a plot device to explain the Terminator. We are not given much detail about it. \nWe know there was a war and to alter the outcome of the war a Terminator has been sent back to stop John Connor being born,\nJohn Connor we are told lead the resistance and defeated the robots and is a war hero.\nThe clever twist is Skynet essentially kills itself by creating a time loop, if you will. Connecting the future to the past as Kyle Reese is John Connor's father and has only been sent back because of Skynet sending a Terminator back through time. This is not fully revealed until the final scenes in the movie so it is a nice moment to take away from the film.\n\nThe film itself is a very violent and very dark movie. It can not be replicated nowadays and is still one of the most violent movies ever made.It is very chilling at times. Since T2 every sequel has been a PG-13 and it is a stark contrast to its original source material. That has become the problem, this film should be regarded as the source material the rule book but every sequel has focused on copying and imitating the sequel to this film and that has resulted in 3 sequels that are so far removed from this movie they are hated and became failures. If you watch this film and then watch Terminator Salvation there is no connective tissue other than the property-Terminator.\nThe glimpses of the future Cameron shows in this movie are frightening. The soldiers are all hiding in a very desolate future and being hunted down. The scenes are very short but for any fan the images all was stuck with you. When you see the future war in Terminator Salvation...It's all very, very wrong. The vision has been lost, the fear, the dread, the destruction, the end of humanity is gone.\n\nThe 3 leads in this movie are all very good. Nowadays It is odd to think of Arnie as scary but in this film he is an unstoppable killing machine. He is absolutely perfect and every scene with him in it is breath taking. His character is genuinely scary as it hunts down Sarah Connors through a phone book one by one until it finds it's target.\n\nDue to records being lost The Terminator has no information other than a name and a city so The Terminator is working his way through the phone book killing off Sarah Connors. The opening scenes with The Terminator are brutal and the film is almost like a horror movie as he guns down numerous women with ferocious accuracy.\nThe film is mainly filmed at night too and gives off an air of a horror movie.\n\nThis would launch both Cameron and Schwarznegger's careers and it is easy to see here. His presence is immense and every scene is so memorable. It created 2 icons of modern cinema.\n\nBiehn plays the soldier tasked with protecting Sarah Connor and later falling in love with her. He is perfect for this role and he is always a soldier, he barely cracks a smile through the whole film and his serious performance adds to the cranked up tension that is built throughout.\nLinda Hamilton is a great Sarah Connor and the role would be expanded on and become iconic in T2 but her performance in this film is probably forgotten a lot but it's a shame as she is very good here.\nWhen we are first introduced to her she is a young waitress and seems like just a pretty L.A. girl and during the film she transforms and defeats the Terminator herself fulfilling her own prophecy. The final scene with her at the gas station is a highlight and wrapped up a terrific film that ends with the war looming...\n\nThis film stands the test of time and does not need to be remade but i do feel if they want to expand on the Terminator name/brand they should take a closer look at this film and study the rules created within this film. The inconsistencies in the later sequels just annoy fans, and studios need to understand this and T2 are the only films with Terminator in the title that anybody liked!\n\nSpecial mention to Brad Fiedel who did the soundtrack to this and T2, it is absolutely superb. He never returned for the sequels and his music to the first 2 movies is mesmerizing at times...if you ask anyone who has seen this movie to hum the music i am sure they can! it was so memorable and is vital to this movie.",

In a desperate attempt to save Sarah, the human resistance sends back a lone soldier to be her protector. The battle for the future takes place today.\n\n\"The Terminator\" is written by James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, and William Wisher, and is Cameron's third time in the director's chair. Coming from an art directing job with Roger Corman, Cameron saved up his money to eventually create this 80s classic sci-fi thriller. \n\nStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Beihn as the lead characters, \"The Terminator\" features a strong cast with gripping performances. Bill Paxton (R.I.P ??) and Lance Henriksen--who would later be involved in \"Aliens\"--have small roles in this film. \n\nAlthough the \"Terminator\" series is known across the globe as an unmistakeable sci-fi action landmark, the first film is essentially a horror movie dressed up as science fiction. This isn't too surprising, since Cameron started his career in film working with the b-horror master, Roger Corman.\n\nWhile \"The Terminator\" follows a lot of horror tropes, it also has a simple and concise story which creates a sense of tension throughout the film. Additionally, Stan Winston and his team created an incredible design for the Terminator, and to this day, it's still held in high esteem. \n\nThe middle section of the film drags a bit to serve as exposition, but the car-chase (there are many of them) pace soon speeds back up leading to an exciting and satisfying conclusion. \n\nIf you haven't watched \"The Terminator,\" but you're aware of the franchise's impact on sci-fi as a whole--do yourself a favor, and check this one out. It's dark and gritty, it's got plenty of action, cool (but dated) special effects, Stan Winston's magic touch, and an excellent cast of characters.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job of playing the titular villain, a robotic hitman of sorts. The action sequences are enjoyable with its sweet, sweet gunplay. James Cameron managed to make this sci-fi flick work with its small budget and directs the best way he could at the time. The post-apocalyptic future is rather frightening and the actors' performances are great. While I find The Terminator to be overrated, that doesn't mean I hate it.

            "content": "The Terminator, is without doubt is a timeless classic that will forever sit among the top sci-fi actioners to have ever been produced, sitting right along side Predator and Aliens; Aliens actually being born whilst waiting for Arnie to finish Conan the Destroyer rather than recast him. Cameron preferred to classify his film as a tech-noir, sci-fi, horror, slasher movie that was inspired by Mad Max 2. It was his first blockbuster hit and only his second major feature after Piranha Part Two: The Spawning and when he noticed audiences were describing the film as Sci-Fi/action, it set him on a path to continue the trend. \n \nSet in then, present day of 1984, a Terminator, not strictly a cyborg but a lethal killing machine covered in human flesh to help it infiltrate, is set back in time from 2029 to kill Sarah Connor, the future mother of the leader of the human resistance, thus resetting the time line and ending the war. Though, someone from the resistance is also sent back to both warn and protect Connor from the Terminator, ensuring her survival. How the story evolved was mostly as a result of a tight budget. Cameron couldn't set the entirely story in the future because of the hefty expense so, the time travel became an economic solution and actually added so much more possibility to the plot, enabling the audiences to relate to the film. \n \nIt was on such a restricted budget that it went over, often resulting in Cameron and crew to make do with what they could, sometimes Cameron even paying for shoots himself and he got cheeky with, or I should say without filming permits, basically doing hit-and-run shoots on location before authorities could turn up. This explains the majority of the film being shot at night. The sound was filmed in monophonic too and wasn't updated with a 5.1 stereo sound until 2001. \n \nOther parts of the original script was greatly cut, but on top of budget it was also the lack of special effects that hindered the story which would eventually turn into the sequel. There was suppose to be two terminators sent back, one being the T-800 and the other being the T-1000 but it wasn't until Cameron made The Abyss in '89 that he knew they then had the computer technology to make the liquid Terminator work. \n \nThere was some controversy over the story with science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, who sued Orion Pictures over infringement, claiming the story was copied from a couple of episodes of The Outer Limits. Must to Cameron's disagreement and protest, Orion agreed to pay an out of court settlement and whilst there was a gag order in place, Cameron still denies any plagiarism quite openly. \n \nWhat it gave birth to was one of the most iconic and influential sci-fi characters to ever be created. The creation and design of the Terminator is ingenius; a robot that's totally relentless, a programmed assassin, the ultimate killing machine that doesn't feel pain, remorse or fatigue, that will stop at nothing until it's task is complete. The late, legendary Stan Winston and team built the Terminator's endoskeleton out of real metal which gives it it's realistic look, however the negative side to the beautiful prop piece was that it was too heavy for the team to operate making it very impractical during shoots. \n \nSchwarzenegger only did the movie for the money and initially wanted to play Kyle Reese, with Cameron actually against the idea of having a bodybuilder play the part of something that's suppose to blend in with other humans. But, putting logic aside, he went of the cinematic aspect of the film going with the notion that the audience wouldn't care much about the science behind it if they enjoyed what they saw. \n \nLance Henriksen had more than just a small part of Det. Vukovich in the film. He knew Cameron from the beginning and actually helped him pitch the script to producers by dressing up as the terminator, got into character and freaked the producer out, giving raise to the rumour that Henriksen was to play the T-800, but that was never the intention. Instead he does go on to play The android, Bishop in Cameron's following film, Aliens. \n \nThere were many actors considered for the role the T-800 prior to Schwarzenegger taking the role. Both Stallone and Mel Gibson declined. Tom Selleck, Randy Quaid, Michael Douglas, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow and Kevin Kline among many more were considered, even O.J. Simpson who was rejected on the grounds of not being convincing enough as a cold-blooded killing machine. Go figure. \n \nSchwarzenegger trained hard, learning not just how to use multiple firearms, but the strip, dismantle and reassemble pretty much blind-folded which added to illusion of how efficient the Terminator was; and it also earned him a commendation from Soldier of Fortune magazine, a publication that normally slates movies for their misuse and misrepresentation of shooting guns. He got some of his inspiration from watching Yul Brenner's performance in Westworld, suggesting to Cameron that his terminator should not act like a machine, but to be a machine. He kept his distant from his co-stars so to minimise any emotional exposure, creating possibly his greatest performance of his career. Not forgetting his iconic and now trademark line \"I'll be back\" which was one of the 14 lines he's say in the entire film, a line Schwarzenegger initially had trouble saying and requested to change the script to say \"I will be back\" then, you couldn't stop him from saying it in nearly every other movie. \n \nThere were plenty of actors considered for the role of Kyle Reese before it went to Biehn, who, after reading the script, wasn't impressed and thought it silly until he met with Cameron and saw his passion and commitment was real. But Bruce Willis, Sting and Mickey Rourke among many more were considered to play Reese. I think there was an even longer list for Sarah Connor, with the role initially going to Cameron's first choice, Debra Winger, but Geena Davis, Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Carrie Fisher were all considered with Sharon Stone, Lea Thompson and Kelly McGillis actually auditioning for the role. \n \nIt's ultimately Hamilton's defining role, and she's rarely remembered for playing anyone else, apart from maybe Catherine in the 80's TV series adaptation of Beauty and the Beast opposite Ron Perlman and maybe Dante's Peak. But, like the rest of the cast, it's impossible to see anyone else play those characters, with only Schwarzenegger returning to reprise his role three more times. \n \nAll the elements worked perfectly and while, yes, there could have always been improvements, it's still a prime example of what is achievable on such a tight budget. Even Brad Fiedel's score is iconic and globally recognised. It's probably the only thing he's ever remembered for but it's such a famous theme, created from an imaginary mechanical man's heart beat, the main theme is reworked throughout the film and really has the tone of 80's horror films. \n \nUpon it's release, it remained at the top of the US box office for two weeks, surprisingly so for both crew and producers not realising what success this would spawn and blame was shouldered in Orion Pictures for its lack of advertising support. The teaser trailer above was voiced by Peter Cullen, who is best known for voicing Optimus Prime. The success of the film, which obviously kicked off a huge franchise secured both Arnie's and Cameron's career.\n \nIt's the perfect sci-fi, tech-noir, horror, action film that has spawned a huge franchise and dozens of carbon copies, being one of the more recognised characters in movie history and remains one of the greatest movies ever made. \n \n \nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 9\nStory: 9\nScript: 9\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Point: 10 for being exactly what it is, a timeless, iconic great.",

A very fast paced movie with a great story, Superb direction, Well Written Script  and some good character development. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Conner bringing a great sense of innocence to her character. Michael biehn is also really good but Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator was just brilliant casting he really sold himself as an Unstoppable Killing Machine. I couldn't quite give this a perfect 5 stars because some of the special effects feel extremely dated but that's understandable since it came out 1984. Overall this is an intense and thrilling and sometimes frightening movie. just an all round Great Film and is right up there as One of my Favourite Movies of all time.",

            "content": "After having watched the \"Terminator\" franchise in its entirety over the past week, I have come to a realization.\n\nIn \"The Terminator\" (1984) the \"Resistance\" led by John Connor, having already won the war in the original (and most definitive) timeline, needed not send Kyle Reese back in time to save Sarah Connor from the T-800 that was sent to kill her. John Connor had already been born, and the war had already been won.\n\nThis is how I see \"The Terminator\" (1984) playing out if The T-800 had been sent back in time by Skynet to kill Sarah, and Kyle Reese had not been sent back in time by John Connor to protect Sarah.\n\n-Sarah Connor was already carrying the child of Stan Morsky which would later become John Connor.\n\n-The T-800 would have gone on its killing spree looking for Sarah Connor, capturing the attention of the news media, and prompting Sarah to seek police protection.\n\n-The police would have arrived at the Tech Noir club sooner and picked up Sarah before the T-800 arrived because the police would not have been stalled due to Kyle Reese's presence in the area. (He was being looked for as well because of his assault on police in the beginning of the movie).\n\n-The Police would have taken Sarah into protective custody.\n\n-The T-800's search would have been stalled.\n\n-Eventually Sarah Connor would have been moved to a military compound after police see that the killer, (The T-800) had not been apprehended or found.\n\n-The T-800 would find Sarah's mother's address after having killed Ginger and Matt in Sarah's apartment.\n\n-The T-800 would kill Sara's mother and \"copy\" her.\n\n-Sarah would eventually call her \"mother\" from the military compound with her whereabouts with the T-800 intercepting the information.\n\n-The T-800 would stock up on weapons at gun stores and kill the clerks, further drawing the attention of law enforcement and military personnel.\n\n-The T-800 would storm the military compound with the police in hot pursuit as well as the military, the navy , and the coast guard having been alerted of it's presence in the vicinity of the compound.\n\n-The military personnel would shoot the T-800 down with rifles. The T-800 would continue to advance. \n\n-Seeing that their bullets had little effect on him, they would begin shooting him with grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles decimating him.\n\n-Bits and pieces of the T-800's cpu chips and the electrical components that constitute the T-800 were found, studied and duplicated preserving the Skynet foundational elements (These elements were already inevitable in the \"Terminator universe however.)\n\n-Skynet, judgement day, and the war against the machines commences.\n\n-John Connor and the resistance defeats Skynet in 2029.\n\n-Movie over.",

The machines send back The Terminator(Arnold Schwartzenger), a cyborg killing machine with one objective: Eliminate Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). Rebellion leader, John Connor, sends back Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah and defeat The Terminator once and for all!\n\nThis movie is awesome. Do I think it's the greatest action or science-fiction movie of all time? God no. It's fantastic for what it is but I don't believe that it is a masterpiece. Needless to say, the acting and action is superb. I mean it is pretty close to perfect in some areas. Cameron's world building is incredible and he is a master at drawing the audience into his world. This movie is fantastic and I highly recommend you see it.\n\nThe story is great and very well written. Cameron is seriously a genius at world building and is very in depth at describing this world. That is also one of the movie's downfalls. This in depth world building required a lot of exposition and that doesn't work towards the movie's favour. Obviously a lot of exposition was needed for a new IP of this scale but everything can be toned down a bit and condensed and that is what I wish happened here. The climax is fantastic and possibly one of the best ever put to film. I wont spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it but I can assure you it is awesome. I wasn't too impressed by the ending because I predicted it but if you were, I wont take that away from you. It's a good ending I just saw it coming.\n\nSchwarzenegger is cold, calculating and ruthless. I love it. The Terminator is one of the greatest antagonists in movie history and nothing can take that title away from him. The fact that he is relentless is terrifying and Schwarzenegger really sells that side of the character. Truly a masterclass of character creation.\n\nLinda Hamilton was great as Sarah Connor and I really bought her arc from the beginning of the movie to the end. She starts as a bumbling waitress with a lot to live up to but slowly evolves into that legend and that is mostly down to Hamilton's awesome performance. She was the 80s Ripley. That is probably the best way of putting it.\n\nMichael Biehn was surprisingly great as Kyle Reese. The point of his character was primarily to deliver exposition to the audience which isn't exactly great character work but aside from that he's an interesting human being that has a fascinating background that isn't really explained but is clear through Biehn's brilliant performance.\n\nTechnically speaking, this is a very well done movie. Aside from one messy semi-action sequence in the middle, I was very pleased with how the movie was shot and edited. The lighting is fantastic. Costume design is great. Set design is fantastic. The visual effects in this movie are mind-blowing and all effects used on The Terminator should be retroactively awarded an Oscar.\n\nIt is also one of the most quotable movies in history. 'Come with me if you want to live' and 'I'll be back' are arguably two of the greatest lines of dialogue ever uttered on screen. The quote 'Listen, and understand. That terminator is out there, it cant be bargained with, it cant be reasoned with, it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear, and it absolutely will not stop...EVER, until you are dead!' is one of my favourite lines of dialogue in film history and is truly the definition of perfection. It gives me chills whenever I hear it and is a work of art as far as writing goes.\n\nBrad Fiedel's score for this movie is awesome and I absolutely treasure the score that signals impending doom from The Terminator. It is fantastic and I cannot praise that score any more. It is brilliant and I absolutely adore it.\n\nThe action is awesome in this movie. The car chase scene, the police station sequence, the masterpiece that is the climax; these are all truly great scenes that elevate this movie above the rest. They lack the fun aspect that most other action movie's possess but that doesn't make it any less awesome.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough. Comparing the tone of this review and the rating may imply that my rating was too harsh but the flaws I mentioned earlier on are my only genuine flaws with this movie. I cannot flaw this movie any more and it is truly excellent. I highly recommend you see this movie. I'll rate it 8 'I'LL BE BACKS' out of 10.",

Okay, so I doubt we'll have cyborgs by 2029, but time travel movies are always a work of fantasy and are way out. Provided they entertain, and they minimise the paradoxes as best they can, they I can suspend some disbelief. And 'Terminator' does just that, by focusing first and foremost on the whole cat and mouse chase from almost beginning to end, with some build up within the first half an hour, and not going to deep into the whole time travel paradox problems. After all this is a suspenseful action-thriller with a sci-fi-time travel backdrop. Chances are you've probably seen 'Terminator' before. Or if you haven't, you probably know the story and most certainly \"I'll be back\". But whether you're\u00e2?? watching it for the first time or re-watching it, be sure to watch it on the remastered Blu-Ray. It is one of the best catalogue remasters I've seen. The picture quality is astounding, especially for an 80's movie. It's just so crisp, clear, and detailed. But that isn't where the good news ends. The audio is also very good and engaging, with some strong bass, LFE's, and plenty of surround activity. 5/5*",

            "content": "Well, ladies and gentlemen, here it is. The one you all been waiting for, The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and directed by James Cameron. And get this: my old friend Jacob Dimmock, he is a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think everybody's a huge fan of him. This is the first film I've ever looked that has an 100% rating from critics from Rotten Tomatoes and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films. You can't really go wrong. It's just unbelievable. OK, I'm going to tell you the details. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an evil cyborg aka The Terminator sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 (the film is been released in the year 1984) to kill Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton before she gets pregnant to the boy who will one day become a savior against machines in a post-apocalyptic future. So he walks naked and comes across the three punks. One was played by the memorable Bill Paxton and two of them I don't know. One of them said ''Nice night for a walk.'' and ''Nothing clean, right?'' and The Terminator starts copying what he is saying and he says ''Your clothes. Give them me, now.'' and the punk leader says ''Fxxx you, axxxxxe!'' so the Terminator starts beating the punks and kills one of them by punching through his chest, pulls his fist out full of blood and holding his heart and one of them takes his clothes off and makes him wear them. I didn't know he punches through his heart at first because all I can see is a pool of blood but I think my brother had a reaction from that scene what The Terminator had just did. Then we see Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese as an soldier from the future (one possible future) sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor and the first chase scene is gripping it's dark. There's a scene where Sarah goes to the nightclub where the 80s party songs are on is a scene where she's been tracked down by The Terminator and Kyle Reese but Reese protects her from The Terminator before he kills her. I love the pacing and directing for this scene, it's unbelievably brilliant. Now the second chase scene where Kyle drives away from the cyborg Terminator and explains to Sarah that The Terminator can't be bargained with and can't be reasoned with and doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear and absolutely will not stop ever, until she is dead. Now the scene The Terminator is cleaning himself by cutting through his wrist and wipes his face and eyes but pulls his eye out and use a cloth to clean through his eye patch and as you can see Arnold looks so different when he get the cloth out of his eye and you can clearly see that his eye is an robotic cyborg skeleton. OK, there is a shootout scene after Arnold famously says his memorable favourite quote of all time that many people has impressed and blown away by is ''I'll be back.''  I bet he says that at every single movie he does. And there's a scene where the person says ''Hey, you got a dead cat in here or what?'' and The Terminator chooses the possible response choosing Yes/No or What?, Go away, Please come back later, Fxxx you, axxxxxe and Fxxx you. He chose by saying ''Fxxx you, axxxxxe.'' I even chuckled at that scene. And that it, that's the end of it. I didn't tell about The Terminator killing the wrong Sarah Connor or the ending cause I think you and the audience in the world have already know that movie by heart. Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't talk much in this film because The Terminator is so quiet and keeps in character while filming. That's why his character is so great in this film. Linda Hamilton is great in this so is Michael Biehn and all the actors and actresses who did their fantastic portrayal in this movie. Well, guys, I guess you've all know this movie by heart and James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd did their fantastic job making this film. Even the special effects at the end looks sort of Stop-Motion-ish. I don't know, it looks like it's from the older films like Sinbad and King Kong and all the other dinosaur films. Jeez. Anyways, The Terminator is one of my favourite films of all time along with the others like Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Highlander, Goldeneye, Bird On A Wire and many more. So I guess this is it then. 10/10. Favorite of all time. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

It was definitely one of my group's cult films - and a cult film is EXACTLY where this fits. James Cameron DID orchestrate an extremely smart action scifi flick, especially on such an obviously low budget, with lots of little gems throughout. Arnold is BY FAR the best pick for the killing machine and his classic quotes will never leave me. However, as gripping as this was back in the day, even then I felt the police were a little obtuse in how they just couldn't figure out that there was something occurring that here that wasn't the norm. Where this is a low budget B, I ALWAYS felt that Cameron could have done better in his choice of a leading lady, as well. Where Michael Biehn is fairly believable in his role, Linda Hamilton is rarely credible in her reactions to the hostilities, with an acting range from A to B. Again, I DO realize that this is a low-budgeted action B. I get that and accept for that. I just really wanted to like it more than I did, both in '84 and now. Arnold and the later stop-motion cyborg = great (even with the inexplicable Austrian accent). Supporting cast = decent, but characters are less than bright. Biehn = good. Hamilton = unappealing. Today, in viewing it again, the drawbacks restrict some of what had been heart-pounding action back in 80s. It's still a fun B with great one liners, though. Just not a fav.",

Humans are low and vulnerable as the machines tower above them. The subtlety in Terminator is absolutely excellent. Details that not only foreshadow events in the film, but expected events in the future.\n\nThe action scenes aren't anything amazingly intense. But they are pretty damn groovy. The surprisingly wonderful soundtrack gives massive benefit to the just plain cool chase scenes around American roadways and tunnels. This, combined with Arnie's outstanding performance as the pitiless robot annihilator creates an atmosphere which is not only lined with tension, but is also just...well..cool.\n\nSo many quips in this film, and lingering moments on the terminator as he progresses with abilities. But don't worry, he saves the coolest visual for last!\n\nThere are a few gripes I had with my experience however. One would be that the acting wasn't anything noteworthy or memorable, each actor did their job well (Apart from Arnie who excelled, though more physically than character wise). In addition to this, the lack of dialogue mainly for the first portion of the movie leaves wide spaces of depth for anyone. This includes Sarah Connor which should have had deep characteristic traits for essentially, 'war' earlier than I saw them develop. I guess you could argue that Reece had some emotional impact on that, but with only a few days to develop her reflective mindset from knowing he could just be batshit crazy is a little questionable.\n\nTo conclude though, Terminator is the default 80s action film to go to. Not perfect, but it is solid in pacing, visuals (for the time), action and the concept of man vs machines in a bleak and hopeless future. One definitely for a film-makers handbook.\n\nA-\n\n81/100",

Die Welt liegt in Tr\u00fcmmern, so d\u00fcster wie in den grossen SciFi Meisterwerken der 80er. Es herrschen intelligente Maschinen, um die letzten Reste der Menschheit zu vernichten. Doch sie haben nicht mit unserem \u00dcberlebenswillen gerechnet! Unter der F\u00fchrung von John Connor bildet sich eine Widerstandsbewegung heran. Die Maschinen reagieren und entsenden den Terminator (Schwarzenegger) in die Vergangenheit. Im Jahr 1984 soll der Terminator Connors Mutter Sarah (Linda Hamilton) t\u00f6ten. Die Rebellen aber schicken Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) ebenfalls zur\u00fcck in die Vergangenheit und die finale Schlacht zwischen B\u00f6se und Gut kann beginnen... James Camerons d\u00fcsteres Meisterwerk entstand mit wenig Budget und spielte sein Geld schnell wieder ein. Im Grunde funktionierte The Terminator wie ein \"Midnight Movie\", denn das Publikum machte ihn gross - nicht eine kalkulierte Promotion. Die Kritiker sahen in The Terminator nur einen durchschnittlichen Vertreter seines Genres und wohl niemand h\u00e4tte gedacht, dass Arnold Schwarzenegger zum Star der 80er werden sollte. Schwarzeneggers Geschick bestand eben darin, seinen massigen K\u00f6rper sowie seinen \u00f6sterreichischen Akzent nicht etwa zu unterwandern, sondern zu betonen. Heute gilt The Terminator selbstverst\u00e4ndlich als stilpr\u00e4gend und zog eine ganze Reihe von Nachfolgern nach sich. Die Special Effects waren 1984 bahnbrechend, die relativ billigen Sets hatten eine ungeheure Wirkung! Was gern \u00fcbersehen wird: Der erste Teil g\u00f6nnte sich neben all seinen Action Sequenzen immer wieder Ruhepausen. Idyllische Vorstadtszenarien machen eben auch Camerons Film aus. Nie verliert Cameron das Wesentliche aus den Augen: Seine Charaktere. Sarah wird unverhofft in den Kampf gezogen, ihr bisheriges Leben endet. Zun\u00e4chst vollkommen ver\u00e4ngstigt, findet sie zu Mut und Kampfgeist. Kyle ist der Prototyp des Einzelk\u00e4mpfers, stets bereit, sich zu opfern. Das alles m\u00fcssen wir uns im Szenario seiner Zeit vorstellen: The Terminator entstand inmitten des kalten Krieges, zur Zeit des Wettr\u00fcstens und der Angst vor dem nuklearen Erstschlag. Das Ende der Geschichte kennen wir: Schwarzenegger, mit stoischer Mine und nur einer Handvoll S\u00e4tzen, entwickelte sich zum Superstar. James Cameron durfte ab sofort mit dicken Budgets produzieren. und Linda Hamilton? Sie spielte noch in zwei weiteren Terminators...",

For the longest time this movie was dwarfed in my mind by the awesomeness of its sequel, but now I see that Terminator is a good movie on its own. I love the use of time travel in any plot, and I think they do a nice job of explaining what's happening, but not spending too much time on how it happened. This allows us to just enjoy the story that's being presented, and not waste time thinking about nit-picky details or potential plot holes. It's really exciting watching this tale of an unstoppable machine with a singular focus and the one guy who is bound and determined to stop him. I love all of the action, and the practical effects work perfectly, with the exception of the stop motion stuff that is used for the full-metal Terminator (it's so clunky and takes you right out of the scene.) Arnold is obviously perfect casting because he doesn't need to do much acting, and can just tear right through every scene with his intimidating physical presence. The only downfall of The Terminator is Linda Hamilton. It is my opinion that she was truly blessed to be cast in these movies, because the quality of the movies have somehow tricked people everywhere into thinking she can act. Her performance is AWFUL! If it weren't for Michael Biehn making me care, I'd be rooting for The Terminator when watching this movie. I think she's more tolerable in T2 because she no longer is stuck being strictly a damsel in distress, so there's less whining, but here she's a big turn-off. Otherwise, I find The Terminator to be a brilliant film, and it stands up well on its own without any sequels needed.",

And the relentless, emotionless cyborg who is practically indestructible and will do whatever to achieve his objective without consideration.\n\nIt's dark, suspenseful, and a neatly packed action story without too many extra frills (minus it's one weak point - the forced love story that I could do without, though I did find their interaction in the tunnel as they hid out for the night to be sincere and effective).  It's the ending that sold it for me, though - usually I'm annoyed by false resolutions, but this was done in a well-paced way that didn't drag on, and I found myself pull right back in each time the action restarted.\n\nAwesome movie.

A savior named \"Kyle Reece\" portrayed by \"Michael Biehn\" also time travels back to 1984 to save \"Sarah Connor\". The plot is simple yet incredible. There is neither plot holes nor unanswered questions after watching \"The Terminator\". The acting in this movie is perfect \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\" was born to play the role of \"The Terminator\". And the one-liner that was repeated over and over again \"I'll be back\". \"Michael Biehn\" was amazing playing the role of \"Kyle Reece\". The music in this movie is thrilling to listen to; the climax of the film is incredible thanks to the stunning music composed by \"Brad Fiedel\". \"James Cameron\" did an amazing job at directing this movie, and he was great at filming the movie, there are one or two scenes that could've been shot better but only one or two. The special effects in this movie are superb for 1984 for example the scene where the terminator drives the car into the police station. There is one scene that is very bad, this is the scene where the terminator's eye is damaged and he cuts he eye out this scene is bad. If you are a person who enjoys 1980's Sci-Fi/Action films then you should definitely watch \"The Terminator\" as it is an exciting and incredible movie.

We are talking time travel, car chases, humanity facing extinction, genocidal cyborgs, and of course the always huge, always chiseled, Arnold Schwarzenegger who's biceps alone make this film a must see. \n\tIn the year 2029 humanity is on the brink of extinction, as an artificial intelligence defense system, known as Skynet and its army of machines, has turned against humans, its creators and waged war to destroy all humans, leaving the world in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Humanity, or what is left of it, is now hiding in the shadows from Skynet their one shot, or better worded their \"savior\" is a man named John Connor, who has learned how to beat the machines, a character you never meet in the film, has the greatest importance to the survival of our race. James Cameron does a phenomenal job of giving us a captivating, seamless connection between the pas and future. In The Terminator, John Connor has given humanity hope to over come the Machines, and is the only man that can deliver us from this technological evil. Skynet realizes that in order to crush the humans they must crush Connor, and what better way to do that than send a killing machine or a \"Terminator\" back through time to kill John Connor before he is born.\n\tSchwarzenegger and all his bulking mass plays the Terminator a cyborg that is disguised in human flesh to make it near unrecognizable to our human eye, sent to destroy Johns' mother Sarah Connor. Arnold is absolutely perfect for this role, I am a huge Arnold fan, that being said, i \fknow he cannot act as well as Leonardo DiCaprio but to play and over 6 foot cyborg death machine, he knocks this out of the park. As Schwarzenegger goes through a phone book killing anyone in Los Angeles with the name Sarah Connor while also killing all those in his wake, Schwarzenegger had me convinced he was a cyborg built to kill. \n\tOne would think that all hope for humanity would be lost, what could stop a robotic Arnold whose only mission is to kill?? Well our deliverer, John Connor is one step ahead of Skynet, having learned their evil plot he sends his right hand man Kyle Reese, played by Michael Biehn, to  locate and protect his mother from the Terminator. \n\tWith now two beings from the future one trying to save her one trying to terminate her, Sarah Connor obviously struggles through the movie on the truth, trying to wrap her mind around the destiny of her son whom she has never met. Cameron puts together such an amazing plot and dialogue in the midst of car chases, gun slinging battles, and explosions all equally nail bitting and pull you to the edge of your seat. From car chase to car chase, shoot out to shoot out, the Terminator slowly loses its disguising flesh and we see step by step its inner Robotic exoskeleton which leaves a terrifying image in the viewers mind. Nothing seems to kill the terminator, bullets, explosions, getting hit by cars, in just stands menacingly back up and continues its hunt. \n\tWith such a fear of this machine I began to see the Vision that Cameron had for this movie, which shed such a great light onto the plot and dialogue. as the film takes place both in the movie and in reality in 1984, at a crucial time in technological development. Cameron is trying to give us a reality check in this SciFi film, is there such thing as technology that can be good but bring us to our demise? Skynet was designed to make humanity safe, to protect us, but when technology becomes too advanced how can we control it? A must see for any person that calls themselves a \"movie lover\" all pieces are there to reach just about every audience, but please, dont bring your kids. Bring your buddies for a wonderful ride into Cameron's blockbuster \"The Terminator.\"",

            "content": "Have not always been a big fan of action films, after seeing my fair share poorly made, dull and predictable, sloppily written and badly acted ones that delivers just as little on the action (the worst of Steven Seagal being prime examples. The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.\n\nThe Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.\n\nAction fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

What with the rave reviews from others I thought what better time than to watch.\nDirector James Cameron brought this film to the screen in an era before CGI was used extensively in these films.\nWhat you see is mostly real using models, masks snd make up effects.\nSome of these effects have aged somewhat compared to modern movies but the film is still highly recommended.\nThis film was one of Austrian bodybuilder cum 'actor' cum politician cum 'actor' again Arnold Schwarzenegger's biggest if not the biggest hit however it spawned an even better in my opinion Terminator 2 in 1991.\nOne aspect that made me laugh was how a character called Kyle Reese (sent back to 1984 from a future world in 2027) confidently says that cyborg technology is invented some forty years from now. \nBy my arithmetic that is only 9 years from now? \nI can't see it happening!\nSome of the fashions and nightclub music from the 1984 era seen in the film also made me laugh.\nThe Kyle Reese character is played by Michael Biehn.

            "content": "In many ways CGI has ruined live-action film making. Things may change as the industry advances but, between the early nineties and today, there was no easier way to date your movie than to use computer generated characters alongside real actors. You can see it in modern franchises such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and The Mummy films or go back to the stop-motion creations of earlier eras. These effects do not stand up and hurt the product greatly over time.\n \nI'm so very pleased that The Terminator was made before such technologies became fashionable. James Cameron and his production team outfitted this picture with impressively detailed models, puppets, and other visual effects which have enabled it to remain relevant for new generations of viewers. Watching this film again I was most struck by how good these elements still look and, were it not for some regrettable fashions of the time cropping up, The Terminator would be essentially timeless (as much as a film about time travel and artificial intelligence can be).\n \nThe worst thing about the movie is how often it leans on long bouts of exposition to explain the backstory. The best thing about the movie is, well, everything else. In order to adequately praise the film I must be sophomoric for a moment; The Terminator is just awesome. It's the rare action film which thrills without being over-the-top and displays the grit normally associated with much lower budget projects. It's also unusual when the villain gets top billing, this likely attracted horror fans who, to various degrees, tend to root for the bad guy. \n \nI've always enjoyed The Terminator much more than its bombastic first sequel T2: Judgment Day although the latter tends to garner more attention. The ominous soundtrack fills you with dread and the grim aesthetic always feels more authentically science fiction to me than anything that came after. When dealing with human extinction and an impending armageddon scenario I feel it's best to keep pop music out of it (talking to you, Guns N' Roses).",

Terminator is, at its core processor, an expert level slasher movie. Think about it: Unstoppable killer pursues girl; ill-fated boy helps girl; girl renders killer stoppable. Better than even the best of this monstrous bunch without even technically being in the same genre (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween), the film also boasts a strong whipsmart heroine, instantly iconic villain, and (then) revolutionary time-traveling post-apocalyptic assassin hook. Tautly edited, the story itself is a heart-stopping killing machine of precision-a ridiculously efficient scaremaker. \n\nIn this legendary R-rated flick, an indestructible cyborg - a Terminator (Schwarzenegger) - is sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in a future war against machines. \n\nEven if he never made anything else, Schwarzenegger's laser-sighted steely cool in Terminator makes him a superstar monster for the ages on the level of Lugosi and Karloff. Even in an age when photo-realism has nearly been achieved via computers, look at Stan Winston's brilliant special effects (those are models, people, not all 1's and 0's). Nearly perfect, the wow factor of this film isn't going anywhere. Both star and SFX wizard got hired for their respective roles by writer/director James Cameron, however, which makes their inclusion all part and partial to this visionary's genius-level gamemanship.\n\nBottom line: Pumping Iron Fists",

I'll give him that he's doing something original with special effects in the Avatar films, but for my money the grit and unrelenting suspense of the original Terminator film hasn't been topped by any of his subsequent films. His screenplay for the underrated \"Strange Days\" the probably the closest to the grit of this film and his entry into the Aliens series is probably the closes to being as suspenseful, but \"The Terminator\" really is something special. When you start your film with Arnold putting a fist through a man's chest, you know this film isn't playing by the same rules as other films. And that scene hasn't lost it's impact,  still playing as being wildly brutal. Rewetting it now, I remembered all of the classic lines and iconic action scenes. What I didn't remember was how good Arnold Schwarzenegger was as the stoney faced Terminator. Although T2 was R-rated and filled it action, Arnold and even the T2000 were nowhere as scary as Arnold is in this film. I'd also forgotten how dark and moody the photography of the original was as well. When the film moves to the once dance club, Cameron not so subtlety names his style with the club name, Tech-Noir, mixing science fiction and the moody photography of film noir. Some of the special effects don't quite hold up now, particularly some of the mattes in the future scenes and some of the laser effects, but overall the dated effects still work very well and again help make the case that well done practical effects are just as good if not better than CGI. Overall, this film is a deserved classic that is right up there with \"ET\" or \"Star Wars\" in that it's a great film and also a cultural touchpoint. Oh, and lastly, I have to say that I was always kind of skeeved out by Kyle Reese running around the entire film wearing a homeless man's pants.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as the titular character since his role calls for the acting skills he can provide: the acting skills needed for a robot.\n\nThe premise is simpler than I expected it to be: kill Sarah Connor to prevent the birth of a hero named John Connor. Sadly, there is not much characterization coming from Sarah Connor until the last few minutes of the movie. It is disappointing that the focus of the film is on Schwarzenegger since poor special effects make up the terminator's face once he tears his own eyeball out.\n\nSadly this film is nowhere on the same scale as the sequel, but I guess being made 7 years earlier, this movie was bound to have lesser special effects than the 2nd one. But it is not just the special effects; like Alien being compared to Aliens, this film just has less action due to less extras (in this case, less police) than the sequel, which makes for a less exciting adventure movie.\n\nI didn't mind the movie, but I don't see all the fuss about why this is so iconic. I have more interest in the characters as well as the action in Judgment Day.

The effects seem cheesy by today's standards, but are impressive considering the lower budget. And the movie's impact on modern day action films is undeniable. \n\nIn The Terminator, a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from the year 2029--when machines rule the earth--is sent into the past to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will lead a human rebellion against the machines. One human from the future, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), is hired to follow the cyborg into the past and save Sarah from assassination. \n\nWhile I'm not a huge fan of James Cameron's writing when it's comes to dialogue, he always has really deep premises. And often times I feel as though he casts actors because of their look rather than their acting ability. The Terminator is no different. The dialogue is painful at times, but the themes are still relevant and the narrative is consistent. And Biehn's poor acting is utterly distracting. Luckily Schwarzenegger has limited lines.\n\nI also wish that Sarah and Reese's chemistry had been a little more realistic. It isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Their dynamic feels a little forced and sudden with no buildup. \n\nThere are a few plot holes and paradoxes in the film, but we can't expect anything else from an 1980s time travel film. \n\nAlthough ahead of its time, it comes off as more ordinary when compared to modern action flicks. Possibly because it influenced most of them. But the '80s setting makes for great nostalgia when viewed today.\n\nTwizard Rating: 92",

The results are a fantastic action romp with undertones hinting at the role technology plays in our lives (ironic considering Cameron's increasing reliance on technology to complete his films).

            "content": "'The Terminator' is what you get when a writer/director has a solid idea for a story and a clear vision for what they want to say and just jumps all in; true, other people have written scripts with him, but this is Cameron's baby... Or perhaps not, considering the plagiarism allegations and James Cameron sold the rights to this film for a dollar! But I'm pretty sure Cameron's old agent is now eating his words for saying he hated this idea; even Arnold, who initially auditioned for Kyle Reese, didn't like the idea. With the studios wanting O.J. Simpson to be the Terminator, which certainly would have been very different but probably wouldn't have played out well in the headlines, given what happened and where would the film series have gone if that did happen? You might wonder why the Terminators look the way they do, and Cameron thought the same thing.\n\nNevertheless, this film is about as iconic and influential a film can get with its larger than life ideas right down to its characters. The film has an absolutely excellent and relevant concept and is perfect right from its opening battle sequences, with its smart and iconic opening titles all the way until the ending credits. You might wonder how a human could beat something like a Terminator but the way the film plays out, there are quite a few surprises in store and it just adds to the tension. I just like the little nuances characters were given to make them stand out, like when Kyle Reese held up his gun in a playful way to the children, that little bit there just added to his character and they all have things like this. I really did like how Michael Biehn portrayed Kyle Reese; he gave him such depth and really made him human, vulnerable and emotional, and made an action hero the way they should be, relatable. \n\nThe story honestly gets quite touching at some points, and some of the twists to the story are quite sad, I also don't think I've ever seen dream sequences used as effectively as I have in this film. You might think there are some plot holes with the time travel elements but they unravel the longer the film goes on and work with the world that has been set up in this film. You might think that someone knowing too much about their own future would cause issues but, honestly, any change they make would most likely be good because the future in this world is so horrible anyway and besides that was the whole point of going back in time in the first place. It works in its circular loop, predestination paradox, and they explain them with its many twists and turns and they explain them even more in the future, I'm sure it was a surprise to those who saw it when it was released. Hell, they even explain why he wears sunglasses in this film, but just becomes a trademark for the sequels. The film has an excellently chosen cast and they are all perfect in their roles, most of which will work again with Cameron in the future, even Bill Paxton in his very small role, of which, would they really mess with someone that looked like Arnold? I kind of thought Sarah Connor would believe what was going on when she herself noted that the Terminator keeps getting back up after being shot, but her scepticism makes sense, clearly.\n\nThe tone of this film borderlines on horror, the imagery and just pure eerie feeling that this machine will stop at nothing to kill a person is perfectly captured, the film is very well crafted and has a perfect build up of tension. The sequences at the end with the Terminator are very effective but it did seem odd that the effects for it got better as time went on. The cinematography is great and very wide, giving a clear shot of the action, the film also has a feeling of film-noir to it with some of the shots, one of them is when the camera is below the Terminator but given the angle and lighting, we can see his red eye underneath his glasses. There was also a scene that takes place in a night-club with 'noir' in the title. We also have a shot that zooms in on a toy truck that's about to be run over because of course, foreshadowing perhaps? But it also has the iconic skull-crushing moments as well. The soundtrack is also incredibly iconic but it is also very unique as well, I really like that we do not hear the entirety of the theme until the end credits, it cuts off right before it gets any further in the song than the opening, it is a nice little touch. The theme perfectly captures the feeling of desperation of fighting for the future, well done Brad Fiedel. The action is memorable, relentless and has many spectacular set-pieces. The film also has many jokes that were written on purpose to fit the concept, like, 'in 100 years nobody will care', '...you're talking to a machine...' and '...dying for a shower', I thought the motto shot, 'To Protect and Serve', on the police car was funny, although apparently the police cars have two and sort of goes on to be somewhat of subtle a running gag for those paying attention. It's funny to think the famous one-liner was originally written as, 'I'll come back', but the film has many great one-liners, of course, and they are awesome, I did think that a fight would happen after what he said to that cleaner, but no. But it isn't just Arnold that gets all the one-liners to say either. \n\nIt'd be nice to say that this was James Cameron's debut film but we have another David Fincher situation going on here, however, like in that situation, I'll take note of what the directors say and this is his debut, it's his vision and this is his film. It is also, as of this review, the only film of his to not be nominated for Best Visual Effects, go figure. Also there is a really long time between each sequel, but it's better to wait and put care in and I like that the sequels aren't just big jokes where they take the iconic things and just play them up. 'The Terminator' is an action classic that has smart themes, pulse pounding action, heart and just that little bit of humour to add up to a defining action masterpiece. When the film was wrapping up, I just had a big smile on my face; this film was directed so well. I've seen it many times before and I'll continue to see it many times after.",

Now, I'm glad this film happened because T2 is one of my favorites and a true classic, but this film was awful. I'm not talking about the VFX or the time traveling inconsistensies - I don't really care about that. But every aspect of this film is really just from mediocre to even less. The characters were so inconsistent and all over the place, especially Sarah Connor (and man, the line delivery timing in this is either incredibly awkward sometimes or just plan off), just like the writing and the directing. SO many moments felt so forced (like the cliches...). There were some really dumb moments and characters, like the jump scares (the only acceptable one was the one at the end, but the Kyle one on the officer in the initial chase - WHAT?!?!), all the extras were so poorly acted (I'm not asking for great acting from them; I just don't want to notice it), every single scene was an assault on logic and sense (the character inconsistencies and logical flow of the events and the characters), and there is not enough violence to justify it as a \"just fun action film\", especially because it takes itself so seriously.

Especially with everything leading up to the new film which comes out on Wednesday but given my busy schedule, it will probably be Saturday when I watch it in theaters and review it later all in the same day. The Terminator franchise has always been one of my Top 10 Favorite Sci-Fi series of all time. Mostly because you have time travel, murderous robots, friendly robots, a savior trying to prevent an apocalypse, and Arnold F@CKING Schwarzenegger! And most importantly is that the real battle does not begin in the future, but rather in the past where 98% of the action takes place. So for those of you who have never seen any of these films let me tell you what the overall premise is for the first one. In the year 2029, robots and humans wage an apocalyptic war with each other and Skynet's ultimate solution is to send a Terminator back in time to 1984 and kill Sarah Conner, John Conner's mother and future leader of the human resistance. However John Conner sends his top soldier, Kyle Reese, back in time to save Sarah Conner and try to kill that Terminator in the past. Now that I got that out of the way, does it still hold up today's standards?\n\nAbsolutely! Mostly because this is a time period film even though they filmed this back in 1984 which makes sense. It is a real pleasure to watch when keeping a real perspective. The action scenes are good, but today's film goers might see this as a little tamed. It is a thinker's movie where it shows a very bleak outlook on the future of the human race. The visual nature itself really enhances the mood with everything being all dark and painting a really gloomy picture of humanity slowly going down the crapper. It is pretty much in the style of a certain film noir which is called Tech Noir. Which is also a smart little Easter Egg in here if you haven't noticed already. They set of the film is also like a horror movie where the Terminator is a monster killing anyone named Sarah Conner, taking a lot of abuse and keeps on killing, and just when you think it is all over he surprises you with one last scare. The stop motion effects make it a lot more robotic and terrifying. Overall, this movie is something that I HIGHLY recommend however it is not absolutely required in order to see the second one. But the way I see it is that everything needs to have a beginning and this is the foundation for it. Which is why I give it a perfect five out of five stars.",

With a small budget compared to his other projects he still manages to crank out a very fast paced and entertaining action thriller with cool effects that resembles B-status movies. The Idea of our own technology turning against us, their makers and takes over the world in the future asks clever social questions about technology and our use of it, which is really relevant still. This has been praised over and over, and really places this film a bit over others within the same genre because of that, which I think it deserves. Arnold is also a genius casting, with his big muscular body and an accent so ridiculous it must be a bi-product of the machines production of these cyborgs. His job was really to act like a bad actor, really neat. James Cameron directs this smartly and subtle at first but with an explosive conclusion. The acting isn't really great but you shouldn't expect anything else from this film because it isn't out to achieve that. After repeated viewings I have also noticed that it is pretty funny and can be seen as a action-comedy, but a good one obviously. This film is fun, smart and generally really well done and is really one of the true great action films ever.",

            "content": "Rating-7.5/10\n\nThe Terminator, the name emits a kind of weird thought of Arnold Schwarzenegger or maybe the name John Connor(usually pronounced in an Austrian accent). Whatever Terminator themed thing that comes to mind, this film will no doubt leave you feeling well enjoyed and engaged, in a way that many action films just fail to do. \n\nThe film is interesting, and again you don't always get that from action movies but the Sci-fi is good enough to combine with the good action to make this exciting and very fun. I found this intriguing in a sense, the story is kind of predictable then also un-predictable at the same time, and that makes it both humorous yet very serious and the suspense is well done too. The ending is the best part about this, this gets better as it goes along and for me the very end is one of the most exciting moments in this entire movie.\n\nYou know Arnie is the best remembered actor of this film, but not for good reason, sure he is good but don't forget about the others here though. Michael Biehn is firm as Kyle and he makes the serious moments, just that bit more serious. Linda Hamilton isn't always great here, probably the weakest of the main \"good guys\" but she still acts kind of well, just maybe not the best for a leading actor. The cast is picked well there is no doubt here but Arnie to be fair is the real memorable person, he commands his scenes and the lines he is given are at times, gold.\n\nNow James Cameron I do feel is overrated here, I know I know how do I think he Is overrated but let me get this out straight, although he is good, as is the film as a whole, I don't think it is a masterpiece. Now Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd create a script that is solid, and it works out well, but I do feel his directing can be a little too, well crash and bang, sometimes scenes get a little too fast and the fighting is too quick to be seen, although all together as said before, he is good.\n\nWhy do I think this isn't a masterpiece?, well it comes down to this, now it is unique it's way of being made however, I watched this years later, I have been influenced by other films, so maybe to fully love this, you'd have to go back to 84. I do though, feel this is special, in a way in which this plot is still to this day, never been re done to a good quality, and I mean that because Sci-fi films want to emulate this, but they can't or people will know.\n\nThe fast pacing of this movie makes this easy to like, and it is important because again, not so many action films do this well or make the action fast but well made(but as previously mentioned, not all the action is seamless). The Special effects are a little crazy at times, when the movie starts to go to the future, the space ships are insane and the props are actually kind of funny, of course effects weren't as good in the 80's so a bit of credit to the team behind.\n\nAll together though I do find this good and although maybe my rating doesn't reflect my full opinion on this, it still tells this is a film nearly everyone likes, even if just a little. It is hard to hate this movie I admit, I mean I didn't try but finding holes in this is fruitless, just sit back and enjoy a bit of movie history.",

And Arnie is flat out scary here, he truly seems creepily, frighteningly inhuman and relentless and the iconic actor plays it with far more nuance and detail than he's really given credit for, his Terminator really is a frightening force. Also never quite as highly rated as it should be, Brad Fidel's fantastic score.

It is very engaging, the part where, Kyle Reese tells these stories, thinking he came from a future world. He was sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor, the most important character in this film. Yet here comes the Terminator, a cyborg from the future to terminate Sarah Connor portrayed by a very strong looking Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold is a bad ass cyborg, he portrayed it very well in a manner which feels, he is really a living cybernetic organism. With straight forward one liners, it is almost funny at times.

But I really dig the lower down, dark, sci-fi horror vibe of the original (it is a knock on every movie in the series that came after T2 though).\n\nSchwarzenegger as the titular Terminator is inspired casting. Firstly, any restrictions he had in acting ability back in the 80s are brushed aside by the fact that he's playing a cold, unfeeling machine. And can you imagine someone who looks like that coming after you? Forget the fact he's got an arsenal in his back pocket, forget the fact that he's got a near unstoppable metal exoskeleton, Arnie is already a machine! Being hunted by that man would be terrifying, and you feel that in the performance of the leads.\n\nThe Terminator is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I have seen - a lot.",

Terminator is a really neat future noir that takes place in the past. Typically when you watch a pre-Terminator sci-fi you can tell that it's sci-fi right away. They always have little eccentricities about them, but not Terminator. Everything about this movie seems more realistic than all other sci-fi. Even the time travel and machines seem real because the movie doesn't ask you to believe in those things, instead it only asks you to believe that such things are maybe possible. I can believe there are machines in the year 2029 right now plotting to come back in time, but once you start going into any kind of details you'll lose my suspension of disbelief. That's all the movie asks you to do. The special effects here are awesome for the time. The Terminator is a robot so the jerky motion of the stop animation makes the machine actually seem animatronic. But the highlight of the film are the post-apocalyptic flashback scenes. The story is very inspired. Since the advent of computer technology there's always been technophobes, and for good reason. I would rank artificial intelligence up there with the atomic bomb as possible doomsday scenarios. Personally, I don't believe computers can ever become self-aware, but a programming error can easily produce the same results. Terminator is one of the best cyberpunk action movies with an important message.",

            "content": "What kind of a world would we live in without The Terminator? I created Arnie, it sky rocketed the careers of James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and Stan Winstone, it took practical effects into overdrive and would also create one of the most sought after franchises in movie history. With iconic 1 liners, an outstanding score, a solid cast and a decent story, this film noir/sci fi/horror/thriller/action movie finds us following the life of Sarah Conner, a young waitress who just cant seem to catch a break. Sarah soon becomes the center of attention, when a cyborg, sent from the future is on a mission to kill her and the only thing stopping it is Kyle Reese, a man also sent back through time to protect the leader of a revolutions mother. Its got time travel, gore, action, car chases, stand out practical effects and a non stop, edge of your seat pacing to it, that literally defined a generation. Arnie plays the bad ass killing machine to a T, literally this is Arnold's stand out role, he plays it with such perfection, using his build and rigidity to great effect. Michael Beihn is also excellent as Kyle Reese, the rogue warrior sent through time, to protect Sarah and warn her of her future. Equally Linda Hamilton is also great in this film, however upon comparison with her character arc in the films sequel, this pales in comparisson. There is a lot to like on offer here, James Cameron has a talent for creating stories, where he falls down however is his clunky dialogue and his ham fisted attempts at character layering. However visually his images are so strong and boast a story you can easily get behind, its extremely hard to penalize the film for this reason, of course the writing could be better but the same could be said for more than half of the movies ever committed to cinema. The action sequences are tense and full of punch, Cameron's strengths lie in directing and here he is, in all his glory ramping the experience up to 10. Each moment Kyle and Sarah's life are in danger, you cant help but feel yourself clenching or shouting at the screen. His edits and shots are tight, exentuating everything needed and its this aspect that really sells the movie and its overall scope. For a first film, this is undeniably a huge project to undertake and knowing that you have another massive franchise depending on the success of this film, Aliens, hats off to Cameron for delivering in almost every category. Although it wouldnt be till T-2, where he eventually would get to really flex his sci fi muscles and allow the scope to broaden. For all its merits, of course there are issues, in fact, there are a lot of issues. If Kyle doesnt get sent back, John Conner would never exist, thus throwing the film either completely into turmoil or into a parrallel universe. If this is the case how often has this scenario happened, how differently does it always play out. The film also asks you to suspend disbelief, yes in the fiction but in character relationships. Almost 5 minutes after meeting Kyle she is 75% convinced he is telling the truth and a day later the couple are madly in love, yet again highlighting the massive plot hole surrounding the entire film. The film also has some dated effect work, granted its all practical and majoritivly stand up, the occasional stop motion moment here or rubber mechanical hear there kind of jolt you out of its immersion. The film also has one of the worst and comical musical sex scenes ever committed to film EVER! Thought Watchmen was bad, oh you aint seen nothing yet. All these things however are side notes if your willing to take the ride, and if you are, it really is one hell of a ride. It is full of tension, atmosphere and thrills, although lacking in a small human element, mainly due to poor dialogue, the story and characters are enough to see it through and although not as powerful as T-2, its difficult to think of another film that really committed such a powerful influence on sci fi even to this day and beyond. Roll on Judgement Day!",

It is very engaging, the part where, Kyle Reese tells these stories, thinking he came from a future world. He was sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor, the most important character in this film. Yet here comes the Terminator, a cyborg from the future to terminate Sarah Connor portrayed by a very strong looking Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold is a bad ass cyborg, he portrayed it very well in a manner which feels, he is really a living cybernetic organism. With straight forward one liners, it is almost funny at times. The robotics in this film are top notch from it's time. I thought Cameron pulled the trigger for innovation. Very well executed action / sci-fi films of all time. Cameron is just a genius.5/5",

            "content": "Original and classic sci-fi action\n\nAfter hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'.\n\nA mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.\n\nKeeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays.\n\nRATING: [4.5/5]",

To this day, the special effects are quite impressive, the film's energy lasts for the entire running time, the story is still intriguing, and it's never goofy.",

Do i agree with everyone after re-watching the film? Well yes and no. Now of course the good in the film is that: iconic characters like Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are done VERY well, the effects are done FANTASTIC for a movie with a 6 million dollar budget, the premise of a robot send back in time, while has been done to DEATH thanks to this film, manages to still holds up very well even for 1984, the backstory on Judgement Day told BRILLIANTLY by Kyle Reese, and of course 'The Terminator', thanks to Arnold's bulky acting (though was it really that hard in the film to find a killing machine that sounds and also is taller than any normal human?). Though issues such as some its noticeable dated effects, acting from the other characters (even Sarah Connor), and Cameron's uses of camerawork keep me from enjoying it more than T2 and others who liked it. But overall, its still a film to definitely re-watch or see if your not a fan.",

I was a little unsold on Sarah and Reese as a couple - I think I liked the first half of the movie more than the second - but it made sense for the story. And then there's the great action sequences, which delivered consistently.\n\nThere was a lot I liked about the pace and overall feel of the movie; it's fast-paced, of course, but the first half proceeds in a logical way, taking its time to show the Terminator and Kyle separately becoming acclimated to their surroundings before jumping into the \"Sarah and Kyle hide\" plot. It was cool to see the Terminator proving how badass he was over and over again, from pulling out his own eye to wiping out an entire police department.\n\nWhen I mention overall feel, what I mean is that this movie feels like a prequel in a lot of ways. You can imagine a preexisting movie about John Connor leading a resistance with his friend Kyle, and a sequel/prequel in which Kyle goes back in time, falls in love with Sarah, and closes the loop. It's very smart, and the ending leaves the story open to continue in the sequels that follow.",

            "content": "\"The Terminator\" is two things that are very good to be: a movie that is of its time, and a movie for all time. From the opening minutes it is almost fetishistically contemporary. A superimposed text says the events of the film take place \"tonight,\" a rather hokey tactic, most often seen in the horror genre, that may create a sense of immediacy for some first-run viewers but that becomes increasingly ironic as time takes its toll on the fashion, the music, the hair, and so on. \"Terminator\"'s first act is an onslaught of such tell-tale signs of the time, and the time in question is peak 1980s. This is not a bad thing. The movie so successfully captures the spirit of its era that later movies set in its milieu often appear to be, and in many cases undoubtedly are, copying it. It wasn't the first movie to take place in fume- and trash-filled urban alleys and neon-lit dance clubs, or to feature independent women who do things like have sex and ride motorcycles without prompting censure or even comment, but it was arguably the best and best-looking and most influential movie to do these things at this time. In other words, it is an icon of 1980s film.\n\nIt is also an icon of film generally. It accomplished that even grander feat through a combination of brilliant achievements. First, the casting, particularly of Arnold Schwarzenegger. His early movie career benefited enormously from the existence of roles that nobody else could have played quite as well. Conan the Barbarian was a near-Neanderthal: strong, serious, a mythic figure of great stature and few words. The Terminator is the same, though he kills for different reasons. Arnold is menacing, darkly funny, and extremely cool in the role, all at once. Second, the script. It serves timeless lines on a silver platter for Schwarzenegger and the other two leads, and they all three seem to know exactly what to do with them. They take soundbytes and throw them at us like sticks of dynamite, and when they land we feel them. The best are \"Come with me if you want to live,\" \"I'll be back,\" and \"You're terminated, fucker.\" (The last one is another reminder that we're in the 1980s, a long-ago time when action and sci-fi movies were sometimes made for adults, not just teens. The language here is strong, the violence is not all bloodless, and the sex is very much on- screen.) Third, a time-travel plot that is unusually well thought out, capable of being communicated without too much belabored exposition, and that leaves plenty of room for further exploration without raising too many unanswered questions. It is strong conceptual ground on which to build a media empire.\n\nLike 1983's \"WarGames\" (which also featured a motorcycle-riding female lead), the central idea in \"Terminator\" is that computers might one day destroy humanity. Unlike \"WarGames,\" which approached the subject from a software angle and took its cues from real programming concepts, \"Terminator\" casts a tangible piece of hardware in the role of unstoppable stalker killer. This leads to perhaps its only real weakness as a movie. Toward the end, as plot recedes and special effects (mostly stop motion) come to the fore, it begins to feel too much like the horror movies that it echoes in its opening text. The false endings that typify that genre are as predictable as ever, and the Terminator becomes just another riff on Michael Myers. But if the penultimate scenes are derivative, they are nevertheless satisfying, and the film ends on a note that provides closure and leaves you eager for more.",

It is one that will always remain special to me as it has given me one of the greatest experiences of my lifetime,an experience that makes my life a better place.On behalf of my opinion and that of  others I think this film should be in the \"top ten greatest films of all time\" list and should stay there for the rest of eternity.More than a legendary masterpiece!",

Secretly Arnold wanted to play the Terminator. Secretly, James wanted Arnold for the Terminator. Both left the meeting not knowing that they were TOTALLY ON THE SAME PAGE!!! Thank God they made their feelings known because what we got was an instant Sci-Fi classic. One of those movies that redefine the genre or Hollywood in general. Arnold was now a household name and on his way to becoming the biggest action star of all time. James Cameron would be on his way to be the biggest Box Office director of all time. And this movie is one helleva ride. From the very beginning when Arnold and his naked stuff fuck up a couple of punks, one played by Bill Paxton. James loves having Arnold beat up his buddy, Bill. I've always thought Michael Biehn should've been a bigger star because Kyle Reese is a badass and father of the savior of the Human race. Linda Hamilton's performance is lost in all the machismo but she just may be the toughest person in this flick. Hamilton balances the sweet innocent terrified little girl who eventually delivers, thru gritted teeth, \"You're terminated, fucker.\" Throughout the movie we can actually see her evolve from that little girl to the tough as nails Mom to John Connor, the man who will save us all. When the somehow superior sequel is released 7 years later, Sarah Connor is a completely different person and it is completely believable. \"I'll be back.\" Yes he will, for a fifth time next year.

It all flows well, it keeps you on edge and makes you feel that fighting back against the Terminator is utterly hopeless.  The Terminator kills anyone who gets in his way, and does so always in a badass fashion with him constantly shooting bullets into someone.  Sarah Connor is now a well know name thanks to this film, and this is also the film that started Arnold's true fame.  The end scene is tense where the upper half of the machine chases after the slow traveling Sarah Connor.  The very end is cool, with things happening that the future John Connor knew and told about.

            "content": "Failing to appreciate a movie with 100% critical consensus makes me feel like a dope and a dumby, but I guess I have to own up to that. I am told that Terminator is a perfect expression of plotting and cinematic technique, and I really just don't have enough insight into how movies are made to appreciate those aspects. Terminator wasn't a flawed movie, to me: it does what it sets out to do well and without any of the myriad hangups and mistakes that make modern action movies bloated and absurd. Nothing stuck out to me as unusually tasteless or bad, but nothing stuck out as enjoyable or creative, either. The movie is just flat. \n\nJames Cameron had a nightmare about a malicious metal endoskeleton bathed in flames and Terminator is just that dream made into a movie. The plot and premise have plenty of interesting potential, but the execution feels like it's just going through the motions. There are no characters to speak of, and they don't have any real interactions that go beyond exposition dumps and an unearned sex scene. Kyle Reese should be astonished by practically everything he sees in the (to him) Utopian world of the 1980s; instead, he simply does his job as robotically as the Terminator. Since we have no characters to invest in, the action scenes have no real tension. \n\nI was also just unable to buy in to the flashback scenes. The blue lighting is just too stylized and ugly to my tastes, idk. Why is everything blue in the dystopian robot apocalypse?\n\nThe direction and cinematography may be efficient, even perfect, but what's the point if there aren't any memorable moments, interesting concepts, or striking images?",

            "content": "Ignoring his directorial debut: the god awful Piranha 2: The Spawning, this film is the big breakthrough of James Cameron as well as Arnold's most famous character and the one he will be remember for. The now iconic, classic, often imitated and beloved sci-fi movie \"The Terminator\".\nIn the year 2029, nuclear holocaust happened, humans are in a war against the machines that are lead by an intelligent defense network called \"Skynet\". Skynet decides to send a cyborg assassin named \"Terminator T-800\" to kill the mother of the leader of the resistance, before he is born, but the humans send a soldier to protect her. A battle between this two, starts for the life of this woman, whose fate could change humanity's destiny.\nWith an intelligent and creative premise this film has a strong script that changes genres, it goes from sci-fi, action, suspense  to a kind of slasher film modernized. Cameron proves here that he can do a solid film with a low budget. The pace is well balanced, it goes from being on the edge of your seat to time were you can take a break from the suspense and relax for a while. With  special effects that now are dated, I believe that helps the film now days in the suspense/scary portions (for example: Arnold's  makeup in the bathroom scene) but some may have problems with them now days. The acting is solid, each one the main characters being credible in their part. My big complain is that despite a lot of memorable scenes, the film doesn't have a memorable climax, I even forgot what happened to one particular character at the end.\nArguably the best of the franchise, it is an amazing film that still is as awesome as it was in 1984. A must see film.",

He's consistent: he doesn't blink, he keeps a straight face for two hours on screen, and actually sounds like a robot without any technical assistance. \n\nThe action will ensure you do not blink either! It's a lot of running, ducking, crashing, shooting and overall, plenty of fun. \n\nForget storytelling, it's an Arnold-whatshisname movie with guns and style. (I'll keep the fifth star for the even better sequel though).\n\nThanks for listening, \"I'll be back\" with more awesome reviews.",

            "content": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is not a good actor by any stretch of the imagination, but he is a star, and he did have a uncanny knack for picking projects that were a good fit for his talents. The Terminator is arguably the best example of this, and could you picture anyone else playing the part as well as he did? He's just relentless as the cyborg sent back in time to kill the mother of his enemy. Focused, seemingly unstoppable, and genuinely intimidating as he goes about his murderous mission.\n\nJames Cameron's Terminator is an action science fiction flick that works on a lot of levels. Certainly it's a great action film, but it's also a love story. There's an element that looks forward to the future, and wonders if our reliance on modern technology will ultimately be our undoing. But it's all told as part of an entertaining yet simple plot about saving the future in the past.\n\nBeing that this was Cameron's second full length feature film and given the limited budget available, it's not totally surprising The Terminator is a little rough around the edges. The visual effects are mostly decent, but some of the makeup effects looked less than convincing even back in 84.\n\nThere's plenty to enjoy here though, from the solidly staged action and the chemistry between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. The score by Brad Fiedel sets the perfect tone for The Terminator, and the animatronics and stop motion sequences at the end of the film are very effective.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is a violent science fiction film so expect a high body count and plenty of action. If action and science fiction are your thing, you should have fun with this. This is gritty, dark and violent with very little humor to break up the tension.\n\nBest Format:\n\nI think a regular DVD or streaming show will service this film well enough. The HD copy I watched further exposed the limitations of the makeup effects. It's still such an iconic film though, so if your local theater were screening it you should try to make that show.\n\nBest moment:\n\nI loved the first time all the key players in this story get together in the Tech Noir club. The initial build up filmed mostly in slow motion has a kind of dreamy quality about it and then - BANG - Resse (Michael Biehn) unloads on the Terminator and the chase begins!\n\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Impressive considering that he barely speaks, but I guess that makes every sentence he says that much more significant. No wonder he is one the front cover of the movie despite not being the main protagonist. I can imagine this sci-fi action movie was innovative for its time and the now shoddy looking special effects and tacky chase scene soundtrack would have suited the 80s era. James Cameron does do a good job maintaining high adrenaline throughout and the plot is ahead of its time. It would most likely have breached the four star barrier if I had viewed this a decade ago before the action movie genre had developed. Alas, I do not possess the ability of the Terminator to go back in time and so I must, perhaps unfairly, judge it according to my modern perspective.  Three and a half stars is a reasonable score though and fingers crossed it'll be enough to prevent Arnie from coming bk from the future and blowing my brains out to stop me ever writing this review.",

            "content": "Often touted as one of the most influential and greatest science fiction movies of all time, \"The Terminator\" still holds up very well after 30 years, 3 sequels (one of which is one of the greatest action movies of all time and one of my favorites), a TV show and much more.\n\nThe story is classic science fiction involving a robotic assassin sent back through time to kill the mother (Sarah Connor) of the future human resistance before he's conceived. Following the terminator is a member of the resistance sent to protect Sarah and ensure her survival. Its the classic story of the battle between good and evil but its much more than that. Its also a coming of age story of direction-less young woman and how she gains the courage and resolve to face the unknown future. Also the film serves as a metaphor of what happens when our own creations turn against us namely the machines. Of course stories like this are clich\u00c3 (C) at this point but \"The Terminator\" handles it very tastefully which helps keep it fresh.\n\nThe performances are nothing short of remarkable, especially the iconic performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the relentless, unstoppable killing machine which jump started his career as an action movie star. The guy was perfect for the role with his build and robotic tone of voice; even his iconic line \"I'll be back\". Linda Hamilton in an early role gives a believable performance as the direction-less Sarah who's character goes through a great arc. Michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, the man sent back to protect Sarah.\n\nThe special effects in this film show their age but considering the nearly 7 million dollar budget and the fact that CG wasn't even around yet, I'm willing to let that pass. Besides, there's some really great camera-work and editing in this film. For instance, when Sarah is at a night club at one point in the movie both the Terminator and Kyle are there looking for her and when the terminator sees her, the action slows down in motion and the music in the club is replaced by the threatening terminator sound which intensifies the scene. And the soundtrack which is 80s synthesized music also dates the movie but the original \"Terminator\" theme is still iconic because when you listen closely it sounds like a metallic heartbeat which fits the tone of the film but I digress.\n\nBecause of the success of this film, James Cameron went on the map as a filmmaker and went on to make other great films including his own sequel that surpassed the original in so many ways. But if it weren't for the success of this film we wouldn't have \"Terminator 2:Judgement Day\".",

You can't get any better 100%. One might be inclined to ask, \"How could the public like T2 better, but T1 gets a superior 100% freshness rating?\" The answer is simple. The freshness percentage is weighted with the opinions of \"film critics\". These are people who review film for a living, and that is why The Terminator has a higher freshness than Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

It was the launch of the successful career of director James Cameron (Aliens, Titanic), who also made the even better sequel 'Terminator 2: Judgment day'. This movie became an instant classic and has it all: suspense, car chases, shootings, romance and even a touch of gore, placed in a well build storyline. I really like to dark rawness and effects in this film. Starring Linda Hamilton (Dante's Peak), Michael Biehn (Aliens, The Abyss), Lance Hendrikson (Aliens) and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Predator) in the most memorable role of his career (with only 18 lines to say). Watch this movie if to want to live! \n\n2029. Humanity has nearly been extinguished by robots who took over the world. Only a small group of rebels lead by a man called John Connor dare to oppose these machines build by Skynet, a once artificial intelligence system developed for military purposes. When a Terminator cyborg (Schwarzenegger) is sent back to 1984 to assassinate 18 year old Sarah Connor (Hamilton) who will be Johns mother, the rebels decide to do the same and select resistance fighter Kyle Reese (Biehn) to protect her. Coming naked into Los Angeles, they both go and search clothes and weapons.  \n\nWhile the Terminator uses the phonebook to find and kill all Sarah Connors (apparently a common name in LA), the real Sarah is leading her boring life as a waitress. Tonight the young woman is going to a nightclub, so that her roommate has the apartment to herself and her boyfriend. When the Terminator shows up, he kills both of them, but realizes he has the wrong person when he hears his target on the answering machine.  Arriving at the nightclub, the cyborg sees the real Sarah and opens fire. Will Kyle be able to save Sarah and humanity's future?",

Made with a low budget, this film's visuals look remarkable, and the tension is kept high throughout, although some of the aspects of the film seem to come together all too suddenly, most notably, the understated romance between Sarah Connor and her guardian angel, and other aspects that leave us feeling cold. But the most impressive element and really what in the long run makes the movie is the perfect casting of Schwarzenegger as the monotone and indestructible killing machine, a role which not only fits him incredibly well but also lets us get a glimpse of the action superstar lending himself to a rare role as a meanie and comfortably letting loose a chilling side of himself often restrained for the sake of playing the hero.",

Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton play great together but the obvious nova of the movie is of course Arnold \"the Terminator\" Schwarzenegger. In his first scene naked Terminator looks intensely over the Los Angeles almost as if he knew what was about to come. Well in the film his character did knew but I'm talking about Schwarzeneggers career and life. The story of the movie is quite simple, a manhunt with sprinkle of scifi and romance. It's just so well put together thanks to James Cameron. Music also plays a role in every production and here it fits perfectly with it's mechanical beat and and somewhat dull tone. So all in all still an enjoyable movie. I'm hopefull of the new Terminator movie but I also know it will never outstand the original Terminator. Until then as Mr. Schwarzenegger would put it, \"I'll be back\".",

            "content": "I didn't know James Cameron wrote and directed The Terminator, can't say that I'm surprised because only a genius could have created it. The Terminator is early on in Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron's careers' and this movie put them on the map, or at least made them bigger stars. James Cameron created a world of time travel and the inevitable end of the world with a war between humanity and machines. What could possibly go wrong? The answer is nothing.\n\tArnold plays the terminator, a emotionless, flat, cyborg, killing machine that has one goal, terminate. Arnold was a perfect role. He obviously has his accent and amazing physique and he probably has fifty lines in the movie and he is intimidating. The special effects done to his face when he is part human and part machine is done really well. The only flaw in the effects is the shots when the actual machine is walking on a green screen. In all honesty it looked awful and took me out of the experience but for its time it was acceptable. The character terminator itself was scary and godlike to say the least and the only reason this movie wasn't a ridiculous robot going on a killing rampage was the story behind it.\nIn the year 2029, or something close to it, a man named John Connor is the leader of the human revolution and he gets word of a terminator going back in time to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother, to prevent John from being born. Ok, so let's start with the idea of time travel. Brilliant, I love it. It makes me think and wonder what happens next. I could go on a rant and rave about time travel and how it messes on my mind but that's for another day. John Connor has a counter and sends one of his best men, Kyle Reece, to the past to protect Sarah Connor.\nThroughout the movie Reece gives bits and pieces as to what happens in the future and how the machines take over humanity. The bits and pieces were awesome, it didn't overwhelm me with information and it kept me invested in the story. The back story is incredible and the universe James Cameron created is commendable. The only real downside to the story is the lack of characters. Reece is a good character but I wasn't a huge fan. His acting was a little flat and I wasn't fully invested n his character. There was something about him that rubbed me the wrong way. \nThe action in the move was really cool. The Terminator is basically invincible so seeing Arnold get shot rapidity and watching him throw people through windows was awesome. The car chases were done well and the best scene was easily when the terminator tears through the police station and says the famous line, \"I'll be back.\" Nobody realized it then but that quote is imitated by everybody at least once in their life, even if they haven't seen the movie. Arnold's voice and the way he acts on screen is so unusual but effective. This thing clearly isn't human and Arnold does it perfectly. People may disagree with me on this but I'm saying it now, Arnold as the first Terminator is better than the T-1000. \nI really liked the character Sarah Connor. She is the most important character and she is portrayed really well. She is a normal girl with a normal life just trying to get by. She is a waitress and a lot of people can relate to that. As 'm writing this now I am a waiter so I know. Sarah Connor is a character people sympathize with so nice work, Cameron; you know how to write a main character.\nThe relationship between Reece and Sarah is cute to say the least. The way their relationship builds is very believable. If you have seen enough movies you can figure out the end of the movie and what happens to each character but when I first saw it I had no idea what was going to happen. Looking back I should have figured it out but that's the magic of movies. \nOverall, The Terminator is a classic in my opinion. I loved the movie and the depth behind the story. Arnold was born to play this role and James Cameron was born to make brilliant movies. The two of them together is a powerhouse that couldn't possibly fail. The Terminator without a doubt gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

It's dark, gritty, raw, and bleak; presenting many thought-provoking philosophical questions and social problems, such as: Can advanced machines become self-aware? Is the future set or do we make our own future? Are we doomed to inevitably destroy each other? And etc. While those questions are all open to interpretation, there's no question that this film is fantastic. The Terminator was shot on a shoestring budget of only $6.5 million and therefore, the team had to get creative in presenting this complex science fiction tale. Thanks to director James Cameron's keen eye for detail and creativity; as well as Stan Winston's brilliant set pieces and effects, most of which still hold up pretty well even today, truly bring their combined vision to life. Despite being already both an action and sci-fi film, The Terminator is also ingeniously a horror film, often going back and forth between the action elements and horror elements seamlessly in order to display its darker and bleaker themes through Arnold Schwarzenegger's gripping portrayal of The Terminator. Speaking of Schwarzenegger, he plays the merciless killing machine known as T-101 and just steals the show, using few words and solely relying on his emotionless but intense facial glares, imposing physical stature, and robotic movements to convincingly portray the character. Michael Biehn gives the most powerful performance in the film, evoking a real sense of danger and potential destruction (and it's rather unfortunate he didn't do much after this because he's a good but underrated actor). Linda Hamilton is a perfect example of a ordinary person caught in an extraordinary situation, amounting to much more than just a helpless damsel in distress that her character could've easily been. All and all, The Terminator is a classic in the action/sci-fi genres and is, in my opinion, James Cameron's best film (as well as one of my favorite films of all time).",

            "content": "Way before his scored big with TITANIC and AVATAR, Canadian born James Cameron was a struggling filmmaker who had a nightmare he had about an invincible metal skeleton robot coming out of a fire and was going to kill him, and it gave him the idea of creating a 70\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horror slasher type action/sci-fi movie called THE TERMINATOR. Set in 1984 Los Angeles, a human looking but unstoppable cyborg assassin (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back thru time from the year 2029 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton, whose future son is the leader of the human resistance against the machines, while another being, a human resistance soldier name Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), is also sent back thru time to protect her. T2 was the 1st one I saw, but I would never see T1 till I was probably nine years old. Although I liked the action, I think of this movie as more of a horror film than an action film because of the look of the movie and the way Arnold Schwarzenegger played the Terminator was creepy but awesome. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting is that he was originally offered the role of Kyle and Cameron almost picked a fight with Arnold about the role, but he immediately changed his mind and thought he was much better suited for Terminator. I'm a sucker for old fashion movie making because I love how they made this movie by using stop motion control for the climax of the film. And that the great Stan Winston took Cameron's idea and make it come to life. I love Terminator 2, but I do like The Terminator. It is an 80's classic!",

            "content": "One of the greatest and most influential action films ever made, The Terminator is a brilliant, bleak sci-fi adventure, and is backed up by a simple, yet terrifyingly effective role by Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, and impressive visual effects and action sequences that continue to impress just as much as it did nearly 30 years ago when it was first released. This film is about a man from the future, named Kyle Reese, who is sent back in time from the bleak post-apocalyptic future of 2029 to 1984 to protect a woman named Sarah Connor, who is the mother of the future leader of a human resistance group, from being terminated by a cyborg named The Terminator. The pacing of this film is so fast and well executed that it's hard to catch any mistakes or flaws throughout the film (if there are any at all), and there is barely any moment where my heart wasn't pounding thanks to its non-stop thrills. The atmosphere is gloomy and chilling, and has a feeling of threat and suspicion. The action is great, with groundbreaking visual effects for its time, leading to a huge amount of intense suspense and fear of the fact that the lives of these two main characters are constantly threatened by an indestructible cyborg that is ravaging the city in search for them. The soundtrack is also great, and has a very epic feeling that perfectly fits in with its setting and atmosphere. Arnold, who gives what is probably his most iconic role, does a very good job at portraying a seemingly simple but very chilling villain that doesn't care how he completes his goal, but if he completes it at all. Everything works so well, and is a great example of what is sorely missing from most big-budget action blockbusters. This is a classic, imaginative, and mesmerizing movie with that works perfectly on every level, showcasing some of the best action and thrills ever put to screen.",

A fair trade, I'd wager. It's a perfect example of this innate ability Cameron has that really defines his career. The guy can somehow lock onto certain visual and story elements that just resonate with audiences, portraying them in the clearest, biggest, most exciting way possible.

The Terminator's a smart movie. I'm glad I waited so long to watch.\n\tEvery character is watertight. Prominent or minor the acting's often what retains the captivation in between gunplay and chase scenes.\n\tThe cops are Traxler and Vukovich, played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen (a.k.a. Bishop from Aliens), and have a humorous dynamic. Sarah's roommate, Bess Motta as Ginger, is the sexy bouncy type, and her boyfriend's a well-meaning dummy. Kyle Reese (played by Michael Biehn) is withdrawn and serious.\n\tHow about Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor? She's such an ass-kicking delight, her likeness is still utilized twenty-four years later in Fox's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The show ran for two seasons and stars the pinnacle of underrated actresses, Lena Headey.\n\tTalk about a crowning accolade for Hamilton's performance.\n\tAs a standalone, the story is very good and there's almost no need for a sequel. Although the ending lends itself to continuation, it's not necessary.\n\tThe movie's greatest weakness is the same mistake made by other science fiction films like Escape from New York and Event Horizon; meaning a drastic underestimation in regards to the timeframe. The scenes that take place in the future are supposed to be set in 2029. There's a number of technologies I doubt we'll have within the next fifteen years.\n\tLaser ammunition, synthetic skin cells and advanced artificial intelligence aren't around the corner.\n\tOh. And there's time travel.\n\tBut this is a silly topic of discussion, because the plot's 'self-contained'; the rules allotted to the story's universe are adequate enough. An artificial intelligence develops in 1997 that learns at an exponential rate, making allowances for the suspension of disbelief.\n\tThe irony is, the film unfolds a lot like a horror movie. I'll get more into that later on.\n\tFor now, all I'll say is that The Terminator is a classic must-see film in the same manner The Great Gatsby's a must-read novel.\n\tThose without a hand in the air should stop reading here, because the rest of the review will contain spoiler-heavy analysis.\n\tNuance abounds in this movie, and it's illustrative of the intelligence packed into every detail. Much of what occurs resonates thematically with the overall narrative. \n\tFor example, the recording on the girls' answering machine states, \"machines need love to,\" which obviously foreshadows Sarah's eventual encounter with the Terminator. It's also ironically commenting on the relationship between man and machine, and the eventual fate of humanity.\n\tAnother detail akin to this is the name of the club where the Terminator finally locates Sarah. The name is Tech-Noir; which is a touch of self-referential humor. The filmmaking resonates with noir themes, and the subject matter's heavily rooted in science fiction.\n\tIt's self-contained because of the limits established by the timeframe. In 1984, a Terminator would indeed have to look through the phone book for every 'Sarah Connor' and kill them off to ensure its mission's accomplished. It also establishes conceivable distance between the protagonist and the pursuing threat.\n\tThe audience can accept humanity's resistance to obliteration against seemingly insurmountable odds when considering ideas like utilizing dogs to detect terminators.\n\tAs for the special effects, most hold up quite nicely. And there shouldn't be any problem for a sophisticated viewer, given the context in which it's made. There is obvious use of green screen on set, and some devolved CGI, but for the most part everything's on the up-and-up.\n\tOkay, let's dive in.\n\tTimeline A is the history Reese returns from, which includes all events up until 2029. Timeline B is the realm in which the film unfolds, Earth in 1984.\n\tPresumably, the John Connor of Timeline A didn't descend from Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor, right? A terminator didn't arrive in Timeframe A's 1984 to attempt the same assassination?\n\tI'm assuming Timeframe A becomes separate from reality; whatever that means. And Timeframe B will continue to unfold into an altered future.\n\tThere appears to be no residual effects from the changing of history yet. No chaos or collapse; which is nice.\n\tI suppose the only real alteration this has on reality is the splitting of John's lineage. He'll now be fifty percent A and fifty percent B.\n\tI wonder if the sequel will cover the issue of reconnecting the loop; specifically, when history B reaches 2029, even if there's no such thing as terminators, will Reese have to travel back in time to impregnate Sarah again?\n\tMy brain hurts.\n\tAnyway, the reason I say it unfolds like a horror movie is the impending doom that's constant throughout. Sarah encounters terrifying scrapes with death around every turn. I don't want to reiterate the whole plot, but consider the odds constantly stacked against her.\n\tAfter escaping the police station and literally everyone dies, Reese blasts the membrane off the Terminator's metal skeleton and dies to blow its legs off.\n\tYet its torso continues to crawl after Sarah and is only crushed by the pneumatic press as his fingers claw at her face.\n\tThe protagonist's terror is stretched to the utter limit, time and time again.\n\tFor those of you still holding an arm in the air, feel free to lower it now.\n\tIf nothing else you burnt some calories today, and learned two things about yourself.\n1.\tYou're easily manipulated. And...\n2.\tYou have exquisite taste in movie reviews.",

            "content": "From the school of science fiction that doesn't need to be over-complicated, The Terminator is  near unrivalled in terms of horror sci-fi.  James Cameron's Aliens warm up movie is a relentlessly brilliant chase that uses slasher movie conventions to create an intelligent action movie that stand outs from the crowd.\nA robot, or Terminator that looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back in time to kill a woman, Sarah Connor, who will go on to give birth to the leader of the human resistance in an apocalyptic war against the machines.  The resistance send back a human protector for Sarah in the form of Michael Biehn. It's a simple premise but one which works wonders in the hands of Cameron.\nThe Terminator was perfectly cast with regards to its two lead male roles.  Schwarzenegger has never played to strength quite so effectively since, as he's usually been in the good guy role but as an unfeeling, monosyllabic cyborg killer, he has arguably never been better.  His movements are slow and definite, precise and cold.  When it comes to playing robotic, Arnie takes some beating.  The portrayal of The Terminator draws parallel with the slasher movie killers that had been popular at the time.  There is more than a touch of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers in the coldness of the character, stalking and killing anyone who gets in their way.  This was something which the subsequent Terminator movies lost the feel of but it's quite chilling at times here, combined with the synth heavy score.\nMichael Biehn's Kyle Reese is a much slighter character.  There's an intense vulnerability to Reese which makes him immediately likeable and a great hero.  Biehn is possibly one of the most underrated character actors of the 80s.  Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor gives good helpless victim but her performance isn't a patch on what she would do for Terminator 2 but it suffices here.\nThe film's action is confined largely to gun fights but the couple of chase sequences that Cameron has crafted are extremely excited.  As far as pure tension goes, the final half hour of The Terminator is first class, right up there with the best.  The other ace that Cameron plays is giving his audience tantalising teasers of a war torn future which is magnificently detailed.  There was a whole other movie waiting to be made here.\nThe Terminator was a simple film taken to a grand scale.  Fusing the elements of sci-fi and horror with an unforgettable villain, it touches on genius and can fairly be called a classic that while it has dated, remains a true great.",

Un misto tra fantascienza, action e scene dalla tensione alta come in un horror (quando all'inizio terminator cerca le sue vittime, anche l'inquadratura e' da film horror). Di negativo c'e' che il film e' invecchiato, non tanto negli effetti speciali (step motion e maschere di gomma a palla ma di buona qualita'), ma nell'ambientazione generale fortemente anni '80. Altro punto negativo le scene ambientate nel futuro: si vede che sono girate in studio e sembrano uscite da un film di basso budget e non mi sono mai piaciute anche quando lo avevo visto la prima volta da bambino.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the \"Terminator\", an expressionless, merciless killer (not unlike the villain in many slasher films) that you just can't keep down while Linda Hamilton plays a woman that is totally overwhelmed but keeps her cool and Michael Biehn plays a soldier that has a lot of heart. The film has a lot of smart, subtle references, like the answering machine message stating that \"Machines need love too\", the revelation that in the future machines have betrayed man but dogs (man's best friend) plays a new role in man's survival, the strong differences between \"Kyle Reese\" and \"The Terminator\" both of which have a man's body, but only one of which is truly a man and more. The one-liners are great and very quotable, the visions of a post-apocalyptic earth are disturbing and there is a lot of good tension during the numerous chases and shootouts. At some points the low budget of the film shows and because the film is so well known it'll come as a shock to many people that everything isn't seamlessly blended but it never detracts from the story. It's a great film that you shouldn't miss even if you're not a fan of science fiction or horror. (Dvd, January 17, 2013)",

            "content": "It sure is funny how memory plays tricks on you.  I can tell you in which theater I saw the way ahead of its time Terminator back on initial release in 1984 (ironic that: 1984); and yet my memories of the film itself are shaded by a veil of \"man that was awesome\".\r\n\r\nIn viewing the film now, almost 30 years later, one can't but notice the cinematic conventions used to get around things like budget constraints, the lack of blue screen and of course, ironically, CGI.  That James Cameron succeeded so well in showing us things that hadn't been seen before is a testament to his filmmaking craft, (like the very first Star Wars film, which from the opening sequence was one big Wow, ain't seen nothin' like THAT before).\r\n\r\nSo, does this iconic film still stand up?  Overall, yes, even though the story, the pace, in fact the entire genre has been done to death - but yes, so much of it stems from this fountainhead of a film.  Note Cameron's use of close up and focus on an item, like a gun or knife, so that he can cutaway from the action without having to try to show you things that couldn't be generated yet.  His editing and pacing are superb here, and funny thing - as much as I dislike car chase scenes, so much of the film is just that (probably some of the weaker moments, really) - and it is within these car chase scenes that the film shows its age.  The squeeling tires as police cars burn rubber - all so very dated now, just as the sound effects of same (obvious film \"sweetening\" done in post production, and again a budgetary and technology issue).  Also, look at how Cameron used a shot of the skeletal cyborg's feet as he climbed the stairs in pursuit of his prey - pretty nifty, you only had to place the fake feet on the steps and move them from above camera - instead of creating CGI to show you the action... this is yet another example of how a true filmmaker gets around his limitations.\r\n\r\nBut regardless, the film is just like its main character: relentless.  So very little time to catch your breath (like Aliens in that regard).  \r\n\r\nOf course there are a few picadillos to consider - first and foremost is why a cyborg is speaking with a heavy Austrian accent - but who else would you have cast for the part?  Arnold is so perfect, and this is the film that gave him iconic status - even though he only says about 100 words in the entire piece.  This is Arnold's film, make no mistake, even though the heavy lifting is ably done by Michael Biehn (who later showed up in Aliens) and Linda Hamilton.  On the side you have the perfect minor role of Lt. Traxler (Paul Winfield), the tired and yet still sharp policeman who puts together that someone is systematically killing off all the Sarah Connors.  His interplay with Lance Henrickson (who later went on to star in the wonderful and underrated TV series Millennium, as well as playing Bishop, the cyborg in Alien; another Cameron film), is so effortlessly acted that it's a joy to behold.  (Another interesting side note: Henrickson was originally tabbed to play the title role, but then Arnold came along...).\r\n\r\nAnd talk about flashbacks - those hair styles!  Yikes!  Then the technology on display - clunky phone recorders, pay phones, huge video machines - wow!  \r\n\r\nIn viewing this now, 30 years later, and since I knew the story and how it all played out, I had time to think - which I didn't back at the U.A. 6 in 84.  Things that make you wonder - how a computer AI wouldn't have been more imaginative in trying to achieve its goal.  I guess that is part of the charm, and again, a product of the non computer world of 1984 - assuming that a machine would simply take the immediate goal in front of it instead of processing the information and reaching a better conclusion (although Cameron did display a certain algorhythm in the scene where the landlord asks if there's a dead cat in Arnold's room - Arnold's HUD shows \"possible responses\" including the priceless \"fuck off\".  However, it occurred to me that while Arnold was chasing Connor and shooting the hell out of the back window etc., that a cyborg should have been aware that the best way to disable a fast moving vehicle would have been to shoot the tires!!!!!  Dumb machine!!!!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this was a nice trip to the past - and while some of my warm and fuzzy memories of this film were tripped up, and the film hasn't aged as well as I would have hoped, it still entertains.  If I were to go back in time and review it in 1984 it would surely have gotten a 100 rating, but here in my jaded present, an 80 is still nothing to sneeze at.\r\n\r\nOh, and before I forget - here's an interesting tidbit; during the credits it states that Cameron and producer Gale Ann Hurd wrote the screenplay - and then there is a disclaimer that some of the \"concepts\" for the film were provided by Harlan Ellison.  This made me take notice as Ellison will always be in my memory banks as the writer of perhaps the best Star Trek episode \"City On The Edge of Forever\", as well as the cult classic film A Boy And His Dog.  Turns out that Ellison really had nothing to do with Terminator, but sued Orion claiming that some of his short stories outlined the concepts used in the film - the solution of course was a settlement and inclusion of the little disclaimer - hooray for Hollywood attorneys!",
