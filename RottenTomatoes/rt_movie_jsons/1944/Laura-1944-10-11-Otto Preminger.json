    "summary": "In one of the most celebrated 1940s film noirs, Manhattan detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates the murder of Madison Avenue executive Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) in her fashionable apartment. On the trail of her murderer, McPherson quizzes Laura's arrogant best friend, gossip columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) and her comparatively mild fianc\u00e9, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). As the detective grows obsessed with the case, he finds himself falling in love with the dead woman.",

            "content": "An All Time Classic. The acting is really good. This is very dialogue heavy but well done dialogue nonetheless. Everyone can come across a bit robotic but still well done, that is until Tierney shows up. She is phenomenal in this, I just wish she was in it more. The cinematography is phenomenal with excellent camerawork and great shadow usage. the music is extremely well done also with great remixes throughout of the title track that is very catchy. The editing is excellent and the pacing is very good. The only knock is during the times we don't focus on Laura it can be a bit robotic and dry at times especially if there is no music. But the story is really clever and keeps you guessing the whole way and never drags in terms of pointless scenes. This is something everyone should see once for sure.",

Nevertheless, as so often happens, the chase is better than the catch; the mystery might have been intriguing, but it's not great, as evidenced by the mundane payoff. As a romantic drama, \"Laura\" lacks the patient character-building that would keep it from turning into an ordinary, unrealistic melodrama.",

            "content": "Laura, an adaptation of Vera Caspary's suspense novel, the film Laura had many issues in development including the ultimate replacement of director Rouben Mamoulien and cinematographer Lucien Ballard with Otto Preminger given director credit and Joseph LaShelle for cinematographer. The film plays like a murder mystery film but has many twists and turns and is one of the great achievements in the film-noir genre. Although the film only has a handful of characters, all of which are potential suspects, it utilizes a unique script to keep the viewer guessing and never complacent in their suspicions. I won't ruin the film's story or character details but this is something that must be watched to be truly appreciated and analyzed. The use of lighting and the usual trademarks of film-noir are here as well as the haunting score and the film remains an intriguing and psychologically complex film, even now 70 years later after it's initial release. The recent Blu-ray release restores the film's original 87 minute running time which had been cut to 84 minutes for television. If you like film-noir or simply a great and complex mystery film with equally complex characters and wonderfully dark and moody atmosphere, Laura is one of the finest released!",

We are drawn into the mystery of the film from its very first immortal lines, and are virtually guaranteed to remain transfixed until the final passion-filled moments. Clever plot developments coincide with the simmering underlying themes of romantic frustration and the intractability of kindred spirits. To relish this film is to celebrate the beauty of the noir genre at the apex of its allure.",

This is the problem with noir movies - you don't give a shit about the characters. That makes it very non-relatable and in turn uninteresting to watch. You don't feel like investing your time in the story. It wasn't till the very end that things got interesting - because it ended. Lmao! Here's the thing.

Perhaps Preminger's greatest film.  My only question is  why two apparently gay men are deeply in love with a beautiful woman? But of course that is not the point, their idea of \"Laura\" and what they want from her transcends narrow interpretations of sexuality. It is perhaps more about narcissism and possession than sexuality. Anyway, who cares, the ride is everything.",

And it is more a mystery than a noir, just an engaged and slightly dark one. What really sets the film apart is not the performances (again, apart from Price, who just demands your attention with his acid tongue), but its exceptionally good pacing, dropping hints consistently without revealing more than is necessary to keep the audience engaged. Even the melodramatic threats of matrimonial infidelity are given some actual weight with the shadow of mortal consequences hanging over the characters' shoulders. The romantic obsession of Andrews' McPherson is rather unnecessary to the plot as it turns out (and instead of securing a much-sought-after murder weapon he leaves it for tomorrow because plot), but he's still a well-suited protagonist. Just a solid film that still has plenty of entertainment value in the modern day. (4/5)",

It's quite brilliant with amazing writing from Vera Caspary's original novel. All the intrigue, obsession, scandal, and romance are all major hints to the dark truth behind Laura. Preminger's meticulous direction lets you see all the cards and clues, so that you can certainly solve the puzzle before the finale with many Red Herrings along the way. Joseph LaShelle's cinematography gives close-ups on objects of interest and holds the camera on suspects with searing suspense! Louis R. Loeffler's editing cuts sharply from each person as necessary for a brisk 88 minutes all about Laura.\n\nFred Sersen's visual effects look real with a natural charm to them. David Raskin's score is excellent with both unnerving suspense music with dreamy romantic symphonies within Laura. Bonnie Cashin and Sam Benson's dresses and Guy Pearce's make-up for Laura is as lovely as the adorable Gene Tierney. Her character Laura Hunt is talked about endlessly and her performance is fascinating. Her nuanced acting gives you all manner of clues due to her standoffish body language and curious misleading dialogue. She's a cool femme fatale, you cannot help but love. Gene Tierney could play any part and her Laura is phenomenal.\n\nDana Andrews delivers a believable quiet tough guy with a softer side as Homicide Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson. He's intimidating when he doesn't talk any nonsense, all while feeling realistic and sympathetic for the victim. Clifton Webb is entertaining as the fast-talking narcissist critic Waldo Lydecker. Vincent Price is outstanding as the suspicious and sympathetic Shelby Carpenter. Price could play any role and he is impressive as the other man. Judith Anderson is fantastically enjoyable as Ann Treadwell.\n\nIn short, Laura is a must see mystery for its intricate story, told beautifully by Otto Preminger in his prime.",

This one also zips by on damn fine performances from pretty much everyone in the billing block, with Dana Andrews and Clifton Webb inhabiting their respective characters especially well. The ending is a tad abrupt and it's not as though the 88-minute running time leaves you begging for a swift wrap-up or anything, but, then again, I've definitely seen worse endings in other films of its ilk. Overall, this was quite the welcomed shock; one I sincerely recommend for any film noir fan who's somehow avoided it up until now.",

I love how this first act functions to both give us exposition but also help us see how the characters interact and why any of them might be the culprit. Then there are a few surprises that I\u2019d rather not spoil, but they change the story as it was presented and create even more suspicions and motives than before. I have to applaud any murder mystery that gets my mind running in circles trying to guess whodunit, and suspecting every character. It\u2019s a marvelous story, and one that I can\u2019t wait to watch a second time now that I know the truth in order to pick up some of the subtle clues along the way. The cast is superb across the board. Each one has moments where they seem sneaky and suspicious, with other moments that make them appear kind and gentle. Clifton Webb is perfect as the highly literate mentor of Laura. His pride shows in every scene but you can still sense his affection for her. Vincent Price is someone I\u2019ve always thought of as intimidating and kind of scary from his other roles, but here he proves his range by playing a relatively spineless kept man. I could keep going on and praise Judith Anderson, Dana Andrews, and Dorothy Adams, because they were all great. However, the real shining star is Gene Tierney. She is not just stunning to look at, but also plays a wide range of difficult scenes with ease. Her ability to make the audience care about her while still wondering if she\u2019s done something wrong puts us right in the middle of the movie with the detectives. If there was any nitpick or complaint I would make against Laura, it\u2019s that the affection Detective McPherson forms seems sudden. Perhaps there is a passage of time that is greater than what we witness on screen, but it feels rushed for him to be so attached without even meeting Laura. I can excuse it, because I also felt a connection with Gene Tierney just from those flashbacks, but the depth of feeling did grow at a rapid pace in the movie. Otherwise there\u2019s very little I can criticize in Laura. The visuals are stunning, and the dialogue is smart and witty. I also loved how the whole thing fit the tone and style of a film noir, but it resisted falling into all the traditional tropes. At times noir can become predictable when it sticks to the formula, but this was smart and unique. As I said before, Laura is a movie that I\u2019m already anticipating my next opportunity to watch it. Everything about this movie clicked for me, and it could become a favorite with time.",

I couldn't believe how pristine this 1944 print looked, as if it'd been shot yesterday.  That certainly adds to the experience.\n\nBefore the movie even starts I'm seriously intrigued by the preview, a detective on a murder or missing person case is falling in love with a girl he's never met because she's presumed dead.  Everyone has had something with this Laura, she's quite the grab.  I'm still a little confused about Shelby, who Laura was to marry, and his relationship with that other woman.  At first I thought she was his mother, but then it seemed like she was his girlfriend or wife and just totally going along with his wanting to be with Laura.  Needless to say, it added to the dynamics and entertainment value.\n\nThere's lots of flashbacks, piecing things together, trying to make sense of what doesn't add up.  Once again, Joseph LaShelle makes Preminger's staging look perfect, noir lighting that isn't as shadow heavy as other efforts - it's a cleaner picture. \n \nLaura lived pretty well, made a decent penny.  And now detective McPherson is moving in to her abandoned shelter... for the sake of the investigation of course.  I always say that ghosts exist whether a person is dead or not, because what someone leaves behind has an aura, and her essence is still in this room, as McPherson experiences.  He touches her things, sits in her furniture, feels his world the way a method actor would gain sense memory.  When halfway through the film we get our major twist, I think he's dreaming.  But I'm glad he's not, it would be terribly unsatisfying.  This is what now carries the movie forward: Laura is alive.  And from there a conspiracy is unraveled that's a bit fuzzy in my memory.  But it was all enthralling.  Gene Tierney has to be one of the most beautiful women I've seen in front of a camera from the 1940s, it's no wonder there's something about her.",

Now I knew about this movie, but by name only.  My true film education is working my way through the list with my wife, and once again, it refuses to disappoint, giving me yet another satisfying movie that was previously absent from my database.  One thing I enjoyed about Laura is that it is actually pretty funny.  It's a serious subject matter, but this has a snappy script, and these are characters that can turn a phrase.  It's in the same vein as The Maltese Falcon, and you're trying to figure out what happened in this story just as much as this detective is.  I like how fluently the dialogue flowed, but it was never at the blinding tempo as something like the screwball comedy His Girl Friday.  It even starts off like a buddy cop film, as our protagonist detective has one of the suspects tailing him around as he conducts investigations (strictly doing research for his writing, of course), and there are a lot of different things going for this movie.  To top it all off, this has a fantastic twist at the midpoint that I quite honestly did not see coming.  You want to crack this case, and when there is a love triangle involved, nothing is easy.  Everybody is a suspect, and you'll be tempted to take your own notes, and see if you can pin the crime on the right person.

Dana Andrews is equally excellent as the detective determined to solve her murder while falling in love with her and Clifton Webb is superb as her witty & mysterious mentor.  Of course, Vincent Price also gives one of his best performances (his daughter, Victoria, has called this film one of her favorites) as Laura's shady fiancee, and is a nice remember of his early career when he was a young adonis.  Behind the camera, Otto Preminger crafts a twisty, stylish mystery that keeps you guessing at every turn, along with a killer twist in the middle.  What's great is that Laura is never who she appears to be, thus throwing suspicion even towards her.  The production is also gorgeous, particularly Joseph LaShelle black & white camera work, which rightly won a Oscar.

A lot of the film seems like a boring love triangle drama - make that a love square consisting of Laura, Detective McPherson, the film's brief narrator: Lydecker, and Carpenter. Naturally, each man offers something different to Laura and each has his own flaws. Unfortunately, none of these romances is developed well enough so we never know which one is supposed to be the focus of the story.\n\nThis conflicting love triangle is one of two stories in the film - the other focusing on the question of who attempted to murder Laura and why. If the film was more devoted to this mystery rather than the underdeveloped romances Laura has with different men, this may have turned out to be a very tense film similar to the repertoire of Hitchcock. Luckily this film is saved from being below decent since its conclusion is tense and to the point. No falling action in this film, leaving it to end on an exciting climax.\n\nI plan to revisit this film in the near future to make sure I did not miss something which would make this film great.

When we meet her, in the form of Gene Tierney's doe-eyed teeny bopper, she doesn't quite deliver the goods. Preminger sees her as a quietly pretty Dorian Gray but, in this genre, with all the men running rings around her, she needs to be more of a sly Lauren Bacall.\nLaura is the central subject of the plot, but Tierney becomes faceless and forgotten in view of Clifton Webb's stiff, manipulative Waldo; the movie's real narrative agent. Even an un-moustachioed Vincent Price suppressing his signature drawl has more stage presence than poor little Laura.\nThe film's melodramatic plot is characterised by a peculiar air of carelessness, which only adds to the intrigue, and Preminger's picture is, in every which way, a smouldering slow-burner with bags of character.

The terrific cast of supporting actors including Clifton Webb and Vincent Price are incredible, helping to keep the mystery of who shot Laura suspenseful, complex and confusing.\n\nThe film is a masterful example of film noir lighting and use of shadow. The music is, of course, on of the loveliest pieces ever composed. Laura is truly a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"I shall never forget the weekend Laura died. \"\r\n\r\nWhen watching TCM's The Essentials, I never know what to expect. I've seen classic films that are either worth the acclaim or those I believe to be overrated garbage. So when I found out about this murder mystery titled Laura, one that I had never heard of until this year, I had no idea how it would turn out, especially when hearing the difficulties the film had behind the scenes, such as changes in direction, casting, and its ending. I was unfamiliar with the work of director Otto Preminger, but after hearing that his films challenged the Hay's Code, it sounds like he was a pretty good filmmaker in his day. As for Laura, what could have been a cheesy, forgettable B-Movie ended up being a well-made film noir, and one that I would call an essential.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening quote, it is established that the well-respected Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered. With that set up, an investigation is called out, led upon by detective Mark McPherson (Dan Andrews). Off the bat, the case has quite a few suspects, such as columnist/mentor Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), Laura's suspicious fianc\u00e9e Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), the wealthy Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson), and Laura's hysterical maid Bessie (Dorothy Adams). But the more Mark gets into the case, the more complex the issue is, and obsession starts to play in, and then... if I told you, then it wouldn't be a mystery.\r\n\r\nRobert Osborne, TCM host and film historian that I deeply respect, stated on his show The Essentials that Laura is in his list of the Top 10 films of all-time, revealing that it's the heavy suspense and twists that always draws him in every time. And I admit, there's some very strong uses of plot twists scattered throughout the movie. But the film's weakness to me is the fact that, for me at least, figuring out who the murderer is is quite predictable, and I felt it weakened some of the twists, cause I was able to figure it out in the first 10 seconds of the picture when I first saw the actor's face. However, it doesn't mean that I was disappointed in the film. No, in reality, for a film that I had only heard of in a small amount of time, I was actually impressed with how well-made the film was.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the film work for me are its acting performances. I knew that both Vincent Price and Judith Anderson were great performers, and while both aren't really the highlights of the movie, their appearances were still enjoyable to watch. Gene Tierney, an actress I had never heard of until watching this movie, is great in the role of Laura, considering she didn't have that much screen time, as her character gets murdered. But what I saw really impressed me, and I'm surprised I had never heard of her until now. Dana Andrews impressed in his role as the detective. But the true standout is Clifton Webb as the mentor. An old man obsessing over an attractive young woman is something very complex to discuss in a movie, and Webb does it brilliantly. He has the most memorable dialogue, and I strongly believe that if Webb was not involved in the film, the film wouldn't have been that engaging. Nuff said. \r\n \r\nConsidering how the film was only intended to be a B-Movie, the film could have been a whole lot worse. With filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock arriving on the scene, Laura could have been a very cheap imitation of what Hitch did best. But with some compelling cinematography, David Raskin's haunting score, and some enjoyable twists along the way, Laura, while nowhere as strong as other film noirs, such as Sunset Boulevard or The Bad and the Beautiful, is still a film I would consider an essential. Plus the ending is flat-out brilliant. Otto Preminger, I think you have gained another young movie fan.\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, Laura. Goodbye... my Love.\"",
