    "summary": "In this classic film noir, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) gets roped into a murderous scheme when he falls for the sensual Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who is intent on killing her husband (Tom Powers) and living off the fraudulent accidental death claim. Prompted by the late Mr. Dietrichson's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), insurance investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) looks into the case, and gradually begins to uncover the sinister truth.",

            "content": "The Hays commission made the studio re-write it several times because it went against their overly moral code.  What did we get, something that makes no sense.  He's an insurance investigator who also sold policies.  Because he goes to her house to talk about them missing payments on their policy.  Now grant you they just met, it's even the same meeting.  Where she goes, \"Wanna help me kill my husband.\" And only like two hours later he calls her saying, \"Okay.\"  Plus it's quite obvious that Phyllis's husband is rich as fuck.  Unless she has a prenup it makes no sense to go for insurance when inheritance.  Considering prenups didn't exist until the 1980s.  Other than a catchy title, it makes no sense.  It would have made a tiny bit of sense that these two were having an affair and didn't want to risk divorce which would keep her from getting anything.  But I'm guessing that was in one of the drafts that the Hays commission rejected because all movies were made for children in the days of the Hays code.   No version would have made sense but the version we got was the dumbest version.",

A dead man ostensibly is killed falling off the rear of a train onto the roadbed, but has no bruises from landing on massive wooden ties? Coroner fails to pick up on that?  On the other hand, our protagonist and narrator has nary a scratch on him from the actual encounter with said roadbed.  Miss Stanwyck is fine as the manipulative monster, and it's interesting to see Edward G. Robinson playing against type as the Good Guy, but it's hard for Boomers to see Fred MacMurray as a stone killer rather than the 1960's suburban single father.  I'm sure I wouldn't be spoiling anything to mention the obligatory for the time Crime-Does-Not-Pay ending.",

Robinson as a claims adjuster whose job is to find phony claims.\n\nDouble Indemnity is one of those classics that I have never seen before now and I am so happy to say, that even when my expectations were high, the movie still blew me away. Billy Wilder is one of my favorite directors, with movies like the Apartement and Some Like it Hot, Double Indemnity can be added to that list. The movie stars Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, who both give incredible performances, however I can't deny how great Edward G. Robinson is as Keyes. The movie is edited to perfection and looks gorgeous in black and white. The story itself is smart and takes you in directions that you might not expect it to go, with an incredible opening scene that sets the tone of the movie. This is another classic movie that I absolutely love!",

            "content": "The double entendre comes swiftly out of the gate in the film noir classic, Double Indemnity (1944)!  Fred MacMurray plays slick insurance salesman Walter Neff.  Mere minutes after meeting sultry Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck), the wife of one of his clients, Walter is letting it be known that he's enjoying his time with her a little more than just professionally.\nPhyllis:  \"There's a speed limit in this state Mr. Neff, 45 mile an hour\"\nWalter:  \"How fast was I going officer?\"\nPhyllis:  \"I'd say around 90.\"\nPhyllis may play the part of a lady, but in reality she is a true broad in every aspect.  She's well aware of her wiles and more than comfrtable using them to her full advantage.  Walter imagines himself a very clever chap, but he's soon caught in the web of deceit that Phyllis spins. \nWhen the film begins, Walter shows up extremely early at his workplace.  He's injured and immediately begins recording a confession into a dictation machine.  His confession becomes the narration upon which the rest of the film is revealed through flashbacks.  His tale begins with his first time meeting the aforementioned Phyllis Dietrichson.  He's immediately smitten with her and becomes empathetic as she spins her tale of being trapped in a loveless and abusive marriage.  Before long, he's assisting her with secretly obtaining a life insurance policy on her husband.  As his affair with Phyllis intensifies, Walter soon finds himself helping her in plotting her husband's death.  Once the \"accidental\" death of Mr. Dietrichson occurs however, Walter's boss, Mr. Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), soon begins to have suspicions about it and about the large payout that his firm will be forced to pay out to the widow Phyllis.  Walter's cat-and-mouse tale quickly begins to unravel as he tries to maintain his affair with Phyllis and his employment with Mr. Keyes.  As a keen salesman, Walter had imagined himself the ultimate player, but he's now found himself as the one who's been played.\nThe dialogue is rapid and sharp, capturing the sort of gumshoe zeitgeist of the period.  Nearly every single sentence Walter utters to Phyllis ends with \"baby\"!   All three lead actors are at the top of their game, with Stanwyck receiving an Oscar nod (one of 7 Oscar nominations the film received in total).  Her portrayal of Phyllis is superb as the layers of her character are peeled back slowly and deliberately.  The pacing is superb, and even though we know Walter ends up injured, we still don't know how everything will play out until the very end.  Adding to the film's brilliance is the incredible score by Miklos Rozsa accompanied by the cinematography of John F. Seitz.  Seitz's use of light and shadows are a visual treat and director Billy Wilder perfectly incorporates the actors into that morsel.",

Furthermore, it is a peculiar characteristic of this unique work that so much can be said without spoiling the film's outcome, as the film takes the ingenious risk of initiating the events from the immediate vantage point of its conclusion.

            "content": "The film that many argue started the Film Noir craze in America, and one of its most famous examples, Double Indemnity, a film title I rarely spell correctly on the first go, was not as appealing to me as other Wilder films such as Sunset Boulevard or The Apartment, but it's made with such style and panache that it doesn't matter whether its subjectively better than those films or not. The plot manages to throw plenty of curveballs without you losing track of things altogether, and makes the characters interesting enough to be engaging, but also ambiguous enough to be mysterious. It's a downright ground-breaking film in terms of its content, where the murder it's based around is rationalised and presented as a viable and even desirable option, not just something a person wants to do for revenge, or because they're a psychopath. There's a few distracting elements, such as the fact that Fred MacMurray is quite clearly wearing a wedding ring throughout the film despite obviously being a single man. How a director as fastidious as Billy Wilder managed to miss that I'll never know. Also, the framing device is that of the lead describing the entire murder plot to another character, who then plans to flee the country. Why not just skip the confession and run away instead? It's like he actually wanted to be caught. But with that to the side, Double Indemnity, aka, Keyes & Baby: The Movie, remains a standout film in a near unparalleled directorial career. If Film Noir is your thing, then there's a very good chance you've seen it already. If not, you really need to.",

            "content": "Intrigue and murder for insurance have never been so enthralling.\n\nBilly Wilder's film noir Double Indemnity (1944) has you wondering what happened when a life insurance agent aided a wife in plotting her husband's murder. Wilder's direction is snappy and doesn't waste a moment of Double Indemnity 108 minutes. I'm used to Billy Wilder's pleasant comedies such as Some Like It Hot or Sabrina. However, Wilder's film noir style is perfect for Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck is drop dead gorgeous as the iconic femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson. Her manipulation of Fred MacMurray's gullible insurance salesman is a delight to watch. MacMurray is great at displaying guilt and feeling cautiously nervous about Stanwyck's sinister scheme. You see her every intention on screen, while the fallout of her radioactive behavior cascades down everywhere as people are shot, men are strangled, and lives are ruined. Stanwyck's magnetic charisma, flirty charm, and serious noir sultry flair are captivating in Double Indemnity. You can tell how Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity was an influence on Gene Tierney for Leave Her to Heaven, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, and even Kim Basinger in Wayne's World 2.\n\nI loved seeing Edward G. Robinson's hard boiled insurance boss Barton Keyes figures out every detail of the story with his paranoid suspicions and lucky hunches. His fast talking, wise cracking, and no nonsense attitude makes Double Indemnity a splendid viewing experience. Jean Heather's supporting role as Lola Dietrichson was nice as her desperate pleas for belief and understanding are quite moving.\n\nBilly Wilder, Raymond Chandler, and James M. Cain's writing is thoughtful and has worked out every detail and mistake in this crime thriller scheme, so that the mystery of what went wrong is always interesting for the viewer. Wilder's playful and dark direction keeps you guessing, so that once you've figured out what has occurred, it's too late for the protagonist. Double Indemnity is an insurance fraud plot with a complex romance drama narrative mixed into the shadowy world of murder.\n\nDoane Harrison's editing is slick and cuts down Double Indemnity just to the main plot and scandalous intrigue, so the film never drags. John F. Seitz' cinematography is moody with these grim looking wide shots and splendorous close-ups of the stars. Miklos Rosza's score is steamy with a sizzling romantic score and unnerving noir mystique to his dramatic pulses. Edith Head's dresses are lovely on Barbara Stanwyck with that chic 1940's style. Wally Westmore's make-up does Stanwyck up in full glamour.\n\nIn all, I loved Double Indemnity. Wilder hooked me on the near private detective aspect of insurance claims agents discovering the nefarious deeds of insurance holders who are willing to commit murder and fraud for financial gain.",

But who said evil must be beautiful to be luring for the lost souls of the night?\n\nBilly Wilder, already a solid and respected screenwriter in Europe before fleeing the Nazis and land in Hollywood to continue his trade, made the transition to directing only few years and two movies before co-writing, in a tempestuous cooperation with Raymond Chandler, and directing Double Indemnity, based upon a James Cain novel published in 1943 and inspired by a real crime occurred in New York City in 1927.\n\nWhile formally abiding to the feared Hollywood's Hays Code, Double Indemnity oozes sensuality and perversion, not only for the excellent script, the clever flashback structure, the remarkable cinematography and the majestic use of light and shadows, but above all for the alchemy between the two leading characters. Like two chemicals that alone can be inert and banal, the combination of Walter Neff, the ultimate nice guy, superficially self-confident, to whom Fred MacMurry gives his handsome and reassuring face, and Phyllis Dietrichson, the apparently frustrated housewife, a Barbara Stanwyck that, although not beautiful notwithstanding a kinky ankle bracelet that soon became a fetish, is dangerously sleazy and manipulative, creates an explosive mix of weakness and power, an evil magnetism that none of the characters can escape.\n\nAn ineluctable and doomed journey, almost like in a Greek tragedy, where nobody can steer any more his own destiny once the wrong path has been taken, nobody can get off the tram directed to the cemetery, to use the words of Edward G. Robinson, who in this film is able to blend strict logic and sentiment, harshness and delicateness in a memorable performance.\n\nA movie that takes the viewer through the labyrinth of the human souls, uncovering and rummaging into the rottenness that both Phyllis and Walter know they have inside. It is not a coincidence that the whole story never takes place during the day, everything happens at night, a long, dark night without a dawn, a night that no light can brighten.",

            "content": "Oh, the unique wonders of Barbara Stanwyck. When I first discovered her I wondered what all the hype was about as she wasn't what you would call traditionally attractive but I quickly realized that she had a chutzpah and a charm unmatched by any other leading lady since. She had possibly her most iconic role with this classic film noir as she embodies the femme fatale in the minds of many classic film fans. Few films from this era have held up as well as this cynical story about passion and murder that manages to have a heart without becoming sentimental mush. I'm not the first to note any of this, few viewers don't fall in love with the film or at least admire it, yet my response was totally organic in a way that my feelings about other classics haven't been.\n\nBored insurance salesman Walter Neff, Fred MacMurray, falls under the spell of the seductive Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, when he arrives at her house to sell automobile insurance to her husband, Tom Powers. Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to murder her husband so that they can be together and collect a large payout as a result of the double indemnity clause that they have written into his life insurance policy without his knowledge. Although they initially believe that they have pulled off the perfect murder by killing Dietrichson and then placing him on the train tracks to make it appear that he commit suicide while Neff impersonates Dietrichson in the train the case is investigated by Neff's scrupulous co-worker Barton Keyes, Edward G. Robinson. Flaws in their plan are quickly brought to light and the two begin to fight as Neff takes measures to protect them while Dietrichson tries to drag a man into disposing of Neff.\n\nThe film is different from others of it's type as it leaves it's slimy protagonist's motives up in the air. Is he simply bored of his day job and the monotony of his life as the beginning of the film would suggest? We are certainly led to believe that he is excited by the prospect of putting the skills he has learnt over the year to good use and the fact that he appears to have little else going on in his life, being single and largely occupied with his work, convinces us that this could be his primary motivation. Furthermore for all of the leery shots of Stanwyck's ankles there is a dispassionate quality to the affair between Neff and Dietrichson as they seem to be seduced more by the idea of an illicit affair than by each other. There is palpable excitement in both of them as they plan and carry out the murder and what they both seem to crave, in my view, is an affirmation of their abilities. As the narcissistic Dietrichson revels in her power over men while Neff delights in doing something bad seemingly for the first time in his life.\n\nThe film also cuts to the chase remarkably quickly, as Billy Wilder's films are wont to do, with the set up of Neff and Dietrichson's affair and planning of the murder taking place within the first 30 minutes. After this the film becomes about the close, almost father-son like relationship between Neff and Keyes who trusts him implicitly even as he doesn't trust any of the insurance claimants who pass through his office. It seems in the second half of the film that Neff finds some moral center as he does not want the man who has nurtured and cared for him to realize what a rotten crook her has become. The final scene of the film informs us that despite the shocking revelations these two men will continue to be friends and compared to the end of films like Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950) that is heartwarming.\n\nThis is probably not what people remember about the film as there is one delicious scene in which the delightfully villainous Dietrichson gets what is coming to her. Before this occurs she has a terribly fun and oddly tragic revelation as she tells our hero that she never knew she loved him until she couldn't shoot him twice. Stanwyck's deadpan delivery and the many interpretations that could be applied to this line make it a great moment and the fact that she is brutally shot dead seconds later immortalizes it.",

In saying that, I mean that the jaw-dropping nuances Wilder has sizzled this film with, and the painstaking attention to details gave Double Indemnity unique taste, and made it stand out from all the films of its kind. Giving away the plot synopsis usually tarnishes the experience of watching your typical film noir because the toughness of them are their small details, let alone doing so with this one in addition to explaining why I find the subtlety of it so mesmerizing. Watch Double Indemnity and you'll know what I mean straight away!\n\nAlas, It seems that this very meticulous attention to detail came at the expense of making the most important the most crucial moments and the turning points convincing. The academic nature of the film's plotting made a lot of decisive moments a bit hard to swallow. It also made the movie drag, surprisingly, at what should have been the most intriguing part.\n\nAll the performances here are fine, but it's Edward G. Robinson who steals the show for me. He plays the quick-witted, determined investigator, Barton Keyes, who may be a bit too smart and clever to be believable; but thanks to Robinson's fierce performance, Keyes hands down is my favorite character in the movie.\n\nDouble Indemnity is an extremely well-crafted moody crime film that transcends the nature of its plotting with an unprecedented, unmatched, unsurpassable subtlety that made the main characters lifelike, and made the story thought-provoking in the first place. It raised the bar and set the standard for film-noir making at its time, and continues to inspire every neo-noir film, nay every crime film to this day.\n\n(8.5/10)",

Words to match the off-putting expressionist lighting, which doesn't just illuminate the set, but cuts these characters into pieces, as they and their plan fall to pieces, like the slow inexorable revelation of truth. Lighting to match the story itself-or at least it's telling-always only half exposed in its narration, shifting your attention to look in one (mis)direction while the real crime is happening just off screen, in the darkness, where you are not looking.\n\nForget, for a moment, if you can, the film's historical importance and influence as the first (or, at least, the prototype) film noir, step past its cinematic originality and impudence, important as that is-all reasons this is one of the greatest films ever made-and look at just what happens on the screen or in the script. This is a movie of detailed but subtle characterization (Stanwyck's trashy wig) and complex but earnest motivation (MacMurray's ideal ego), with unexpected turns that never pander to or underestimate the intelligence of either its audience or its characters. Yet for a movie about such darkness as what lies in the depths of the human condition, a movie that looks seedy and caused something of a scandal, for all about it that is hard on the soul it nonetheless is easy on the eyes and ears, profoundly enjoyable to watch even when the iniquity of these characters makes you, at times, want to look away.\n\nIn that sense, despite the narration by MacMurray which puts you in his shoes-and so makes you miss the story as its really happening, blinded by his ego while the real subject of the crime being Stanwyck-the viewer is ultimately in the position of the gumshoe-esque claims adjuster. Surrounded by brilliant performances, Robinson is the true criminal here, stealing every scene he's in, and in him is the whole spirit of the movie: Cantankerous, wordy, energetic, intelligent, skeptical, pessimistic. In fact, part of me suspects-and here we return to the filming and not just the film, to what happened off screen and not just what happens on-that Robinson is a stand-in, in a way, for Wilder, the force who keeps the action moving through his relentlessness, who is a step ahead even when he's playing catchup.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity is a classic film noir and a classic crime drama about bad people doing bad things and doing them badly. It's a rich narrative environment that has been explored in droves before and after. Double Indemnity was a box-office sensation, critical hit that was nominated for seven Oscars, and solidified Wilder as one of the most creative and daring voices in cinema. This was only his third directing effort and it provided the freedom to make his own way through Hollywood. There's a certain danger in going back to cinematic classics. It's easy to see their influence in a sea of imitators and sometimes the accomplishments can be taken for granted just because the viewer is too removed from the initial splash the film made. Double Indemnity is a sharp, surefooted, and highly influential film that still resonates with suspense and intrigue. The formula was refined with Wilder at the helm and his genius can be readily recognized.\n\nWalter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a mid 30s insurance salesman in Los Angeles. He gets into some big trouble when a prospective client, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), intimates that she would like to bump off her husband and profit from the act. Walter is appalled but also intrigued, drawn to the charms of the sexy Mrs. Dietrichson. He agrees and says they're going to do it right. She takes out a hefty insurance policy on her husband that pays double for rare accidents, which spurs Neff to stage a phony accident where the injured Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) fell to his death off a train. The scheme is elaborate, with alibis, swapped identities, hiding places, and a minimal of public interactions. It seems perfectly executed that is until Neff's boss, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), starts inspecting closer feeling something is amiss. Neff must outwit his boss and co-workers and keep the scheme from getting further out of control.\n\n\"I killed him for money - and a woman - and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.\"\n\nThanks to the morally and creatively restrictive Hays Code, it's easy to see all the roadblocks that could have sabotaged the movie from getting made, let alone becoming a great film. It's a movie not just about adulterers but they're also murderers, and the script places you in their perspective, clinging to hope they might succeed in their scheme. Admittedly, the characters are punished for their misdeeds by the film's end as the Hays Code would demand, but the film experience was different, and Wilder made it so early on. Within minutes, as Walter Neff dictates his confession in his boss' empty office, he admits to being a killer, to killing Mr. Dietrichson, and in doing so out of a desire for Mrs. Dietrichson. By the very fact that he's slumped over, panting heavily, and confessing in sordid detail, we can rightfully assume that he did not get away with it. What's left for the audience to discover? Wilder has already established the major turns of his story for his audience and seemingly robbed us of any notion of surprise. But that's where Wilder's storytelling prowess emerges, because it's not so much a story of whether something was done or would be done, it's a story of how and how to elude capture.\n\nWe're locked into Neff's perspective, and with it as an experienced insurance salesman, he knows the proper way to stage a murder, make it look like an accident, and not get caught. It's in the details that Wilder hooks us, and as we watch the trap unravel, the movie becomes an exercise in nervous tension wondering what will trip up our lovers. An audience generally gravitates to smart characters trying to outwit others, appreciating the wiles but also, perhaps, wanting to see if the scheme can be accomplished. It pushes the audience into an interesting position of rooting for our murderer. There's a wonderful scene right after Neff and Phyllis have deposited the body of her dead husband. They've hopped in her car and are ready to flee the scene of the crime, and that's when her car won't start. Wilder simmers in the moment, luxuriating in the encroaching panic as key turn after key turn only results in the sounds of a stalled engine. Finally, it starts, but during the sequence you empathize with the killers and their panic. Wilder and company have done their job and at least some part of the audience is pushing for them to escape. What happens later tests audience loyalty, but we're still firmly in the perspective and in the shoes of the film's killer, the only killer in the picture at that. He's our man.\n\n\"I think you're rotten.\"\n\n\"I think you're swell - so long as I'm not your husband.\"\n\ndouble-indemnity_in-text1520The staples of noir cinema really came alive with Wilder's excellent crime drama. The visual signifiers we associate with the genre are all here in accordance, like the chiaroscuro lighting that bathed the actors in swaths of invading darkness. The lighting does a great job of reflecting the sordid schemes of our lovers. As soon as Walter accepts, the lighting changes drastically and the layers of dark creep in on the actors' faces. The dialogue by Wilder and Raymond Chandler (his first screenwriting gig in Hollywood) has that robust rat-a-tat rhythms of hardboiled genre fiction that we love. The twists and turns keep an audience glued even though we have already been told the major plot particulars. The inclusion of Mr. Dietrich's twenty-something daughter Lola (Jean Heather) from his previous marriage presents an intriguing complication. She suspects her wicked stepmother might have something to do with her father's death as well as her mother's death. Walter Neff keeps tabs on her as a means of trying to dissuade whom she tells her suspicions to, as a means of manipulating her, but then when Lola reveals that her ex-boyfriend has been seeing Phyllis on a nightly basis, we don't know what to think. Is Phyllis setting up her own scheme to kill Neff? Is Lola knowingly manipulating Neff to enact vengeance against her hated stepmother? Is there anyone a guy can trust? It's a fine character and played sincerely by Heather (Going My Way) almost to the point of ache. She stopped acting altogether in 1949, to the detriment of us all.\n\nBut the ultimate femme fatale is Stanwyck (The Lady Eve). I think what makes her work is the fact that she doesn't immediately leap to mind as a femme fatale. She's not the most gorgeous actress in Hollywood, though clearly still an attractive woman. The stiff blonde wig they saddled her with doesn't help on that front. She's a temptress that doesn't sizzle off the screen so much as step from the mind, because she feels more realistic. Working within the repressive confines of the Hays Code, Stanwyck still knows how to provide a sexy smirk to things left unsaid with her character. There are a few looks she employs that could make you melt. A standout scene focuses entirely on her face. Her husband is being murdered just off screen. That violent act is left to our morbid imaginations while we watch Stanwyck's subtle expression of satisfaction crosses her face only to dissolve when she knows better. I wish MacMurray (The Absentminded Professor) was a better scene partner with her. He seems overly stiff like he's trying more to get out the stylized dialogue in the tone the director wants. Wilder finds ways to subvert the actor's tendencies but I feel like he's at best a likable dolt of an actor.\n\n\"You're not smarter, Walter... you're just a little taller.\"\n\nPhyllis is a classic femme fatale figure and Stanwyck plays her with a beautifully controlled sense of menace, but I want to offer a different theory as to what kind of twisted love story inhabits Double Indemnity. I think Walter Neff was never in love with Phyllis, though acknowledged her beauty and general seductive effect. This much is clear from his first meeting with her where the insurance veteran can't help himself with how forward and transparent his flirting is. He's interested, though he's also interested in getting a sale, and then when she floats the idea of life insurance, his tone immediately changes. The flirting stops cold and he promptly sees himself out. But he can't stop thinking it over. I propose he isn't drawn to Phyllis so much as he's drawn to the intellectual challenge of pulling off the \"perfect crime.\" He considers himself a clever man and this would put all his skills to the test. He knows what agents look for to suss out foul play. He knows what the police ask over. Now he gets to see if he can fool them all. In this interpretation of mine, it's not Neff's love for the dame that gets him but his love of his ego. There's a cold manner in how often he calls Phyllis \"baby,\" lacking apparent affection and instead seemingly turning the pet name into something dutiful. Oh, but you'll argue, his voice over goes into great detail about the magnetic and sexual appeal of Mrs. Dietrichson, and that's the point to remember, that it's his voice over. Neff is retelling this story, knowingly dictating his confession, and perhaps he's playing into a narrative that removes some of the emphasis from his true intentions. Since it's from his perspective, his words are all we know about Phyllis and her assumed seductress ways. Having the final word on his story would provide a perfect opportunity for Walter to alter the story as best he sees fit, shifting some blame onto the woman who done him wrong. I believe that in the end it was Walter Neff's desire to prove he could outsmart the world of law enforcement and get away with murder that drove him onto this wayward path and not a woman as fetching as Stanwyck and her anklet may have been.\n\nThere's a very unexpected emotional current that surfaces fully by the conclusion of Double Indemnity. Edward G. Robinson was at a transitional point in his career, having been the lead in a slew of older crime pictures. An audience was prepped from association to consider Robinson a disreputable character, just as they had prepped to consider MacMurray's character a likeable fellow from his previous comedic roles. Wilder's film flips audience expectations to great effect. MacMurray is the cunning murderer and Robinson is the moral center. Keyes is exceptionally skilled at insurance fraud and it naturally should be him that unknowingly tightens the noose around his beloved employee as he gets closer and closer to the truth. He just can't see it; Walter Neff is so close he inhabits a blind spot. When Keyes does discover the truth, his crushing sense of disappointment he tries to hold back is an emotional moment that hits hard. It's the professional and loving relationship between these men that helps to add something more to Double Indemnity; it's got the noir staples we come to expect nowadays but it also has a surprisingly sweet and affecting father/son relationship between mentor and student. Robinson is terrific in the bravado moments like when he unleashes a torrent of statistical categories on suicide types and methods and he sells the quiet hurt of a proud man who must admit he placed his trust in the wrong recipient.\n\n\"I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man.\"\n\nDouble Indemnity is a film classic that holds up thanks to deft plotting that puts the audience in the place of the killers, solid twists and turns, and a clear understanding of the strengths of the genre. It's a standout film noir that still stands rather tall. It's always reassuring when the great pieces of art can still transport, still excite, and still resonate with the same feeling that communicates why they deserve the decades of plaudits and acclaim. Wilder was one of Hollywood's greatest storytellers who could hop genres like few others. His foray into noir cinema left a long lasting legacy for the genre and its fans to follow, and Double Indemnity is still the crackling crime thriller it was under the Hays Code. Perhaps the scrutiny of censorship forced Wilder and Chandler to get more creative, and the finished product is a taut and stylish imprint that others eagerly copied.

The black-and-white filter makes the film dramatic and tense.  I also really liked how the film is narrated by the protagonist.  This added an energy to the film and made it engaging to watch.  This notwithstanding, Double Indemnity wasn't perfect.  The romance between the two lead characters felt forced and the film didn't engage me throughout.  I was bored at times.

            "content": "MacMurray does justice to the characters pervading Cain's novels, justice that was partially obliterated by Garfield later on. In spite of Wilder's and Chandler's\nwriting, MacMurray rises above a very poor screenplay adaptation of Cain's novel to capture the essence of the noire genre. Wilder and Chandler might seem to be writers cut from different cloth but what they have in common, a tendency to dwell in schlock and awe, is what rips the fabric from the Cain storyline. You know, I partially take what I wrote about MacMurray back, on second thoughts he has a tendency to fall into the overwrought emotional mannerisms typifying movies of the '30's and '40's.  Emotions run strong in Cain's novel, emotions of desperation not the outraged anger MacMurray exhibits at inappropriate moments. Stanwyck does a decent job in her role, her laid back style might have been the inspiration for the method acting school of thought. Stanwyck's acting style is also a function of the Hollywood star system as exhibited in Mae West and others, a laconic style meant to impress upon the viewer a persona of being sated and unapproachable. It works in the early parts of the film and Stanwyck makes the transition to the later, more desperate parts adequately.\nSo is the movie worthwhile in spite of its different take from the novel? I would say so, it's one of the movies that helped found the whole noire genre. Eventually the genre would become relegated to B movie status without the stars and with scripts not based on novels and written specifically for the screen. in some ways the stars of the later, smaller scale noire films are more up to the task because their relative anonymity fits perfectly with the ordinary horror that is an essential element of the genre.",

You sense it in the dreamy way scenes transition, how the lighting and angles in each frame is stylized like a comic book panel, how the dialogue is smooth and filled with one-liners like a showdown between superhero and villain, and so on. Double Indemnity isn't like that. It's more down to Earth and grounded in reality, while at the same time retaining the clever, romantic and devious charm of the genre. This makes it either one of the best or one of the worst. In my opinion, it's one of the best. It's a good movie for people who don't like the eccentricities typically found in old film noir.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is film noir at its finest. The story is about an insurance salesman who allows a woman to talk him into a murder plot that will help them defraud the insurance company and runaway together. Fred MacMurray plays dramatically against type as the insurance salesman who has dreamed up the perfect way of getting the best of the insurance company. His narration throughout is very classy and feels perfect for this style of film. I also appreciated that the narration explained some of his thought process, but didn't waste time retelling moments we were able to see on screen. Barbara Stanwyck plays the femme fatale in this story, and she is just mysterious enough that you can never tell what she is really thinking. Is she genuinely in love with Fred MacMurray's character, or just leading him on? You'll have to watch the film and decide for yourself. Without question, though, my favorite performance comes from Edward G. Robinson. Who would have thought that an insurance claims manager would be the hero of a film, but I feel like he is definitely the hero of Double Indemnity (although your rooting interest kind of shifts around as the movie goes on.) He is so perfect for this role, because he manages to be the hard-nosed boss, but his affection for his coworker softens every scene they have together. In fact the relationship between the characters played by MacMurray and Robinson is easily the most interesting and engaging aspect of the film.\n\nOf course the cinematography includes a lot of darkness. It fits the dark tone of the film, and locks it solidly in the noir genre. However the more intriguing choices that were made behind the camera were how shots were set up. There's a scene where Stanwyck is hiding behind a door trying to avoid being seen by Robinson, and they brilliantly place the camera down the hallway so we can focus in on her. This one staging choice adds so much tension to what could be a very mundane conversation between MacMurray and Robinson. Also the scene of the murder is executed in a brilliant way because we aren't allowed to see the deed, but instead experience it through the expressions on Stanwyck's face. There's really not much to complain about in Double Indemnity. It is a well-crafted story, and it takes a different angle on a classic murder mystery. It was very intriguing to think about how the insurance company has more at stake than the police so they have more incentive to sniff out a murder. Instead of following around some detective we are left with a pencil pusher played by Edward G. Robinson, and yet it works. I thought there were a few odd choices in the film, and I never fully understood what role Nino played in the story. His entire subplot kind of went over my head. That being said, I still think Double Indemnity is a great film, and it is definitely worth seeing at least once.",

In that crime, Ruth Snyder persuaded her boyfriend, Judd Gray, to kill her husband Albert after having him take out a big insurance policy - with a double-indemnity clause. The murderers were quickly identified, arrested and convicted. The front page photo of Snyder's execution in the electric chair at Sing Sing has been called the most famous newsphoto of the 1920s.\n\nDouble Indemnity began making the rounds in Hollywood shortly after it was published in Liberty magazine in 1935. Cain had already made a name for himself the year before with The Postman Always Rings Twice, a story of murder and passion between a migrant worker and the unhappy wife of a café owner. Cain's agent sent copies of the novella to all the major studios and within days, MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, and Columbia were all competing to buy the rights for $25,000. Then a letter went out from Joseph Breen at the Hays Office, and the studios withdrew their bids as one. In it Breen warned:\n\n\nThe general low tone and sordid flavor of this story makes it, in our judgment, thoroughly unacceptable for screen presentation before mixed audiences in the theater. I am sure you will agree that it is most important...to avoid what the code calls \"the hardening of audiences,\" especially those who are young and impressionable, to the thought and fact of crime.\n\nEight years later Double Indemnity was included in a collection of Cain's works entitled Three of a Kind. Paramount executive Joseph Sistrom thought the material would be perfect for Wilder and they bought the rights for $15,000. Paramount resubmitted the script to the Hays Office, but the response was nearly identical to the one eight years earlier. Wilder, Paramount executive William Dozier, and Sistrom decided to move forward anyway. They submitted a film treatment crafted by Wilder and his writing partner Charles Brackett, and this time the Hays Office approved the project with only a few objections: the portrayal of the disposal of the body, a proposed gas-chamber execution scene, and the skimpiness of the towel worn by the female lead in her first scene.\n\nCain forever after maintained that Joseph Breen owed him $10,000 for vetoing the property back in 1935 when he would have received $25,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nExteriors of the Dietrichson house in the film were shot at a 3,200-square-foot (300 m2), Spanish Colonial Revival house built in 1927. The house can still be seen today and is located at 6301 Quebec Drive in the Beachwood Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, almost exactly on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nThe exterior of the train station in the film was the Mission Revival Style Southern Pacific Railroad Depot in Glendale, California built in 1923. The station can now be seen as part of the Glendale Transportation Center and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1997.\n\nOther locations around Los Angeles used in the film were an apartment building at 1825 N. Kingsley Drive in Hollywood where Walter Neff lived and the building on the southwest corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Western. That building still stands, but the Newman Drug Store originally on the ground floor is no longer there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble Indemnity opened on September 6, 1944 and was an immediate hit with audiences - despite a campaign by singer Kate Smith imploring the public to stay away on moral grounds. As James M. Cain recalled, \"...there was a little trouble caused by this fat girl, Kate Smith, who carried on a propaganda asking people to stay away from the picture. Her advertisement probably put a million dollars on its gross.\"\n\nReviews from the critics were largely positive, though the content of the story made some uncomfortable. While some reviewers found the story implausible and disturbing, others praised it as an original thriller. In his mixed review of the film in The New York Times, film critic Bosley Crowther called the picture \"...Steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length.\" He complained that the two lead characters \"...lack the attractiveness to render their fate of emotional consequence,\" but also felt the movie possessed a \"...realism reminiscent of the bite of past French films.\"\n\nHoward Barnes at the New York Herald Tribune was much more enthusiastic, calling Double Indemnity \"...one of the most vital and arresting films of the year,\" and praising Wilder's \"...magnificent direction and a whale of a script.\" The trade paper Variety, meanwhile, said the film \"...sets a new standard for screen treatment in its category.\"\n\nInfluential radio host and Hearst paper columnist Louella Parsons would go even further, saying, \"Double Indemnity is the finest picture of its kind ever made, and I make that flat statement without any fear of getting indigestion later from eating my words.\"\n\nPhilip K. Scheur, the Los Angeles Times movie critic, ranked it with The Human Comedy, The Maltese Falcon, and Citizen Kane as Hollywood trailblazers, while Alfred Hitchcock himself wrote Wilder that \"Since Double Indemnity, the two most important words in motion pictures are 'Billy' and 'Wilder'\".\n\nThe film's critical reputation has only grown over the years. In 1977, notably terse critic-historian Leslie Halliwell gave it an unusual 4-star (top) rating, and wrote: \"Brilliantly filmed and incisively written, perfectly capturing the decayed Los Angeles atmosphere of a Chandler novel, but using a simpler story and more substantial characters.\" In his 1998 review, film critic Roger Ebert praised director Wilder and cinematographer Seitz. He wrote, \"The photography by John F. Seitz helped develop the noir style of sharp-edged shadows and shots, strange angles and lonely Edward Hopper settings.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nman this is such an incredibly really well written/directed/acted movie 2 watch, its got a fantastic cast throughout this movie.....man this is such a brilliant classics movie 2 watch. it is so thrilling it is such a fantastic, movie 2 watch, its got a great cast throughout this movie.....man this is such a brilliant movie 2 watch, it is such a fantastic movie 2 watch.....",

While it's hard to watch movies like this without MST3K-type banter about the way men treat women, the over-dramatic acting and the sometimes-unreal premises, overall Double Indemnity tells the kind of story one only sees in parody today and keeps the viewer intensely interested the entire time. The mystery takes twists and turns, teasing the audience with the direction in which the investigation will go until the inevitable discovery ends the plans Neff and Phyllis took such great care to construct.  Edward G. Robinson plays another memorable role in his list of many throughout his career as the manager of Neff's Insurance Claims Division who eventually figures it all out.",

Granted, Stanwyck (to me) doesn't look like the kinda dame that a schmuck would risk all for, but she's good in the role. McMurray (especially to those of us who mainly know him from \"My Three Sons\") is a revalation though, perfect in the role as the arrogant dupe. And Eddie G is as awesome as ever - the speech he delivers to his boss about insurance (before taking the boss's glass of water and chugging it down) is a keeper. Exceptionally delivered. But the real star of \"Double Indemnity\" is the script - Chandler and Wilder's dialogue is fast and scattershot and delicious and bounces off the walls, lurid, purple poetry, endlessly rewatchable. The two lead characters may be nasty pieces of work, but Wilder makes the humanity - and the humour - dark, noir humour - shine through the shadows. Love that little dude's work.",

The classic story about the extramarital affair that commits spousal homicide. One of the great classics from Hollywood's golden age, \"Double indemnity\" is a seminal film noir directed by Billy Wilder, based on a novel of the same name authored by James M. Cain, whose inspiration came from a real case dating from 1927. This realistic movie does not portray the mechanics of the real case, the story here is much more sophisticated, intelligent and still perfectly plausible to happen in the reality of that time. In \"Double Indemnity\" we know from the very beginning that things will end terribly wrong. However, we still afford the privilege to witness and experience the tribulations of the evil mind as it meticulously sets in motion the perfect crime. We also experience the emotional unrest of the perpetrator as he verifies the authorities proving him wrong as they slowly unravel the truth. In addition to the wonderfully crafted suspense, this movie is also a wide open window to the complex psychological canvas of the guilty subject who deceives his daily friend until the eventual confession.\n\nThis movie is notable for the excellence of the narrative craft, which is enough to wrap me in the thrilling and realistic story, the dialogues are superb. The naturalistic and effortless acting endows the movie with life and emotional power. Barbara Stanwyck's role stands in my memory as the archetype of the femme fatale, beautiful, lustful, sweet, but a true wolf in sheep's clothing! Fred McMurray and Edward G. Robinson are also at high-level. Except for some memorable scenes, I didn't find the visual style to be particularly notable, the camera work is clean and polished, but apart from the innovative light and shadow work of John F. Seitz, there are no other gimmicks to enhance the visual style, this is a thoroughly realistic and stripped picture. I also lament the less than perfect condition of the film's analog source when it was converted to digital format, a bit more visual integrity and \"Double Indemnity\" would be an immaculate cinematic experience for me. Another wonderful black-and white classic, highly recommended!",

This suspenseful and dark film-noir set the standard for the genre and many imitations and parodies followed in it's wake, but it's a good film and it has some very good performances in it. It begins with insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) dictating the events that came to this point, all told in flashback. It all began when he met Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) at her house to remind her that her husband's (Tom Powers) car insurance is up for renewal. But she wants to take out a life insurance policy on his life, but Neff susses out she's up to something and backs off. But he can't get Phyllis out of his mind, and agrees to help her kill her husband. Which they do, by having Neff jump off a train, and put Dietrichson's body on the line. It seems to go well but Neff's colleague Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) deduces something's not right. It's a very good film, and it has some good dialogue and a good plot too. It's a complex plot and does require attention, but it does pay off at the end, and it shares DNA with Cain's other great crime novel The Postman Always Rings Twice.

It demonstrates this idea by a man who gets on the slippery slope of adultery that ends with a double murder. In the process, he loses his career, friend, a woman who really loved him and ultimately his life.\n\nThe main plot of the story is the external one: to get away with the perfect murder in order to be with the woman he loves. This plot ends in failure. Suspicion ruins his love and he commits another murder to hide the first. His suspicion is proven to be misplaced as his lover refuses to kill him before he kills her. In the end, he is caught, confesses and dies from his wounds.\n\nBut we already knew that he doesn't get away since the movie starts with his confession and the whole thing takes place in a flashback that catches up to the present.\n\nIf the movie ended where it began, it would have been a simple morality play about how the slippery slope of the loss of morality (that started with some innocent flirting) can quickly spiral out of control and take everything with it. But our hero chooses to redeem himself at the end. He realizes he has lost everything and chooses to confess. He also choose to put two young lovers who have broken up because of mutual distrust back on track to be reunited. This minor plotline of Lola and her boyfriend's love is crucial to the hero's redemption.\n\nDouble Indemnity is a very tight story. Each character plays roles on multiple plotlines and each scene provides turning points of expanding stakes and meaning. It absolutely proves the idea that even a small loss of morality will lead to the ultimate destruction.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",

Basically, it began as an innocent visit to discuss insurance with a Mr. Dietrichson at his home, but when he's not there, he meets Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck, his sultry and flirtatious wife. Eventually, she talks Walter into murdering her husband and making it look like an accident in order to claim a large amount of money. This movie is in incredibly sexy for a movie made in 1944. With the beginning sequence between MacMurray and Stanwyck, the banter is slightly comical, fast and filled with innuendo. The cinematography is top notch as well.

Dunkle Schatten wechseln sich mit der kalifornischen Sonne ab.\nDie Schauspieler sind Weltklasse: Fred MacMurray ist genial als Walter Neff, Barbara Stanwyck, wie ich bereits erwähnte DIE Femme fatale und Edward G. Robinson spielt den kleinen wütenden Mann so gut wie ein James Cagney.\nSein Barton Keyes, hält den Film zusammen und dient dem großen Ganzen auch als Antrieb - er ist der einzige, der dem Plot immer auf der Spur bleibt und schlussendlich auch die Auflösung liefert.\n\nUm was geht es? Double Indemnity ist einer jener Filme, an den man möglichst uninformiert herantreten sollte - es geht um einen Versicherungsmakler und eine Frau die ihren Mann loswerden will - so viel sei verraten - der Rest ist ein furioser Ritt durch die Vergangenheit - denn wie auch Wilders späterer Film Sunset Boulevard, wird Double Indemnity mittels eines Flashbacks und langen Voice-over Passagen erzählt.

Once the movie begins and we are introduced to our main character, we are already aware things have taken a bad turn, but we just don't know how bad. All we know is that things are not looking good as our character is about to begin his confession.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help, but feel pity for Neff, but I think we can all agree that this was a lot of stupidity on his part for not using his brain to investigate things further before he went in too deep. This is an engrossing story and as the story unfolds, many layers of the mystery begin to peel off, unveiling one shocking revelation after the next. With each twist and turn, we can feel our insides twisting more and more as the big picture starts to show revealing the disturbing truth.\r\n\r\nThis has everything I love about the film noir genre.

The story was simple he taught, all he had to do was kill the lady he so desires husband and make it look like an accident, while tricking him to sign an accident insurance policy where everything goes to his lady friend, so he will get the girl and with her comes the money. \n\nThe movie is best put using the word nice, and a classic as it has come to be. Double Indemnity is beautiful and captivating, based on a 1943 novel of the same name by James M. Cain. This movie was the height of film noir in the 40s spring out many copycat B movies from other producers.\n\nThe screenplay is penned down by Billy Wilder, who also directed the movie, and from the way the movie drove you just have to appreciate the work of the screen writer, I while watching I was so eager to know if they will get away with it or not. Fred MacMurray narrated and starred in the movie, although the movie was a huge critical success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Billy Wilder's writing and directing of this movie is a masterpiece worth treasuring and a work of art worth owning.\n\nThe movie and the book's idea is based on the Double indemnity clause provided in life insurance or accident policy whereby the insurance company agrees to pay the stated multiple (double) of the face amount in the contract in the case of death caused by accidental means.\n\nThe movie was a box office success making over 5 times its production cost, and the cinematography used \"venetian blind\" lighting which became popular in later film noirs. Double Indemnity was well received by the American Film Institute, in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it was rated 29th; it also got other American Film Institute recognitions. \n\nThis movie is wonderful, so if you have not seen or heard about the movie now you have so go see it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

Billy Wilder put together a crime film that is still intriguing today with its femme fatale and other techniques in storytelling and cinematography. Starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson, this is a classic film-noir. Walter Neff is your average American insurance salesman. However while trying to sell some accident insurance he falls for a woman who is married to a former widower. Together they plot and carry out a murder on her irritable husband trying to cash in on a double indemnity clause. Although everything goes as clockwork the two of them must stay apart and Neff's colleague is hot on their trail. Through a series of visits with Deitrichson's depressed step-daughter, Neff himself finds out Phyllis was seeing someone else. In their final confrontation he figures out she killed her husband's first wife . Then she preceded to use Neff for her own purposes. Following their confrontation Neff feels guilt and so he records all he knows for his colleague Keyes to hear later. This movie was definitely full of suspense as well as great characters. Director Wilder utilizes the voice over with flashback very effectively to tell the story.",

            "content": "One of the masterful grand daddies of Film Noir. The first of many great masterpieces to follow from one of Hollywood's greatest talents, Billy Wilder. This film became a blue-print for many new fresh ideas in Hollywood film making.\r\n\r\nThe script was written by Wilder & Raymond Chandler & crackled with sharp double on-tundra quips deliciously delivered by both the lead actors Fred MacMurray & Barbara Stanwyck. As the story goes no one else wanted to play the roles in this seedy morally corrupt caper. But as fate would have it both Stanwyck & MacMurray were perfect for the parts & did some of their very best work on screen. I would also be remiss in not mentioning the great Edward G. Robinson's performance as Keyes, the claims manager who is the detective in this noir classic. What is really fascinating is the uniquely nuanced relationships amongst the leads. Particularly Robinson's & MacMurrays characters who clearly respect & care very much for one another. Perhaps they love each other as colleagues & friends. And what is the real story between Stanwyck's & MacMurray? Do they love each other? It seems not, right up to the final scene when thay are together. We never will really know. Brilliant stuff!\r\n\r\nAlong with the legendary photography of one John Seitz who really developed the noir style with this picture. With it's high contrast scenes, to it's sharp edged shadows & interesting angles & composition Seitz helped create a look that is a classic & has been copied countless times in films to follow.\r\n\r\nThe film is unique & brilliant in it's detail. It's brilliant in its cold characters, it's more realistic portrayal of the personal frailties & greed of our species. It stripped back the layers of naivety & reveled a much more cynical & raw realism that was certainly cutting edge when the film was released to an appreciative audience in 1944.\r\n\r\nLike many of the great films one viewing is not enough to fully appreciate this films brilliance & artistry. Double indemnity is surely one of the great Hollywood films of all time.",

The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona-fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.\n\nOne could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyesâ(TM) eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition (âthe little man insideâ?) to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. Itâ(TM)s quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyckâ(TM)s role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvellous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a manâ(TM)s world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on.",

Double Indemnity is my favorite of the 1940s Noirs, the hayday of the genre.  I'm suggesting Key Largo, Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep (all with Bogie).

            "content": "A classic. I had allowed myself to believe that I don't like old movies, as a rule. Mostly, movies made in the Production Code era I find pale next to what followed.. And it is simply because the art form was still in its adolescent phase. In acting, special effects, music, etc., I feel that generally, movies are only getting better,  the majority of older movies I've seen being drab, boring, and stodgy by comparison. I feel like it has been impressed on me over and over that old movies are superior to new because they came first, or that they are purer artistically. It is reckoned as heresy, or at least a sign of boorishness, not to appreciate \"films\" from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Also, simply because a noted contemporary director idolizes certain old movies, as Scorsese showed his feelings in Hugo, does not mean I should like it. Perhaps numerous old classics are worthwhile because of their influence on later generations, or because they introduced novel techniques which became widespread. This makes them then important for film students, or as a diversion for someone interested in tracing the evolution of moviemaking. Take \"M\" for example, almost universally hailed as a masterpiece. It's sense of dread and atmosphere, its lurid subject matter, and it's use of music were influential; personally, I found it extremely dull. No doubt perhaps Billy Wilder was influenced by it in making this film noir. At any rate, as this digression has consumed so much space, although I found, honestly, that most widely acclaimed movies pre-1970s were not worth watching, clearly there were a number of well-made movies that, even now, decades on, can still provoke and entertain, and . These are movies that transcend their technical and dramatic limitations. Double Indemnity is one of them, and naturally there are many others. But if you are of a certain cast of mind, who is historically minded and respectful of canonization, you have to cast off the pressure that the critical establishment places on your shoulders to enjoy \"art\". So, anyway, Double Indemnity is a firecracker of a movie. The story is a textbook example of a noir and the script is just filled with clever, funny dialogue, and great characters who just flow together on screen. You really forget you're watching a movie released in 1944, over 60 years ago.",

Billy Wilder's first huge success, ushered in his run of stone cold classics. This is as important as nearly any American Film for the possibilities it offered for everyone who followed and copied/echoed it. MacMurray was a great choice for the lead, as he is quite easily believable as an honest man gone wrong \"I did it for the money, did it for the girl\".  I definitely saw parallels between this and Dostoevsky's Crime & Punishment in the way the aftermath of the crime and the guilt and conscience eats at Neff and Raskolnikov.

As the tension rises, the true nature of the characters is revealed, and what seems to have been a perfect plot, turned out to be a fatal disaster with unimaginable consequences.The fate of every person involved is sealed before the thrilling end. Fred MacMurray is great as the rapacious insurance agent, and Barbara Stanwyck created a cold-blooded femme fatale of flesh and bones. The black-and-white cinematography is purely nightmarish, and the film makes a great use of the retrospections, in order to maintain its tense tone.

Director Billy Wilder wonderfully crafts this movie and moves it along well.\n\nThe story is of insurance agent, Walter Neff. He goes to the house of a Mr. Dietrichson to talk to him about car insurance. Instead he winds up talking to Dietrichson's wife Phyllis. Phyllis is miserable in her marriage and casually drops a hint about getting life insurance for her husband. Neff deduces Phyllis's plan to kill her husband and collect the insurance money. He stars an affair with her, and he both plan the murder together. It goes off without a hitch, but Neff's boss isn't so sure that it was an accident.\n\nFred MacMurray gives one of his all-time best performances in a dead serious role. MacMurray is known for his family comedies, but he plays Neff spectacularly. Billy Wilder seams to bring out he best in MacMurray, in strange roles for him. Barbra Stanwyck plays a classic Femme Fatale s Phyllis. Another good performance.\n\nOverall, this movie doesn't live up to the great noirs, but it is a very strong movie, with a good message.\n\n\"Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money - and a woman - and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman. Pretty, isn't it?\" 7.5/10",

Billy Wilder is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. I adore the beautifully cinematic lighting that characterizes his films.

The elements in it - the performances, the music, the dialogue, and even those little hints of alternating homosexuality AND heterosexuality in Walter Neff's mind - were, to say in the least, greatly depicted by Billy Wilder's brilliant direction. But above all else, what really stood out from all others was Barbara Stanwyck's chilling part as Phyllis Dietrichson. I could see at once why she is considered even today as being the iciest femme fatale in film history. She isn't just icy and scheming - she's simply too dangerous and murderous even for a femme fatale. The way she hooks on Neff to her schemes, and then dumps him, struck me as horrifying, as though she were a sort of Oriental seductress-courtesan entrancing Neff to kill her fat and oafish Sultan. Her words and dialogue seem to provide a brief key to her real character, but her beauty strips away all that. Ultimately, thus, that is what made Double Indemnity a really chilling noir. The other chilling part of it is, of course, how both Neff and Stanwyck react to the eventual downfall of their schemes and plans, and how the once collaborating lovers become murderous enemies. Dietrichson may have got what she deserved in the end, but her death signifies that Neff too must go down. That part of the film takes place after the ending. What we really want from it is what we get - the schemes, the plots, and their eventual collapse.",

Damn.\n\nThankfully, this talent doesn't go to waste at all, and the end result is one of the greatest entries into the film noir genre. The plot concerns an insurance salesman named Walter Neff who, smitten with a client's wife, schemes with her to kill the husband in an accident like fashion in order to cash in on the double indemnity clause of their policy- a cluase that will pay out double than normal in the event of a death caused by accident. Things get tricky though, when a suspicious claims adjuster who works with Neff is assigned to the case.\n\nThis is a smart, suspenseful, and tightly written thriller, and despite how old it is, really holds up extremely well. The film has also been very influential not only on the film noir genre, but also several films by a couple of guys you may have heard of named Joel and Ethan Coen (among others). Wilder's direction is superb, and the acting is brilliant. MacMurray and Stnawyck had never done anything quite this sleazy and gritty before, and this also marked the start of a long tenure as a supporting character actor for Robinson..something he was great at.\n\nFrom the music, to the technical details like cinematography, editing, etc, the tightness of the plot is made even more spectacular, and this is hands down one of the best ever.

All goes good, and no one suspects them: until Walter's super smart boss (Robinson) suspects that all isn't as it seems ... \"Double Indemnity\" is one of the best movies ever made in every sense. It's the definitive film noir, started a trend in plot devices, brings home to bacon of what you expect a '40's movie to be like, and then-- you get Billy Wilder directing, and that's the key to why the film isn't as ordinary as it could be. Wilder wanted this to be one of those steamy, erotic thrillers, but we all know that those didn't exist in the 1940's due to the Hays Code, and Paramount wouldn't allow anything \"sexy\". Wilder, one of the smartest movie makers of all time, works around it. We know Walter and Phyllis are having an affair, but do we see it? Nope. The most \"dirty\" thing going on is them kissing, but we get the hint. Then of course, we have the crime of the movie. But all murderers had to be caught in the '40's. Does he get caught? Yep, but Wilder fashions it to the point to where it covers the plot twist area, and makes no disappointment available. Who knows how he did it?? Better off, he gets help from screenwriter Raymond Chandler (one of the biggest drunks of the time) who he didn't like, but Chandler makes the lines absolutely perfect, and makes Phyllis more cheap and evil, and Walter the wholesome guy who gives into temptation. Stanwyck was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, and Wilder was for directing (who knows how they didn't win) but who gives a crap if they won or not? \"Double Indemnity\" will always be one of the best, and most daring films of all time.

            "content": "An Archetypical look at the narrative structure (or frame story) as exemplified in film, along with one of the first (and greatest) film noirs of all time. Double Indemnity pushes the boundaries of the film in that sexual motivation becomes a key part of Neff's character as well as the advancement of the plot. There's plenty of both subtle and blatant symbols; The fact that Neff is always lighting the match for Keyes with a role-reversal at the end, the positions of the characters in the frame to assert dominance (as plenty of films employ) and an archetypical \"car wont start\" that has finagled its way into any modern film that claims to evoke suspense. You know a film has had a lasting impression when an action or event began in said film becomes commonplace in modern film 70 years later (Psycho? okay, maybe 50 years later.) The characters are so well developed and the lighting is brilliant (for a noir film and particularly in the artistic sense). The brilliant piece of the film is how the suspense is evoked. We're told that he did it, by him, within the first few moments, but we keep wondering how, why, and when. This evokes more suspense than if we would be wondering if they get caught or not. We have to worry about three elements rather than one. The original noir to implement the frame narrative, followed by plenty of noirs that executed the same styllistic storytelling in response to how well it preformed (Out of the Past???). In conclusion, not only a classic, but an archetypical noir, frame narrative, and suspense thriller.",

Not only does Billy Wilder's adapted crime-drama epitomize the genre, but it redefined the careers of Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson and reestablished Wilder's versatility as a director. \n\nYou needn't be attuned to insurance to understand this film. The succinct writing and story delivers all of this for the audience, taking the basic practices of insurance policies (with all of their bureaucratic loopholes) and placing them into a heinous murder plot. It's the kind of film that addresses that damning \"what if\" scenario so many Americans probably contemplate with insurance policies but dare not demoralize. But this is Los Angeles, in the Golden Age 40's, and murder can arise from almost anything. \n\nThe plot opens with Walter Neff, an insurance agent 15+ years in the business. With experience and credentials like that, you'd expect him to recognize scandals. And that's the irony of it--he's seduced by a deadly femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck) to the point of abandoning logic and reason just for a scent of her honeysuckle (you get the point). Neff reports back to his insurance manager, Barton Keyes--a derisive but knowledgeable friend who despises Neff just as much as he trusts him. Keyes is definitely the film's most interesting character, and G. Robinson delivers an Oscar-worthy performance with every scene he's in. Keyes is the guru, the wizard, the indefatigable man who ceaselessly investigates the insurance scam. He keeps everybody on edge, from Neff to the audience, and utilizes his wit to test the limitations of Neff's waning conscience. As a result, what we see is a suspenseful, dark, morbidly funny, and even earnest film that is packed with a cadaverous ambience that can only be defined as film noir. \n\nDouble Indemnity is one of the greatest films to emerge from the 1940's era and made an indelible mark on the genre of film noir. It opened my eyes and enlightened me to films with similar and/or recognizable themes. Honeysuckle never smelt so murderous, or perhaps, murder has never smelt so sweet.",

Featuring superb direction from the great Billy Wilder, beautiful black-and-white cinematogrpahy, and pitch-perfect performances from Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson, Double Indemnity remains an American classic that explores the lines between black and white/good and evil.

MacMurray plays an insurance agent, Walter Neff.  Stanwyck is Phyllis Dietrichson.  These two characters get involved in murdering her husband and making it look like an accidental death so she can get twice as much money off of the insurance policy.  This film is told in flashbacks, as it starts with Neff recording his confession for his co-worker Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson).  Neff then becomes the narrator for the rest of the film through extended flashbacks.  Keyes thinks something is strange and that the death, might not have been accidental.  At this point there are plot twists galore.  Double Indemnity was incredibly well made.  The two leads had great chemistry with one other, and MacMurray was great as an accomplice to murder, a type of role he was certainly not known for.  The black and white cinematography was beautiful, with dim lighting and lots of shadows, just to make the genre a little bit more obvious to everyone who watched.  I loved this film and was thoroughly entertained the entire time.  I would recommend this one as well for those interested in seeing one of the best American films of all time.  I've only seen it once, but I assume it will only get better.  4 out of 4 stars\r\n\r\n-Joseph Sbrilli",

He falls for Phyllis Dietrichson, the wife of a client of his, and is drawn into a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson and pocket the insurance money.  Between the two of them they come up with the perfect murder, so good it not only looks like an accident, but ensures that the insurance pays out double the usual sum insured - double indemnity.  Between them and the money stands Barton Keyes, Pacific Insurance's Head of Claims.  Experienced, wily and possessing a sixth sense for claims fraud he is a formidable adversary...\n\nBrilliant crime drama - a film-noir classic.  Written by Raymond Chandler book and directed by master-director Billy Wilder, this is great on so many levels: the clever plot (especially the murder plan, which is so good you almost want them to succeed); the snappy, often funny, dialogue and the excellent, engaging performances.  Moreover, there's a smoothness and coolness about this, a hallmark of film noir.\n\nOnly things missing from making this one of the greatest movies of all times is a good twist and possibly less predictability.  The use of flashbacks to tell the story sort of gives away the direction the plot is taking.\n\nGood work by Fred MacMurray as Neff, Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis and Edward G Robinson as Keyes.  In hindsight, Humphrey Bogart would have made a better Neff, but then you could say that about any 1940s role requiring a cool, tough, smooth-talking, wise-cracking male lead.  Fred MacMurray does well and doesn't really put a foot wrong, but I kept thinking \"Imagine Bogie in the role...\".\n\nBarbara Stanwyck got a well-deserved Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination for playing Phyllis.\n\nThe film itself garnered seven Oscar nominations but no wins, losing out on Best Picture to Going My Way, the so-so musical starring Bing Crosby.  Billy Wilder got his first Best Director nomination and fourth writing nomination for Double Indemnity.  He would have to wait for his next movie, The Lost Weekend, for his first win.",

            "content": "This is certainly a worthy film and an archetypal film noir, but I can't help but compare it to the novel that it is based on and be a little disappointed. In a lot of ways, the film cannot really be blamed for lacking some of what the novel has; the Production Code of 1944 Hollywood simply would not allow much of the novel's dark content to be put on screen. Still, though, watching this movie today is not nearly as electrifying an experience as reading the James M. Cain novel is.\n\nThe core of the plot, the scheme by an insurance agent and a seductive woman to murder the woman's husband and collect the insurance money, does remain intact, and it's still a compelling story. Much of what happens after the central murder, however, is condensed, erased, or otherwise sanitized. Without wishing to reveal the ending of either work, I'll say that the movie's ending feels much more conventional, whereas the book's ending goes to some truly dark and shocking places. The characters have also lost some depth and intensity in the transition to film.\n\nAll that being said, it is still a good movie. Fred MacMurray's performance is nicely understated. Barbara Stanwyck, in an Oscar-nominated role, does do a good job with the relatively limited scenes she is given, and does have one perverse shot of one of the more disturbing facial expressions I've seen in a movie. Edward G. Robinson makes quite an impression in the smaller role of a suspicious insurance claims adjuster. The movie is well-made, with lots of the stark shadows typical of a good 1940s noir. It's really interesting to consider that, after this, director Billy Wilder went on to make some of the funniest comedies ever, such as Some Like It Hot and The Seven-Year Itch. This movie is worth watching for noir fans, but don't let it replace the experience of reading the book for you.",

            "content": "Billy Wilderâ(TM)s âDouble Indemnityâ is a classic film noir of which I had often heard, but never seen or knew much about, so I had nothing to create expectations around as I went in. I saw it in Greenbriar Theater and noticed that the room was a bit fuller than usual. I guess, unlike Juno, people had not seen it before and had all waited until the last showing, as I had.\n\nThe movie did a great job of absorbing me into its atmosphere from the very beginning. I was definitely interested from the moment I saw the silhouette of the man with the crutches and heard the entrancing music, and having a bleeding man confess to a murder on tape was certainly enough to get my attention.\n\nI thought Fred MacMurrayâ(TM)s performance as the unsavory insurance salesman was interesting. At first, I frowned at his monotone, thinking him just a bad actor, but the scene where explains his motives changed my mind. He compared himself to a casino worker, wanting to rip off the house just because he thought he was the only one who could get away with it. Even for a murder motive, that is remarkably cold-blooded. He really does not feel any moral qualms about it, and the movie is only stronger for never calling him a psychopath.\n\nOn the other hand, his dispassionate demeanor creates an awkward dissonance in his romantic scenes. A lot of people in the theater laughed out loud when Phyllis came to his apartment and they kissed. It was partly funny because he grabbed her so firmly and mashed his face onto hers so indelicately. I also thought his cold monotone and blank expression did not suit the repeated usage of âbaby,â or any other expression of affection. It just seemed unnatural. The line, âShut up, babyâ was especially funny to me.\n\nThe opening credits said that the film was based on a novel by James M. Cain. I have not read it, but my impression while watching the movie is that the screenplay may have quoted from the novel a bit excessively. Walterâ(TM)s voiceover describes the room where he meets with Phyllis in a very literary way. He does not need to describe at all, since, via the magic of cinema, we can see it, and it is an unnecessary digression from Walterâ(TM)s confession to Keyes. If I had to guess, I would say that the description was lifted from the book and grafted onto the script.\n\nThere were other instances of rambling voiceover. One occurred after Walter said he knew where to go to find out if Keyes suspected him. We all instantly knew that he was going to go to his office, but rather than simply cut Keyesâ(TM)s office, Walter pauses for dramatic effect and then spells it out for us. More amusing was when Walter reminisced on Keyesâ(TM)s metaphor about the trolley, and how the last stop is the cemetery. As if we would not understand what that meant, Walter notes what goes on at the cemetery. Then, as if we still were not getting it, he told us straight out that they put dead people there. Not one to leave any dead horse unbeaten, Walter then wondered out loud whether that meant that he or Phyllis would end up dead, as if we could not have followed his line of logic on our own.\n\nDespite all this, as I left the theater, I still thought the movie had an intriguing story- an academic approach to murder. I also found the relationship between Walter and Keyes fascinating and an interesting contrast to the filmâ(TM)s dark heart.",

Both seem more driven by the promise of money and getting away with a crime than really wanting each other, and really ... the real relationship that this film is about is between Robinson and MacMurray.",

            "content": "This film is putting a hard fight to Sunset Blvd on my book as Billy Wilder's best film. Both films are excellently acted, directed, written, and highly entertaining. Sunset Blvd cleverly mixes noir with black comedy, while Double Indemnity is a very intriguing noir thriller, which is certainly one of the bests of the 40s. I didn't like Some Like it Hot or The Apartment as everybody did, though I still can enjoy them, I prefer Witness for the Prosecution actually, but Double Indemnity is one of my favorites of the 1940s. \r\nThe performances in this film are very impressive from its two leads, and from the rest of the cast two. On the opening scene when the main character arrives to tape his confession you can see the concern in his eyes and face, you can see how nervous he is, you can even see he is very sweaty. This is clever acting. The woman also does a good job with her character. No scene in particular comes to my mind, but she throughout is pretty good at her role.\r\nThe writing in this film is incredibly good. Billy Wilder has a great talent for writing. He details his characters with great care, making them what they are supposed to be, giving each of them its own importance. The dialogues are very amusing too in this film. And the general plot is very intriguing and exciting. The screenplay of this film is clearly one of the best of the first half of the 20th century, and probably the best of the 40s, if not it is only topped by the wonderfully dark British noir The Third Man.\r\nBut the spotlight must go to Billy Wilder, the crafter of this movie, the architect, the basis. His direction is extremely well done, with intense, funny and even romantic moments, making the viewer feel the emotions he needs to feel in the right time. He works with his characters in a very good way, directing them all to become their characters and to believe what they are saying. The film's tone and atmosphere is dark, what was an achievement Wilder was looking for, and he does it effectively. \r\nThe film is very thrilling, which is one of my favorite aspects from it and probably what makes it so great for me. The story is  a very intriguing one, and we get attached to the characters from the word go. But it is the great suspense we get from this film that makes me love it. This is what makes it possible to be greater than Sunset Blvd, though it is still a hard choice.\r\nI didn't feel it was perfect enough to give it an E, it felt like there was something that could have been done better, but it is still a very good film that is probably one of my favorites.\r\nAmp Stamp: S for Superb",

            "content": "One of Billy Wilder's weakest efforts, this one suffers from the fact that Wilder isn't necessarily used to writing a straight-up drama rather than his infectious black comedies. Then again, he wrote \"Ace in the Holy\", so there. However, its familiar plot, reserved performances (from Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson), and twist at the end makes this one of those films you need to see during your life. \n\nThis film is about Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who's this god amongst all insurance salesmen until he meets up with Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck), who expresses general discontentment with her husband. With that and his sudden lust for her (he's single), Walter decides to hatch up this plan to make the both of them rich: get the husband to sign up for accident insurance and kill him in an accident of sorts. This seems to go well for the first few days, then Barton Keyes (Robinson) starts looking into it to see if it conforms to standard procedure. Then all hell breaks loose.\n\nMany have stated before me that the cinematography in this film is just amazing - and it is. Wilder tends to make even the most trivial of situations (sitting at an insurance desk, shopping, riding a train) into some of the most frightening of situations. Also, the script isn't what you would expect from a man whose history, until Ed Sikov's \"On Sunset Blvd.\" was published in 1999, was somewhat muddled by stories and general apathy - this seems very suited for English-speaking audiences. No faults - everything's so natural. And so groovy - the result of Billy listening to jazz records in his teenage years.\n\nI recommend it for a film noir aficionado or anybody who wants a change in pace. Don't want the villain to be glamorized? You've come to the right choice, my friend.",

The calculating Phyllis has Walter sell her husband a accident policy, then a short time later kill her husband making it look like accident; so they can collect the $100,000 on the 'Double Indemnity' clause, but then what almost seemed like the perfect crime begins to fall apart because of the two characters absolute mistrust of one another, and the fact that Walter's best friend and colleague Barton Keyes, played by Edward G.

It's hard to picture Walter Neff so easily manipulated into killing a man he doesn't know - the characterization just isn't there - but towards the end it's so easy to sympathize for him.

            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" has been labeled the greatest film noir, and I couldn't agree more. Everything in this movie was spot-on perfect. The dialogue was all natural and every meticulous detail put into writing the script was all there for a REASON. For example in one scene Fred MacMurray's character impersonates a soon-to-be dead man on a train, and has a very brief conversation with a random man. Normally a scene like this would be just to simply add character development, or some sort of humor. But here it all comes full circle in the end, as the \"bad-guy\" gets what is coming to him. Typically in the world of film noir, there never are clear good guys, and bad guys. That is a clear theme in this movie, as ambiguity runs thick. One particular character named Keys(played brilliantly by Edward G. Robinson), starts off to look like the antagonist of the film. Going against the two cocky main characters. But as we get wrapped into this dark story of crime, we side more with him than MacMurray or Stanwyck. This, of course, is a method Billy Wilder uses ingeniously to his advantage, throwing  the audience off balance as to what is right and what is wrong in this movie. In film noir, there is neither. Dark lighting, good camera angles, and contrasting shadows make this movie what it is. That, and some haunting narration by MacMurray throughout the whole duration of the film. It is a particularly dark movie for it's time, but certainly is a classic. All three leads play their rolls quite well. The two main(MacMurray and Stanwyck), both too arrogant to think things through, and Robinson to counter that. Movie like \"Double Indemnity\" expose the darker side of cinema, and prove that Hollywood can do more then just recycled, optimistic films. Of all the noirs made in it's time, and even today, \"Double Indemnity\" has got to be the best of it's kind. Or at least ONE of the best.",

All its elements conjoin with such attitude and panache that it's probably one of the few films where style drips from every frame without overwhelming the equally engaging substance. If any movie were the ultimate crime film, it's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. \n\nFor those who unfamiliar with film noir, it's a genre characterized by the strategic use of black and white film to emphasize the negativity of the human condition. Few noir characters are moral, even fewer are likable. But the look of film noir seems to work some sort of magic wherever it's employed; by its very nature, however, the genre takes itself so seriously that it becomes tough to do without veering into overstatement or parody. When it's done right, the result is DOUBLE INDEMNITY; when it's done wrong, you get Frank Miller's THE SPIRIT. DOUBLE INDEMNITY succeeds because it avoids all the genre pitfalls and doesn't pull any punches, delivering a sly, gritty, and sinister morality tale about sexual temptations and forbidden fruit.\n\nWalter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a stoic, morally ambiguous, and fast talking insurance salesman. When we first meet him, he's also practically dead. Bleeding profusely from a bullet wound in the shoulder, he lumbers weakly into his boss' office and prepares to record a confession of double murder. How and why is what the rest of the film answers, as in the best of noir traditions, our \"protagonist\" must retell his story in first person. And what a story... lust, sex, murder, fraud, and then of course, the inevitable brush with the law. Turns out he was seduced by Phyllis, a sultry femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck) who wanted his help to kill her husband and cash in a major life insurance policy. Foolish average joe that he is, Neff falls for her totally, raising the suspicions of his insurance boss (Edward G. Robinson). What follows is a taut thriller about seedy and sordid murderers who by today's standards might seem tame, but whose snappy, pointed dialogue is loaded with frank double entendres that will still raise your eyebrows if you're really paying attention. In 1944, the Hays Code stipulated that one couldn't use profanity or sexual references overtly, but that just meant Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder had to find creative ways to say just as much in subtler ways. Furthermore, while color films were growing in popularity, DOUBLE INDEMNITY's black and white photography was not only a stylistic choice but also a symbolic one; the controlled range of contrasts symbolizes the characters芒聙聶 literally shady morality. They commit a crime in a black and white world, but we see the moral gray area. Shadows arc high on apartment walls, and in some parts you'll swear there's no way they could fit anymore darkness into the frame. The silhouettes of window shades end up looking like prison bars on the walls, and the smoky haze created by characters' cigarettes never lets us forget that these people are up to no good. It's expertly shot, and anyone seeking to make a crime thriller of any type should school themselves in this film almost exclusively.\n\nSince it was one of the first films to legitimize crime drama, DOUBLE INDEMNITY originally caused quite a controversy. Like many film noirs, it hinges on adultery; its characters are inherently alluring because they芒聙聶re tempted by sex. Second, they芒聙聶re murderers, and the plot explains how to commit a crime for money. These were HUGE red flags in 1944, but with a certain amount of artistry, one could get away with them. So things like the double entendre dialogue passed the censors, but audiences still got it. Plus, it's worth noting that we never see the murder; in fact, the script never even includes the word \"murder\" in connection to the crime. Instead, we see Stanwyck芒聙聶s face. Her husband芒聙聶s being killed right next to her, but we see only her smile; it's a restrained shot for dramatic effect that makes the reality feel worse. (That芒聙聶s noir.) Even smaller details abound, as when MacMurray walks down a street and can芒聙聶t hear his footsteps on the pavement, like he芒聙聶s a dead man. It's a chilling moment that heightens the suspense and foreshadowing. Finally, there's only one moment of moral goodwill in the film--whenever Neff lights boss Edward G. Robinson's cigars for him. It芒聙聶s reversed by the end of the film because one good turn deserves another, but that provides the only emotional core of the picture. Once that happens, it芒聙聶s over. As with most noirs, there are no clear-cut \"good guys\" in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Maybe that's why its style doesn't overwhelm us, because its characters have real, flawed, and honest substance. It's refreshing to see a film that can comment on the depravity of humankind while reinforcing our moral sensibilities and looking amazingly moody while doing it. So do yourself a favor; give in and watch the film.",

It is such a breathtaking, sexy, beautiful film of deliciousness. Well acted and contains terrific, scathing dialogue, this film has turns and twists, and essentially set the bar for mystery and suspense movies of the 1940's. It is a well crafted murder mystery, that essentially has two plots. One follows the enactment of the murder along with the plotting of the brutal crime, and the second, follows the criminal's plan go wrong, with little cracks developing, eventually showing their identity to the world. Credit for greatness must go MacMurray (who some say was not great but I personally could not picture anyone else in this role and he was very good), the sexy and breathtaking Stanwyck, the pervasive Robinson, and two the supporting cast. As well Chandler and Wilder should be complemented for their extraordinary efforts. My favourite film of Wilder's, my favourite film of the 1940's cinema, and one the best films of all time. Masterpiece! Incidently, to those who love watching old movies or are Wilder fans, you must watch his 1960 masterpiece The Apartment and this film at the same time, and you will find some astonishing similarities (although the genre of both films is incredibly different).",

            "content": "This is THE American film noir.  Gripping, taut, clever, dark, and perfectly acted, \"Double Indemnity\" is also a movie that presages and encapsulates its era.  Many have written about the post-war sense of paranoia that shadowed America in the mid-to-late 1940's, as the dark intentions of our WWII Soviet allies became all too clear.  The sense that perhaps there are no good guys, that no one is to be trusted, and that darkness lies beneath every gleaming surface is everywhere here in Billy Wilder's masterpiece.  An essential element of the film's pessimism is its beginning, which is in fact an ending--insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is gravely injured, hobbling into his office to dictate a confession to his boss (Edward G. Robinson).  The Dietrichson case, accident and double indemnity, was indeed a murder, as suspected.  Only the wrong suspect was pursued.  I'm giving away nothing by revealing Neff as the real killer.  \"I did it for money, and for a woman.  Only I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman.\"  Indeed, by the end, Neff no longer wants the treacherous Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck, amazingly enticing and poisonous here).  Neff has been a fool, and a tool, and discovers through his disastrous caper that he may be rotten, only Phyllis is \"a little more rotten.\"  They have conspired to kill Phyllis' husband for the insurance payoff, the oldest scheme in the book, but as an insider Neff has plotted an ingenious chronology of events to throw off any investigation.  Knowing from the outset though that the plan will fall apart lends the proceedings their whole doomed appeal.  We know that this will be a world without happy endings or heroes.  People are unpredictable, fate is cruel, and stylish dialogue exchanges mask deep inner desperation.  Phyllis has secrets, you see, and some are all too willing to talk.  Neff will learn the hard way what every general knows:  a battle plan collapses the minute the battle starts.  He will find himself spinning different stories for different people, desperately back-peddaling and dashing around, under, and ahead of the investigation, Phyllis' enemies, and the vixen herself.  The byplay between the leads is witty to say the least, and their chemistry sizzles, as of course it must in all doomed romances.  It's telling that both the angel (Robinson, playing boss and best friend Keyes) and devil (Phyllis) in Neff's life offer him a path towards his future.  He can choose a promotion and years pushing paper behind a desk with Keyes, or he can go for the easy woman and the easy money.  Unfortunately, Neff will learn that he lives in a world where nothing comes easy but trouble, and where endings are inevitable but not necessarily happy.",

Sleek, stylish, and all too mysterious and intriguing, Double Indemnity is a true noir classic.",

For the most part, quite happy with the results. Yeah, they were mostly predictable, but that meant that I ended up winning the Oscar Pool I was in. No money involved, but I am milking those bragging rights for all they're worth. I only got 3 wrong. I missed Foreign Film, even though I considered switching it at the last minute. I shoulda known that the same thing that happened to Pan's Labyrinth and Waltz With Bashir would happen to this year's frontrunner, The White Ribbon, but didnt listen to my gut there. I did pay attention to that for the sound awards, picking Hurt Locker for both, which is what gave me my edge. Well that, and following EW's advice for the shorts. The one short I missed was Animated Short, and having seen all the nominees I was kinda sad about the result. Yes, Logorama was the most inventive and original at least as far as the visual, but I found the story itself quite boring. If anything was gonna beat out Wallace & Gromit I was hoping for Granny O'Grimm's or The Lady and The Reaper. The last one I missed was adapted screenplay. Did not see Precious coming at all, and was quite sad that what shoulda been a lock for \"Up In The Air\" resulted in that film going home empty handed.\r\n\r\nAs far as the ceremony itself, it was rather unmemorable. My two favorite moments (without thinking too hard about it) were wicked early in the program: NPH's surprise appearance and Christoph Waltz's \"uber bingo\". Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin were great, but nothing much was really happening otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt least now I can relax for a few months on that front. Except for being very gung-ho about Shutter Island, there isnt really much speculating to do yet for next year :-D\r\n\r\nNow--Double Indemnity. I'd actually sat down to watch Swing Time instead, but then went down to check the mail and Double Indemnity was waiting for me (bee tee dubs, I now own or can easily access all the rest of the AFI's). I'd been really wanting to see this one. The whispers of a plot I'd heard really intrigued me. Sounded like my kinda thing.\r\n\r\nSadly, as has often been the case, I was a bit distracted so I didnt get into it as much as I woulda liked. This will definitely merit a second watch at some point in the hopefully not to distant future. I mostly followed the dialogue but missed most of the visual. But the story didnt disappoint.\r\n\r\nReally liked Fred MacMurray. He caught my eye when I recognized him from The Apartment. Dont know why I was so struck by the way he said \"Baby\".\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, starting to crash now. Long day at work and I didnt sleep too well last night, so I should prolly go pick something outta the queue to go sleepy-bye to\r\n\r\nhttp://expletivedleted.livejournal.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the classics of film noir that everybody should see. Fred MacMurray, as ordinary insurance agent Walter Neff, really shows his acting chops, putting on weight for his character and restraining his natural geniality to play an amoral insurance man drawn into an intricate murder plot by his own carnal weakness. MacMurray demonstrates that when he needed to be, he truly was a major acting talent as well as a top Hollywood star. He is all sidelong glances and grimaces, rueful expressions and sudden passion.\r\n\r\nBarbara Stanwyck, playing femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson, gives perhaps her finest performance, making us believe that she really could wrap a man around her little finger and then toss him aside like an empty soda can. The scene with her at the top of the stairs, wrapped only in a towel, is quite steamy even today. Rarely in her body of work does Stanwyck come across as a great seductress, but she manages it here. Another great talent unleashed in a rare opportunity to play against type.\r\n\r\nThe mood is dark, the lighting is all shadows and darkness, and the characters say more with a look than with a page of dialog. Let's face it, anyone can play with light and shadows, that's not too difficult, but making it fit into the story and enhance it, as here, is the mark of genius. Director Billy Wilder was at the top of his game, creating an atmosphere throbbing with passion and innuendo. Despite all the deserved accolades, Wilder has to be the most underrated director ever. The way he could master the film noir, then leave it behind and change with the times, shows phenomenal adaptability.\r\n\r\nBut all that aside, this film is stolen by Edward G. Robinson, absolutely nailing his supporting role as Barton Keyes. Keyes is the kind of back-office guy who always solves the hard projects. His job as an insurance investigator is to try and find out who (if anyone) killed the victim, which would avoid a huge indemnity claim. He and Neff are friends, and Keyes' flaw is that he can't suspect his pal of murder. My favorite scene is when he and Neff are called into the office of their boss and Robinson, completely wrapped up in his job, neglects to bring his suit jacket. Facing a comment about this, he just blows the issue off (\"I didn't realize this was a formal occasion\"), sits down, and starts talking about the case, getting more and more excited. He gets so agitated that, while taking a drink of water to calm down, he accidentally splashes water on his vest (you can barely see this happen). Rather than demand another take, as a lesser actor might, Robinson instead goes with it, and shortly after stops to brush the water off his clothing, which has a double meaning as he is talking to Neff at the time. Brilliant acting job!\r\n\r\nThe plot is the film's weakest point, with a rather straightforward murder at issue and not a lot of mystery surrounding it. But along the way, motivations are questioned, friendships and loyalty are examined and sometimes broken, and all the intricacies of human interaction are put on display and dissected. Watching Neff twist in the wind as he realizes that Keyes is putting two and two together is gripping. The scene of Neff being confronted in front of Keyes by someone who happened to see him at the scene of the crime, and almost (but not quite) being recognized, has tension worthy of the best of master Alfred Hitchcock. MacMurray's narration at times does get a bit heavy-handed, but ultimately everything is wrapped up in just the perfect way.\r\n\r\nFour stars out of four.",

            "content": "This wonderful 40's thriller sees Wilder at his best. The plot may be complex on the surface, but it can be stripped away to reveal a dark simplicity. MacMurray captures the right amount of morbid naivety, to reflect a manipulated man, but one that was always capable of killing. It's both his curiosity and his boredom that reels him in. It's a great film to watch unravel, with Robinson doing an excellent job at slowly pulling at the thread. There's also a welcome touch of morality to the atmosphere. You may like these people, but you don't want them to get away with it. This makes for such great viewing that it can be watched again and again.",

There was even a flirtatious exchange between the two of them early in the movie that had the Music Box audience chuckling. It was made up of a series of suggestive lines each of which started with \"S'pose.\"\n\nStill, this was an excellent, classic noir film, moving from shadowy streets and roads, to trains and train stations, to a labyrinth of an office building. And Stanwyck plays the archetype film Noir femme fatale, leading MacMurray on a path of evil. From the beginning of the movie, MacMurray narrates the story of his crime into a Dictaphone machine for his friend and nemesis Edward G. Robinson, a clever insurance inspector. \nML         http://noirjournal.typepad.com/noir-journal/",

            "content": "Double Indemnity... What can really be said? Aside from being, quite possibly, my favorite film and an undeniable film noir masterpiece, it is a very dark and challenging work from one of the most skilled artists of his time (or any other for that matter); for those and many other reasons, no words are capable of doing this film justice. However, seeing as I have already started writing, I shall press on and give it a lame attempt.\r\n\r\n    Double Indemnity is about an insurance salesman named Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who becomes smitten with one of his company's clients' sexy wife (Barbara Stanwick in what is by far the best performance of her amazing career). As the sexual tension between them rises, Walter is duped into murdering her husband so they can collect on his insurance policy. The only thing standing in their way is Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), the insurance company's claims investigator who is absolutely positive that everything is not as it seems.\r\n\r\n    While this film has numerous strengths, I'd say its biggest is its ability to sustain a mood of tension throughout. This has a lot to do with the Direction (Billy Wilder) and the brilliant acting, but I think the most contributive (Firefox doesn't recognize this word... lol) element is the amazing screenwriting (the film was scripted by renown novelist Raymond Chandler and the director Billy Wilder), which stands out to me as possibly the best ever; whatever the reason, this movie is a classic of the highest order and is practically demanded viewing for any and every film lover. Watch it... and even if you don't like it, at least I won't egg your house.\r\n\r\n7 Oscar Nominations - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress in a Lead Role, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Music, Best Sound Recording",

            "content": "Hands down, one of the best noir films out there. Interesting, dark and thrilling Double Indemnity is an instant classic on the DVD shelf. Billy Wilder directs and writes a deep followup to James A. Cain's novel. In my opinion, Wilder's adaption is actually better than the novel. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are a beautiful scandalous couple on screen and supporting roles from Porter Hall and Edward Robinson as MacMuray's boss is a great refreshing role as the funny, stubborn Barton Keyes.\r\n    Double Indemnity revolves around the life of insurance broker Walter Neff (MacMurray) who ends up in a weird love triangle with a rich man's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson. When she gives him the haunting idea of murdering Dietrichonson's estranged husband, all hell breaks loose and the insurance money becomes a bigger hassle to obtain, the couple slowly drive to madness, and ultimatly a tragic, unforgettable end. \r\n\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\n\r\nNeff and Dietrichson are a powerhouse couple, she is beautiful, he is charming. The script fills the classic 1940's noir sterotype, easily seen in the Cohen's and Tarintino films. Dark, haunting and totally unforgiving a classic tragic film at its best. Brilliant acting, beautiful filming and excellent music for the time frame, Double Indemnity is Billy Wilder and his finest of moments. Keyes is the comic relief and plays off really nice. Elements of suspense and modern thriller litter the film. To me, this is way better than Scarlet Street.\r\n\r\nVERDICT:\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity is a great noir film. Regardless if your into the genre or not, the film offers a great story, great acting, making it an overall enjoyable thrill ride way beyond its time.",

            "content": "The genre that is film noir can trace its roots to this 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder. Double Indemnity is called the start of film noir, and what I mean by this is you have a femme fatale, or a female villain, a hard-boiled detective, and a plot usually involving murder. But there were other films that could be considered film noir before Double Indemnity. So technically, we can not give this film the title of starting film noir. Yet, Double Indemnity can be a good example of how to describe film noir and the process of how it can be described.\r\n\r\nSalesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) comes to visit a man about car insurance, but Walter only confronts the mans wife, Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck). After seeing the wife a couple more times, Phyllis finally confesses: she hates her husband and wants him dead. So, after some persuasion, Phyllis and Walter plan on killing the husband so that the wife can get all the money. Everything goes according to plan, until Walters partner, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), gets a sneaky suspicion about the murder. And from there, it gets into some dark territory.\r\n\r\nThe three main stars, Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson, are the central focus points in this film. They deliver excellent performances that show what they can be capable of. Billy Wilder did an excellent job at directing this film. He really captured the detective genre that was popular in the 1930s and brought film noir into the 1940s.\r\n\r\n\"Double Indemnity does a pretty good job at creating sets. These sets showcase buildings that detail Southern California very well. The lighting also gives a good job detailing the sets and the scenery. My only problem with the lighting is that it can get too dark and you cant see whats going on. The music here is a fine orchestrated piece that can stand on its own.\r\n\r\nOverall, Double Indemnity is an amazing film that still holds out on its own today. Double Indemnity is a movie that needs to be seen and I highly recommend it.",

You don't see too many suave insurance salesmen like this guy.)would help assist this beautiful woman in the murder of her calloused husband.\r\n\r\nBilly Wilder helms the Director's chair for this flick and never fails when he's behind the camera lens. The atmosphere of the film was dark and brooding while also giving barbara stanzwyk's character this sexy but sadistic look to her.\r\n\r\nThe music is beautiful is this film! This is also the case in Sunset Boulevard (the other Billy Wilder film i've seen of this kind of nature). Billy Wilder knows how to edit a movie so that the music weaves together with the visuals and the movements of the characters. The sharp stings of the ensemble come in at just the right time with beautiful sweeping glory. The music gets dark at just the approriate times it needs to.\r\n\r\nI particualarly loved Edward G. Robinson, who plays the good guy of sorts ( or is he the bad guy? i don't know who i'm really rooting for!) in this later film of his. He's a fast talking man with some great dialogue in this film and Ed Robinson plays his part convincingly well. i'd have to say his acting is above all the rest. But, I gotta give Barbara Stanzwyk credit for playing A sexy dame while also giving the audience this brooding feeling that she shouldn't be trusted. Should she? Well, folks, you'll have to watch and find out for yourself\r\n\r\nSome cite this as one of the first film noirs (although I think M should helm that honor myself) and the film has all of the elements that makes one great.

And, I can equate the twists in a thriller equal to the passing bridges. It's thrill! The two most inconvincible professionals are tax auditors and insurance clearance agents. It's not only the attribute of police to investigate a crime but also for an insurance officer. There are few films associated where the crime is based on insurance. I remember one Tamil movie which followed this theme - Kei Niraya kaasu with Nagesg acted in dual roles.\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity - 1944/Thriller\r\nAdapted & Directed: Billy Wilder\r\nBased on a novel by John Cain.\r\n\r\nPlot\r\n\r\nThe entire story is narrated by Walter Neff, a charming insurance agent. Phyllis is rich man's wife who happens to meet Neff once in her home. They slowly develop a friendship and gets into a relation. They get slowly into a dangerous and an almost perfect plan to murder the rich man. In turn, they plan to get the insurance money and lead a new life.\r\n\r\nThe plan looks easy but complicated as much as a big mess. Neff's boss Barton Keyes, an outstanding insurance investigator who has a little guy inside him [intuition] leading him to crack any great case. With these elements, what happens is the plot for a perfect thriller. The story moves in flashbacks from Neff's view and involves the clash of different fates of all the characters involved. That makes this movie a super thriller.\r\n\r\n\r\nView\r\n\r\nAlfred Hitchcock movies were the eye opener for me, which stated that black & white movies were not slow movies. There are certain films which move at the speed of a bullet train [ Tamil example : Gilli ]. There are many examples of this genre.. Spellbound(1945), The killing(1956), Strangers on a train are few to quote for now. This film is a classic example of a fast executed script.\r\n\r\nThe BGM is an inevitable part of storytelling - even I remember we used to narrate the action films with sounds and BGM.. In fact, even when we fight in childhood we make sounds [ Dishaaal, Dishyum :) ]. That's the power of BGM. This movie got the perfect BGM which enhances the thrill and increases our temptation to look for what happens next.\r\n\r\nI liked the light and shadows part of this thriller. More'shadows' are used in this film to represent the darkness of the events involved in the story. Somehow, this movie resembles 'the strangers on a train'. The best part is the characterization of Barton Keyes. He is one of the sparkling and brilliant characters in the story. His dialogues are rally outstanding and soundly convincing. That's the reason I used his dialogue as quoted in the beginning.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nA perfect thriller for a Saturday night movie time.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't an accident.. it wasn't a suicide.. What it was then ?\r\n\r\n\r\n-Toto.",

The film is infused with gritty, sharp, edgy black and white shadows, much like the shadows of deception, mistrust and evil the characters move in and out of.  The world created in this film is a hardboiled one, with some truly crackling dialogue by the legendary Raymond Chandler (\"I wanted to see her again, close, without that silly staircase between us.\").  The standout performance is from one of Hollywood's finest character actors, Edward G. Robinson, playing the gruff, cynical, straight-as-an-arrow claims investigator Barton Keyes, wonderfully navigating his character between what he knows to be his gut feeling and his quest to prove it.  In the end, it really is the brilliant craft of this great movie that stays with you, with each character moving between their own lies, deceptions and flaws as the narrative deftly moves in perfect pace and unison.  Although not as hardnosed as its source novel (which in turn is a masterpiece of crime writing), this is Hollywood filmmaking at is very best.",

Understanding America at this time in history can allow me to see why it took 8 years for the script to be approved by hollywood's standards, why this film is one of my all time favorites! It's stood the test of time and why it's surpassed the films in it's day, especially the film it lost best picture to at the academy awards that season. But the film is controversal because of its content, probably why it didn't win, politics, people in america didn't like it at first and there would've been outrage. Nonetheless it did get nominated still, shows that there's something there, something more to this film. The 1st person narration, classic noir, just has me on edge waiting to see what's going to happen next. I simply love everything about it.",
