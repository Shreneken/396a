    "summary": "Writer and notorious marriage detractor Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) falls for girl-next-door Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), and they tie the knot on Halloween. When the newlyweds return to their respective family homes to deliver the news, Brewster finds a corpse hidden in a window seat. With his eccentric aunts (Josephine Hull, Jean Adair), disturbed uncle (John Alexander), and homicidal brother (Raymond Massey), he starts to realize that his family is even crazier than he thought.",

            "content": "My only complaint is that sometimes Cary Grant isn't on the screen. The man is just ludicrously charming. \n\nFrank Capra made some incredibly sweet movies, but sometimes he goes so overboard with the faith in humanity, they become sickly sweet; senators overturning decades of corrupt behavior out of guilt, or landlords all of a sudden finding a soul and stop themselves from throwing the old widow out on a snowy wintery night. Arsenic and Old Lace is a refreshingly different story for the beloved director to lend his talents to, a black comedy that technically involves a series of murders and an insance escaped criminal but is relentlessly upbeat; Grant is a screwball comedy master here, with such top-notch timing and insane, cooky energy that you wouldn't expect him to have been one of the most acclaimed leading men of all time. Though the script certainly has all the limitations of a stage adaptation, few scripts that started in the theatre can claim to have this level of unpredictability or free-form humor. It's both consistently funny on the surface level (thanks to some excellent performances from Grant, and both Josephine Hull and Jean Adair as his eccentric aunts), and as a class criticism of old blue blood American families with their oddly twisted ideals; many films of recent years that tackle similar themes (Triangle of Sadness, The Menu, etc.) seem to feel the need to be somber, but Capra adapts a riotous stance to arguably greater effect. Love that you never see a body the entire time, despite about half a dozen opportunities for one to appear. \n\nI feel so bad for Peter Lorre, Hollywood treated him like a monster because he had a slightly distinct appearance and an unusual accent. He had real skill but it got constantly overlooked because of typecasting. Shame Boris Karloff couldn't reprise his stage role here, but the script gives him plenty of callouts. (4/5)",

The rest of the cast, especially the two aunts (Hull and Adair reprising their Broadway performances) and the two brothers (Massey and Alexander) give great performance with dead-pan comic delivery.

            "content": "Arsenic and Old Lace might be one of the funniest movies ever made. There are two things that make it clear that comedy is hitting on all cylinders for me: 1) It makes me laugh out loud even when I\u2019m watching all by myself, and 2) It makes me laugh out loud even when I\u2019ve seen it several times before. This movie pulls off both of those things from start to finish. It has all the types of comedy I love including the way it willingly breaks the fourth wall more than once. It all resonates with me, and it\u2019s one of those rare movies that I wish would last even longer so I could keep having fun with it. I don\u2019t care what anyone says about career comedians (like Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, or even Bill Murray) they haven\u2019t got anything on Cary Grant. He can get huge laughs with nothing more than a surprised expression. They surround him with such an amazing cast too. The entire Brewster clan is delightful, particularly Josephine Hull and Jean Adair who play the sweet aunts who are completely oblivious to the error in there ways. In fact, despite the ridiculous nature of all the things happening, every actor plays it straight when the script calls for it. What\u2019s remarkable about Arsenic and Old Lace is that even though it feels so chaotic, there\u2019s a legitimate story going on that makes sense if you can stop laughing long enough to keep track of it. There\u2019s even a creepy menace created by the amazing Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre. Yet even they have comedic moments and show some awareness of the wackiness of everything that is happening around them. I suppose things wrap up a bit too conveniently at the end, but if you\u2019re putting that much critical thought into the story structure then you\u2019re missing out on the fun. I will watch Arsenic and Old Lace at any time and will always love it with all my heart.",

            "content": "ter a summer of enduring a near constant bombardment of blockbuster movies driven more by special effects that the emotional connect emanating from heartfelt performances, I find myself roaming the classic section of my film library. Like Ismail in the iconic opening paragraph of Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick,' I seek to address my cinematic restlessness by immersing myself in something greater. In this case, I find solace in the older films of my catalog, ones that have withstood the test of time by helping to define the means of artistic expression referred to as cinema. I was drawn to a personal favorite genre, the dark comedy. The ability of this type of story to elicit laughter in defiance of the serious, somber themes that encompass hardship, defeat, and death is among the most difficult types of category for a storyteller to master but when achieved the product of such a fertile imagination is a genius. Officially defined as \"a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is considered taboo,\" its very nature mak3s it difficult to present to a general audience. It is certain to undermine some sense of moral integrity, The film that caught my eye and engaged my brain remains a personal favorite and is cited frequently as a significant influence in introducing this genre to mainstream entertainment, 'Arsenic and Old Lace.' Hat its core is a story about a pair of unremorseful serial killers that dispatch men devoid of emotional ties. The plot device of having the murderers be senior women living in a respectable neighborhood in Brooklyn only appears to intensive the heinous nature of the acts routinely performed. The effect sustained by the story is humorous. Despite the amoral connotations instilled in the premise. Released during the height of the human tragedy permeating life through the global horror of World War II, it would seem the absolute most insensitive time to feature such a topic. The contemporary proved to be overwhelmingly positive permitting the film to embrace its historical place in film history.\n\nThe story is concerned with a well-established and respected Brooklyn family, the Brewsters. Since their arrival on the Mayflower, they have retained the status as the epitome of White, Anglo-Saxon Protestants proud of their lineage demonstrated by the images of past generations adorning the walls of the family home. The family member currently in the public eye is Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) who has written many several books denouncing marriage as an antiquated superstition. He finds himself in a hypocritical position when he falls in love. The object of his romantic attention is the literal manifestation of one of the oldest stereotypes of a romantic tale, the girl next door, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). They married on October 31st, Halloween day, and before going off for they honeymoon Mortimer wants to stop at the family home to tell his elderly aunts, Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair). Mortimer's uncle John (John Alexander) resides there. If the Brewster family were devoid of the financial and social standing they enjoy, John would be considered insane, but such a position in society permits John seen as 'eccentric.' He believes that he is Theodore Roosevelt. As a manifestation of this delusion, he tends to yell \"Charge\" as he runs up the stairs imitating Roosevelt's famous charge up San Juan Hill. The construction of the fundamental elements of a dark comedy is especially crucial due to the fine line between humorous and bad taste. The craftsmanship exhibited in this story set the bar at such a high level that those choosing to follow in this genre would encounter an exceedingly arduous time even approaching the artistry displayed here. Considering the newspapers and radio broadcasts of the time were overwhelmed with the growing tragedy, the prelude to a second global war. This was not an emotional atmosphere conducive to a humorous consideration of death.\n\nMortimer was already experiencing a significant paradigm shift in his publicly known disdain for marriage, his new father-in-law, Reverend Harper (Grant Mitchell), was obviously an enthusiastic supporter of the institution. Returning to his quaint family home to visit his loving elderly aunts held expectations of glad tidings. Much to his shock, he discovers that Martha and Abby held such relationships so vital to continued happiness that when they encountered a bachelor devoid of familiar support they felt the most human action was to ease them out of their isolation with the fatal combination of arsenic and sweet wine. They leveraged Teddy's delusional persona to their best advantage. He dug down there convinced that he was digging the Panama Canal in the basement. He was providing the final resting place for the corporal remains of his aunt's victims. Advertising a spare room for rent was a common practice and guaranteed to attract the demographic, or perhaps more accurately, victim profile, they desired.\n\nWhen audiences think about serial killers the image that comes to mind typically is one of a seriously antisocial man, obviously overwhelmed by a plethora of mental problems. The pair of elderly spinster sisters presents the epitome of harmless eccentricity. Most families had examples of such people with many also embracing a harmlessly delusional relative like 'Teddy.' Back then such benign psychological afflictions were not addressed by institutionalization but directly by the family, the appreciation of these circumstances by modern audiences may be hindered through their belief in the currently approved methods of intervention, but for a long time, the circumstances found in this stately Brooklyn home was commonplace and very relatable.\n\nThe moment that ignites the main motivator plunging Mortimer into the thick of his insane circumstances occurred when he found a dead body in the downstairs window seat. Mr. Grant built his considerable reputation performing in roles of distinction. The usual roles he undertook were debonair, controlled and in charge. The considerable scope of his talents was often best showcased playing against type such as the bewildered executive in Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' of a comic part like this. A man that exudes control set in such bizarre, surrealistic circumstances grabs the attention of the audience. An actor of such extraordinary skill as Carey Grant a movie that might have easily spired into ruination became one of the cinema's genre-defining gems. It does help considering that the setting is kept simple. The story unfolds in the familiar surroundings as a parlor among beloved family members. This was made possible by the origins of the story. Before its translation, to the silver screen, it was a highly popular Broadway play. A stage play is favorable to such an intimate feeling. The stage by nature, is simplistic, each detail in place for a specific purpose. When a setting is stripped of extraneous elements, the focus is shifted to the characters more than usual. It enhances the ability for the filmmaker to go to some extremes in the various plot devices. Without this, the ensuing craziness would be unsustainable. Mortimer concisely describes the situation with the memorable quote, \"Insanity runs in my family, practically gallops.\" There is a kinetic component that imbues a slapstick feel that helps to offset the morbid plot points. The police are called in ostensibly in pursuit of Mortimer's brother Johnathan (Raymond Massey). He is a psychopathic criminal accompanied by his alcoholic accomplice, plastic surgeon Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). Johnathan is a murdered currently bordered with the problem of disposing of the body of his latest victim. This is a film that must be seen by anyone with a serious infatuation of films. Not only did it help define a genre it is undoubtedly one of the most clever comedies made",

Now, I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's not only against the law, its wrong!  It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.  He wouldn't understand.  What I mean is, well, this is developing into a very bad habit!\" ... all while hunched over and gesticulating.  This is a loud movie, with one brother believing he's Teddy Roosevelt yelling 'Charge!' as he runs up the stairs and slams his bedroom door repeatedly, characters rapidly entering scenes in a pell-mell confusion of trying to hide bodies, threaten each other, commit others to mental institutions, etc etc. It's also all over the map.  \n\nAt first I thought Capra may have threaded the needle and been able to deliver both a dark comedy and a drama, since Raymond Massey's glowering and Peter Lorre's simpering are quite sinister, and a nice counterpart to Cary Grant and the sweet old ladies played so wonderfully by Josephine Hull and Jean Adair.  However, the movie dragged on, and was far too long at 118 minutes.  Some may like the madcap frenzy Capra created based on the stage play, and I have to say there are some nice moments and lines (\"Insanity runs in my family.  It practically gallops.\"), but overall the movie gets to be a little much, and doesn't stand the test of time, at least for me.",

It also starred Grant in the lead role, as well as having a comparable style of haphazard black comedy. Yet this film had much more sinister themes with the bizarre story line of the serial killing elderly aunts, and perhaps more bizarre, the brother Jonathan and his sidekick. The film doesn't drag on, with the plot thickening with a new revelation every few minutes. It could be considered slightly unique in the fact that it is almost entirely set in one room. Although I'm sure there are many others, the only other occurrence of this that springs to mind is 12 Angry Men, and this clearly comes about because it is a play adaption.
