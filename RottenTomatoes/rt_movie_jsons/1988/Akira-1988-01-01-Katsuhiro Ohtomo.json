            "content": "Akira é uma obra-prima do audiovisual que ainda me surpreende a cada ano. Durante duas horas o filme nos transporta para um mundo completamente perturbador, onde a destruição e ambivalência estão onipresentes na sociedade. Um filme para nunca se esquecer.\nÉ original, é sombrio e é violento, mas, por ser tão criativo, é uma experiência marcante e as vezes difícil. Um espetáculo furioso de cores e movimentos dinâmicos. Com um roteiro ousado e intrigante.\n\nA estranheza de Akira é surpreendente e as vezes desconcertante. Mas nisso tudo há um arrebatamento catatônico em sua visão de mundo terminado e renascido como uma coisa familiar e diferente ao mesmo tempo. Embora sua trama de ficção cientifica tipicamente complicada e seu amplo conjunto de personagens que ocasionalmente confundem quem assiste beirando a incoerência, Akira foi feito para ser ousado e desafiador em cada ponto. É difícil não ficar maravilhado com as paisagens urbanas gigantescas desenhadas à mão que compõe todo um quadro fotográfico rico de ação e cores de arregalar os olhos. As perseguições de moto são emocionantes, no entanto, a dedicação está nos planos de fundo amplos, bem como multidões de pessoas e outros detalhes ricos que compõem o cenário preenchendo a tela, explosões acontecendo à distância e uma sensação palpável que, de tão palatável, cai o queixo fazendo de Akira o clássico que é onde gerações futuras beberam em sua fonte.\n\nMuitas obras seguintes usaram Akira como base criativa, como Matrix, Minority Report, Batman: Cavaleiro das Trevas, A Origem e até mesmo Star Wars se inspirou na animação. Akira influenciou a cultura pop no geral criando um imaginário dentro do subconsciente coletivo quando se fala de ficção futurística se tornando uma das obras de animação mais influentes da história já feita. Uma conquista tão extraordinária que exige ser vista mais de uma vez para reavaliação e adquirir a mais profundas camadas profundas de relevância contida, e ser apreciado como um marco não só para a animação ou cinema, mas toda arte em si.",

I first watched Akira as a teenager with a friend of mine as we were first getting into Japanese anime at the time. Brad and I, as well as my brother Jon have continued watching anime the past decade now and still Akira is one of the most unique and imaginative anime of all time. Watching now I still find it a wonder to behold and amazed at how old it is and that it looks so new and has aged beautifully. If you are a fan of anime or any animated works at all and are matured enough to handle some violence you will have an amazing journey to travel watching Akira. Highly Recommended!",

The film successfully blends its cinematic influences, most apparent Blade Runner, within its unique storyline, bringing to life something fresh in its own right. I love the look and feel of this movie. Neo-Tokyo's atmosphere is presented in a beautiful-hazy glow as the city comes to life with color. Its gritty environments are reminiscent of the slums of a major metropolitan city in the early 1990s, yet the film doesn't feel aged and outdated. From an artistic perspective the movie is visually stunning and a masterpiece in cel animation.\nThe film's second act struggles to hold the same cohesiveness as the first. Slowing down to introduce new characters, their motivations, and storylines. Its epic conclusion requires additional research to fully understand the ending, and I can see where Otomo struggled to convert Akiras's massive story into a 2 hour run time. All of which doesn't take away from the movie's enjoyment, but inspires you to dive deeper into the world of Akira. Its gory animation and futuristic themes make it required viewing for all fans of anime and sci-fi films alike.",

If the movie would've remained a straightforward, cyberpunk-ish action thriller, and been about 20 minutes shorter, I'd have enjoyed it more and rated it higher. The 2nd half of this movie just lost me completely. was able to follow the plot along for the most part, but my god did it devolve into a stupendously over-the-top, bloated and exhausting mess. Lots of random shit levitates, lots of shit explodes, characters fly with capes on, and some of them literally inflate until they explode. Individually, these aspects Wouldn't bother me in a different movie, but the fact that Akira turns into this in the 2nd half just made the entire thing feel like it was cut into 2 halves that didn't resemble each other at all.\nreally wanted to love this movie, and I was digging it initially, but in all honesty it exhausted and bored me by the end. Give me an anime movie that resembles both the tone and mood of the first half hour of Akira, but remains that way for its entirety.",

Just like the storytelling that was thrilling, shocking and heart-breaking did, likewise with the use of sound, the silence was even more haunting and intense than those scenes with sound, the excellent dialogue, characters that are developed so well(for a character-driven film you'd expect that, the main characters' conflict is especially well done) that you do root for them and a message that I highly appreciate and don't feel it's over-didactic. All in all, amazing, a real landmark for not only anime but also animation in general. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

However as great as it was, a lot of it seems disjointed which was probably because they shoved 120 chapters of over 2000 pages of manga into a 120 minute movie.  I would really like to see this adapted as a tv series instead of more movies, that would really expand the story so you can understand why the people did what they did and how it really unfolded from start to finish.  Making a movie at a pace of 1 chapter a minute really makes you think what they had to cut away and make it understandable still in such a short movie.",

During a violent protest, the hot-headed Shōtarō Kaneda leads his vigilante bōsōzoku gang, the Capsules, against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an esper who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. Assisted by fellow esper Masaru, Japan Self-Defense Forces Colonel Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes Tetsuo away, and arrests the Capsules. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist within the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her and his gang. At a secret government facility, Shikishima and his head of research Doctor Ōnishi discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for the singularity that destroyed Tokyo in 1988. Esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction, but the city's parliament dismisses Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm. Meanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to run away from Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend Kaori, but they are ambushed by the Clowns. The Capsules save Tetsuo and Kaori, but Tetsuo begins suffering intense headaches and hallucinations and is taken back to the hospital. After overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers, Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell. At the hospital, the espers try to assassinate Tetsuo via hallucinations, but the attempt is thwarted. He then searches for them in a fit of rage, easily killing any orderlies and militiamen blocking his path. The resistance group infiltrates the hospital, and Kiyoko draws Kei and Kaneda into Shikishima and the espers' futile attempts to stop Tetsuo. Kiyoko tells Tetsuo that Akira, located in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium's construction site, could help Tetsuo with his powers. After rejecting everyone around him, especially Kaneda, Tetsuo escapes the hospital and hunts for Akira...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Akira is strikingly bloody and violent, but its phenomenal animation and sheer kinetic energy helped set the standard for modern anime.\" Anime News Network's Bamboo Dong commends the Limited Edition's DVD for its \"superbly translated\" English subtitles and the commendable English dubbing, which \"sticks very close to the English translation, and the voice actors deliver their lines with emotion\". THEM Anime's Raphael See applauds the film's \"astounding special effects and clean, crisp animation\". Chris Beveridge comments on the Japanese audio, which brings \"the forward soundstage nicely into play when required. Dialogue is well placed, with several key moments of directionality used perfectly\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times commends Otomo's artwork, stating \"the drawings of Neo-Tokyo by night are so intricately detailed that all the individual windows of huge skyscrapers appear distinct. And these night scenes glow with subtle, vibrant color\". Richard Harrison of The Washington Post comments on the pace of the film, stating that the author \"has condensed the narrative sprawl of the comics to provide coherence, though there's a bit of \"Back to the Future Part II\" incompleteness to the story. That hardly matters, since the film moves with such kinetic energy that you'll be hanging on for dear life\". Roger Ebert compares the film to Mad Max, calling it \"very gory, very gruesome, but entertaining in its own demented way.\" Variety praises aspects of the film \"from the imaginative and detailed design of tomorrow to the booming Dolby effects on the soundtrack\" but criticizes the \"slight stiffness in the drawing of human movement\". Kim Newman of Empire commends the film's \"scintillating animated visuals, with not one – not one – computer-assisted shot in sight\". Chicago Tribune's Dave Kehr commends Otomo's \"excellent animation-specific ideas: Vehicles leave little color trails as they roar through the night, and there are a number of dream sequences that make nice use of the medium's ability to confound scale and distort perspective\". Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies claims that the anime \"remains fresh and exciting, easily holding its own against the products of two decades of massive technical advancement\". Meanwhile, in February 2004, Dan Persons of Cinefantastique listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", simply referring to the film as \"the film that changed everything.\"\n\nFinally I have seen this 1988 Japanese animated post-apocalyptic cyberpunk action film directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, based on Otomo's 1982 manga of the same name. It is widely regarded by critics as one of the greatest animated and science fiction films ever made, as well as a landmark in Japanese animation. It is also a pivotal film in the cyberpunk genre, particularly the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre, as well as adult animation.The film had a significant impact on popular culture worldwide, paving the way for the growth of anime and Japanese popular culture in the Western world as well as influencing numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. \"Akira\" is a very violent and a bit wobbly post-apocalyptic tale that didn´t really do it for me I must say. Then again I have never been an animated fan nor Manga fan, so that sort of doesn´t make me the best reviewer of this film. I think nevertheless that one should´ve seen this film.",

I went with 2 stars for this movie, it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was a long watch in my opinion. I am not the biggest anime fan but I am and have been seeing a lot more anime over time. Tbh I didn't quite understand or get this movie.

            "content": "Akira reinvents how mature anime can be.\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo's legendary anime, post-apocalyptic, science-fiction, psychological thriller Akira (1988). Otomo's ambitious direction is always impressive as his foresight into the future deeper feeling of anime is astounding. Atsushi Okui and Katsuji Misawa's cinematography uses these far wide shots to make the action feel epic on a massive scale, while the conversations are all close-ups on faces to really capture the genuine emotion of each figure.\n\nAfter three viewings, I think I finally understand the complex and surreal plot. It's really about a loss of order in Japanese government, military and politicians overstepping their bounds, children lost in the system, teenagers rebelling against an unfair world, and the cruel lack of ethics in science, all framed by the internal suffering of one teenage boy named Tetsuo. Katsuhiro Otomo and Izo Hashimoto's writing is sophisticated and mature as they reinvent what anime can be to the medium. Akira is a fantastic viewing experience as I have been shocked every single time I see it with that grotesque body horror ending with mind blowing implications.\n\nAkira is unlike any other anime film because of its groundbreaking scientific ideas about raising children with psychic abilities like Chronicle or X-Men, but years before many of these concepts. Akira's influence can be felt in every anime after it. It takes production designer Hiroshi Ono's cyberpunk aesthetic seriously with futuristic weapons, vehicles, labs, and other tech in a world barren of decency. Akira is stuffed with bloody violence, body horror, intense gore, and constant screams of agony. Akira bears a dark maturity with a nihilistic view on what the future of humanity looks like after a calamity. The empathetic viewpoint of disturbed or abandoned teens is very interesting and thoughtful. Coupled with that brilliantly unexpected finale, Akira takes you away for a wild ride.\n\nThe hand drawn animation is stunning for its gritty realism and meticulously detailed designs. The fluid motion of characters running, shooting, or riding motorbikes has never looked so frenetic. Takeshi Seyama's editing is so fastly cut that Akira's 124 minutes fly by like Tetsuo with his supervillain powers, cape included. Shoji Yamashiro's unorthodox score utilizes traditional Japanese drums and sounds so that everything feels eerie, except with a religious feel as Akira references God for one of its many themes. Keiji Muraki's sound design fills Tokyo with noisy air vents, car crashes, explosions, gunfire, car engines, helicopter blades, and creepy lasers for an unsettling level of noise.\n\nI recommend watching Akira's restored blu-ray that has never looked better. I enjoyed the restored Japanese original voice cast with English subtitles for an authentic feel while watching Akira. Mitsuo Iwata's passionate voice for Kaneda is powerful with a moving performance. Nozomu Sasaki's iconic power hungry voice acting for Tetsuo is mind blowing. He captures all the hurt and distress that Tetsuo is experiencing. They are phenomenal lead actors for Akira.\nMami Koyama as the rebel agent Kei is compellingly serious. Tesshou Genda is mature and intriguing as the rebel organizer Ryu. Yuriko Fuchizaki is sympathetic as the meek Kaori in Akira, who you just want to be alright. \n\nIn conclusion, Akira is probably the most viscerally shocking picture I've ever watched. I can see why it's influential. I can certainly say I appreciate its masterful craftsmanship and ambition, but I also find it entertaining with breathtaking animation and powerful action. Seeing Akira is like watching the world end.",

            "content": "\"Neo Tokyo is about to explode,\" boasts the neon-bathed artwork for this cornerstone of anime, and that's true on so many levels. Three decades removed from the megaton blast that annihilated Japan's capital and sparked a third world war, the physical rebuilding process is nearly complete, but societal wounds are still very raw. As demonstrations grow violent in the streets, politicians line pockets and point fingers, motorcycle gangs rove the highway and the military quietly readies a coup, a secret, pre-war government program is losing control of its super-powered test subjects. And, naturally, it's all come to a head at once; a reverberating chorus of disaster that's suddenly reached its apocalyptic crescendo.\n\nAkira is every bit as rich, dense and complex as that description sounds. While many of those arching themes are grandiose in nature, essentially wide-angle subject matter, the story itself is quite personal. We get a sense of the big picture as it's suffered by key individuals; a cocky street punk, his beta dog buddy, an out-of-her-depth resistance fighter, a military general and a trio of disfigured, omnipotent children. It's a mysterious film. It does not give easy answers, but the truth is there for those willing to dig. There's just too much going on, too many massive set pieces and tidal shifts, to slow down for anyone. At times, that can make it feel cryptic and inaccessible. In those cases, I'm afraid, the hyperactive pace, towering scale, breathtaking action scenes, striking visual feats and monumental soundtrack cuts will have to suffice. Even if you don't get the ending (which, let's be honest, is way out in space somewhere), the journey to get there is everything.\n\nI don't know if this would've been a ten the first time I watched it, way back in the mid '90s, but it would've been in the neighborhood. After soaking it in, over the course of so many years and repeat viewings, it's not even an argument. Akira is one of the most ambitious, and rewarding, animated films ever made. It's a certifiable masterwork.",

Bad voice acting, particularly in English. This is a Japanese film and in Japanese, but they go for a bad-boy main cast and it Works via Animation and the story overall, but Not for the voice-acting. They wanted to be like American biker-gangs, and it just had this cacophonous resonance to the story, plot, and settings that it just did Not work. If they did Yakuza dialogue and characters, instead of American Biker gangs that they apparently had No idea how they actually talked, it would have gained that last star. \nThe ending is also bad. I mean, it is ok, and it gets you thinking about what is this about and what is this nonsense, It ends Very abruptly, almost like a full minute is cut straight out, and even the characters In The Movie are questioning how abruptly this is happening. Everything up to this point is just fantastic and amazing, but the ending is just cut like a slice of bread pulled out.\nWatch This Movie, like, Now! Especially if you are an Anime buff.

Coincidentally, I decided to view it again in 2019, not realizing it took place in Neo-Tokyo, 2019. Immediately, I remembered the fantastic panorama shots of the city rebuilt after \"World War III\" and had the same response I did back at college: \"How was this made in 1988?!\" Roving bands of biker gangs, anti-government protests, religious cults, a city in martial law, all grasp and keep the viewer's attention through displays of extreme violence and chauvinism. But the last third of the movie, specifically when Tetsuo dons the makeshift red cape, is when the sci-fi animation really heats up — the final showdown between Tetsuo and Kaneda is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Akira is a film about ESP gifted (cursed?) children known as \"Espers,\" who basically can determine the fate of the entire world. The titular, omnipotent character is not revealed until the very end. My gripes with the movie are poor dialogue — which I'm not sure was a product of the dubbing (the only version of the movie I could view) or the writing itself — and the instances that caused Tetsuo to become an egomaniacal supervillain. Getting teased by your friends just didn't seem believable enough for him to risk killing millions of people.

            "content": "TOP RATED MOVIE IMDB\n\nAkira, like other famous anime films, can prove to be quite bizarre at times. Trying to explain the premise of the movie is challenging since the story takes a while to focus on a main plot rather than three or four different subplots.\n\nThe movie starts with what appears to be a bombing of Tokyo in 1988, then quickly jumps to the year 2019 (hey that's this year!) and the city of \"Neo Tokyo.\" A bike gang with key members Kaneda and Tetsuo becomes the focus of the film as we simultaneously see a civil war happening in the city due to lousy tax reforms which upset the citizens. On top of all that, there exist three children with psychic abilities who are being monitored and cared for by a group of military members and scientists who are concerned that a mysterious being Akira will be unleashed in the near future.  The last important thing to note is that Tetsuo gains psychic abilities after interacting with one of these psychic children at the beginning of the movie.  It only gets stranger after all of that.\n\nAs can be seen from the last paragraph, Akira is a movie that could be helped if it did not pack so much into one story.  The plot is so convoluted that it is honestly difficult at times to tell who the true protagonist of the movie is. From the cover art on the box of the blu-ray disc as well as the first fifteen minutes of Akira, the protagonist seems to be Kaneda, and one would think the movie would primarily about him as a leader of a bike gang, but as noted above, the focus of this movie is all over the place.\n\nThe writer/director's choice to set this story in the middle of a civil war is interesting yet strange to dissect.  As we get further into the story, we are led to believe that the explosion or bombing at the beginning of the story might have been a result of the titular mysterious being, Akira.  Once Tetsuo receives his new abilities, the group of military and scientists begin to talk about Akira as a sort of common enemy that will unleash hell on Neo Tokyo due to catastrophic events in the past.  This notion is reminiscent of people in power uniting against a common enemy in the graphic novel Watchmen, and the visuals surrounding the common enemy are strikingly similar as well.  With all this in mind, this part of the story is almost to no avail since the common people in this movie are always seen fighting with the government. This common enemy never seems to fully unite them, but rather causes a ceasefire between the two parties.\n\nThat last thing to discuss about this film is its rating of R. It receives that rating due to graphic violence and brief nudity, both of which do appear in the film, but this film can easily be catered towards younger audiences if the nudity was dropped from the film. In the scene that involves nudity, it is heavily implied that members of a rival bike gang are going to attempt to rape a woman, but they only undo her top in the scene before they are stopped.  If they are stopped even earlier than this, then this film could probably receive a PG-13 rating since the violence in the film is more cartoonish than disturbing.\n\nAkira is definitely not a film for everyone.  Ultimately it tries to pack too much into its 2-hour runtime but it is ambitious in nature, so it at least deserves some respect.\n\n6/10\n",

I didn't watch it back then because I wasn't really interested; but this was before I realised how good animation could be, before those annual animation short film festivals in the early '90s and before we knew about Miyazaki.  Of course, Akira is absolutely nothing like Miyazaki's work and it definitely isn't for kids.  Imdb summarizes the plot as follows:  \"A secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo when it turns a biker gang member into a rampaging psychic psychopath that only two teenagers and a group of psychics can stop.\"  So, there are heaps of explosions, fights, deaths, a rape scene, motorbike accidents, police, army, tanks, gangs, and yes, psychic kids.  The animation itself is impressive and often beautiful in that classic Japanese style that has become so familiar worldwide now.  It is hard to place this as a 1980s film, perhaps because it takes place in 2019 (where strangely Japan is preparing to host the Olympic games in Tokyo) and the futuristic city isn't too different from today's cities; in other words, it feels new and current.  Yet, a little of this also goes a long way and by the time we approached the end, I was dozing off (that third beer probably didn't help).  I think I might only dip into anime now and again, and perhaps those short sweet versions are the best dosage.",

The original streamline dub is cheesy and overdone, but the Pioneer dub from 01 is excellent, just as the original japanese dub - and if you're going to initiate yourself with a Japanese classic, the Japanese Dub is amazing in stereo with its high bit rates.\n\nThe film its self is a little overwhelming at times, as it is taking a 2,000 page manga sereis and smashing it into a 2 hour long film, but its take on the manga is still sucessful, and the hand animated art work still holds up even 30 years after the original release in 1988.\n\nThe music is unique, with a mix of what was, and what could be.

            "content": "Akira: 29 Years Later, a Classic Still Striking \nAkira is an animated film released in 1988. Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, this science fiction thriller set the precedent for its genre and still impresses to this day, but in 2017, it feels like it's missing a certain spice. \nThe plot is dense and long- form, ascending from the local fights of rival biker gangs to the end of the world in just two hours. It took a while for me to see where the story was going, but once the path became clear, sailing was smooth. Neo Tokyo 2019 is not only well- realized and detailed, it is presented with class and finesse. In a scene of politicians arguing about a character's insubordination, a throwaway line, \"it's still not proven that Akira caused World War 3,\" exposits \"Akira\" as something catastrophic while showing that some don't believe in it, having their own agendas to think about. Moments and details such as this litter the film, giving life without distracting from the plot. \nThe directing is likely what keeps this classic from being a masterpiece in my eyes. Striking colors, well- delivered, well- written lines, interesting ideas, an ensemble cast of \"no true villain\" characters, and extravagantly produced animation inject Akira with the stuff of legends, but it's telling that it took me over an hour to get comfy in my chair. It's telling that I thought the 2001 English dub delivery was good, not phenomenal. Watching gang bikers ride along highways and bash each other with pipes, watching them fall to the ground and beat each other senseless should be an intense and visceral experience, but it wasn't as intense as I expected in my 2017 desensitized mentality. Near the beginning, when a biker is knocked to the ground, there's a lingering shot on the collision between his body and the highway. A fall like that should bruise or break something, but the impact simply doesn't crush. \nCompared to the two Japanese animated films I've seen and not the myriad television shows, Akira lacks a lingering atmosphere present in End of Evangelion and Angel's Egg. Forgiving for Evangelion, which aired an entire decade later, but Angel's Egg was three years before Akira. Perhaps that's the wrong expectation, though. Gritty, edgy, and packed with personality, Akira is more of a thriller, starring hot- blooded, young men living on the cusp of a failing society. There are moments when things get trippy, striking, and alien, such as when Tetsuo hallucinates his organs falling out of his stomach and madly grasps at empty air, trying to hold himself together, and when the ending presents a poignant piece of eldritch body horror, complete with tortured screams. That's interesting and emotional content. It just feels like Akira takes a long time to distinguish itself from anime it inspires, when its intro portrays a group of young rebels getting lectured by school officials. \nAkira has influenced many, and while I haven't seen many anime, I asked my friend about how Neon Genesis Evangelion takes the plot of Akira and better integrates its themes and character arcs into the end of the world, he said: \n\"Shinji Ikari being representative of all people, as his identity is that of all people is able to demonstrate how all charachters ended up in instrumentality, by showcasing what the people had lost we are able to understand the common flaw which had led to this situation, so the ultimate question here is what had people lost? A sense of externalized perspective, by focusing in on how one is perceived by others rather than trying to perceive the world through empathy of \nothers this leading to the over internalization of communications that had led to the functional isolationism which each character had come to through some means, be it Asuka through her resistance to limitations which lead to her downfall, Rei and the awakening to the absence of normality or Misato and her shutting out of the only person who had shared pain of reality by killing him.\" \nIn Akira, a Big Bang- type event happens because Tetsuo was pushing his psychic powers too hard during a developmental phase, or something about the Akira body parts being unleashed, resulting in a somewhat out- of- nowhere moment of body horror. Ten years later, Evangelion takes powerful teenagers with personal insecurities and turns its final- act, destruction of humanity into something so deep, I have no confidence in talking about it myself. \nAlong with the introduction of small, blue, shriveled, psychic children, one in a floating chair, and a scene in which a woman is pinned against a wall and her shirt removed, Akira's first half rides the line of \"Would my parents be weirded out by this?\" But it definitely makes its buildup worthwhile when an adolescent develops superpowers and uses it to fuel his inferiority complex instead of becoming a superhero. \nWhat I'm saying is, Akira is a classic which inspired many of many people's favorite things, but because of this, it stands more as a building block than a big favorite. Akira is absolutely worth your time, but it's only the beginning of its medium's greatest hits.",

This cyberpunk Tokyo is filled with dark ruins and delinquents but also powerful beings that the government tries to hold power from. Tetsuo is one of those beings and Kaneda and other friends have to stop him from unsealing the power of Akira that will wreak havoc through this futuristic Tokyo. This animated film has all the action, violence, and story any anime fans would need. The characters revolve throughout the story getting involved as much as possible. The designs and structure of old school Tokyo mixed with the futuristic 80s theme gives a spectacular atmosphere. Bloody stuff happen in this story but this is not the best case of this movie yet, the real fight comes in play later with Tetsuo's ability. The soundtrack has the best vibes you can get from a classic Japanese composer. You want the best cyberpunk feature with lots of action, well here it is!",

Wow this movie even foresaw the future and how it was going to be. I'm interested in how the boy's story progresses, the one who shouted. The city in this movie, is what I imagine most cities are like in the Star Wars movies on ground level. That whole overly futuristic and dystopian feel. There's some really great ideas in this movie. \n\nI will say, Kaneda's bike is fucking sick. This movie's got a terrific sense of humor. It reminds me a lot of the humor Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo have. You can already tell there's a suspicious agency or entity that is involved with the kid. That hallucination that Tetsuo has in the hospital was fucking crazy. Just that whole concept. It's crazy to see how having so much power can completely change a person in a negative way. Never abuse power folks. \n\nPretty fucked up how the secret agency experimented on children. I like how they delve into the story of how Kaneda and Tetsuo became friends at school. It's nice to see this movie also touches on themes of friendship. Great ending!\n\nOverall, awesome fucking movie. The animation was top notch as well as the action sequences and movement of the characters. I will say though, I don't care too much for the setting and the colors - there just not as beautiful as other anime movies. I understand they're trying to get across the whole overly futuristic and dystopian grim feel of it, but I just don't think it's beautiful to look at.",

It did have all the things I dislike about this style of movie: terrible line delivery, lots of things happening at once so I can't keep track of it all, characters who all look the same so I can't keep anyone straight, and more.\n\nI was really struggling in the first 15-20 minutes of this movie because I could not follow who was who, and what they were doing, or why they were doing it. So many characters are thrown at you with no background or explanation. However, there was a point when I started to say...\"wait, I think I might understand some of the things going on now!\"\n\nThe second act is where I was totally on board. The sci-fi super-power element of the plot had me intrigued. I was worried about Tetsuo, and was fascinated to see what would happen next. Sadly, the third act kind of lost me again. There's some good stuff going on in the climax, but then there's a lot of other stuff that makes no sense to me. I needed someone to just explain what was happening and why but the movie wouldn't offer that to me.\n\nIn a weird way Akira felt like watching a sequel without seeing the original movie. There was so much backstory that I wanted but this movie glossed over it as if I should already know all of it. I could see that Akira is probably a film that rewards repeat viewing so you could dig into it. The style is just one that I don't particularly love, so I doubt it's something I would personally explore further. I can see where people would be passionate about Akira because it is one of the best Manga/Anime films I've watched.",

            "content": "So Manga Entertainment, the UK's largest Anime distributor celebrate their 25th anniversary this year and in honour of this great milestone they screened the 1988 Manga extravaganza, Akira, in amazing remastered versions across the UK in selected cinemas. This was something too epic to not see, Katsuhiro Ôtomo's masterpiece that paved the global way for Anime and Manga, gaining international attention and still remaining to be one of the highest grossing films of '88. \n\nBut for those not familiar with Akira or it's legacy, Ôtomo-san's post-apocalyptic sci-fi started back in 1982 as a series of manga and continued on till 1990 until and was eventually released into six massive volumes that wouldn't look dissimilar to a collection of encyclopaedias. The art-work is incredible and set a standard for Manga and then doing the same for Anime when evolving into the feature length animation. \n\nThe full story of Akira, is the modern Iliad and Tolkien of Japanese pop culture, an incredible work of science fiction on such a scale it's truly epic by definition and only fans of the original Manga series might be disappointed with the film adaptation as the movie is considerable shorter. Whilst keeping the core of the story true to the Manga, the viewers are missing, what I would estimate another 75% of the original plot. Yes! That much. \n\nThe story is set in Neo-Tokyo, around 2019 in the wake of an apparent nuclear disaster that decimated the city the year previous. The new city, though rapidly rebuilding is buried in politics, controversy, terrorism and an amphetamine-fuelled, cyberpunk culture that's rules the streets. Introducing Kaneda, the alpha-teen gangbanger who leads a biker gang of fellow juvenile delinquents and during a night clash with one of their oppositions, his friend Tetsuo has a near fatal accident when crossing the path of an escapee child, a government subject with interesting powers. \n\nTetsuo's recovery does not go well, basically being captured and monitored by the military, under the watchful eye of the colonel who is desperately trying to prevent a repeat incident that previously destroyed the city the year before. There's conspirators and treason within the government who know the truth about what happened and though it's not entirely clear the intentions of any of the parties, it boils down to harnessing or controlling the power Tetsuo has somehow contracted from his accidental meeting, leading to political intrigue, casting the government into turmoil and eventually a coup d'état with a rising spiritual revolution, riots and acts of terrorism. \n\nTetsuo starts to realise his powers and unfortunately takes a turn for the worse for mankind as his demonic rage obliterates anyone and anything that stands in his way of seeking out the absolute power, the child Akira. One way to describe him during the transition is being like Jack Torrance from The Shining, only with literally mind-blowing powers of Neo from The Matrix. The escape from the facility is bloody brutal. \n\nThe animation is still some of the best work I have ever seen, the violence portrayed is incredibly visceral with impressive action sequences that give the film a grand sense of scale and was innovative with out-of-focus perspectives. The opening bike chase in particular, with rear light trails, the velocity and detail gave the animation a a level of realism not otherwise seen in animated movies. It's very surreal, but so elegantly done and borderline horrific with grotesque images but balanced with vibrant, illuminating scenes of technology, architecture and science. I know this was a challenging film to animate due to being loaded with gorgeous night scenes, the cityscapes and lighting effects, demanding so much more from the animators, but the final spectacle makes it all so worth it. \n\nThe soundtrack is marvellous with a complete mixture of modern electric guitar entwined with Balinese Tantric chanting, taiko drums and other traditional Japanese percussions. Composed by Yamashiro Shoji and performed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, it fits the film so perfectly well with Kaneda's theme song being high-powered and full of attitude and then the ambient 'Winds over Neo-Tokyo' being very soothing and dreamy. The mixture of tech-noir and tradition is conveyed across amazingly well too, with tracks like 'Mutation' and 'Exodus from The Underground Fortress' but Requiem is my personal favourite track because it captures the essence of the entire soundtrack together, giving a reprised merger of the key themes. I'm actually listening to it now while I write this. \n\nThis film was the ground-breaker, getting the rest of the world outside of Japan to notice and paved the way for international anime recognition. It was the main anime to reach wider audiences and was normally the gateway to other anime greats like Fist of North Star, Ninja Scroll and the more controversial Chôjin densetsu Urotsukidôji, better known as The Legend of The Overfiend that followed. Not forgetting to mention Ghost In The Shell. The films multiple posters are all iconic and instantly recognisable with Kaneda walking up to his bike being my personal favourite. \n\nI was only a child when this was released and being considered an adult animation, no teenage geek could deny the attraction of super-bikes, ultra-violence and comedy in true Manga fashion where a lot of it happens in the background. This film inspired me like no other, and I would sit and draw manga for hours based on Akira. I wanted Kaneda's bike just like Tetsuo did, and his red jacket and wanted ride about town with my friends during the midnight hours whilst listening to the amazing soundtrack. I first recorded it off the TV on to VHS at a time where you had to be present to press record and pause during commercials. Then purchasing the proper video along with the imported soundtrack, eventually buying the DVD and upgraded to the special remastered editions. It's one of those films you must have, going through the ages of technology; I'm waiting for the special edition bluray. \n\nAdmittedly, I watched the film first before reading the comics, which, incidentally had not finish running until two years after the film's release. It was this pinnacle film that got me hooked on manga and anime so I started collecting the manga and continued reading Akira as Ôtomo-san original envisioned it. Some, like myself, could be disappointed with the much-butchered story of the film but it's Ôtomo-san creation of both anime and manga, so he had complete creative control and who's to argue? \n\nThe story continues after Akira with Neo-Tokyo in a state of emergency where a few stragglers of civilisation fight to survive in the desolate city among the spiritual zealots and Akira's Cult with Tetsuo at the throne. The full epic story has so much more to offer than the film ever did, and that's even with an already generous running time of 124mins there's no way they can fit the whole of the manga into one complete film missing characters and subplots like Lt. Yamada and the brutish heroine Chiyoko. \n\nCould they continue, or, seeing the recent developments with live action like Ghost In The Shell, could a live action version be on the cards? I know it was an idea, and can imagine it constantly floating around in studio's dreams but the original budget for such a project skyrocketed beyond $300 million. Ignoring Rupert Sanders' incoming version of Ghost In The Shell, I would welcome a live action Akira, maybe with a reworked plot to allow it to go further like the comics do but keeping the iconic scenes from the anime that make it so awe-inspiring. \n\nIt's a masterpiece, an extraordinary testament to animation that perfectly bonds music, story, action and animation so gloriously well. It's the iconic film that placed anime where it is internationally today. Akira, the legendary anime that became the one of the most recognised, respected and revered pieces of animation in movie history.\n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 10\nDirection: 10\nStory: 9 (not 10 only because of the comic story)\nScript: 9\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10\n\n96% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

With society as fucked up as it is, many religious leaders predict the arrival of a violent savior called Akira. On an standard night a young biker, named Tetsuo, finds himself in a dangerous position with the Tokyo government but little does he know what the future has planed for this boy. \n\nIt isn't for nothing that anime has earn a reputation of an exaggerated, melodramatic, cliched and at times gross and perverted, so when an anime receives the level of praise this film achieved it made me want to watch it a few years ago (plus the fact I will watch any acclaimed sci-fi film) and I got to say Katsuhiro Otomo's work is quite something. \"Akira\" has beautiful animation that hasn't aged a day, striking visuals, an atmosphere is a mixture of \"Blade Runner\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\" with a little Orwellian vibe and the standard anime formula, it uses a high level of violence effectively for setting a mood (it's not just there to be shocking or tasteless), an insane and trippy story that starts with promise but it ultimately gets far up its own ass, the character designs are distinct (which is not as usual in the medium as it is required) and cool looking, the action sequences are what you would expect from anime but the combination of guns blazing and supernatural powers is quite unique (I haven't seen anime fights quite unique and intense since I saw \"Cowboy Bebop\", which I know came latter), it's world is so creative and out there that I find it extremely fascinating to watch, the character relationships are believable (I can see where the Naruto and Sasuke bromance came from) and it is overall quite fun to watch. But sadly this impressive and gorgeous film has numerous issues. The characters lack personality as they are just stereotypes, the story is a little hard to follow at times, the dialog is at times groan inducing (not surprising for Japanese animation), the standard anime comedy is so dumb and awkward, Tetsuo is the worst written character I have seen in a while, the third act goes on too long, and the last 15 minutes go to Psychomagic bullshit territory (not surprising considering Otomo made that ending after meeting Jodorowsky) but what's funny is that it tries to come off as \"2001\" (when I was 14 I though it was a mind blowing finale but it really is a tacked on addition). Furthermore it needs to be said that you need to like anime or even know about it as it follows the standard formula of the medium which you may go with or  you won't (the world is bizarre and they don't try to give sense to it, the action is composed by massive explosions, technology is shown as destructive but also as miraculous, the characters are as over the top as the setting, the soap opera writing and the awkward comedy).\n\n\"Akira\" is one undeniably the most influential anime film ever made (it is debatable whether it is the best but no other film has achieved the same impact as Otomo's work, not even Miyazaki) as it is creative, unique, gorgeous, mesmerizing, mostly solidly written and extremely fun to watch. If you can go with anime logic then you will enjoy this film but if you can't or prefer kid friendly anime like Pokemon then I recommend to stay away from it. It is not for everyone and has major flaws but it still is powerful and highly entertaining.",

            "content": "Praised by critics from around the world and held high as \"the\" landmark film of Japanese animation. Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 animated classic \"Akira\" is nothing short of a masterpiece. Featuring cuttingedge cel-animation that will take your breath away and an emotionally driven music score composed mainly of traditional Japanese instruments, this film is a must watch for not only fans of Japanese anime, but anyone who can appreciate a well constructed film. Based on the manga of the same name, which was written and hand drawn with over 2,000 pages by Otomo himself. The story takes place in 2019AD, 31 years after WWIII, which was ignited by a mysterious explosion that set off a chain of events leading up to the war. The setting is Tokyo (now known as Neo-Tokyo) a dystopian wasteland teetering on the scales between order and chaos. Riots break out, drugs are available around every corner, and biker gangs run wild in the streets. Yeah, this film is not kid friendly at all. The story centers around two childhood friends, Kaneda and Tetsuo, now members of a biker gang lead by Kaneda, that stumble across a top-secret military operation that has been hidden for over three decades while out fighting a rival gang. A secret buried in a vault under the rumble of Tokyo. A secret to unlocks the powers of the universe. A secret known only as ...\"Akira\".  I can't really say too much else without spoiling it for you, but it's a surreal mindtrip from start to finish involving a complex action packed story that may (and probably will) require multiple viewings. It teaches a valuable lesson about friendship, greed, corruption and the devastating consequences of absolute power when handled carelessly. Everything about this anime is beautifully detailed, from the glittering of the city lights, to the wind blowing through the trees, from the heaps of garbage burning on the streets, to the teargas rounds flying through the air. Even the sound effects are amazing. The city traffic honking as biker gangs race down the streets, the shouting protesters, the gunfire and explosions are equally impressive as the music score itself. The American voice acting redub, though very good, can be a little over the top at times. But in my opinion it sounds better in Japanese because they recorded the voice acting first, then synced the animation of the lip movements up with the words. That alone should tell you how much heart and soul went into making this anime. It does differ quite a bit from the manga, but trying to fit over 2,000 pages full of art and dialogue into a two hour movie would prove to be an impossible task. So the anime connects the beginning with the end and leaves out a lot of the middle. But both are well crafted works of art and both can easily stand for themselves. I could go on all day talking about the film, so I'll wrap it up by saying that out of the 350+ plus films I own, this is the one I recommend the most. And sadly, not too many people I've talked to have even heard of it or are even willing to give it a chance. But it really is their loss because it's not just a really good anime from 1988,  it truly is a landmark film that has stood the test of time and pushed the limits of what an animation is capable of. It's treasure for both sight and sound that you will never forget.",

            "content": "One of the indisputable gold standards of Japanese animation, Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira - adapted from his own manga - is a story like many others from post-World War II Japan; it tackles the socioeconomic effects of war, and the dangers of atomic power. Akira's subtexts, ultimately, is yet another manifestation of Japan's nuclear fear, but Otomo's film isn't a war film like Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies - released the same year - was. Instead, Akira jumps into the future and imagines a different Tokyo after another fictional World War.\n\nBeginning immediately with an explosion that engulfs the entirety of Tokyo in a white light, Akira wastes no time in setting up the characters and premise set 31 years following the film's fictional World War III; it cuts right to the escalating and subsequent action sequence involving the Pills gang - a group of delinquents lead by Kaneda - engaging in a turf war with another gang, the Clowns, on high-speed bikes. A turf war which results in the capture of Tetsuo after the gang crosses paths with a mysterious person with psychic powers that the army is hunting, all whilst a separate political protest is on-going. And in just 15 minutes, Akira effectively lays the intriguing foundation of its story and characters.\n\nLike many other Japanese animations, Akira feels alive each frame and shot, as Otomo's direction brings life to Neo-Tokyo, brimming with lights and violence, a city being slowly torn apart as a fascist government struggles to hold it together, as a separatist group incites the public into around the city, one that has begun to erode as unemployment and school dropouts pile on. Racing beside folk music hybrid songs from the stellar soundtrack composition by Tsutomu ?hashi, there is a cyberpunk beauty to the film, from sequences of Kaneda racing on his blood red bike to the destruction that Tetsuo leaves in his wake as the story progresses.\n\nWith a visual design and animation that holds up 27 years later, Otomo additionally utilizes 'pre-scoring' - voices are recorded before there is any animation, as the latter is then done to match the recorded voices - to create a much more accurate, realistic portrayal of characters speaking. Though this only applies to the Japanese voices; the usual grating English voice acting remains dubbed.\n\nLike the impending DreamWorks-Paramount Pictures produced, Scarlett Johansson-led Ghost in the Shell (1995) live-adaptation, Akira is an important chess piece in the onslaught of Hollywood remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and unnecessary adaptations. As such, with the anime being a coveted piece of dystopian landmark in Japanese storytelling and animation that is sought after by Warner Bros. and Leonardo DiCaprio to be adapted into a live-action film, it's best to watch Akira now before the live-action, whitewashed potential catastrophe is eventually made.",

I can't flaw the production values, especially for the time, and was constantly impressed by the excellent animation. The opening scenes, full of exposition as the city of Neo Tokyo is revealed, are some of the film's best moments, rivaled only by the ending, which I won't reveal, of course, but will say escalates to higher levels than I could've ever imagined. Another highlight of the film are the creepy ghost-children, who are other government experiments and are basically kindergarteners who've been given physic powers and are aged to look like they're pensioners despite having the minds and statures of children. Admittedly, a lot of the stuff in between the stunning opening and outrageous ending sequences is generic action and necessary plot development, but cutting down a colossal (2182-page, Wikipedia tells me) epic manga was never going to be easy.

While out fighting their rivals, Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) nearly crashes into a small, odd-looking child. Tetsuo is injured and taken away by government agents, who discover that his brain patterns are very unusual. Colonel Shikishima (voiced by Taro Ishida) orders experimenting to begin on the boy, who begins to develop similar powers to Akira a mysterious boy with mental powers so powerful they were nearly god-like. The plot follows Kaneda, who allies himself with anti-government forces in the hopes of rescuing his friend and Tetsuo, whose growing abilities begin tearing at his sanity.\n\nThis film looks amazing. The post-war setting of 2019 Neo Tokyo makes for some truly incredible sights. This is one of those movies where any number of still could serve as backgrounds for your desktop because every little element is lush and detailed. Every frame was painstakingly hand-drawn and painted and you can tell everyone involved consistently delivered their best work. Every frame is beautiful and exciting to see. Populating this world is a story that fleshes out Neo-Tokyo and makes it seem very much alive. While we mostly follow Kaneda and Tetsuo, we also see glimpses of the rest of the population. We find out that there is political unrest between the youth of Japan and the corrupt government, that there is a religious cult following the mysterious Akira, that the youth who are disenchanted with rules and politics roam the streets, fighting each other and joining gangs. You get a glimpse at a world that's very interesting; just enough to get you worried when the climax of the film threatens it all.\n\nIf you're a big fan of animation and you want to break the stereotype that every animated film is for kids, this would be an excellent choice to show to the uninitiated. If you're not a fan of animation and you want to jump into the format, this is a great spot to go; no silly sequences where a character screams, but only his mouth moves or backgrounds are replaced with streaming lines here. There are some shocking moments of violence and some frightening sequences (mostly Tetsuo's hallucinations as he develops psychic powers) that are the stuff of nightmares. The story is complex, but not difficult to follow (kind of a must for a film that is subtitled and moves quickly) and the characters are well developed, with some nice subtle moments to them. It's all set to a fantastic score that's memorable and haunting, cleverly using vocals (but not necessarily words) and to me, what sounded like an extensive selection of wooden xylophones to generate a primal, haunting melody that hinted at the action that was incoming.\n\nIt all wraps itself up into an unforgettable climax and the film is filled with iconic moments that once you see, you will recognize in countless other films and stories. The film nevertheless stays fresh and stimulating throughout despite inspiring countless other filmmakers. I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who I wouldn't recommend \"Akira\" to and if you can see it on the big screen, it's an engulfing experience you won't easily forget. Even you, that guy that doesn't really think of himself or herself as a person that likes animation, you have got to see this film. I can't believe it took me this long to finally get around to watching it. It actually makes me angry that someone didn't introduce it to me earlier! You absolutely must get around to watching \"Akira\". (Original Japanese version with subtitles on the big screen, January 31, 2014)",

The whole movie had such a dark, murky atmosphere that had strong resemblance and inspiration towards other movies like Blade Runner and Mad Max. But after a while, the whole thing dragged a lot. Characters simply shouting tersuo's name over and over doesn't exactly count as decent dialogue. Yes, there really isn't much for them to say but the writer could've spent more time developing these characters rather than having them repeat the same lines over and over. I agree with myself that this rating was a little unfair. But putting all those flaws aside, I loved the animation, the style and the feel of the movie, with a great score. Being a gritty, dystopian science-fiction film, I was expecting to like it which I did at first but ending up dragging a lot the more it progressed. This rating feels a bit unfair so I'll probably give it another watch. If I still don't like it, then it's just my opinion.",

The world is pure cyberpunk and just screams to be explored. Unfortunately, the story doesn't hold up quite as well. The characters are one note and each plot point just acts as a stepping stone to the next action sequence.

AKIRA is one of those films, and it happens to be the first anime film I've ever seen. The setting is 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, so named because of an apocalyptic event which took place 31 years earlier. The rebuilt city isn't too different from what you might find in a post-apocalyptic/dystopian sci-fi story. What stood out most to me, and the most recognizable elements of this type of story, was the portrayal of a fascist police state where government and those in authority abuse their power and the citizens fight against them. Not only do they show this violence, but there is also a lot of graffiti which provides subtext and context to the overall situation. Some of it went over my head because it's probably specific to Japanese society when this film (and the source graphic novel) were made, but the broad strokes of oppressive regimes, the military-industrial complex and populist uprisings should resonate with most viewers. All of this, and I haven't even gotten to what makes this story unique. At the center of this story is a biker gang, and one of the members, Tetsuo, is captured by a secret military group that studies people with psychic abilities. There is also another group of people who prophecy about the return of some mystical Akira, who will either bring balance or destruction. To be honest, I don't completely understand all of the plot intricacies, but most of the time I was being blown away by the stunning hand-drawn animation. I've never completely warmed up to computer animation, but animated films such as this one have an artistry to them that is second to none (when done right). One minor complaint I have is that the English dub (and I don't really like dubs) was a bit iffy in places. What I mean by that is some of the voice acting was a bit over-the-top. Still, it wasn't too distracting like it might be in a live-action film. My other minor complaint has to do with the length of the film. The third act was perhaps a little bit too protracted and it messed with the overall pacing. Still, I ended up liking this film a lot and look forward to delving into more anime in the future.",

Amazing that someone could have thought of something so bizarre and gory, but yet, at the same time, so poetic. Now I'm reading the books and they are just remarkable. Each panel doesn't make the art feel refined or constricted, it allows the art to roam freely throughout each page and lets the story take its course. The story itself is like something that pops out a teenage boys head but is afraid to let that story out because they can't  figure out how to piece it together except Katsuhiro Otomo who wasn't afraid to let it out. I'm not a huge anime fan, but I'll watch it if it peaks my interest, but this isn't just any ordinary anime you pull up on Netflix and watch on a rainy day, Akira is cool, it's mean, it's surreal, it's gory, it's beautiful, and it's down-right awesome.

Otomo also writes and directs here and he goes to great lengths to throw massive amounts of images at the viewer in rapid succession.  \nAkira is extreme violent and bloody. The composition is well thought out. For instance the motor cycles are interesting in design and leave a cool light trail behind as they ride along.  I also liked the overall design of the film, the futuristic Japan imagined in 1984 is amazingly close to todays modern Tokyo Japan.\nThe framing of shots I found confusing and hard to follow. For instance in the grand finale when the protagonist is turning into a giant blob a  POV of the blob is used and I literally got motion sickness and had to look away from the screen. Also many extreme close ups are used and add to the difficulty I had following scenes progression. \nI have heard that Akira was ground breaking for it's time and that it's status as a cult film is assured. I just was not feeling it. \nMuch of the animation seemed cliche and the dialogue cheesy. I really found this movie a chore to watch. I had to pause the film and walk away many times before I could finish it.

I'll get this out the way: I'm not a fan of anime, really.  Only two anime series I enjoy are Cowboy Bebop and DragonBall Z, along with the occasional Afro Samurai.  Now, I'm not saying these are the only series I've watched.  When I was a kid, I adored shows like Death Note, Inuyasha, and Full Metal Alchemist.  However, as I grew up, those shows never really stuck with me and I just got over them.  The only two that did stay were DBZ and Bebop.  So, I'm not exactly an anime fan, but that's what makes Akira wonderful!  I forgot I was watching anime and felt comfortable watching it!\n\nAkira is a strange film... It's basically a superhero/villain (?) origin story.  In the year 1988, a nuclear explosion occurs in Japan, causing World War III.  In the future, 2019, neo-Tokyo is ruled by a military force and is occupied mostly by biker gangs and low-life thugs.  Enter Tetsuo, a random biker who turns out to have superpowers.  After a couple of government testing, things go down. The film sits at 2 hours and 5 minutes, yet it's breakneck pacing allows for a much more easygoing experience.  There's not a moment in here where it feels dull (need to stop using this word) or listless.  The film has to cover a lot of ground, especially considering it's rather large scope, and I felt is has succeeded it's goal.\n\nThe animation in this film is stunning.  To my surprise, I found out that this film was entirely hand-drawn.  Looking back at the fluidity of it, I'm speechless as to how they accomplished this, and more-so by the fact that it was made in the 80s, a time where films seemed to have a lot of effort put forth.  People sat there and drew every scene, though sometimes I get the feeling they used CG for a couple of scenes.  However, effort alone is jaw-dropping.  The voice acting is decent at times.  I watched the remastered dub, and I can say that no one did a horrible job.  Sometimes they went a little overboard with the melodrama and for some reason, in a couple of scenes, some of the dialogue isn't in sync.  \n\nWhat makes this film amazing is it's imagination.  The film begins going one direction.  Then, it switches it up and now it's going in a completely different way.  At times, the film can be gratuitously violent, but it adds more to the charm of the film.  It makes the action scenes more visceral, and hard hitting, something that is lacking in most cartoons now.  The film doesn't attempt to be something it's not.  It's not pursuing to be a family friendly film, and it broke the mold of \"family friendly cartoons\" and really pushed the boundaries.  Like it or not, this film has done more for the anime business (and even film) than most other films.\n\nThe film never takes itself too seriously, as well.  It has a buoyant sense of joy in scenes not detailing the darker themes.  When it does delve into it's message, the film feels a little muddled, however.  Through all the rubble in the film, the film is against the thought of power.  No one should have increasing power.  It's an allegory on the political system of Japan(or any country) and it's corruption, but it's never fully utilizes this idea because it's easy to get lost in the violence.  I know I gave the film props for it's violent tone, but I feel that it's a double edged sword.  On one hand, it enhances the film's overall joy.  On the other, it is distracting.  Oh well, it's just me.\n\nThe film carries a surprising amount of emotional depth as well.  There is an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, Kaneda and Tetsuo, and it's strange how depressing it is to watch their friendship slowly break apart.  And that's what can be said about this film, there is strong characterization in this film, especially from the two leads.  Kaneda is a witty, heroic kid looking to help his friend.  It makes the final result more pulse pounding and suspenseful.  Akira is not for everyone as mentioned before.  In the first 20 minutes alone, a kid is decapitated, there's a rape scene, and there's strong language.  The film is a social critique.  If you see the violence there for no reason, you're missing the morality aspect of this film.  Oh, there I go again.  Defending the violence right after I had antagonized it.  I still hold my stance that the violence does shroud the overall theme, but the violence holds it's own reasoning.  Is that different enough?  Well, I felt that the brutality of the film held a weight, revealing the harsh reality of what goes on in street gang warfare.\n\nOverall, Akira is one of the hardest films I've had to review in a while.  It's negative aspects can also embellish the film, making it tough to find real criticisms on this film.  The dialogue can be a tad...silly.  \"Look!  It's blood!\" Yeah, thank you for telling me as if I didn't know.  It's not for everyone.  It's gory, sexually explicit, and foul mouthed.  If you can get past that, this film is a beautifully animated, imaginative, electric film that shouldn't be missed.   It has a wonderful social commentary on gangs and features a nice political allegory.  This is a great film!",

I've never had anything against it, but before about a week ago the only anime I've really ever watched are shows like Pokemon when I was a kid. But, I was recently convinced to give it a try, and from looking around a bit on the internet I found that for people who want to start watching anime, they are generally recommended to watch two things: Ghost in the Shell, and Akira. And while I haven't checked out Ghost in the Shell yet, I've gotta say, I'm glad I gave a chance. I still will probably never become a big anime fan, but Akira is an excellent movie. It has great action, beautiful animation, and an engaging, thought-provoking, and incredibly original story.",

Obviamente se entienden razones, fué de las películas más caras en cuanto a animación y trasladarla así hubiese tomado tanto más dinero como más horas. Así que, partiendo sobre el hecho de que es un resumen ¿Funciona?, es un deleite. En aspectos técnicos es una maravilla, y que sigue viéndose y sonando como si hubiese salido ayer, la música de Geinoh Yamashirogumi crea un ambiente incómodo en el espectador y el tema principal es pegajoso. Y Otomo, padre del manga, hace una buen trabajo como director, y si el decidió el resumen entendió o (sin pensarlo) que partes, personajes y situaciones podrían funcionar y que no a una audiencia tradicional...y acertó por que Akira es un filme que se recuerda en todas partes, emblemático e influyente. Vean la película y lean el Manga, ambos son deliciosos.",

It showed that there are absolutely no limits to animation. The fact that it managed to prove this after such a thing had been debated for over a half century alone shows that it deserves this rating. But of course, it needs more.\nThe characters are just really, really fucking fun. They're solid and believable. Tetsuo is just a normal kid who discovers he can do incredible things, and like many people with that kind of power, he goes batshit insane. Kaneda wants to help pull Tetsuo out of this crazed state because he's his friend and would die for him, not to mention he pulls some of the funniest one liners I've ever heard.\nThe story has been abused over and over again, but it's like a How to Train Your Dragon before its time. It's polished and refurnished with some interesting new additions. Basically the main character discovers he has amazing powers and these make him go nuts and he becomes evil. And of course, someone has to stop him. But it seems so... UNFAMILIAR even though it has been repeated more than a thousand times. It's almost as if it's completely new. This movie is the JAWS of the manga world, the movie is better than the book.\nThe reason I call this a psychological thriller is because it really fucks with your mind... just like a psychological thriller. And let's face it, psychological thrillers usually share one thing in common: the moments the credits roll, you start thinking... HARD.\nAnd the way you think with Akira is what sets it apart from other psycho thrillers. Rather than waiting for the end to think, you think DURING the film. Yet the thinking doesn't deviate you from focusing on it, you can question an event that happened an hour ago and hear every single word said right now.\nThis makes it a 5 out of 5, and, to be honest, the greatest psychological thriller of all time.",

But I've heard of Akira and I've been wanting to watch it for a while. I have also heard they are suppose to make this into a live action movie which will be kind of cool.\nWhile was watching I couldn't quite get what the story was but further in the film i understood.

Tetsuo is pursued when he escapes after being given an insidious energy source that has rendered him of telekinetic powers. Kaneda must stop Testsuo before he loses control of his new power.\nThe animation is nothing short of amazing cause anime always makes for the best animation(well at least most of the time)but this movie looks like it would work better as a live action film. In the end of how start to finally put the pieces of the puzzle of what this movie was about it was a lot like Chronicle(2011) in the end where Testuso went on a rampage and killed a lot of people and attempted to kill Kaneda. He was given the powers of Akira which well I don't want to confuse anyone but it's pretty cool.\nThe characters are cool I especially liked Kaneda, Testuso and The doctor. The doctor was the one who tried to take all of the energy out from a computer cause it looked like it was touching him and was the one who put the Akira energy source in the first place and well he didn't like what happened in the end. Kaneda is the gang leader who try's to make sure Tetsuo keeps his cool and the other members of the gang help him out. Tetsuo is the youngest member of the motorcycle gang and he loses control after having beating up everyone who's ever gotten in his way. He attempts to kill Kaneda cause Kaneda would always save him from situations and he was sick and tired of it so when he gets his power he goes nuts.\nAkira is an awesome energetic action animation motion picture with great stuff but would work better as a live action film.",

I know there's a cult following, but this my opinion, so if you disagree it's fine. While there is the original manga, I'm just talking about the film. The story focuses on different charactors but a main part of the story involves a young phycic test subject akira. In neo-Tokyo in 2019, the city is corrupt and on the edge of collapse. The is bike gangs at war, corrupt politicians wanting power, and reluctant scientist. During a battle between 2 bike gangs, a young man named Tetsuo accedently come to contact of another test subject named takashi who is trying to escape the research facility. Tetsuo is taken to a hospital and it turns out he has the power of akira and goes on a rampage to find him. Tetsuos child friend kaneda at first wants to help him, but when Tetsuo goes over the edge kaneda is attempting to stop him. Okay it is more complicated of a story then it seems, which is one of the major problems. The original manga was thousands of pages which benifets story and charator development, but the movie tries to compress it to 2 hours. I know the creater Katshuhiro Otomo directed and wrote the movie, so there's scenes he put here that's not in the manga, like a nightmare Tetsuo has. But there's some plot points and charactors from the manga that either not seen as much, different, seen in the movie but put aside, or even not in it. And as for the graphic violence, I think it's off the book. But with that said it's not that bad of a movie. The themes of the film is thought provoking, some of the main charactors are relatable,the English version is one of the best English versions of an anime in my opinion, and the animation is amazing for an anime from 1988. If you're an anime fan check it out and see for yourself.",

Like many films in this genre, it suffers from plot inconsistencies and awkward dialogue in the dubbed version (considerably better in the subtitled version) but the vigour and vibrancy of the animation makes up for these shortcomings. The story involves a young motorcycle gang member, Kaneda, in a future Tokyo some decades after a nuclear explosion. He becomes embroiled in a government and military plot to develop psychic weapons when one of his friends, Tetsuo, begins to show strange powers following an accident. Tetsuo begins a strange transformation as he is gradually consumed by elemental forces which are trying to resurrect the mysterious Akira, a figure blamed for the blast that levelled Tokyo years before. Being Manga, it's not quite as simple as that. Released in the 1980s, it is amazing to think that the animation was all drawn by hand with little of the technology that would undoubtedly be used today. It is an astonishing feat. Like many movies of this kind, it is quite violent but the violence is handled in an artistic, almost balletic manner which, for me, makes it far from gratuitous. This is, without question, a great movie and a fantastic example of Anime showing all of the strengths of this form of movie making. It's an imaginative, bloody and hectic tale that really proves that animation is a whole lot more than mere cartoons.",

            "content": "Just watched a movie I haven't watched in over a decade. That movie was Akira which I have to say is just as good as I remember. Heck, just to make it more nostalgic I watched the old English dub where \"Leonardo\" does the voice of Kaneda. It brought up alot of memories, like in some scenes I shout \"KANEDA!\" or \"TETSUO!\" and cringe at the part where Kaori gets smashed in Tetsuo's fat rolls.\n\nOne thing I didn't remember so well is that the animation is absolutely superb. Animation that would shame most animators back to school so they could try to draw on pencil and paper and then on cells. I especially like how the mouths are actually animated to the words they are saying, if your watching the Japanese dub, rather then mouths flapping up and down like they were doing their best impression of a marionette doll. There are many instances where they could have gotten away with not animating some sequences like a hover bike exploding in the background. But instead they show off the bike scrapping on to the pavement and eventually exploding into a million pieces. And the wind effects and water effects would put many modern day CGI special effects to shame.\n\nI'm normally repelled by most Japanese anime. Many people tell me that, unlike many American animations, Japanese animations are more catered to adult audiences because they have more complex storylines but in my experience I've found most of these to be more convoluted and boring. But the thing I like about Akira is that it does have a complex story without it having to have bore you to death with long dialogues of exposition and pointless scenes. Another thing I like is that it also doesn't explain too much, leaving some questions better off explained by the audience's imagination. If you want a good example of revealing too much of something to the detriment of a movie's lore just look up the word \"Midi-chlorians\"\n\nI also like that many of the weird visuals actually make sense unlike many media where it's just done for weirdness' sake. Many of the creepy weird visuals are actually connected to the plot and add to the story rather than it being a non-sequitur. It has more of a sense of, yeah we definitely meant to have that scene where the guy gets attacked by demonic toys.\n\nWell enough of me continually bathing this movie in praise cause I do have some complaints.\n\nOne main plot point is that the revolutionary group wants to rescue the psychics in the movie but they never never fully explain why they want them free. Do they want to free them so the military doesn't have super weapons, because they feel that they are being mistreated like test animals, do they want to keep them for pets, or are they recruiting for the circus? All they mention is that Neo Tokyo is some sort of germinating seed and somehow Akira will fix it. I dunno, I guess that's one of the things I have to read the book for or just read a plot synopsis on wikipedia.\n\nSecondly, the pacing is all over the place. You've got a short burst of action followed by short slow paced peaceful scene then again an unexpected \"what the heck is going on i think I'm going nuts\" scene. Rather than feeling like a good roller coaster ride it's more like driving a smooth road with a giant rock every 100 feet.\n\nAfter watching it again I can see why this movie is considered a classic. This movie outclasses or is equal to many animations done by Studio Ghibli, Disney, Pixar etc. Probably the only other movie that I'm more impressed by the animation is Fantasia. I normally avoid Japanese anime like the plague but this movie strikes so many chords with me that it's among the few anime I actually watch. So take this as a recommendation that even if you don't like anime, Akira is a must watch.",

The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating.\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story.\n\nThe story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour.\n\nOne thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.",

It has enough twists and turns to always keep you guessing as to what will happen next, but it can take the appearance of being incoherent with the movie's tendency to not explain stuff until later on, when the moment you were scratching your head as to what was happening had already passed. To really appreciate everything in this film, from it's criticisms on the government and society, to science and technology will probably take two viewings. \n\nActing/Script: Probably the weakest point of the whole movie. The dialogue is pretty simplistic, and reeking of anime-isms ranging from screaming character's names over and over, to using fancy science words to explain things in ways that don't really make sense if the viewer has any real level of scientific back ground. To be fair, I did watch the movie in Japanese with english subtitles, and I'm sure it would have been better if I could actually understand the original Japanese. The voice actors for the most part delivered pretty passable lines, with none of the overly high pitched screaming that usually grates my ears when watching anime. \n\nSoundtrack: Not much to say about the soundtrack seeing as I can't really remember much of it after only having watched the movie minutes ago. It was mostly fitting, with no songs standing out as being extraordinarily good or bad.\n\nVisuals: The definite strongest point of the movie, and the biggest reason I would recommend at least one viewing of Akira. Many of the stills of the movie are beautiful on their own accord, and all the characters are extremely well animated, from the spry protagonist, to the grotesque form the antagonist takes on later in the movie. However, my favorite visuals have to be the light trails the motorcycles leave behind, reminiscent of the Tron movies.\n\nOverall: I'd say go see it. Once for the visuals, twice if you want a really complete grasp on the story and themes of the movie. Not my favorite anime movie, but a damn good one. 4/5",

The blast leads to World War III a few hours after. \r\n\r\n31 years later, gangs are terrorizing Neo-Tokyo, a city on an artificial island in Tokyo Bay near the old city of Tokyo. Troubled youths are placed into a foster system where the adults in charge are a bit rough with them. \r\n\r\nOne of these children, \"Tetsuo\" (voiced by Joshua Seth) is taken to a secret location where he is subject to experiments studying his awakening ESP powers. \r\n\r\n\"Tetsuo's\" powers grow as the movie progresses. He is slowly uncontrollable, and there may be only one thing that can stop him -- the one known as \"Akira.\" \r\n\r\nConsidered by many critics as one of the greatest animated movies of all time. It helped the sudden boom of popularity of Japanese Anime (aka Japanimation) the genre had in the Western hemisphere back in the 1990's. \r\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful. The use of mostly darker colors sets a mood wonderfully. Like most Anime, the characters appear to be from the West instead of Japanese and are drawn nicely. The movement of the characters, at times, makes you forget that they are cartoons. Also, the characters' mouths seem to be in perfect synch with the English voices, but it is obvious that their animated for the original Japanese dialogue. \r\n\r\nA note to parents: this is not Pokemon. There is strong language, violence and a lot of blood. I would suggest that you only allow older children who are pretty well out of the Pokemon phase before you allow them to see this. It is not for the Pokemon crowd. \r\n\r\nI am personally not an hard core Anime fan. However, I am a science-fiction fan, and this is pretty much a sci-fi movie. However, there really isn't a lot of science-fiction elements like futuristic weapons or futuristic technology. We do get a futuristic science though, which is a major plot device that works well. \r\n\r\nSomehow, the actors have some good on-screen chemistry and make the characters pretty believable. You can actually believe that they are on screen together through out the movie. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldn't put it on my \"Must See\" list. But, if you can catch it on HBO or even on On Demand like I did, you might not be disappointed.",

It is not that the book is more epic, it is, it is not that the scope is larger or that it is more developed, the book is also those things. What frustrates me is the balance, the brilliant tension between humor and violence, the geometric, carefully planned, insanity and tragedy, it all seems lost in the film. The only character that has any development (And I have noticed this is a frequent problem with Katsuhiro Otomo's films, unlike his comics) Is the antagonist, Tetsuo. The visuals still resonate in this film, the hallucinogenic cyberpunk insanity is still there and it is still strong, not falling flat against the cheesy writing, or the bad plotting, like many visual feasts today, which I find are just a string of intricately put together set pieces, whether it be video game or film. However, after reading the book, I can't find any real draw to this film, as I know what the writing in the book does for it, it is so much more powerful, so much stronger, then this movie, that all I see in this film is missed opportunity. Yes I am admitting to my bias, but also trying to bring awareness of the graphic novel, all six incredible, feverish, volumes. There are adaptations by other authors of manga into film, Nausicaa of the Valley of The Wind is one, and that is one of my favorite graphic novels, ever. Even then though, I think the writing of the adaptation of that comic is, on a plot and setting basis, still much more crafted then Akira the film. I really do feel that this was not a great adaptation. The comic is three thousand pages long and has incredible pacing. You can't make one single film out of three thousand pages, and I can imagine the difficulty in making Akira on any budget, period. I guess what I am trying to get as is the potency of the combination of the visuals present in the graphic novel with the downward spiral of a story, is absent in the film. It has been replaced with orgasmic visuals, with not the best foundation. There is so much the film draws from, and yet it doesn't really have any real focus on any of it. If you really like the film that much, you should read the books.",

            "content": "Considered a true cult classic for anime cinema, Akira sounded like another good step out into Japanese animated cinema.\n\nAs Akira is from 1988, it comes from the same year as the iconic Studio Ghibli animated piece My Neighbour Totoro. It is interesting to contrast the two films because they both contain excellent animation qualities and yet the sybject matter of the both of them is very different. My Neighbour Totoro is an easygoing childish fantasy whereas Akira is a violent and dystopian cyberpunk feature. I never expected Akira to live up to the standard of My Neighbour Totoro, but I was open to some Japanese cultural enrichment and welcomed a change of form for anime.\nThe universe of Akira is so big and so ambitious that there is a lot to take in. There is a lot of complicated political context, some of which is interesting and some of which is a bit much and distracts from the central plot. What is interesting about its relevance in the central plot is how it examines totalitarian government collapsing in on itself on a massive scale. The government in Neo-Tokyo is exceeding violent and corrupt, and it is destroyed by an experimental creation. Its obsession with power is its own downfall, and this is projected in a very original manner. This makes the internal story of Akira very complex. Occasionally it is a little too complex for its own good, but as it foes on the story becomes great and it incorporates in some science fiction themes to make it a new level of powerful, It is a well written film, even if sometimes it gets a bit distracted in its main focus. Although a lot of its story flaws are unavoidable, many of them are transcended by the quality of the visual experience that is Akira.\nIt is interesting to see such a universe depicted in animation, particularly because the detail in the animation is great. It has a truly gritty feel to it and a natural dystoipian sense since it has a sense of isolation and emptiness as well as a lot of sights which are tainted with cracks. The universe has some moments, particularly at night time, where it is remeniscent of the science fiction classic Blade Runner which makes it a nostalgic piece. Comparing the imagery of the two, Akira is a lot different because it feels dystopian in the sense that it is more crime-ridden than Blade Runner and less dark. Yet it is animated which projects a different look at a damaged futuristic society. Everything in Akira looks colourful and yet maintains a grim sense at the same time, and the universe looks great while the characters are all designed very well. The animation incurs a lot of blood, but it is all appropriate to the gritty nature of the film. What is most impressive is the animation of the action scenes. The action scenes in Akira are fast paced and very exviting with a lot of versatile animation to it. There are motorcycle chases, shootouts and superpowered contact fights. It all works to make Akira an exciting an exhilarating film, and it succeeds at being visually terrific and yet also tying into the thematics of the story being in a post-apocalyptic society. Akira has a lot of vibrantly crafted action scenes which are tense and memorable as well as exciting, and they are aided by powerful sound effects which are edited well. Everything plays out against the backdrop of a powerful musical score as well which gives the film more atmosphere and helps to emphasize the true scale of all the events, so Akira Succeeds very well from a visual and auditory perspective. It isn't difficult to see why Akira is considered a breakthrough in anime cinema because Katsuhiro Otomo's direction is great. Considering that he not only directed the film but also wrote and penned the original manga from 1982, the fact that he is director is perfect because it allows him to pursue his own vision. I've never read the manga, but I can tell you that the anime is pretty impressive due to its vibrant and aggressive energy. Although as an adaptation is leaves out a lot of the second half of the original manga's material and it feels like by the end of Akira there was more of a story to be told due to a lot of themes leaking into the story at many different times, for its time and for its ambition, Akira is a very successful and memorable film.\nOverall, Akira is a great experience. It is a look into the potential of Anime from when it began to bloom 26 years ago and explore the gritty material of violent turmoil in a post-World War III Japanese wasteland. It has an interesting concept and explores it in a very creative and original manner. There is a lot of material for the film to be working with which means that it hits a lot of marks just as easily as it misses others, but there is no denying the exciting exploration of the complex science fiction material in the film. It is a good example of a cyberpunk film which is captured well with a strong anime style and a true sense of tense grit as well as a strong visual style. There are a lot of complicated ideas that are put into the story which can make it a little overwhelming, but it really is powerful as an experience. Akira is a great example of the kind of potential that anime cinema offers, and its versatile exploration of all kinds of dystopian concepts in a story with valid social commentary really makes it an effective production.\n\nSo despite the fact that Akira has such a huge and complicated universe which can sometimes be either overwhelming or ambiguous, it is an excellently animated and exhilarating piece of anime cinema with some complex political subtext and entertaining action scenes.",

It's a mess and maybe perfect for it.  Mind boggling hand drawn animation, amazing tribal/electronic score (once again so fitting to the content), searing images of horror on a character to character scale as well as a societal scale (institutionalized violence erupts just as shockingly as wayward telekinetic rampages), a landmark in anime and animation period.  Hard to stomach, and yet magnetizes attention.  I tend to have to take breaks months/years long before I rewatch, and yet I rewatch.  There's nothing quite like 'AKIRA'.  \n\nI'm not an anime purist when it comes to subtitles vs. dubbing, but this is one time it's a must see in original Japanese dialog with subs (unless you speak Japanese) as the English dub renders inappropriate wacky over the top spin in the tone that's very out of place.   \n\nCurrently reading the epic (thousands of pages long) manga by Katsuhiro Otomo, who was also this film's director.  If you haven't seen a decent anime film before, I would suggest the beautiful and world renowned work of Hayao Miyazaki.  'AKIRA' would invite you with a kick in the face, yet (here's another ironic contradiction emerging from the film prefaced by a 'yet') many in the western world were apparently introduced to anime by this film in the 80's/early 90's, leading to its growth here across the great blue divide of the Pacific.",

The story was adapted from a manga (Japanese graphic novel) the size of a phone book, so stuff almost certainly hast to get cut to meet film lines, especially with animation, but it still feels really empty. A lot of the story was taken out, and a lot of things are left unexplained. Itâ(TM)s still a decent movie, donâ(TM)t get me wrong; but it is much more of an important film than it is a good movie. This film inspired a lot of what anime would be in the future, and changed its medium. I respect it for that, and to be fair, the story is well done on its own, and the characters are certainly well developed, but I cannot deny its flaws as a whole.

            "content": "From the opening shot of Neo-Tokyo in 2019 which was decimated by a nuclear blast to the anarchy and chaos of the biker gangs fighting it out, this film sets out the proper tone right away. It has that theme of anarchy versus order where the military tries to sustain control in an environment where its people has lost all hope, and even cults have begun to form who have started anti-government movements. Tetsuo is set up as the disgruntled member, who obviously has the most history with the leader Kanada and can be considered the second in command, but is generally looked down upon. Everything changes when he runs into Number 26 who transfers his power onto Tetsuo who immediately gets taken by the government. I like how science and the army clash in different views for the experiments like Akira, who is deemed the most powerful, or Tetsuo who is growing in power and their similar interests. Science looks it at as the next step in evolution in science in controlling such power and the military wants to use it as a weapon; however, I like how the military changes views right away when it makes the rational decision that it is too much power for one to handle and that it must be taken down by all means, meaning Tetsuo. The film is ravishing with spectacular visuals in animation, especially the gory scenes, Tetsuo transforming into a monster, and the soundtrack is fitting especially Tetsuoâ(TM)s theme when he becomes more of a threat. The rebels where a bit tacked on though, because I think that this was a more personal story on Tetsuo vs Kanada in a change of leadership, Tetsuo became more powerful and had no need for Kanada to protect him anymore as Tetsuo was constantly bullied in his youth and Kanada had his back. Tired of this, Tetsuo grew resentful and with his newfound power, he ironically ruled with an iron fist as a bully. If the movie focused more on Tetsuo, Kanada, Tetsuoâ(TM)s girlfriend, Science, and the Military then the film would have been paced a little better, I just found the rebels a bit tacked on. Overall, the film gets a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Where It All Began for Many, Many [i]Otaku[/i]  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a child, there was a commercial for what was basically the anime-of-the-month-club, which welcomed you into (if I remember correctly) \"the fascinating world of Japanimation.\"  (As we called it in those days.)  This was prominently displayed in it, because it had just come out and was blowing people's mind, man.  When I was in college, I discovered the phenomenon of the anime music video.  The best of these, so far as I'm concerned, is a brilliant version of Van Halen's \"Right Now,\" which exactly followed the structure of the original version and complained about that idiot who considers himself an anime expert because he's seen this and a couple of episodes of [i]Dragonball Z[/i].  (These days, I believe you would insert [i]Naruto[/i] into that sentence instead.)  Because everyone--everyone--with even a little interest in anime has seen this movie.  It's one of the symptoms and has been for more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nExplaining the plot, however, gets a bit complicated, and not merely because the manga on which it is based is over two [i]thousand[/i] pages long, meaning the story skips a lot of detail.  Briefly, though, Tokyo was destroyed thirty-odd years before our story begins.  The year is now 2019, and our characters are members of one of the biker gangs of Neo-Tokyo.  (Biker gangs of Tokyo are actually a thing.)  The gang is led by Shôtarô Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata).  For years now, he has been best friends with Tetsuo Shima (Nozomu Sasaki), who is envious of much of Kaneda's life, including the really spectacular motorcycle he drives.  One day, they are fighting against a rival gang, the Clowns, and Tetsuo gets into an accident.  And develops telekinetic powers, like you do.  He seems to be possessed by the spirit of a boy named Akira, whose powers are what destroyed the original Tokyo.  There is a lot of complicated political intrigue, and Tetsuo is going crazy.\r\n\r\nWhen people say negative things about this movie, they usually start by talking about the violence.  In my opinion, it is a much better starting place to talk about the limited amount of sense it actually makes.  One of the reasons I'm skipping over the politics is that I myself don't entirely understand what's going on there.  A man named Colonel Shikishima (Tarô Ishida) controls the military around Neo-Tokyo, but I was never clear on the structure he was a member of.  He seemed to answer directly to Parliament, and when he stages a coup to ensure that the Akira threat is dealt with as he feels it ought to be, there does not seem to be anyone in the military who outranks him.  There's a great deal of talk about tax reforms which have essentially destroyed the Japanese economy, and I assume the detail is explored in the manga--I mean, with over two thousand pages, you'd hope so--but I didn't really get it here.  Or even think it was entirely necessary.\r\n\r\nBut no--violence.  Which is odd, because I really don't think [i]Akira[/i] is all that violent.  The violence is a little hallucinogenic, which means it has a . . . well.  I hesitate to use the word \"visceral,\" because part of the issue is that a character is basically killed by being crushed by someone's organs, but it is also the right word.  The point is, the feel of the violence in [i]Akira[/i] is not like the feel of the violence in, say, a Michael Bay movie.  There are explosions here, but there are not merely explosions, and the explosions are the least of everyone's problems.  There isn't even quite as much highly pressurized blood as you get in a lot of violent anime, where people get papercuts and have blood spurt twenty feet.  But because the violence is so unreal so much of the time, it has a bigger effect.  It's also true that the gang warfare isn't exactly [i]West Side Story[/i], either.  I mean, these guys are swinging blades at one another from motorcycles, and that isn't going to end well for anyone.\r\n\r\nI don't know what it is about [i]Akira[/i] that has given it the place it has in anime history.  It certainly isn't the best anime that I've ever seen.  In fact, the last time I saw it was with the Giant Robot Appreciation Society, which is the anime club at The Evergreen State College, and we got horribly distracted by comparing the cult of Akira (within the movie) to the more vocal of our fellow students.  Certainly they're equally laughable quite a lot of the time.  The plot is convoluted, and I haven't even gotten into the \"kindergarten.\"  It is, of course, visually striking, comparable to [i]Blade Runner[/i].  And, of course, for many people, it was simply the first anime they'd ever seen.  That same AMV that I mentioned earlier grouses about how Disney delays their Studio Ghibli releases, which is certainly true.  However, the thing about the distribution deal between Ghibli and Disney is that Ghibli [i]gets[/i] American distribution.  Hardly any other anime does, making [i]Akira[/i] practically unique just for that.",

If you consider yourself someone who usually loathes this style of animation, I urge you to give it a shot. \n\nStrong visual imagery, vivid colours, and elaborate, choreographed action sequences combine to form the hostile and turbulent environment that is \"neo-tokyo\".

Its just a little over 2 hours of intense, ultra violent science fiction with all kinds of intense drama.  It's pretty cliché, but that's mainly because we've seen all of these clichés amongst other forms of media throughout the years.  So, the Original Cliché...I can deal with that.\n\nIt's quite ridiculous at points, and can get truly bizarre as well.  Not that that's a bad thing, it just hasn't quite aged as well as some other anime classics such as Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky.  It's a crazy fever dream action film that never ceases until things get truly ridiculous in scope.\n\nIts influences spread far and wide throughout all types of media ranging from film, television, and video games.

When Akira was released, the audiences were amazed by the depth of detailing used in this animated film. Today Akira is known as a milestone in Japanese animation that helped set the standard for modern anime. The film is extremely detailed. From small window panes to large buildings, everything's marvelous. The opening scene itself is in my opinion one the powerful scenes in cinematic history. The character design too is lovely. The bikes, the clothing style, the dirty streets of Neo-Tokyo, everything's captured just perfectly. Secondly, I never talk about sound very much but in Akira's case the sound design in both the Japanese and English dubs is mind-blowing, one of the reasons why I love this film so much. GeinÃ...? Yamashirogumi's score syncs perfectly with the environment and energy of Akira. \n\nSo in short, this film has state-of-the-art animation and sound design and these get a perfect score from me. As they say, well begun is half done. Otomo gives Neo-Tokyo a personality too, one of the driving forces of this film. But then what of the central theme, the story? Yes, that's brilliant too. As the anime is based on Otomo's 2000 page manga, they had to cut down serious amount of the story. Still, Akira has all the vital elements. The characters in Akira are quite complex and realistic. Tetsuo is shown as a perfect maniac who is bestowed with terrible power that can destroy cities. Tetsuo was always \"the last one\" in his life. Thus, he takes revenge on unleashing his powers at his own will on anyone who tries to stop him or order him. Kaneda is Tetsuo's best friend and he the kind of friend anyone would want in their real lives. He is the hero who is trying to stop Tetsuo from harm. These two characters were portrayed very strongly being the two most vital elements in the film. I won't talk about other characters as there are too many. I will just say in short that they too were animated very well. \n\nIn conclusion, Akira is an instant classic cult film. Akira clearly fulfills the meaning of the word \"Animation\" which means bringing an inanimate object to life. Akira is extremely bloody and violent though. So it's not for kids...\n\nVisit my movie page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart",

Like Ghost this film also had a massive influence on the Wachowski brothers so a lot of it's style was subsequently aped by the Matrix. Final Fantasy VII was also heavily influenced by Akira especially it's futuristic setting and lead antagonist. \n\nI first saw Akira when I was a child and it fried my then 10 year old brain. Quite simply I had never seen anything like it and it freaked me out as much as I enjoyed it. I have seen it several times over the years but this was the first time I had the opportunity in high definition and quite simply the film never gets old.\n\nThe film starts with boldly with a nuclear exposure wiping out a great deal of 1989 era Tokyo and triggering a third world war. The story then fast forwards 25 years when we are introduced to the new post apocalyptic Neo Tokyo. A place that has largely been rebuilt but where youthful rebellion and violence rules the streets. \n\nAmongst this choas two best friends Tetsuo and Kaneada and a group of other teenagers, race and fight rival motor cycle gangs. One night during a battle with the clown's gang, Tetsuo encounters a strange boy who causes the power that destroyed Tokyo 25 years ago to begin to awaken within in him, the mysterious power of Akira. Can Kaneda prevent his friend from causing a second apocalypse and avert the start of a forth world war?\n\nAt the time of release Akira cost $8 million dollars to make and despite the fact that it's now over 20 years old it still looks absolutely superb. The hand drawn animation is still breathtaking in places and some of the iconic imagery will stay with you long after the film has finished. Disturbing, mind boggling and stunning in equal measure, Akira is never boring and still remains a classic of not just Anime but also Sci-fi cinema.",

It's also one of the unique comic book movies not to have any superheroes, but rather it's about a teenager who gets these powers that he cannot control. It'd be like someone moody that you hate, then that person gets those powers.\n\nIt's not at all like a MARVEL or DC movie. It's based off one of the landmark manga comics of all time with the same name. In fact it's had as much of an impact on comics as Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, Watchmen, and Maus have had on the whole comic book industry.\n\nThis movie also proves that animation is NOT just for kids. Animation is MADE for kids today because Hollywood thinks it is only meant for kids, but animation does not equal a kids movie. This a post-apocalyptic science fiction movie with intense violence. It is also to a degree a disturbing film. It shows the aftermath of a Nuclear Holocaust. This movie also shows that you can make a mature cartoon that adults will love. It broke box office records in Japan at the time of its release, so why can't this kind of animation appeal to the regular Western crowd? It should.\n\nThis movie isn't a Disney movie. It isn't a Hayao Miyazaki movie. It's in a league of its own. Also another important thing to keep in mind:\n\nWITHOUT THIS MOVIE, THE MATRIX WOULDN'T EXIST!!!!!!! This is what makes culturally important. If you see this movie, get it or rent it. It has great story, reasonably likeable characters, a great science fiction experience for hardcore fans of the genre, or minor fans of the genre, and the animation is beyond incredible!!!!

His friends and fellow gang members - especially their leader Kaneda try to get their friend back in the meanwhile...\r\n\r\nIt all evolves in a violent way - violent being an understatement.\r\n\r\nAkira is another perfect example of how great Japanese animation culture is and how storytelling in (animated) films is ought to be done - after more than twenty years Akira is still full of relevant themes like power, greed and political discontent and nihilistic world views.",

            "content": "In 1988, anime master Katsuhiro Otomo shook critical and audience records with his breakthrough motion picture, Akira.  At the time of its release, anime was new to audiences and nobody ever thought of an adult oriented animated feature.  Not only did Akira become a cult hit with audiences, but it also set the stage for anime as we know it.\n\n     Based on a 6-part manga series created by Otomo, the plot takes place in the year 2019.  Neo Tokyo becomes the new city that emerges from the ashes at the end of WWIII.  Neo Tokyo society becomes dominated by martial law.  Crime and student demonstrations run rampant and motorcycle gangs constantly fight amongst the streets.  During a brawl between a gang led by Shinchiro Kaneda and their rival gang known as \"The Clowns'' Kaneda's childhoos friend Tetsuo Shima gets injured during a run-in with an abducted telepathic child.  Tetsuo gets abducted by the military and becomes an experimental specimen after he displays atypical psychic phenomena.  Meanwhile, Kaneda becomes entangled with a resistance group led by Kei and Ryu who plan to infiltrate the lab and abduct the specimen to forward their agenda.  Tetsuo escapes in an attempt to find out about his condition and the so-called Akira, but upon his discovery of his newfound powers he goes on a chaotic rampage across Neo Tokyo in order to find the answers.\n\n     The plot is an intelligent, dark, yet dense and complex narrative.  It tackles lots of themes like creationism, politics, religion, science, and prophecy.  There are a lot of subplots in this movie and every one of them are tackled through the perspective of exposing humanities' overconfidence in dealing with that which is beyond its capabilities.  Everything in this movie is very well executed and Otomo's direction is top notch.  The action scenes are engaging and every scene is wonderfully played.\n\n     The animation is also excellent.  The attention to detail is wonderfully done.  The style stands out and is a legitimate stark contrast to the animation style used in the Studio Ghibli films.  Every image moves very smoothly and the backgrounds are wonderfully rendered.  Even the action scenes and images of background destruction in correlation to the events depicted are wonderfully rendered.\n\n     The music and voice acting are also great.  The music, done by Shoji Yamashiro, consists of both vocal and orchestral tracks.  Each does well in setting the mood of every image and event.  The dub in both English and Japanese is well done.  Aside from the original Japanese track, there exist two different versions of Akira's English dub: the 1988 Streamline dub and the 2001 Pioneer dub. \n\n     I haven't seen the entire Streamline dub and I don't know if it's available on dvd.  I'll be talking more about the Pioneer dub, since it's the version I currently own.  Kaneda is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch (Trigun, Bleach, Code Geass, Gankutsuou).  Kei is voiced by Wendee Lee (The Melancholy of Huruhi Shuzumiya, Outlaw Star, Ninja Scroll).  Tetsuo is voiced by Joshua Seth (Digimon, Wolf's Rain, Cyborg 009, Last Exile).  I have mixed feelings about the Pioneer dub in general.  All of the voice actors perform their roles nicely and every voice matches each of the characters.\n\n     On the other hand, some the alternate translations feel kind of strange.  Some even feel a little underdeveloped.  An example being when the doctor talks about Tetsuo's psychic pattern readings and its connections with discovering the fundamental truths about the birth of the universe.  Another being about the psychic kids and their departure with Akira after his awakening and when Kaneda tries to rescue Tetsuo.  These parts do leave some dense, yet not incomprehensible subplots.  From what I've seen of the Streamline dub, the voice overs for the characters sound more mature for their ages (them being teenagers), but the dialogue in these parts is more understandable.  Thus, making the plot more comprehensible.          \n\n     Akira is a landmark feature that is well deserved of its status of influential motion pictures.  Akira is one of those movies that not only proves why people, like me, love anime, but also shows that animation can be just as satisfying for adults.  The translations can be a little iffy and the story may be too dense and bloody for some people.  But everything from the engaging action, great animation, complex storyline, and top notch acting are enough to earn my praise.\n\n*Thanks for reading and Happy Halloween.",
