This movie made me laugh more then most comedies do, it made me cry and it made me think about human relationships in another way. Rain Man gives one of the best male acting performances of all time, with Dustin Hoffman. He is just absolutely perfect as Raymond and he doesn't question you one time, if he is really autistic. Tom Cruise is solid as well, he has some core emotional scenes and does a great job in them. The score of Hans Zimmer is absolutely gorgeous, you really are just being transformed into the movie and realize that the score is doing a lot of the work to be able to do that. The directing is great, the movie has some iconic still frames, the editing is flawless and the screenplay so much fun, while still delivering a complex character study, fantastic stuff here and another great best picture winner!",

Once you get past the horribly dated 80s music score, Rain Man is touching film about brotherly love and acceptance, extremely well written and acted.  From a period relatively early in his career, Tom Cruise provides evidence that he's a pretty decent actor, but the movie is stolen by Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of the autistic savant Raymond, a character who is alternately funny, heartbreaking and infuriating.",

The movie received other Oscars too although I did not see anything else exceptional in the movie. Some of the things that bored me are: populistic screenplay and dialogue that try to manufacture drama out of nothing, typical wooden \"acting\" by Tom Cruise, quite an unnecessary romantic interest to Cruise's character, and an unrealistically sensational stint in a Vegas casino. Nevertheless, see it for Hoffman's performance (this is the only reason I gave it four stars) but don't walk away with the impression that autistic people are savants - very few are.",

It's a slow burner that does feel slightly drawn out at times, but it makes total sense to learn the full extent of Raymond's state of mind and Charlie's self centeredness and greed.  And while slow, Rain Man captures all sorts of emotions throughout every act.  Dustin Hoffman's performance is so good, it's scary.  It's incredible how authentic he appears the entire way through, playing what must've been an incredibly difficult role.  I went from hating Charlie (Tom Cruise) to feeling for him.  And his character arc is one of the best I've ever seen.  He develops from a selfish, greedy and entitled douchebag into a caring brother that creates a genuine connection with his older sibling in what blossoms into a beautiful relationship.  Charlie believes Raymond to be a nuisance (putting it politely) and clearly thinks that he can provide \"every day\" advice and loses it when it fails to work.  Then figures out how important routine is to Raymond and starts to witness how brilliant he is and becomes attached toward the end, passing up a huge chunk of money in favor of having his brother in his life for the first time.  The ending was a little abrupt and I'd have liked to see more into their future together but Rain Man pulled on every one of my emotional strings and I loved every minute of it.  One of the most emotionally rewarding movies I've ever seen.",

The writing was definitely a missed opportunity in several respects. It felt like there should have been more to it than a lot of repetitive dialogue and driving, hotel, and eating sequences.

            "content": "Rain man is a film about autism and bonding.\nRain Man is a story of a cars salesman, who finds out he has a brother. The brother is autistic and has been given a will of a million dollars which the other brother Charlie wants. Charlie kidnaps the brother in order to get his money. As the brother, Raymond is autistic, he's very smart and Charlie decides to use his brother's skills at counting cards to get money all the while, getting to know the brother he never knew. The films have some strong themes with bonding and adapting to new situations all executed well. The road trip plot is a great way to provide skeletal structure to the tension and stakes of the film. We get to know the characters of Charlie and Raymond before the road trip kicks into gear. We see that Charlie is a businessman and has a job but doesn't accept his pay for the day's work. He holds a grudge against his father for keeping money away from him particularly because Charlie feels that he was unworthy. That brings us to Raymond. He doesn't have a job and can't function in society. He has fascinations with cars and doesn't like change in his routine. With these flawed characters, the road trip helps the two grow as people. Although Raymond isn't rude like Charlie, he needs to learn that things in life can change and have unpredictability. Just as Raymond doesn't have a mean bone in his body indicating that he doesn't need to grow more humble, Raymond needs to be back home with his basic needs. He ends up returning to the institution Charlie finds him at but what the film knows how to execute is the experience Raymond had. He got in touch with his long-lost brother and dropped some of his OCD tendencies and even got to laugh at himself and his brother. Charlie, in turn, has more development as a character as he starts off selfish, but learns to appreciate his family, to the point that when someone is called in to take Raymond in, Charlie gets defensive and says he would want to spend more time with his brother the one family member that Charlie has had close ties with as of late. Charlie really grows a person and changes for the better and is allowed to change and given the opportunity, unlike Raymond who ends up going back to his roots. In the end, Charlie is given development as a character which helps him grow, while Raymond grows from the experience he got to have.\nI like the character of Raymond in particular. It's interesting knowing about the quirks of this autistic character both verbally and physically. I find it easy to relate to him as I have traces of autism myself. He's socially awkward, ditzy, and friendly. However, he's also intelligent thanks to his disability and is pretty bright. I can see some people empathizes with Raymond's disabilities even if they don't have autism. Charlie starts off as selfish and rude but also smart but unlike Raymond, he uses his smarts to scheme. Sometimes you can understand why he's annoyed with Raymond but he's not one to judge as just because he is high functioning, doesn't mean he is good with manners. However in a way you can relate to Charlie with how he just wants respect from his family and eventually comes to see Raymond as family. There are other characters in the film, but it's really the journey of these two individuals that shows strong characters.\nThe visuals in this film are pretty good. Seeing as this is a Road Film, we get a lot of shots along the open road. As mentioned Hoffman gives Raymond some great physical quirks which help the visual style. This is one of Hoffman's best-known roles.\nOf course, the acting from Cruise and Hoffman is great. This is the film that really helped Crusie become a serious actor and more than just an action star. He gives Charlie a lot of charisma and overacting. This is really Cruise's film as he appears in more scenes than Hoffman.\nThe music in this movie is decent with Iko Iko as the main theme song to the film. \nTo conclude Rain Man is a wonderful movie with actors Cruise and Hoffman giving larger-than-life performances to a great script. Its themes are very relatable and may hit close to home for some people. I think this film is awesome and to say recommending this movie would be an understatement.",

Once he moved to the big city of Los Angeles he quite naturally attained a self-centered nature that most of these privaleged residents walk around with. As he got older Charlie's relationship with his father became estranged so it comes as no surprise Charlie got the short end of the stick when it came to the his fathers last will and testament. Even worse Charlie discovers that his father left the whole 3 million fortune to a man he's never heard of. This infuriates Charlie to the point where he has no choice but to head home to Cincinnati to sort out this debacle. Charlie is informed that the money has been left in a trust for his older brother, Raymond whom Charlie had no idea even existed. Raymond is autistic but seems to be a bit of a genius when it comes to numbers. Entirely acting off emotion Charlie kidnaps his brother from the mental institution in the hopes he can convince the institution director to give him half of the fortune left to Raymond. The two then embark on a cross-country trip, Raymond proves to grow on his brother much faster than Charlie thought imaginable. Soon this grows into a powerful connection and unbreakable bond, one with the strength to change both brothers lives forever. \n\nThis film succeeds very well at creating a beautiful moving story while at the same time startling. The cinematography and scenery of the film was stunning at times and Hans Zimmer almost literally always creates a very effective score. The script of this piece was also excellent I may add. The two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise were perfect but especially Hoffman whose portrayal was breathtaking and he clearly immersed himself in that role to the point where he's almost unrecognizable. This film is truly deserving of That Best Picture Oscar without any doubt or incertitude.",

            "content": "Barry Levinson's 1988 classic has not necessarily aged well, but remains a staple of Hollywood film history. Rain Main namely tackles the savant syndrome, a special phenomenon of autism. A topic that almost no one had on their mind at the time. The plot around it is quickly told: After the death of his estranged father, the egotistical car dealer Charlie is drawn to his hometown in Connecticut, where he looks at the will. In the process, Charlie discovers that his father's entire fortune has been left to his previously unknown big brother Raymond, who has been in an autism institute for many years. Charlie then hatches a nasty plan that leads to an unexpectedly emotional journey.\n\nRain Man has earned its cult status specifically thanks to the stirring chemistry between the two brothers Charlie (Tom Cruise) and Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman). In his breakthrough role, Tom Cruise is excellent alongside the established and highly regarded Dustin Hoffman, although his character is not a sympathetic one, especially at the beginning. His greed for money and obsession with himself lead to a lack of understanding of his socially challenged brother's condition. Of course, he didn't know of his brother's existence all these years and therefore had to deal with this bomb, but his complete lack of empathy makes Charlie something of an antagonist until the middle of the film. Through Cruise's authentic acting we learn more and more about Charlie and why he acts the way he does. The fact that he is able to relate to Raymond better and better as the film progresses and increasingly puts aside his almost evil behaviour towards him helps to make us almost like him towards the end. But the show is clearly stolen by Dustin Hoffman as the autistic Raymond. Regardless of how realistically he portrays a person with this syndrome, Hoffman captivates you from second one and you are always invested in his character. Of course, you also feel sorry for Raymond because of his lack of expressiveness, but it's mainly the human element that Hoffman brings across so brilliantly. You almost think you can put yourself in his place, even though he lives in a world of which you, as a non-affected viewer, have no idea.\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning, Rain Man has not necessarily aged well over the years. This is mainly due to the clichés typical of Hollywood at the time, which apply especially to Cruise's character. The bad boy with the pretty Italian girlfriend (also the cliché of women falling for men of this ilk) who starts out with seedy intentions and gets better as he goes along. Surely this is the cornerstone of why it ends up being a feel-good movie that warms hearts despite its harsh quintessence. Still, this theme could have been suggested in a much more serious and professional manner. The simple plot therefore makes Rain Man almost a pure feel-good film, but one that definitely educates and should therefore rightly be seen by people.",

Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) is a Los Angeles car dealer who hears the news of his father's death in Ohio and discovers his long-lost brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), an autistic savant with a terrific ability of memorizing numbers. On top of the title being a play on Raymond's first name, it also reflects his allusion to water. In an early monologue, Charlie refers to an imaginary friend Rain Man who sang to him when he was frightened. That moment would revive later when Raymond sings ‘I Saw Her Standing There' to Charlie in a hotel. Also, Raymond has a strong reaction to water, whether when it rains, keeping Charlie inside for a few days or when Charlie turns on the hot water in a bathtub, causing a meltdown. Conversely, Charlie's personality is described as impatient and, to fit metaphorically, fiery. The fire in Charlie matches with his strained relationship with his family, attraction to desert cities, explosive temperaments, incapability to handle stress, and concealing personal information from Susanna (Valeria Golino). And like fire, the only way to prevent it from spreading is water. So, Raymond, the brother once perceived as a symbolic imaginary friend, is the water that Charlie needs to stop the fire inside him, but it takes a whole deal of patience to replenish it. \n\n(4 Pizzas with Tapioca, Apple Juice Boxes, and Cheese Balls out of 5)",

And, I have to say, I'm sitting at a big, fat goose egg on pretty much every account. That's not to say the 1989 Best Picture winner doesn't have a few memorable lines, laughs or scenes that make you wince. I simply found this to be a much more enduring piece of drama, than it was a comedy. And, for the scenes that \"don't age well,\" could it be that we as a moviegoing populace kind of miscalculated the way they were supposed to be taken from jump? No, you're not supposed to like Tom Cruise's character. No, you're not necessarily supposed to want Dustin Hoffman to end up with him in the end. This is a text book drama, filled with anger, baggage and characters making critical errors in both judgment and emotionality. My gut instinct is to err on the side of allowing a narrative to challenge its audience. \"Rain Man\" does so, and its success is thanks in no small part to the incredible performance work from both Hoffman and Cruise, as well as some staging from Barry Levinson and a classic score from Hans Zimmer.",

Watching Cruise show Charlie change throughout the movie and understand that family is more important than money. He has to learn to understand Raymond in many ways. Raymond has schedules he likes to keep to, from TV, clothes and food. Initially Charlie is reluctant to fully embrace this but changes. There are some touching moments, from Charlie teaching Raymond how to dance, the end as their heads touch and also Raymond telling Charlie who the rainman is. Hoffman does the little things so well. From his facial expressions, to his touching of his hand and also repeating many phrases when nervous. You can tell he has researched and tried to create a believable character. Cruise character is very unlikable at the start and has a lack of understanding of people with learning disabilities.

Though I whould recommend it for people who want to learn about family or love movies with dramatic relationships.",

There is the fact that the kidnapping for ransom of a person from a mental institution is an incredibly serious act - that was not given enough weight in this film in the beginning or middle, and the consequences for such an action later in the film not given enough weight either.

            "content": "This was made during a special, very interesting period of Tom Cruise's career when he was appearing in thoughtful serious dramas playing characters who were complicated and sometimes unlikable. Of the three films I've seen of this ilk, the Color of Money (1986) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989) being the other two, I would say that this is the most consistently entertaining but it's emotional manipulations are very clear which caused the cynic in me to partially object to elements of it. I love Barry Levinson as a director and although I could name about 6 films he's directed that I think are better than this it's nice to see him get rewarded. When considering this film as a Best Picture winner it seems odd because although I think it is a very good film I was never amazed by it and it seems incongruous with the other films that have won the same award.\n\nCharlie Babbitt, Tom Cruise, is a struggling car salesman who discovers that his father who he was emotionally distant from has died. He sees a way to keep his business financially afloat as his father left $3 million in assets to his autistic brother Raymond, Dustin Hoffman, who's existence he was previously unaware of. He kidnaps Raymond from the facility he has been living at and takes him on a road trip to get back to Los Angeles as he attempts to blackmail Raymond's doctor, Dr. Bruner, Jerry Molen, for half of the inheritance. The two begin to genuinely bond however and as Raymond helps Charlie out of his financial struggles he realizes that he is a savant.\n\nCruise gives one of his best performances here and he is able to apply his cynical yuppie persona to a character who goes on a believable character arc. Cruise is convincing as a handsome, manipulative man who is used to getting what he wants but his inability to emotionally connect due to his distant father figure makes him sympathetic. Cruise is able to sell his transformation from this man who is using the ends to justify the means and treating his brother in an abhorrent way to a loving, supportive brother who just needs to feel emotional connection. When Raymond's mental state is evaluated we see just how much he needs somebody to lean upon but is ultimately able to accept that receiving constant medical treatment is the best thing for his brother.\n\nHoffman is also very good as he adopts various tics that have now been seen as potentially spreading misinformation about people suffering from autism but at the time this was a very progressive portrayal of an autistic person. He is extremely annoying at the beginning of the film and we can't help but be on Charlie's side as he complains about his underwear but as Charlie comes to appreciate him so do we. When he dances with Charlie's girlfriend Susanna, Valerie Golino, in an elevator he is sweet and endearing in his awkwardness. We come around to appreciating him and how important he is to Charlie by the end of the film and in the final scene as he leaves on the train we hope that the two brothers see each other again.\n\nThe music should also be noted as it is entertaining and well used in the casino scenes in particular. Hans Zimmer seems like an odd choice for this film as I associate him more with science fiction films, those directed by Christopher Nolan in particular, but he's able to keep the film feeling light and breezy even as it stretches to over two hours. \"Stardust\" by Aaron Neville and \"At Last\" by Etta James were standouts to me and they really enhanced the effect of certain scenes.\n\n1988 was a weird year for Best Picture nominations because although I enjoy all of the films nominated I wouldn't dream of calling them Best Picture worthy. I personally would have given the award to The Accidental Tourist (1988) but that's just me. I would certainly call this a very good film but I wouldn't say it's anything incredible and it's not the best work of the film's director.",

            "content": "A charming road trip movie.\n\nRain Man (1988) gives an empathetic look into the lives of the autistic. Though it narrowly views them as troubled savants instead of mentally challenged people suffering from a debilitating disease, Rain Man is a very tender film.\n\nBarry Levinson's direction is really beautiful and a fun way to look at America from a driver's perspective. Levinson shows the struggles of the afflicted and their families as well as the impact of childhood trauma resurfacing years later. The themes of brotherhood and compassion are powerful and affecting. Levinson takes care in not making fun of the autistic community, but Rain Man does simplify the disease into a series of visual ploys that does come across like stereotyping.\n\nTom Cruise is captivating as the sleazy con artist that must learn sympathy and empathy for his autistic brother. Cruise is brilliant at playing the trickster into the caring. He's so mean throughout Rain Man, but so funny and sympathetic for his situation and backstory. Cruise ends up making you care and feel teary eyed by the finale of Rain Man.\n\nDustin Hoffman makes a brave choice to attempt to accurately portray someone with autistic savant condition. His performance is super annoying, yet often funny and endearing. Hoffman does a better job at this style of acting than Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. However, it is frustrating to witness Hoffman's interactions with Cruise. He is pretty incredible in Rain Man all the same.\n\nThe 1980's synth score is hazy and excellent. The pacing is pretty quick, and the movie is fun overall. I liked the sweet girlfriend performance from the heavily accented Valeria Golino. She comes across as very genuine and kind in Rain Man.\n\nIn short, this movie may not work for some as the depiction of autism is difficult to represent and watch no matter how good it is really. Rain Man does an admirable job.",

            "content": "I finally got to watch this movie. It really was on my radar for a very very long time. The movie's story is not unconventional by any means, but thanks to Levinson's smart direction, Ronald Bass' powerful script that adds a lot of fresh details, and the terrific performances from the leads, Rain Man feels very original. In fact, I can even see how the ending would be from the beginning, but that didn't make the slightest issue for me. \n\nBarry Levinson presented the movie in a way that manages to generate emotion in their audience without ever feeling melodramatic. That's because Levinson avoided many clichés, the most important one of them is the typical way of storytelling. Instead of making a movie that relies on drama, he made road-trip movie that produces a catharsis of emotions more than you would ever imagine.  \n\nAs a matter of fact, the movie feels as if it has a character-driven story, except it's actually not. And the result is a movie that has a very restricted and bound plot, but it never feels that way. While watching the movie, I felt that I can't expect anything. I felt as if I was watching a movie with a picaresque tale, but it's actually far from being that. \n \nUnlike Wag the Dog, Rain Man has a lot of memorable moments that will stay with you forever. In other words, Barry Levinson made Rain Man feels more cinematic than Wag the Dog. But I'll say it again, the movie never feels overly sentimental. \n\nDustin Hoffman gave one of the Best Performances in his career, but I really can't say if he had deserved the Oscar more than Tom Hanks in Big or not. Tom Cruise's performance is really what stands out in my opinion. I think he gave one of, if not his best performance ever. I don't want to spoil anything for who haven't watched this wonderful film yet, but there are a lot of scenes that show Cruise's acting abilities, and prove that he is underappreciated as an actor who really can deliver some exceptional dramatic performances, not just doing incredible stunts and running. I think he deserved to be nominated for an Oscar at the least. \n\nThat being said, I have some issues with Rain Man. The first one is that the beginning was a bit rushed and very fast-paced for its own good. Specially because the drama kicks off very early, and the movie should have taken its time to represent it. \n\nThe entire message of the movie has been literally revealed near the end by Tom Cruise, so that's an obvious, and a bit annoying problem.\n\nAlso, the ending could have been a little bit shorter. However, the last 15-20 minutes has some of the smartest, and most powerful dialogue ever written. And it also has the most intense and moving moments in the movie. \n\nThe moments that show Raymond math prowess were very hilarious and funny at the beginning, then they became kinda overused, but after that they were taken advantage of very cleverly.\n\nOverall, I loved Rain Man so much, and I really don't know why there are many people who think it didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Picture. It's meticulously written, impressively directed, beautifully shot, superbly acted, engaging, moving, touching, and above all that, it's very enjoyable. Also, Zimmer's score is electrifying!\n\n(8.5/10)",

Whereas most films treat their historicity, their existence within a chronological timeline, as something to pass over, as something to guard themselves against, aiming instead for general sort of timelessness, here the experience of history is at the fore of the movie's meaning making. The drum machine score, the Vegas setting, the horrid clothes, the a-list casting: Everything works to place you squarely, unmistakably in the 80s-at least in regards to Cruise's character; meanwhile, what surround's Hoffman's character are signifiers of a long gone, but still very recognizable and locatable, past: An outmoded style, classic cars, early Beatles tunes. The reason I think this is such a crucial decision and is at the heart of why the movie is still effective three decades later is that it foregrounds how the identification, treatment, and social stigma of developmental disorders is a historical, contingent problem. Consider this: The DSM didn't differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia until 1980, and did not provide a means for diagnosing autism until 1987-the year before the movie. By placing that history front and center, by placing it's kairotic movie in the foreground rather than trying to make this a more universal and timeless story, the film not only was able to speak to its moment and catapult to the highest grossing movie of the year, but is more of a classic now because it weirdly feels less dated, existing fully in its moment in a way that we can still relate to.",

I've heard it said that Tom Cruise might have actually done the better acting in this movie, and I could buy that. He goes on a serious emotional journey that leads to character growth, but you can feel him making that transition slowly so that it is convincing. Dustin Hoffman becomes Raymond and he did create an extremely memorable character. It might be a bit over-the-top, but I don't know how someone with severe autism would really act to make a comparison.\n\nRain Man tugs at my heartstrings every time I see it, and usually brings me to tears. The bond between these brothers is so genuine and sweet that it becomes a feel good story despite many moments that aren't all that pleasant. I think there are some flaws in the story, and I could do without the lame car selling that was used as a framework for the film. However, most of the little flaws disappear for me when Raymond first steps onto the screen and we see the clash between him and his cocky younger brother. Rain Man is an excellent film that everyone should check out, if for nothing else watch it for the two amazing acting performances at the center of it all.",

In an effort to get the 3 million dollars left to his brother, Charlie kidnaps him and they embark on a roadtrip across the USA.\n\nThis is a good movie pushed to greatness by Hoffman's spectacular performance. He provides one of the greatest performances in movie history and rightfully deserves his Oscar. Accompanying this powerhouse performance is a beautiful story. The humour was well handled and the story is very thought provoking. It's a very entertaining movie, held on its pedestal by Hoffman.\n\nBarry Morrow and Ronald Bass wrote this movie and did fantastic jobs at it. It's a funny, harrowing and thought provoking tale that really drives emotion in the audience and makes you care deeply about the characters. With no spoilers, the ending for this movie is perfect and it couldn't have been done any better. Well done Morrow and Bass.\n\nWhat can I honestly say about Hoffman that hasn't already been said before. His delivery, his mannerisms, his facial expressions - all of it is so contrived and focused and pure; it is truly one of the best performances ever given by an actor... ever. Cruise was our leading man and does a very good job as that. I really bought Charlie's arc and character development throughout the film and this is the perfect example of character redemption in a movie. He started off as a jerk but then you see his arc unfold and begin to really understand him. Props to Cruise for this but, once more, the writers, and even Hoffman's performance, deserve the credit. My main issue is Valeria Golino as Susana. Her performance wasn't anything too good and her entire character was completely pointless.\n\nIt is a technically proficient movie and I have no real gripes as to the way it was shot, edited or lit.\n\nThis movie is funny yet also sad. It is dramatic yet also melodramatic. The characters are lovable yet also loathsome. It's truly an example of what genius writing, a layered performance and fantastic direction can do. I heavily recommend you check this film out; it is definitely worth your time and I'll rate it 9 Tooth Picks out of 10.",

Besides the acting the story has a feel good kind of storyline, about a yuppie finding out that he has an autistic brother that he never knew about.  The two become closer through the film, but by the end it feels like everything will go back to normal, Hoffman is taken back to his home and Cruise is back on his feet enough to continue in his sleazy car saleman way.  Not trying to knock Rain Man at all, but I expect more from the rest of the cast except Hoffman.",

            "content": "Autism is a disorder that can be typified by impaired social interaction, verbal communication and repetitive behaviour, whilst it can also affect the way the brain processes information causing autism sufferers to be notably good with calculation. In fact, autism is a very unique disorder that is not simply irrepressibly negative. Most people think autism sufferers are amazing with numbers yet weird social beings and that is often the case, but it is far more intricate than that and perhaps the only film to memorably capture this disorder is the 1988 classic that is Rain Man. Starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman, the film centres on its two leads, one a young businessman and the other a middle-aged autism sufferer, who end up going on a road trip after Cruise breaks Hoffman out of his mental institution so he can embezzle the money his dead father left him. Little does Cruise know that Hoffman is his long-lost brother and that this road trip is far from being about money, instead by the end it loses its initial purpose and turn out to be a film about the bonding of brothers. Made 26 years ago, Rain Manâ??s cultural impact has been enormous, ranging from its popularising of misconceptions regarding autism and card counting and its escalator-scene replication in The Hangover, but despite this, today many people would not have seen Rain Man or appreciated it enough to understand that the film is so influential towards many things in society.\n \nDustin Hoffman, the star of so many Hollywood classics including Kramer vs. Kramer and Tootsie, portrays Raymond Babbitt, AKA â??Rain Man.â?? First of all, let me just say how perfect Hoffman is for the role as his miniature build and sentimental face give him a head-start on his character because he merges so well with him. Raymond has autism which means he has to adhere to strict rules, has minimal emotional expression and yet has superb mental recollection. Raymond is possibly one of the very few characters ever created that can truly get under your skin and make you feel his character and everything he unfortunately embodies; as seen in the gut-wrenching scenes he lets himself go and shrieks with almost lifelike despair. This is partly down to the genius of the screenplay that has created the most realistic, all-consuming character of the last 30 years, but also down to Hoffman, who is the mastermind that makes this genius fiction come to fruition. Hoffman was already into his fifties at the time of this performance but he manages to remove every single pre-ordained perspective you have of him and truly become the soul of Raymond. Thus, the film becomes all the more affecting because it is as if we are watching a few weeks in the life of someone as mentally powerful yet disturbed as Babbitt is.\n \nTom Cruise portrays Charlie Babbitt, and to be honest he needs no introductionâ?¦ itâ??s Tom Cruise for goodness sake! He stars as the young, urban professional who is in the middle of importing Lamborghinis for re-sale. He, unlike Raymond, is an arrogant, self-assured and greedy young man who only travels to his estranged fatherâ??s estate when he dies to secure his share of money. As soon as he finds out the bulk of his fatherâ??s money is going to an unnamed trustee, or better yet as soon as he even lays eyes on Hoffmanâ??s bumbling character he goes berserk at being cheated out of it by someone lesser than him. Cruise is an under-appreciated actor in this film, and this is because Hoffman steals the spotlight from him pretty much whenever he is on screen. But Cruise mustnâ??t be forgotten because his character must respond convincingly to everything bizarre Hoffman does and he manages to develop a beautifully layered character who transforms right before our eyes. Cruise in 1988 was only a 26-year old creating his present legacy in Hollywood, but out of all the 35 films he has starred in, Rain Man is by far his best film even if he is overshadowed by Hoffman.\n \nThe stunning screenplay of Barry Morrow is the glue that allows the protagonists to thrive and truly heighten the brotherly theme of Rain Man. The Babbitt brothers were never meant to see each other but out of death, an unlikely brotherhood was developed. They donâ??t know each other and therefore have to bond, or to put it better Cruise hopelessly forces Hoffman to bond for the sake of his money, not understanding Hoffmanâ??s mental toils. It is a difficult relationship considering Hoffmanâ??s autism is highly dictatorial of everything they must do. So many plot lines are dedicated to nourishing this overlying brotherly theme that seems to be the most important aspect of Rain Man. For instance, because Raymond is afraid of flying based on his calculations of which airline has the most fatal crashes, he instead makes Charlie take him on a car journey back to Los Angeles. There is a lovely moment when Charlie finds out he actually remembers Raymond from his childhood as the older brother-turned-imaginary friend he referred to as â??Rain Manâ?? as his father sent him to a mental institution, and thus feels the need to look after him. Despite the film revolving around helping Raymond, it in fact is Charlie who is the one that actually transforms the most thanks to Raymondâ??s attitude. It is a heart-warming ending to their relationship, although it may not change anything regarding their positions in life, both characters by the end of the film feel as if they have been through something and come out the other end stronger.\n \nRain Man unfortunately can get overly emotional by withholding a weighty atmosphere for long periods, which essentially drowns you in gloom. You never lose interest but you are not entertained for the whole film because this is not entertainment; it is realism. You feel the atmosphere as being empty, which in a way adds to the superimposing brotherly theme but this emptiness adds too much focus to the protagonists, which can attach you perhaps a little too greatly. At times Rain Man is an extremely stressful film. You may think Hoffmanâ??s performance is amazing at capturing the characterâ??s problems and it bloody hell is, but the stress you feel in Cruiseâ??s character is too much to handle (like the truth!). You can literally feel Cruiseâ??s impatience but the inadvertent Hoffman holds him back. When the relationship begins to work you feel a happy sensation inside of you, as you comprehend this film as if it was a real story because it is so amazingly acted. Winning Oscars including Best Picture, Original Screenplay, Director and Actor, Rain Man will leave you feeling as if you have experienced a remarkable film that actually has a purpose not just as entertainment, but also as a mass-mobilisation perspective changer device.\n \nGlued together by a stunning script, Rain Man features one triumphant impressive performance by Dustin Hoffman and one extremely under-praised enactment by Tom Cruise.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        8/10",

A movie that has fantastic performances that are Oscar winning. A movie that is timeless and will stick with you after seeing it years after. Of course I'm talking about \"Rain Man\". Now \"Rain Man\" isn't a perfect film. I'm not trying to make it more what it is. I truly enjoyed experiencing this film. But besides having a good time watching the film I cannot get past the negatives. Like the pacing for me was a little off. For example, characters go this area but now they have to do this. Boom now go to another area and oh no this happens. Bang now oh this is happening and now we have to do this...really? The movie is in a way scattered and all over the place. That being said there is some forced drama in some scenes. And I would like the movie to be cut down about ten minutes because it felt too long. Besides those complaints this movie is really good. With career boosting performances. Great cinematography. Above Average Dialogue. Emotional tones that git hard in most scenes. Great use of character development. Original plot that leads into a great backstory. And the realism of this movie...Wow! I felt like I was watching real people's lives but in movie format. No sugar coating mushy mushy and I like that. Overall, \"Rain Man\" is an excellent experience to witness. With astonishing film making and story telling \"Rain Man\" can have potential to be an underrated classic. Then excluding all the good you have to bad in there to witness throughout. Which may be in your hands how much you'll like the film. I will give \"Rain Man\" an A-!",

            "content": "This approach is the way to go when you want to reach people.  So this is about a man who flips cars for a living (Tom Cruise).  He didn't have the best relationship with his father, so when he finds out that he has passed, he isn't too surprised to find that he got cut out of his will.  What he is surprised to learn is that he has a long lost brother who has inherited the entirety of the estate (Dustin Hoffman), and to add insult to injury, he has no concept of money, given that he is autistic and in a mental hospital.  My wife any I decide to keep the \"theme concept\" going on our quest through the list of the 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, with this month's theme being blind spots.  I picked one big movie she hadn't seen, she picked one that I hadn't seen, and we both settled on one of the most renown movies that neither of us have seen, with the latter being the Academy Award winning Rain Man.  All of the acting here is first-rate.  Even though he gets a very small amount of credit do to an understandable overshadowing, Tom Cruise shows off just how talented he is here.  In a very short amount of time, you quickly get to know this man: you can tell that this man is a closer, and he wouldn't be out of place in the Glengarry Glen Ross universe.  He is a flawed human being, and he does a really good job of being the avatar for the audience.  Having somebody to relate to is important here, because there are lots of people out there that aren't aware of the effects of autism, or have any basic understanding of disorder; there's a small town nurse featured here who mistakenly thinks that Dustin Hoffman is \"artistic\".  While I do consider myself very familiar with the disorder (I have a nephew who has it), I do realize that there are people out there who just don't know any better, especially back in 1988.  Speaking as somebody who is familiar with the condition, I have to say that Dustin Hoffman absolutely nails it.  He has all of the ticks down, and he never at any point breaks or pushes it to the point of it being over-the-top.  This performance gave him one of his two Oscar wins, and it is absolutely well-deserved.  It's a delicate subject matter, and because it hits the sweet spot middle ground without ever tip-toeing around the issue or beating you over the head with it, the end result is success exactly as it was intended.  Rain Man ultimately promotes learning and understanding, and because of that, it is an insightful and important film.",

The pairing of the sleazy car-salesmen and his incredibly profound autistic brother provides an interesting, almost hilarious companionship. Charlie's waining patience with Raymond is very funny, considering how little people actually understand the eccentricities of autism. But the more we find out about Raymond, the more we feel for him, and the more we want Charlie to fall for him. Without a doubt, this is Dustin Hoffman's best performance. This is is a feat of brilliant method acting, that only comes once in a lifetime for an actor of such electrifying theatrics. It looks like it was a risk to his mental stability, but who wouldn't accept the role of Raymond, and completely disappear in this character? I think Raymond is one of film's most groundbreaking characters, and he brought to the forefront, a syndrome that even to this day, few people understand, or even care to understand.

However, while on the trip the two brothers make a special bond. \n\nThe most incredible thing about this film is definitely the performances. With Tom Cruise its hit or miss. In this he actually does a great job. But let's be honest, the real stand out is Dustin Hoffman. Winning himself an Oscar for best actor, Hoffman delivers a heartbreaking and convincing performance. He really did a fantastic job at playing this character. Before hand he met with many autistic people to prepare for the film, and it really shows. \n\nThis is a very good film, but it's not without its faults. It's a little bit too long. There was a point in the film where things got a little slow, but the phenomenal performances pilled me back in during these moments. I feel like giving this a complete 5/5 but the slow down was just a bit too noticeable. However, this is not a large criticism, I loved this film. \n\n\"Rain Man'' is a wonderful story between two brothers. It's got clever dialogue, it's funny, heartwarming, and very well directed. The acting from Hoffman is flawless, and Tom Cruise does a solid job along side him. While it gets a little slow half way in, it isn't too noticeable because of how invested I was in the story and it's characters.",

Tom Cruise does a terrific job of going from this pig headed impatient businessman to a well mannered and understanding friend and relative who can make connections with ease. Dustin Hoffman is irresistibly charming in a role which requires more than just acting - a requirement of complete psychological transformation, as not looking your co-star in the eye throughout the whole project will have been a fair challenge.",
