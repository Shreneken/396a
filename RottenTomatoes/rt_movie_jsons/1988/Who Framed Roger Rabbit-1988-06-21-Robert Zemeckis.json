            "content": "A gritty film noir mystery for the parents that's got cute animated characters for the kids.\n\nDirector Robert Zemeckis' live-action neo-noir mystery and animated family comedy Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) is a real creative and funny movie. Zemeckis' direction is imaginative and skillful with deft craftsmanship and a loving tribute to Looney Tunes and old Disney cartoons alike besides all the old film noir mysteries. Zemeckis brings cartoons to life and lets people become animated characters in their own right. Zemeckis is strangely the perfect director for Roger Rabbit as he plays the mystery totally seriously with intrigue and style, then allows for the cartoons to be absurd and playful for the comedy.\n\nRichard Williams' animation direction is exciting, adorable, hilarious, provocative, and highly imaginative. His animators are so skilled at recreating older animated cartoons like I grew up watching reruns of on television that it's amazing. The way the practical effects blend with hand drawn animation has never been executed more realistically before or since green screens and computer animation. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a groundbreaking milestone of hand drawn animation and crafty live-action direction for a thoroughly entertaining hodge podge of ideas. Richard Williams deserved that special Oscar Award for his animation efforts within Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nProducer Steven Spielberg oversaw the script and with directorial credits like Spielberg's, you know he paid attention to all the references to old Hollywood like Chinatown or The Maltese Falcon. Writers Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, and Gary K. Wolf imagines a world of living cartoons mingling with human adults. It's all gritty film noir detective stuff with sleazy people, swear words, and voluptuous women. I don't know how this got made, but surely adults and children will love it for generations to come. I used to dismiss this as a silly concept, but it's quite brilliant. Mashing up old film noir picture aesthetics with old Hollywood, Disney, and Warner Brothers cartoons with sheer whimsy in mind.\n\nEditor Arthur Schmidt somehow splices animated cartoon footage together with live-action footage with Bob Hoskins. It's all so slickly cut that you never question the toons living in this world. Schmidt earned that Oscar for Best Editing. He even keeps the run-time down to a brief 104 minutes. Dean Cundey's cinematography uses all sorts of shadows, angles, and hideaways to keep the tone and visual style of Roger Rabbit like it's a film noir picture.\n\nBob Hoskins is excellent as the grumpy and disillusioned detective Eddie Valiant. His alcoholism and gruff performance show off his disdain for toons like the film noir detectives of old having a hatred of criminals or women or whatever. Christopher Lloyd is both funny and terrifying as the erratic and violent Judge Doom. He's a truly unsettling villain in all his slow movements and hysterical behavior. Joanna Cassidy is very charming, funny, and likable as Valiant's girlfriend Dolores.\n\nCharles Fleischer is insane as the chaotic cartoon bunny named Roger Rabbit. He's got a fun rapport with Bob Hoskins that works wonders for their unlikely buddy cop dynamic. Fleischer goes all in on being obnoxious as Roger to the point where it circles back to being actually endearing and funny. Kathleen Turner pulls off the breathless whispery voice for Jessica Rabbit's sultry speaking voice, while Amy Irving delivers an enchanting and soft singing performance as Jessica Rabbit's vocals. Lou Hirsch is rough and brutish as Baby Herman.\n\nI loved hearing Mel Blanc voice Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Bird, and Sylvester the Cat. Joe Alaskey is great as a frustrated Yosemite Sam. Wayne Allwine's Mickey Mouse voice is adorably squeaky. Tony Anselmo and Clarence Nash are both wonderful as a sputtering Donald Duck. Mae Questel sounds cute as Betty Boop in a sweet tribute to her character and era of cartoons. I liked seeing the Fantasia characters too from the brooms to the hippo.\n\nProduction designers Elliot Scott and Roger Cain create shady bar and nightclub sets for that sleazy atmosphere. Art direction from Stephen Scott and William McAllister creates stark city streets and cute plush looking animated cityscapes for Toon Town. Set decorators Roy Barnes, Robert R. Benton, Peter Howitt, and Lynn Christopher adorn every studio office, bar, and apartment with lavish cartoon movie posters and old Hollywood glamour.\n\nComposer Alan Silvestri really nailed the 1940's style jazz music throughout Roger Rabbit. I like how old timey and charming his musical score sounds for the cartoon segments. Silvestri's score is as vibrant as the colors are lush. Joanna Johnston and Linda Henrikson's costumes look cool with that trenchcoat and pinstripe suit look on all the guys. Of course, Jessica Rabbit's sparkling red dress is dazzling to look at as it is fitted to Jessica's absurd curves. Peter Robb-King makes all the men look more cartoony and grisly, while Dolores looks lovely in her old fashioned diner and bar dresses.\n\nIn short, there's tons of humor and charm herein Who Framed Roger Rabbit with some darker themes and scary sequences for thrills of all kinds. There's really no other film like it as Space Jam does not even look this great anymore.",

This is the perfect blend between comedy, action & Noir and one of the most technically ambitious films I've ever seen. Also one of the most memorable villains i have ever seen as well. The most incredible scenes are the ones where the toons/real people interact with objects from the others world. This is something to this day you barely see in CGI live action movies, only having the characters talk and look at each other and never actually interacting with each other. Also many will give a behind the head  shot to hide the fact the actor is looking through the character. That is never done once here and it is phenomenal.

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is one of the best movies ever made. I'm not exaggerating. Spectacular as a comedy (absolutely all the jokes work) and solid as an investigation movie, the film is led by one of the best pairings in cinema's history: Eddie Valiant, made by Bob Hoskins, a private investigator who hates cartoons; and Roger Rabbit, voiced by Charles Fleischer, a toon bunny who is the perfect junction of almost every main character of a protagonist from a cartoon made in the 1940s. I love Roger Rabbit, seriously; for me, he's easily in the top 5 best protagonists. The film satirises everything and everyone, it has elements of a noir film, jokes with Disney, Warner and even MGM, and especially (and essentially), the essence of cartoons. Jessica Rabbit is a fantastic example of a Femme Fatale (possibly the most famous noir archetype): seductive, mysterious and intelligent, and voiced \"sexily\" by Kathleen Turner. She steals her scenes and not because of her physical lines. And Christopher Lloyd, who is unrecognisable, is the perfect villain for this type of approach, but I can't say anything more without spoilers. His goons, the weasels, make only one joke, that works every time. In my review of \"Passing\" (2021), I said that movie was the period film that seemed to have been made at the time it takes place. Well, \"Roger Rabbit\" is at least at the same level. We already have coloured films at the end of the 40s (the film takes place in 1947, and \"The Wizard of Oz\", for example, is from 1939), and the interaction between humans and cartoons (who also look like cartoons made in the 40s) have also been made on that time (The Three Caballeros in 1944 and Song of the South in 1946, both from Disney). The film has deservedly won three technical categories at the Academy Awards (Sound Editing, Visual Effects and Film Editing), but I really think its biggest triumph is that it never loses its comic tone at the same time it never takes away the credibility of the investigation plot, merit shared between the director (Robert Zemeckis) and the screenwriters (Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman).",

It seems firmly aimed at those of us who grew up on Looney Tunes and Disney (which is me, luckily), but I'm pretty sure a cartoon novice could still find a lot to enjoy here.\n\nI spent most of the film in awe of how well the cartoons interact with the live actors. It's legitimately impressive how much chemistry a noir detective can have with a cartoon rabbit, but they've really pulled it off. The cartoon props feel exactly as out of place as they're supposed to, but not in a jarring way. However (and this is a minor complaint), near the end of the film I noticed several instances where it seemed like the animators might have forgotten to overlay the cartoon version of the props on top of the real ones? Eddie makes a point of having a cartoon gun in one scene, and then in the next scene it's just a regular, if kind of clunky-looking, gun. It's a bit of a shame because it took me out of what was otherwise a clever and engaging film.\n\nThere are some surprisingly deep themes here and they mesh well with the light-heartedness of the cartoon cameos. The script is satirical and goofy in just the right way. All of the voice actors are great and Christopher Lloyd steals every scene he's in with his comically evil Judge Doom.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit is just a really fun, unique movie that everyone will enjoy.",

            "content": "Based on the 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? by Gary K. Wolf, this movie is from a time before crossovers and meta-based films like the latest Space Jam and Ready: Player One. It was incredibly mindblowing as a teen to watch this movie on the big screen and see Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse actually having a conversation.\n\nWhat's even better is that it has a film noir mystery at its center with Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant*, a down on his luck private investigator dealing with his hate of animated characters known as Toons which actually exist in this alternate universe.\n\nAt the time, this was the most expensive animated film ever made, but Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg believed that live-action and animation together would save the cartoon department at Disney.\n\nPlus, the studio brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg and his production company, Amblin Entertainment, who would get creative control and most of the box office, leaving Disney to keep merchandising rights.\n\nSpielberg went to work getting other studios to lend their characters to the film, getting most of the Warner Brothers characters to appear but sadly failing to get Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Casper the Friendly Ghost or any of the Terrytoons.\n\nWith live action directed by Robert Zemeckis and animation by Richard Williams — along with the skills of Dean Cundy as cinematographer, Arthur Schmidt as editor and hundreds of artists making all the animation** — this film stands out as nearly the final chapter on traditional animation***.\n\nEisner and Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of The Walt Disney Company, felt the film was too sexual, but Zemeckis had final cut privileges (and Williams disliked Disney so much that he based his animation studio in England so they could not interfere). That's why this was a Touchstone Pictures release instead of Disney.\n\nEven today, Zemeckis claims that Disney will never make any of the proposed sequels, telling Den of Geek, \"The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all.\" He also claimed that a sequel**** wouldn't be on Disney+ as there are no princesses in it. There were, however, some animated shorts that came out after the film: Tummy Trouble proceeded Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit played before Dick Tracy and Trail Mix-Up was in front of A Far Off Place.\n\nInstead of a detailed summary of the plot of this film, I suggest you view it for yourself. However, I will share that I absolutely love Joanna Cassidy as Eddie's strong and capable love Dolores and Christopher Lloyd is beyond outstanding as Judge Doom. And I think it's amazing that early versions of the script had The Toon Patrol weasels as Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho, created to be inversions of Snow White's Seven Dwarves Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey).\n\nCharles Fleischer was so dedicated to his role as Roger that he dressed up on set and did his lines. And man, has any voice ever been better for a cartoon noir girl than Kathleen Turner (and Amy Irving for the singing voice)? And any movie where a cartoon baby gruffly says, \"I got a thirty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinky…\"\n\nOne last fact: When Eddie takes Roger Rabbit into the back room at the bar and Dolores is sawing their handcuffs, the lamp on the ceiling bumps and swings. That's all animation that was added to give the scene something extra. All of those shadows were drawn. That's why the phrase \"bump the lamp\" is used at Disney even today when people say they need to go the extra mile to make something special, even if no one notices it.\n\n*Test footage has Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, Paul Reubens as Roger Rabbit and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. Other actors who were almost Eddie include Harrison Ford, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Ed Harris, Charles Grodin, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Wallace Shawn and Don Lane.\n\n**Post-production lasted 14 months and all of the animation was made with cel art and optical tricks instead of CGI.\n\n***It's also the last time Mel Blanc would voice Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Bird, and Sylvester the Cat.\n\n****You have no idea how badly I want to see Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon, a movie where Roger would have entered World War II and met his real father, Bugs Bunny.",

I didn't even know he was british till I was older and saw him in \"The Long Good Friday\" which I also reccomend to my fellow Hoskins fans out there, but turns out he was a British Bear!

I could've watched all these BRILLIANTLY animated characters do aimless stuff for 3 hours, never mind watching a decently structured movie for an hour and fourty minutes.\n\nThe screenplay by Jeffery Price, Peter S. Seaman & Gary K. Wolf was appealing to all ages. Though this movie was super silly, and over the top, it had somewhat of a structure due to the witty, yet humorous script.\n\nFor a 1988 movie, this film was so colorful, and visually beautiful! The cinematography, animations, & effects won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects & Best Film Editing. The art directors did a fantastic job of blending the animated characters, to the real people, with the addition of the silly props.\n\nOverall, if you love the Looney Tunes & Disney characters, this movie is right up your alley, and a must watch!",

            "content": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a lighthearted semi-animated family film. What it lacks in story development, it compensates for with its upbeat energy and colorful--at the time, groundbreaking--animation, forming a better than average, entertaining watch. Set in the late 1940s, Who Framed Roger Rabbit takes place in a universe where cartoon characters live in the live action world, residing in Toon Town. Detective Eddie Valiant, a human character played by Bob Hoskins, searches for clues behind the murder of Toon Town’s owner, Marvin Acme. Because his wife is photographed playing pattycake with Acme (which in the film is considered an affair), Roger Rabbit is the main suspect. Knowing Roger is innocent and that Judge Doom, the obvious villain, is up to no good, an adventure pursues to save Roger and the entire toon race. The film, while enjoyable, is not without its flaws though. The tone and genre of the film is still a mystery to me. Jokes that suggest pattycake is sex make the film seem like a pure kids film with lots of innuendos. But the violence and language used at other times makes it seem more like an satire for adults. Despite its PG rating, Valiant literally says “son of a bitch” at one point. In that, it’s a little confusing who the intended target audience was. On a separate note, the story was very predictable. Things are set up without any subtlety and it sort of takes the fun out it every now and then. For example, at the beginning of the movie, it is very clear that Valiant hates toons. His backstory and reasoning behind this could have made his character more unpredictable. But within the first 10 minutes of screentime, a side character explains that his brother was killed by a toon only for another scene 10 minutes later to tell us the same thing only for yet another scene 40 minutes later to say the same thing yet again. If the first two instances, or at least the first, were taken out, his character arc would be a little more interesting. Also, his prejudice against toons would have been much more effective if they were shown, once again, in more subtle ways like when he gets defensive about associating himself with them. But instead, he spends the first half of the movie making forced, snarky remarks about toons to himself. As a result, watching his transformation is just more boring and unbelievable. There is honestly almost nothing that shows Valiant and Roger actually bonding. And there is genuinely no motivation or lead up for him quitting alcohol. He just looks at his bottle toward the end and without any influences from others in the entire duration of the film, decides to pour it all out. Again, if this really is a kids film, perhaps I’m being a little too critical. Regardless, I am disappointed with the film considering how much praise it got. Nonetheless, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is harmless. The summation of it’s flaws is not what it did, but what it could have easily done better. But for most audiences, the film will be an easy-to-please, feel good experience.",

Hard to choose from between Christopher Lloyd going against type and playing a ghoul, Jessica Rabbit's uncomfortably sexy moments that made you second guess what the hell you were watching, and just the nostalgic novelty of watching \"retired\" cartoon characters update you on the continuing saga of their lives.  It's hard to find a movie that's both a sentimental favorite, as a proverbial child looking forward to Saturday morning cartoons, as well as a movie that's nuanced enough for adults.

Here comes Benny the Cab, we're racing through ToonTown -- along the way is Mickey, Goofy, Donald, Daffy, Bugs, Pepe, Yosemite, Dwarves, Dumbo, Broomsticks, and so many more.  For the first time ever, we're seeing Disney and Warner Brothers characters in the same film, and oh my what a funtastic treat more delectable than a bowl of colorful sweet candy.  Also, though not the first time, we are seeing the most sophisticated blend of live action and cell animation, the likes of which Gene Kelly and Jerry, or Pete's Dragon couldn't dream of.  \r\n\r\nThe film happens to be about a conflict between toons and humans, a slight allegory to racial tensions amongst people.  A toon, legendary film actor Roger Rabbit, is accused of killing a person -  that's about as sensitive as a black man killing a white woman.  Private Investigator Eddie Valiant is tasked with the job of finding out whether or not any of it is true.  A conspiracy against Rabbit begins to unveil that has us suspecting several players, including his wife Jessica, and the man who tasked Valiant to begin with.  But it's clear there's one man in town who hates toons above all else, Christopher Lloyd's phony toothed, wild eyed Judge Doom.\r\n\r\nThe film maintains consistent whimsicality, even with darker story points, like Eddie's dead brother killed by a falling piano!  Jokes about extramarital affairs are treated not with sex, but a game of Patty Cake, which has Roger bawling in despair.  Yet there's no shortage of sexuality either; Jessica Rabbit is the ultimate cartoon sex symbol.  One memory that stuck out in the long span between viewings was the violent third act in which Doom gets flattened by a cement roller, only to reveal he can outlandishly pump himself back up - then we see those crazy googly eyes, and we learn he's been a toon all along, the \"I hate my own kind\" villain.  Again, everything is done with a slapstick sense of humor so that violence amongst humans looks similar to a cartoon.\r\n\r\nAlong the way we're treated to delightful cross-promotional pairings, such as Daffy and Donald Duck on the dueling pianos, or Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny sky diving beside free-falling Valiant.  Most of the famous voice actors are reprising their roles, including the legendary Mel Blanc (Daffy, Tweety, Bugs, Sylvester, Porky), credited with 1,142 works, just one year before his death.  Nobody is dancing around the rights here, we feel the total authenticity of these characters, thanks in part to Steven Spielberg's solid communication with Warner.  It's as special as seeing any great ensemble cast, which is pretty incredible when you think that only our imagination makes them real.  The end ensemble of the cartoon universe is very special for any enthusiast.  To some it will just be a bunch of drawn up nonsense, to others it's a symbol of unity and breaking the borders of ownership.",

And lately he recreated New York city his 3D feature \"The Walk\".\nThis movie had some good ideas and interaction between its characters but the framework in which everything occurs is simply inappropriate. It should be a family-friendly movie as it contained animation and would be viewed by younger audience no matter what the rating was but the story contained implication of sex, consuming alcohol and smoking cigarettes. Not to mention the detective/ murder story line in which it was wrapped with. Jessica was a character created to diminish females and sexualize their bodies. Not even suitable to be viewed by adults for instance.

Every time I watch this movie I marvel at how well they blend the cartoon animation with the live action. Yes, you can see the disconnect between the two if you're analyzing it closely, but the movie is so entertaining you kind of forget. Also the cast of actors are so good that you genuinely feel there's someone there when they are really just talking with thin air. Then there's the story which feels like it was plucked straight out of a classic film noir. There's a private detective who takes a case that results in murder, he suspects a femme fatale, and has to piece together the clues before his client gets murdered as well. Honestly, if you take away the living cartoons you could almost see Humphrey Bogart starring in this thing. Speaking of which, Bob Hoskins is delightful in the lead role. I think he does a good job of displaying anger and frustration with his life, and his interactions with Roger are great. I love Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom also, but I kind of wish his performance was a little more subtle because he is so obviously evil from his very first moment on screen that you kind of feel like he's up to something from the beginning. Luckily there are still surprises that get revealed in the end so it never mattered all that much to me. I think the only real problem I ever had with this movie is that the cartoons give the illusion that this might be a kids movie, so I saw it when it first came out and I was still a bit young for that. Between the adult themes that permeate most of the film, and the scary ending I was terrified. But for adults I think Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a winner that still holds up well today.",

It takes place in the 1940s and does an amazing job of imagining a world where real people and cartoons live side by side.  It's even more impressive considering how much work was put into a film like this that came before computer animation.  It's strange to think there probably won't be a film like this ever again.  \nThere are cameos galore of numerous old school cartoons.  I didn't realize this was the one and only time Disney and WB characters have appeared together on screen.  Bob Hoskins's character is a good point of view character for the average viewer.  He's a little cynical of the cartoon characters (and they clearly can be grating at times, especially Roger Rabbit himself), but he comes to accept and care for them as the story progresses.  I don't think the film is for everyone, but if you're a lover of old school films and cartoons, I think you'll find something to love here.",

I thought the Roger Rabbit character was irritating, I couldn't stand him at times. And the whole \"cartoon\" aspect was hammered down, just like Almost Famous. I know this film was made for a younger audience, but it could have been more twists and turns to make the movie stand out from every other buddy-cop film on Earth.\n\nDespite the flaws, this movie isn't awful, it just wasn't that good. And it does have bright moments, even from Roger occasionally. Most of the live-action actors did a good job, like Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd. And the blending of 2-D animation and live-action is glorious, and like I said, a vital piece of both film and animation history.\n\nI said it once, I'll say it again, Cool World is the better flick.",

Disney and Looney Toon fans rejoice, as this is what I would consider a one hit wonder that happens to also include Spielberg in the making. The drawn out characters in real life settings were expertly done especially with the lighting and the shadowing. When it comes to putting animated characters in a real life world and vise versa in an interesting and engaging story, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a gold mine of that type of genre such that it exists. I'm actually quite surprised that there isn't really any other movie like this one aside from Space Jam.

The man behind such acclaimed films such as \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"Flight,\" really has outdone himself with this instant classic of a movie. Bob Hoskins is great in his most memorable role as private eye Eddie Valiant. There are moments I thought because of his performance that I wondered if they ever offered the role of Eddie Valiant to Robert DeNiro because I think he would of been incredible in the role, but I guess because of the money they probably used for the animation, they probably couldn't afford  him being the very demand able and talented actor DeNiro is, but either way, Hoskins does a very fine job in the movie. But for me the real draw is Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom who I think should have been nominated for best supporting actor for his performance because it takes a real intense and authentic type actor like Lloyd to pull off such a terrifying and yet intense performance. But of course we all know that Roger Rabbit is really the star of this movie as he is the one who really brings in the laughs for this movie and whether your a comedy guy or not, you gotta admit...this is one damn entertaining movie.",

The scene where she pinches the guys cheeks. I mean, they look like cartoons and CGI does look significantly more real and detailed, but I'm talking about the contact between the Toons and the physical world. Amazing. I'm not a big fan of the story, though. I give this four stars because of the illusion of actual contact. And because the animated short film at the beginning is without a doubt the funniest cartoon I've ever seen. I think it's called \"Tummy Trouble.\"",

            "content": "As a kid, I didn't watch cartoons that much. Oh sure, I watched a bunch of disney movies, and I watched my fair share of tom and jerry, but I never actually watched Disney animated shows or even Warner Bros. Maybe it's because I read books a lot of times, but I'm not sure. However, you don't need to watch a lot of cartoons to fall in love with this movie. The story is great, but the actual mystery isn't that mysterious. I mean, take one glance on the poster and guess who the villain is. The writing however is fantastic, giving these characters tons of personality and having some real funny jokes for both adults and kids. You know the writing's good when they can make you laugh at how a character died. But it does have some swearing and sexual innuendos, so beware. As you may have already known, this movie is praised for its technological achievements, and yeah, it's really great. The animated characters aren't just standing there, they touch, grab, slap, and even kiss human characters and objects. I remember there's a scene of Jessica Rabbit peeking out of a window, and it's so impressive, especially at that time. The characters are wonderful. Even though cliches, they still have some personality and depth to mix them up. I found that even though Roger Rabbit had an annoying voice I still rooted him on because I found him to be pretty awesome. I mean think about it, he's a rights activist who still wants to make people happy and is a great husband. The acting is great, and you have to be a great actor to take all of this seriously. But they do. They punch, kiss, touch and choke the animated characters as much as they talk with them. The voice actors of the toons aren't bad either, giving the characters depth just by talking. But I think the real strength of this film is that it shows all of these animated characters we love are in the same universe. Donald Duck and Daffy have a piano battle, Droopy and Goofy could have an conversation(which they don't, sadly), and most obscure of all, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are parachuting together. Doesn't that sound like a weird but amazing fanfiction? Well that could happen in this world, and it's a world many kids wished for, including me. And it doesn't show recent cartoons, they show cartoons from the beginning of cartoons, like Felix the cat and Betty Boop, and so adults can get nostalgic as well. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a wonderful love letter to our childhood, but it isn't just nostalgia that makes it grand. Add in a great plot, characters, and innovative animation, and you'll get one of the greatest movies of all time.",
