ET was just big because of the actors in it. Mac and Me had action, and had a handicapped person with in that action. in todays world that is beyond a + and no one see's that yet will complain about it regardless. in 1988 which one of you 1 star people thought about coke and or McDonalds? I surely didn't even notice it at 8 years old. I liked the movie then and i like it now good enough to show my children.",
