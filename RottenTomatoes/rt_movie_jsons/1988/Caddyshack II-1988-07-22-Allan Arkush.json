    "summary": "Jack Hartounian (Jackie Mason), a boorish but good-hearted real estate tycoon, applies for membership at a snooty country club, but is blackballed by the old-money WASPs, led by Chandler Young (Robert Stack). As revenge, he simply buys the club outright and turns it into a garish amusement park. Chandler wants to win the property back by challenging Jack to a golf match, but he hedges his bets by hiring deranged mercenary Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) to eliminate his competition.",

Bad movies come in different flavors; some are bad because the film makers were inept, some are bad but good because the film makers were completely clueless but sincere. Some can be entertaining as something to mock. Some are amusing by the sheer \"brilliance\" of the movie makers utter failure. Some are bad because they're ill conceived, poorly paced and ultimately boring. This isn't one of those. This is an insult to film. This is a bald faced cash grab with no vision, no originality and no entertainment value. There's nothing funny about it. There's nothing even amusing about it. If it were shown to prisoners it would be considered cruel and unusual punishment. It's actually painful to watch, painful in how every bad joke falls flat, painful in the waste of talent and painful that some studio exec had so little regard for their fellow human beings they would release this thinking people would like it. This is the stupidest movie ever greenlit by greedy execs. It's so bad I can't mock it. It's so bad I can't watch it because it makes me angry. It's absolutely horrible.",

The witty, well scripted, and well played comedy of the classic does not exist in this knock off.  It is horrible.   The talents of otherwise talent people are wasted, or even ruined.  Even Chevy Chase, who shines in the original is not funny at all in this one.  Jackie Mason sitting in as a Rodney Dangerfield type and Robert Stack playing the Ted Knightesq. character are simply not good.   The attempt to reveal issues of class warfare fail to reach the levels of the first.   The attempts to elevate the Gopher from a tool to showcase Bill Murray's talents to a primary character is infantile.  Dan Akroyd's attempt to be Bull Murray is painful to watch. What is good about this one?  Ok. Here is something positive.  Dyan Cannon is always delightful to watch.   A young Jonathan Silverman as the Danny Noonan type is watchable.  Jessica Lundy is very appealing as Mason's daughter.  Marsha Warfield has a few laughs.  Skip this one.",

            "content": "It took eight years for a sequel to\u00a0Caddyshack to get made, perhaps the greatest \"hijinks ensue\" movie ever made. I say that phrase because it's such a simple concept: a quick statement like \"A day in the life of a golf course...and hijinks ensue.\"\n\nThe beauty of the original film is that despite the out there characters like Chevy Chase's Ty Webb and Rodney Dangerfield's Al Czervik, the story is really about the struggles of Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a working-class kid forced to follow the whims of the incredibly rich in the hopes that he can work toward a better life. It also comes from actual life, as writer Brian Doyle-Murray, his\u00a0brothers Bill and John, too -- was a caddie at Indian Hill Club in Winnetka, Illinois. His brothers Bill and John Murray, and director Harold Ramis had all been in Danny's caddy shoes at one point. Most of the people in the movie were all based on actual members of the clubs that they had worked at.\n\nRamis told the A.V. Club that he went in with the right intentions: \"They said, \"Hey, we've got a great idea: The Shack is Back! And I said, \"No, I don't think so.\" But they said that Rodney really wanted to do it, and we could build it around Rodney. Rodney said, \"Come on, do it.\" Then the classic argument came up which says that if you don't do it, someone will, and it will be really bad. So I worked on a script with my partner Peter Torokvei, consulting with Rodney all the time. Then Rodney got into a fight with the studio and backed out. We had some success with Back to School, which I produced and wrote, and we were working with the same director, Alan Metter. When Rodney pulled out, I pulled out, and then they fired Alan and got someone else. I got a call from [co-producer] Jon Peters saying, \"Come with us to New York; we're going to see Jackie Mason!\" I said, \"Ooh, don't do this. Why don't we let it die?\" And he said, \"No, it'll be great.\" But I didn't go, and they got other writers to finish it. I tried to take my name off that one, but they said if I took my name off, it would come out in the trades and I would hurt the film.\"\n\nThis moment of wondering why this movie is being made and feeling is that it's the wrong idea? That will come up throughout the discussion of this movie.\n\nSo instead of Rodney, we get Jackie Mason. Sure, they're both older Jewish comedians who married much younger women late in their lives, but that's about all they have in common. Rodney's character was an everyman who seemed to be using the audience as his therapist, bemoaning the way he was treated with lines like \"I know I'm ugly. I said to a bartender, \"Make me a zombie.' He told me that God beat him to it.\" To me, Mason always felt like he was lecturing the audience, somewhat above it*.\n\nDan Aykroyd is one of my favorite actors, but he's basically coming on to be Bill Murray. And while Jonathan Silverman and Michael O'Keefe are somewhat interchangeable, there's a large divide between Robert Stack and Ted Knight. And that's no slight to any of these actors, but when you're placed in the same exact role as a movie that is beloved, you're going to get compared. After all, Ted Knight is my favorite villain in any movie. He's perfect in his role. And while I love Robert Stack, I can only see him in heroic roles or parts that make fun of his heroic nature.\n\nI mean, I love Randy Quaid, but his role was written for Sam Kinison, who would have destroyed audiences with that part.\n\nTo be fair, Dangerfield was to be in this, but a month before production, he bailed, realizing that it wouldn't work. He kept adding to his contract, demanding final cut and royalties and getting everything he wanted, except to be released from the film. This all ended up with him facing a $10 million dollar lawsuit.\n\nBut there still needed to be a movie.\n\nAs for director Allan Arkush, he told\u00a0Sports Illustrated \"I should have never made this movie! What was I thinking?\" He told us -- in an interview we were honored to get to conduct -- \"You should never make a movie for the wrong reasons. You should only make movies about something where you know no one else can make it better than you.\"\n\nSo what's it all about, you may ask.\n\nKate Hartounian (Jessica Lundy, who was in Bright Lights, Big City and\u00a0Vampire's Kiss the same year this was released), the daughter of real estate developer and working man Jack (Mason), seeks to improve her social status by following the advice of her friend Miffy Young (Chynna Phillips) and asks her dad to join the Bushwood Country Club.\n\nOf course, seeing as how her dad builds housing that normal people can afford, he doesn't fit in with club members like Chandler Young (Stack), his wife Cynthia (Dina Merrill, Operation Petticoat) and Mr. Jamison (an always welcome Paul Bartel).\n\nSure, hijinks ensue, but it's hard to get behind the blustering Mason, who strangely attracts Diane Cannon, making this into something of a science fiction movie. The gopher can now talk (someone get Frank Welker in the booth stat!) and Chevy Chase shows up for all of five minutes, most of which consists of him being a sexist boor to scare off multiple women in a scene that may have seemed funny in 1988 but seems beyond gross in 2021 (I know, I know -- let's not place our modern values on movies from the past; I'm also the guy who brings you all sorts of aberrant Italian and Spanish gut-churning filth, right?!? But maybe I just agree with the \"medium talent\" assessment of Chase).\n\nThe hardest thing to deal with in this movie that it's made by incredibly talented people placed into a thankless struggle to make something halfway decent. I mean, Harold Ramis and PJ Torokvei (who wrote\u00a0Armed and Dangerous,\u00a0Back to School,\u00a0WKRP in Cincinnati and\u00a0Real Genius) wrote the script with rewrites by Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman, who wrote Who Framed Roger Rabbit together**.\n\nThe thing that really sticks out to me is that Caddyshack\u00a0works whether or not you play golf, but if you love the game, you can see the nuances and enjoyment of the sport within the movie. In the sequel, golf just seems to be something in the background, other than the miniature golf course finale that closes the movie.\n\nI guess you should add the phrase, \"Don't remake\u00a0Caddyshack\" to other important lessons like \"Never fight a land war in Asia\" and \"Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.\"\n\nIn our aforementioned chat with the director, this movie was summed up quite simply:\n\nB&S:\u00a0So why\u00a0Caddyshack II?\n\nALLAN:\u00a0Yes, exactly. Why\u00a0Caddyshack II? There are no more questions to be answered.\n\n*Indeed, Arkush said --after seeing Mason perform two nights in a row -- \"I started to get a very different impression of him. The thing that occurred to me was that he didn't connect with the audience in any sort of personal way. That's not necessarily a good thing for someone who's supposed to be your lead. At least when Rodney says, \"I get no respect,\" there's an empathy that he evokes from the audience.\"\n\n**To be fair, they also wrote\u00a0Wild Wild West and\u00a0How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so perhaps...",

There were a lot of fun comedic bits and it even has a good message; however, the rest of the movie kind of drags.  Not unwatchably bad, just not that great.  As a PG movie, I'd recommend this if you have a young kid around and you are looking for something to watch together.  I think this movie gets a worse rep than it deserves because it is not the same kind of movie as the original \"Caddyshack\".  The sequal is more about delivering a positive message that is geared at kids, rather than being the raunchy R rated comedy of the first one.  I give it a C, if you've already seen the best, but you insist on watching a movie, try this one out.",

Featuring Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dan Aykroyd, and Chevy Chase, the cast isn't that bad.  But the performances are terrible; Mason in particular is out of control and toxic to the film.  While screwball comedies tend to be pretty zany, Caddyshack II is overloaded with craziness; making it incredibly stupid.",

Plus, the film is essentially a retread of the first film, although with a different cast. Set at Bushwood Country Club, local Jewish businessman Jack Hartounian (Jackie Mason) and his daughter Kate (Jessica Lundy), apply for membership at the club, but Jack's reputation of building low-cost housing for poorer families doesn't go down well with the snooty members, including Bushwood President Chandler Young (Robert Stack). But, Jack gets the last laugh when he goes to Ty Young (Chevy Chase), and buys his majority share in Bushwood, and decides to open it up to general public turning it into an amusement park, much to Young's absolute disgust, so he hires Captain Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) to put a stop to it. While there are one or two laughs here, it's just the same as the original, with Chase doing little more than an extended cameo, it smack of studio compromise and cynical cash-in. They did try to get much of the original cast back, but they were all disgusted by the quality of the script, and it is all over the place.",

            "content": "Before seeing Caddyshack II I had never seen Caddyshack, and considering how many Golden Raspberry Awards Caddyshack II was nominated for it would clearly have to be poor material. But I figured watching it before Caddyshackwould make it of slightly lesser poor quality.\n\nCaddyshack II doesn't have enough golf for a sports comedy, or enough laughs for a good comedy, so it's a failure as a sports film and as a comedy film. To put it simply, Caddyshack II is a failure and I'm certain it worst quality is that it bears the name Caddyshack in its title when its predecessor is such a critically acclaimed comedy classic.\nThe concepts in Caddyshack II are clearly unoriginal and dull, and the entire film is laugh free. The script and storyline are uncreative and there is nothing new that it brings to the table like the first Caddyshack did. All it supplies is lame actors at their career low points trying to capture the dying spirit from the comedy classic Caddyshack but failing abysmally most of the time.\nAnd the production team were clearly a bunch of gophers, because whoever they hired as the voice actor for the horses needs to get a different career pattern, because it was so unconvincing, pathetic and unfunny that it just brought down Caddyshack II's already low credibility. If it was Frank Welker then I blame the director, because bad voice acting can never be his fault.\nCaddyshack II suffers as a terrible and unfunny flim as well as being a bad sequel that suffers from all the issues that a bad sequel usually does, including the lack of fresh material that its predecessor supplied and a cast which fails to match the ensemble set up by Caddyshack, as well as characters that aren't interesting or worth paying focus to. Alan Arkush's inexperienced direction is no better here than it was in Deathsport, except that this time he is working with talent which he and his terrible movie manages to drag down, and his terrible direction is a serious cause of the blame here. But then again, so is Dan Akroyd's performance.\nDan Akroyd, well, whoever the hell told him to give an abysmal performance like that has suffered serious brain damage. If it was his idea, then clearly Dan Akroyd's comedic spirit must be in spirit prison. His voice itself is more ridiculous than the aforementioned terrible horse voice, and it gets very annoying to listen to very fast. It isn't funny, its Golden Raspberry Award material. Luckily they realised that and awarded him the Worst Supporting Actor award, and hopefully that would help the filmmakers distinguish between good comedy and utter stupidity.\nThe only real good qualities of Caddyshack II are that the puppetry of the gopher and the silly dynamics that he goes through are both decent, and the presence of Chevy Chase again is genial because he gives a decent performance. Caddyshack II is also shot well on some good locations and features fine cinematography to back it up.\n\nBut really, nobody could have thought that Caddyshack II was a good idea, yet it didn't stop the money grubbing producers who must have learned their lesson from this Golden Raspberry Award winning box office bomb.",
