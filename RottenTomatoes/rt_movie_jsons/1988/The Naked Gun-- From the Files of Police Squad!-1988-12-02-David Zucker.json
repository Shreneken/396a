Simpson), is shot, Frank sets out to find the culprit, leading him to business tycoon Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban). However, Frank has no evidence until he meets Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley), Ludwig's assistant. She knows nothing about Ludwig's devious plans, but falls for Frank and agrees to help him.",

Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) stumbles across a devious plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and, with the assistance of his only slightly more competent partner Ed Hocken (George Kennedy), embarks on an outlandish journey to save the day.  While a ton of jokes miss the mark, the vast majority are comedy gold, including some extended set pieces that have to be seen to be believed.  While the cast, which includes the likes of Ricardo Montalban, Priscella Presley, and O.J. Simspon, among others, is great and do a solid job, the movie is stolen by Nielsen, whose deadpan delivery never fails to come through.",

            "content": "Ok, so I just watched this movie after watching the six episodes of Police Squad! (Did I somehow make it through youth in the 80s in the US without watching either, at the time? I think I basically did, though I'm sure they were on in the background at some point.) Tbh the series was snappier. The hammy nature of several of the bits was more hammy, because of episode-to-episode repetition. Norberg and Hocken have funnier stuff to do in the series and better dynamics with Drebin. The love interest in the movie has some funny moments but also a lot of dull ones. I'm sad that the shoeshine guy didn't make an appearance; I always looked forward to his part in Police Squad! All in all, the movie has a lot of really funny moments, but it also drags, and I kept wondering when / if it was going to pick up.\n\nI watched this as part of watching a series of cop shows; I was interested to try to understand more about this genre which has been so expansive in American cinema since the 70s, to try to figure out why it has been so compelling, in various forms, and whether it tells us anything about this moment of competing demands: to defund the police, to recall left-liberal prosecutors, to puncture the mystique of the police in the aftermath of an abject, sickening failure like in Uvalde. However, I am too lazy to deconstruct anything, so I mostly just watch the movies and shoot fish in a barrel. (I love shooting fish in a barrel! Sometimes, I get one! And it always makes me happy. However, it's kind of messy. I've been thinking about trying a net.)\n\nPolice Squad! and Naked Gun are interesting in this regard in that they sort of survey the tropes that had become standard over the 70s and early 80s in cop shows, boil them down, and exaggerate them for yuks. Honestly, I would have to think more about where some of these come from. The early 70s renegade cop movies I've been watching are great for understanding the bleeding edge of the ideology and the desire, but they don't offer the most boiled down version of the tropes that later became standard.\n\nOne low-key aspect of this first Naked Gun movie that I liked: when Drebin plays, for what seems like it's aiming at stupid fun, something that turns out not to be funny at all -- in fact, he killed five actors who were putting on a Shakespeare in a Park festival (and not just any actors, but good ones!), or he finds exculpatory evidence for a guy who was already sent to the electric chair, or he laments, upon the possibility of losing his badge, that the next time he shoots someone, he could be arrested. You could easily overlook these short, deflating moments, but they tell the truth about policing in a way that a lot of cop shows don't. All of this bumbling isn't *just* for yuks. Ok, it's 98% for yuks, but it's also maybe 2% serious about quietly planting the idea that all this bumbling might not be just fuzzy and endearing. Of course, the cops still get the bad guys, every time, and the Dirty Harry fanboys probably just kept laughing.",

            "content": "Leslie Nielson's death last November was a big shock to me. Sure he has been in some bad films, such as 2001:A Space Travesty, but he had also made some quintessential classics such as Airplane, the only film of his career I consider better than this, and the Naked Gun series, of which this is the best. Whatever the outcome of the film, that doesn't stop me from considering Nielson a comedy genius.\n\nThe Naked Gun:From the Files of Police Squad! is fast, furious, zany and most importantly, enormous fun film. While it looks great, is wonderfully directed, brilliantly paced with seldom a dull moment and has energetic music and a fun story, it is the humour and acting that really makes this film so good.\n\nThe dialogue is deliciously dry-witted, and the plentiful juvenile gags never cease to be hilarious. Nielson gives one of his career's best performances in a wonderfully deadpan characterisation as an likable inept character. The support performances from Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy and OJ Simpson are equally great, but special mention has to go to Riccardo Montalban who just oozes cool.\n\nOverall, a hilarious film. Forget rubbish like Disaster Movie, 2001:A Space Travesty, Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie and watch the classic spoof movies like Young Frankenstein, Airplane, Galaxy Quest and this. You won't regret it! 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Ridiculous gags and nonstop jokes.\n\nDavid Zucker's absurdist crime comedy The Naked Gun (1988) is very funny with outrageous gags and creative visual direction that keeps you on your toes. If you look away from the screen for even a moment, you'll miss like 3 different jokes going on in the background. It's not as hilarious as Airplane! or Top Secret!, but The Naked Gun is still a classic comedy with plenty of laughs.\n\nLeslie Nielsen can deliver any goofy or joke line in a perfectly serious deadpan voice and it is funny every time. He's so calm given all the strange and hilarious situations that I'm always entertained by Nielsen's shenanigans. Priscilla Presley is surprisingly funny and keeps up with Nielsen's absurd energy. You never buy their romance or like the endless string of sex jokes there for a quick crude laugh, but their comedic chemistry is more important. The Naked Gun has it all, even Top Secret! superfan Weird Al Yankovic!\n\nRicardo Montalban is excellent as the villain. His casual manner tells you everything you need to know with a more nuanced performance than some of the more colorful characters in The Naked Gun. George Kennedy plays a gung ho cop who just allows Nielsen to do whatever he wants with reckless abandon and it's great. I love how The Naked Gun cast O.J. Simpson just to beat the hell out of him.\n\nWriters Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Pat Proft make efficient use of their 86 minutes to tell a silly story with as much visual flair and comedic insanity imaginable. I will not spoil anything in The Naked Gun, so that all the jokes are fresh, but I will say that the breakin and baseball gags are glorious.\n\nIn short, The Naked Gun will always be a comedy worth revisiting for a series of rapid fire laughs.",

Putting aside his \"other side\" OJ Simpson plays the straighter man of Nordberg perfectly while George Kennedy takes the Captain Ed role into whichever corner Drebin leads him next.\n\nPriscilla Presley shows surprising comedic timing as Jane Spencer as she switches effortlessly from straight woman to second banana throughout - any scene with Neilsen is a delight. Watch out for Weird Al Yankovic's cameo (he has one in all 3 movies in the franchise) but don't let your attention wander too far otherwise you may miss another sight gag or quick zinger.

It has toilet humor, sexual humor, and a fair amount of dirty jokes in it and it's all done brilliantly.\n\tIn The Naked Gun an incompetent policeman named Frank Drebin sets out to prevent an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth the Second.\n\tThe funny thing about Frank is that he's not only incompetent but also flawed in many other ways. He has difficulty reading between the lines such as when he steps off a plane and assumes since he's one the first people off the plane that the microphones, and crowd cheering is all set up for him but it's really set up for Weird Al Yankovic since he was on the same plane. He also lives in a very poor manner. In his apartment he has lots of old outdated food in his frig.  \n\tThere's one toilet joke in The Naked Gun which involves Frank using a toilet, which is funny in itself because it's literally a toilet joke. It's a quirk in which Frank forgets to take off a radio mic during a press conference before he goes to the bathroom and this results in everyone at the press conference hearing him go to the bathroom.\n\tThe Naked Gun also has sexual quirks which is appropriate considering sexual quirks are generally associated with toilet humor. There's a hilarious quirk which involves Frank using a dildo and getting in trouble for it. There's also a funny moment in which Frank and Jane, his partner, decide to overly use protection for them having sex.  \n\tFrank ends up getting himself in lots of funny situations. He goes to a baseball game because he finds out that that's where the assignation attempt on Queen Elizabeth the Second is supposed to take place. The fact that Queen Elizabeth II is at a baseball game is funny because it's the last  kind of place that you would expect her to be because she's with a bunch of people who are the exact opposite of what she is because they're:  uncivilized, unsophisticated, and not very royal. One of the funny situations involves Frank going undercover as an umpire and he doesn't even know exactly what to do as an umpire at first. He goes undercover as an opera singer and gets in trouble for it. \n\tThe Naked Gun has off the wall funniness and it also has many situations that Frank and other characters get themselves in and the comedy in it is brilliant.",

With a zazzy yet incongruent background score, annoyingly loud sound effects, daft cinematography and amateur editing, it falls flatly on face on technical aspects. All the husbandry gags are just cherry on top that makes you root for it more and more as it ages on screen. \n\nTicking for around 90 minutes, the tightly packed screenplay never lets you wander off its sketchy world, it may be illogical but it's hilarious, it may be redundant but it somehow is feasible and it may overdo sometime but it works like a charm. Neilson's comic timing is off the hook, he hits a home run on every throw and its his expressive or inexpressive face is what fuels this comic into a bit more than one anticipates for. Because at certain points even writers may fall short but he delivers every time and every line. \n\nHis ludicrous attempts to not only convince others but himself too, is what makes him stand alone than any other actors in here, his strong belief in each and every gag is clearly visible through his mannerism and tone. Zuker's execution barely matters in here, it is good but armed with such an attention seeking script one rarely wonders about it. \n\nNaked Gun might be an attention seeker, but why not just give it to it, there won't be any regrets.",

When it comes to the Zucker Brothers being together, they tend to make some comedies that are a classic. So with this, it's also a classic that is just as fantastic as Airplane!. Leslie Nielsen is really good at taking things seriously in a very comedic way that brings out a lot of laughs. It's interesting to see that it doesn't entirely make it obvious about who the villain is, and even if it did, that's probably because he was in a film that was one of the well known films of all times. I like how in a detective spoof like this, it still has the interesting detective stories that could be taken seriously as a action detective film, but also doesn't give out the whole case out in the beginning, just the basis of it. The writing by Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Pat Proft give out a lot of jokes for us to handle, and they kept hitting the mark as I kept laughing so much in it. Frank Drebin is very likable and silly to watch that you can't help but find him enjoyable. The Naked Gun is a fantastic film that it's sad to see that this is the last film where the Zucker Brothers and Jim Abrahams were involved together.",

You have your Horror movies and then dramas and then action movies. We as audiences wanted something completely different. Now I'm not saying that I hate these kinds of films but I wanted new ideas instead of reboots. Thus The Naked Gun was born. Well I can't really say that this movie was original because was based on a TV show. But this gave us something new for audiences to sink their teeth in. Thus with The Naked Gun, the spoof genre was born cranking out film like Scary Movie and Epic Movie. The Naked Gun combines some of the funniest humor that you can get from a film. It's like the filmmakers of this movie were like \"If we're going to scoff all of these spy movies, then we have to do it right\"! And the filmmakers clearly show it. This film not only combines the best speaking humor, but also the best visual humor. And this movie is jam-packed with all of this kin of humor. Like in one scene Frank (Leslie Nielsen) says \"Nice Beaver\". The girl Jane (Priscilla Presely) says \"Thank you, I just had it stuffed\" She then pulls down an actual stuffed Beaver from the attic. When you watch the movie and see the joke you'll get it. The Naked Gun is a funny comedy and I totally recommend it.",

Sure enough this movie gets me laughing more than anything manufactured by the Wayans' brothers.  I must admit, though, that the first 2 acts of the movie struggle at times to keep a consistent level of comedy.  There are moments where the jokes fall flat, and it sometimes struggles to recover quickly because they keep working through those ineffective jokes.  However, when the 3rd act hits, this is easily one of the funniest movies I know.  From the second they arrive at the baseball game I am just in tears with laughter, and it does not stop until the credits roll.  In fact, I actually had to remind myself there were some slower parts of the movie as soon as I was done watching, because I'm on such a high from that whole final sequence.  I'll also quickly address the one reservation some people bring up with these movies: \"Isn't it weird/hard to watch these films with O.J. Simpson in them as a cop, considering what we all assume he did?\"  It could be, however, since his character (Nordberg) is constantly getting the crap kicked out of him in these movies, it kind of works.  In fact one could even consider it somewhat cathartic to watch him get shot, punched, and dropped so frequently.  Overall, I think the first Naked Gun movie is by far the best, and despite some slower moments that struggle with humor, it ends with a big bang that is seldom matched by other spoof movies including its own sequels.",

The first movie 'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!' dates from 1988 and was directed by David Zucker. The storyline is about police lieutenant Frank Drebin, played by the brilliant Leslie Nielsen (Airplane, Spy Hard), who tries to stop an assassination attempt on Queen Elisabeth II who is visiting LA. I absolutely love the mix of different kinds of humor; slapstick, visual and verbal puns and of course the face of Leslie Nielsen! Starring Priscilla Presley (Dallas), George Kennedy (Airport films, Intensive Care), Ricardo Montalban (Spy Kids 2 and 3) and O.J. Simpson (The Towering Inferno). Entertainment guaranteed. Impossible not to laugh!\n\nWhen officer Nordberg (Simpson) unsuccessfully attempts to bust a drug operation on a boat near the docks, lieutenant Frank Drebin (Nielsen) and captain Ed Hocken (Kennedy) promise him to catch the one who is responsible for Nordberg's injury. The few clues lead Frank to the wealthy Vincent Ludwig (Montalban), who he suspects is planning an assassination on the British queen Elisabeth II. In order to gain prove Frank interrogates Ludwig's assistant the beautiful Jane Spencer (Presley). Can Frank and his police squad catch the bad guys?",

From beginning to end, it's just a hilarious combination of slap stick, visual gags and word play. Some of the jokes will take you by surprise, and others telegraph their arrival - but I would say the vast majority hit their mark in The Naked Gun.\n\nThe film's success is partly due to Leslie Nielsen's great dead-pan performance as Lt. Frank Drebin, but mostly its about the writing. The ZAZ team (plus Pat Proft) do a great job lampooning the detective crime drama genre, and turn every stereotypical plot device on its proverbial head with hilarious results.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've seen any of the spoof movies from the ZAZ team (Airplane, Top Secret), then you'll likely enjoy this too. The humor is crude, and even childish, but you're still likely going to find something to laugh at here.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThere's nothing tremendously visual about the film. You'll get the same enjoyment regardless of the device you choose to watch it on.\n\nBest moment:\n\nOne of the my favorite scenes is when Frank goes to get information from a local informant.

As he gets deeper involved in what turns out to be a huge case involving drugs, assassination attempts, and simple old murder, the giggles arrive thick and fast in a wonderfully scripted comedy. Never over complicating the joke, it's plain old dad wit right throughout, with a hint of sexually related crudeness. I particularly like the 'nice beaver' comment , made as the character stands underneath a ladder that a woman is climbing, moments before she passes him the actual product of a taxidermist, commenting 'Thanks, I just had it stuffed'. Cringe worthy as it may sound, it's rib tickling stuff with various references to other films as it progresses, James Bond and his gadgets in particular. It's amazing how many modern films have still not surpassed the hilarity of 30 years ago, but I guess that's a matter of individual taste really. I would much prefer to see more of this genre, albeit what would sadly have to be without the late Leslie Nielsen.",

Frank Drebin, who is assigned to protect the Queen of England when she visits America. Drebin suspects rich hot shot Vincent Ludwig to have something sneaky up his sleeve and then meets his associate Jane, who Frank has an on and off relationship with throughout the film. As the film goes on, Frank must protect the Queen from an assassination attempt at an MLB game all while constantly throwing hilarious jokes and scenes at the viewers. The Naked Gun is a great comedy and is considered a classic comedy.\nLeslie Neilsen is superb at what he does, he was a great actor and he's even better at producing laughs. Lt. Drebin is such a likable character, too, he's such an idiot but you root for him as the film goes on. I wasn't too big of a fan with Presley's character, she's not the best actress around, but she did what she could. The film is hilarious and one you should watch more than once to laugh at all of the jokes, there's just so many great scenes and lines.

Not every single line and gag work, but with the abundance of them, the ones that work outweigh the ones that don't. Leslie Nielsen is perfect for this role. He's able to deliver those clever one liners with ease, as well as pull of the oblivious goofball character perfectly. Something I usually don't praise in movies is the runtime, but here the runtime was spot on. Spoof movies generally need to be about an hour and a half long, and this movie gets it just right.

Looking at it now, the movie's rather thin plot is merely an excuse for a sequence of hit or miss gags. If nothing else, the movie features one of the most unlikely casts ever; Leslie Nielsen (once a dramatic leading man), O.J. Simpson (no comment), George Kennedy (\"Cool Hand Luke\"). Priscilla Presley (Elvis' wife!), and Ricardo Montalban (\"Fantasy Island\") who steals every scene he's in!",

It is up to him to foil an assassination plot on the Queen Elizabeth II when she is visiting the States.  Now I don't typically go for parody movies; I like Airplane!, and I like Edgar Wright, but that's pretty much the extent of what I enjoy of the subgenre.  The thing about comedy though is that is arguably the most subjective genre out there, and while I know plenty of people that like the Naked Gun series, what works for them doesn't necessarily work for me.  The jokes featured are very upfront (a lot of them play their hand too early), and I personally prefer a subtler delivery of humor.  But hey, these are the jokes, and I would be lying if I said I didn't get a few laughs out of this.  What works best are the random non sequiturs that are left unexplained, because they really do take you by surprise.  Also, it's hard not to like the deadpan Nielson, as he does have a lot of natural charisma.  For me, slapstick and pratfalls work exponentially better in silent films, but hey, different strokes for different folks, and there are certainly worse spoof movies out there.",
