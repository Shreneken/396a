    "summary": "When Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets transferred for evaluation from a prison farm to a mental institution, he assumes it will be a less restrictive environment. But the martinet Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) runs the psychiatric ward with an iron fist, keeping her patients cowed through abuse, medication and sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. The battle of wills between the rebellious McMurphy and the inflexible Ratched soon affects all the ward's patients.",

The infamous Nurse Ratched isn't even the villain she was laid out to be. Sure, she's strict and mean but hardly worthy of being considered villainous.

In one of his greatest performances, Nicholson breathes live into McMurphy as he rails against the system, creating one of Hollywood's most memorable anti-heroes.  Filled with humor and drama, it's a remarkably powerful film with an ending that may leave the viewer cheering and crying simultaneously.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is worthy of the praise it has received over the years and is must-see viewing.",

Throughout the film I even had a soft spot for Nurse Ratched\u2026 however, the coldness of her demeanor and the ease at which she handed out sentences and punishment is chilling.

The production values are of top notch quality, and Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent. The film also has a brilliant script, superb direction from Milos Forman(who also directed one of my other favourite movies Amadeus) and a compelling story. The pace is spot on, and there are many memorable scenes especially the very poignant yet harrowing ending. The characters all add a lot to the film, especially Nurse Ratched who is oppressive and terrifying. The cast are all terrific, Jack Nicholson is superb in one of his best roles and Louise Fletcher is just unforgettable as Nurse Ratched. Among the supporting cast are Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douif, all great. So overall, I cannot fault One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is considered not only one of the best of the 70s but one of the best ever, and it deserves that reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Jack Nicholson is a wonder and it's no surprise he won best actor for his performance in this.\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a story of friendship that is sure to make you smile. It's truly a beautiful film, but it will no doubt break your heart into pieces. \n\nWith a breathtaking opening scene, this film is set up for success. A compelling story that will make you bend over laughing at the perfectly written/timed jokes, but will also make you cry and question everything you know about the value of human life. The characters are so wonderfully created that you get attached to them quickly and (I can't say it enough) the acting is some of the best I've ever seen in film. So many amazing actors, if I were to list off the best ones I would probably name the whole cast. The cinematography is gorgeous for the time period snd they do a great job of wide angles and (my personal favorite) long exposure shots. For 1975, it really is impressive.\n\nI wish I could put more into this review but there's nothing that I could even say that would describe this film. When I say this is the greatest film I've ever seen, I mean it. Everyone needs to see it at least once in their lifetime!",

            "content": "There is not a wasted scene or frame in this entire movie. I've seen it before, but not in a while and not with a critical eye. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a masterpiece. Jack Nicholson gives the performance of a lifetime as Randall Patrick \"R.P.\" McMurphy and alone could carry the film. However, the entire cast is fantastic, from the medical staff to the other patients \u2014 Sydney Lassick as \"Cheswick\" was my personal favorite, but there's four or five that I could argue for a supporting actor nom (Brad Dourif as \"Billy\" did get the nom at the 48th Academy Awards). Then there's Nurse Ratched, who Louise Fletcher plays with a calculating coldness. McMurphy and Ratched are engaged in a tug-of-war over control of the ward, even if it's largely subversive. It's difficult to tell if McMurphy wants to embarrass his overlord, or if he genuinely just wants to enjoy himself. Nevertheless, he's a threat and needs to be neutralized. The film explores comradery, loyalty, self-confidence, madness and anarchy and power-structures. There are too many good scenes to recount, but the \"fishing expedition,\" the \"basketball game,\" the \"Christmas party,\" and the reveal that \"Chief\" Bromden (Will Sampson) is neither mute nor deaf (\"Mmm, Juicy Fruit.\" Classic!) all come to mind. Chief is a legendary figure, and I love him. The smile he cracks on the basketball court warms my heart \u2014 the hug he gives his sweet prince at the ending is cry-fuel. We end up where we start: \"medication time\". The opening and closing tracks are perfect. The casting is perfect. One of only three films to ever win all five of \"The Big Five\" Oscar categories, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest might be as close to a perfect movie as I've ever seen. To date, it's only my second (99). One of those rarities where the movie is better than the book (the book is also fantastic), I entreat you to watch it as soon as humanely possible.",

Sure there is excellent acting, an interesting premise, and a unique setting, but the script on paper is just a rebellious guy getting into trouble with some mental ward patients. Despite this simple premise, this movie swept me into its story almost immediately and I could not look away, even during the slower scenes. Jack Nicholson absolutely owns this movie, but all of the side characters also add such convincing performances. Immediately I was interested in all of them and curious what their stories would be in this film. The pacing is very solid, and I really felt the weight of everything happening in the film. The use of music/sound is very tactful, such as the electrotherapy scene where all you could hear were the tortured grunts. An experience that I was not expecting to have, I would give this movie a 10/10 but I would need to have a second viewing, so for now, 9/10.",

Please bear with me on this one!\n\nIt is quite apparent that both films, GIRL, INTERRUPTED and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, are asking the audience the same question: \"Am I crazy?\" While on the surface it might seem both films have the same answer to that question, i.e., \"depends who you ask,\" the answer goes deeper than that. Both films end with the freedom found in the \"escape\" from a mental institution, but the two films' deeper answers are found beyond \"depends who you ask\" and rest in another question needing an answer, \"Why are those deemed \u2018crazy' locked away in mental institutions when the REAL \u2018crazies\" are walking around free?\" I hope I can attempt to explore all these questions and answers in reviewing both of these films to arrive at neither a question nor an answer but instead a revelation\u2026.but, knowing me, there'll still be a question or two!\n\nGIRL, INTERRUPTED is based on Susanna Kaysen's 1993 autobiography about a year she spent in a mental institution. Actress Winona Ryder plays Susanna in the film and Angelie Jolie (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) plays Lisa, a sociopath who challenges Susanna on this \"am I crazy?\" question. I'm not saying either Susanna or Lisa are NOT \"crazy,\" but what I am saying is that they both have a thirst to understand their inner workings which probably makes them as sane (probably MORE sane) than most who do NOT thirst to understand their inner workings. I loved the book and I loved the movie, but the book \"attacks\" more than the movie, thanks to Kaysen's sharp observations into madness, stripping away from the reader the preconceived notion, \"am I sane or insane?\" After the reader turns the last page of the book, Kaysen does indeed have the last words to this notion: \"I don't know. What do YOU think?\" Thank God director James Mangold cast Angelia Jolie as Lisa. Truth be told, when Jolie is not on screen, the film coasts along pretty calming and safe (and that's hard for me to say, as I'm a Winona Ryder fan). But all is forgiven when Jolie shows up in a scene, wherein \"attack\" is a huge understatement where Lisa is concerned. Interesting to note is that I saw Angelina Jolie on INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO and James Lipton was interviewing her about her role as Lisa. Jolie said either before casting or after, she found Kaysen's book that she had read as a teenager and when she flipped through the pages, all of Lisa's lines were highlighted and underlined. Talk about willing yourself to play the role you know you have to play at some point in your life. What struck me so interesting about GIRL, INTERRUPTED is toward the ending of the film, not when Susanna was discharged from the mental institution but what she said before she was discharged. Susanna's roommate was Georgina (Lisa called her \"Georgie Girl\") who was a pathological liar. When Lisa steals Susanna's diary and all read it together without Susanna, Georgina is distraught and angry at the things Susanna wrote about her. When Susanna is leaving the institution, she tells Georgina as a sort of peace offering, \"You know, what I write in my diary, I don't know what I'm saying, Georgina. Maybe I'm the liar?\" Georgina replies, \"Maybe not.\" This is how the film gives us mirrors. All the characters in GIRL, INTERRUPTED are mirrors for one another and mirrors for us. If we say, \"that Lisa, she sure is crazy!\" (and we do many times in the film), we might as well be saying, \"that so and so in our life (to include us), he or she sure is crazy!\" Of course, I'm talking about \"the speck and the plank\" (Matthew 7:3-5), as I always seem to be talking about. \"Crazy\" is NOT insanity. \"Crazy\" is sanity in a world of insanity. \"Crazy\" is you and me muddling through an insanely rigid and cold world that wants to label us as SOMETHING so we can be \"boxed in,\" \"you are different than me, and I don't like that, so you go over there (or \"down there,\" which is more appropriate) and I'll stay over here.\" If we break free from of all of this, then how we can be \"crazy?\" Mental institutions are for those who the world beats up in this way and, if I'm being honest, if mental institutions were for people who beat up on others, EVERYONE would be in them and there would be no one walking around free.\n\nONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is another film based on a book, this time by Ken Kesey, and another film set in a mental institution. The central protagonist in the film and book is Randall P. McMurphy, but the book tells the story from the point of view of Chief Bromden, the enormous Indian who all the patients think is \"deaf and dumb,\" until he speaks to McMurphy and becomes the sole figure who finds redemptive freedom by picking up an enormous fountain and throwing it through a window, escaping the institution and running through the \"green pastures\" (Psalm 23:2). I think you would have to be living under a rock if you have not heard the name, \"Nurse Ratched,\" a term synonymous with \"mean\" and one with a horrifying bedside manner. Ratched is the nurse who despises disruption and disorder, and McMurphy is the epitome of disruption and disorder. Jack Nicholson as McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Ratched both won Best Actor and Best Actress Oscars for their performances. There was one particular scene that truly stayed with me, and it's a scene less than a minute where the camera has Nicholson in closeup, no dialogue, but we can hear everything that his character, McMurphy, is saying. It's toward the end, and what I heard McMurphy say is, \"How the hell did I get myself in here? They're trying to break me, but they won't do it! They'll shock me senseless, for sure, but Chief is my friend and if the shock is that bad or if it's a lobotomy (which it was), Chief won't let me live like that. He'll put me out of my misery and then he'll pick up that fountain that I secretly know he can pick up and throw it through a window and break out of here. His very act of freedom will be how I break out of here, too!\" This is EXACTLY what happens in this film. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is about patients asking, \"Who's the crazy one in here? Is it us for being in here or it is that Nurse Ratched over there behind that glass and the other hospital staff telling us we're crazy in here?\" We don't need the answer to this question, because Chief gives us the answer, i.e., \"crazy or not, I'm outta here!!!!\"\n\nNot to get too personal (though I will), I have to talk about my many visits to mental institutions. \"Was I crazy?\" \"Depends who you ask.\" But if you're asking me, I WAS \"nuts,\" but it was because I was \"cracked.\" Truth be told, I still think I'm \"nuts\" (\"cracked\") on any given day or, better yet, on any given hour. But what is this \"crazy\" and this \"nuts\" if I voluntarily admitted myself into these mental institutions, which I did? Is it \"crazy\" for someone to voluntarily admit themselves to a mental institution? Is it only \"crazy\" if someone INvoluntarily is admitted to a mental institution? Maybe the \"voluntarily admitted myself\" is the \"crazy\" and the \"nuts\" part of it, because I'm NOT \"crazy\" or \"nuts\" for wanting to understand why I am like I am, why I need what I need, why I think like I think, why I feel what I feel. If you think that is \"crazy\" or \"nuts\" about me, challenge yourself to answer these same questions. And notice I didn't put question marks behind these questions, because you don't have to answer them if you don't want to. You can stay \"sane\" as long as you need to, as long as that is working for you, as long as that is how you \"roll,\" and just plain as long as you possibly can in an insane world.\n\nSo, have I come to a revelation? I think I have. In reviewing GIRL, INTERRUPTED and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, I wanted to come to an understanding of these films' question, \"Am I crazy?,\" but instead I seemed to have come to understand my own answers to this question. I understand now that I will NOT allow anyone to call me ANYTHING, nor anyone to \"box me\" or label me ANYTHING. And if they call me ANYTHING or \"box me\" or label me ANYTHING, I don't have to answer them back. I can hear what they called me and I can sit with what they called me and ask myself, \"is this speck or is this plank?\" But none of this has to alter me inside in any way, shape or form\u2026.unless I let it. I've been called A LOT in my life, some good, some not so good, and that has all altered me in more ways than I care to mention. But what can't alter me RIGHT NOW is what ANYONE chooses to call me, \"box me\" or label me. I struggle like Kaysen and McMurphy to understand myself better. I have been both Lisa and Nurse Ratched on more than one occasion. But what I DON'T struggle with or what I have NOT been both (actually, I'm lying\u2026.I AM BOTH!!!!) is me finding my own path, journeying, discovering, weeping, laughing, etc. I think they call this \"living.\"\n\n\"Am I crazy?\" \"I don't know. What do YOU think?\" or, more appropriately asked, \"I don't know. what do YOU think about asking yourself this same question?\"",

He brings color and liveliness to a lifeless world, which equally lifts spirit as it is saddening and the film contains a boatload of memorable characters. The problem I have with the film is I don't fully understand why. For that, I give \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"... 4 stars.",

Yet, seeing this adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel come to life makes one yearn to read the source material.\n\nThe first thing that one notices while watching this film is the quality of the acting. It's extremely hard for actors to portray the intensity of mental illness in a way that is not offensive. Yet, the supporting cast of Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, among others make this a performance to remember. Everyone in their cast was spectacular in their roles. There were times I thought I was watching real patients with mental illness.\n\nJack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher do a remarkable job bringing the conflict to life. Playing  McMurphy and Nurse Ratched, audiences feel the high stakes card game at each act of this movie. Nicholson goes above and beyond in captivating audiences and making this a masterpiece.\n\nThe writing, dialogue, and plot give each character a chance at full development. Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben are amazing at letting each character shine. Audiences can understand the themes brought to light. Themes of authoritarian care, social support structures for the mentally ill, dependencies on said structures, and soul-crushing institutionalism vs individuality.\n\nThe script was incredible as the audience can never quite predict what happens next. There were moments of real tension felt as the suspense builds and we wonder if our protagonist gets caught.\n\nJack Nitzsche brings alive the entire movie with his wonderful music. Every scene is built upon and improved with the addition of his work.\n\nAn outstanding movie that still holds relevance in today's society. Milos Forman lets his artistic genius shine. \n\n5/5.",

            "content": "I watched it so long ago but it feels nice to revisit it 45 years later. \nHad no idea it was based on a book by Ken Kesey.\nDirected by Milos Forman and produced by Michael Douglas it's been engraved into the public consciousness for so many years as one of the greatest movies ever made. \nThis is still one of the best performances of Jack Nicholson's career.\nA terrific supporting cast from Christopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif to Danny Devito to Sydney Lassick to William Redfield to Will Sampson as the mute but beloved Chief. Chief chooses not to communicate as a way of not being mistreated by the general population the same way his father was treated when he was a soldier so he and Randle are more alike in many ways. \nRandle is admitted into the Oregon psychiatric hospital to see if he's mentally unstable. He's committed statutory rape, has had physical altercations, and is not very work-savvy. He's flawed but feels he can find a solution to why he's so troubled. So for his entire stay Randle acts as a humorous con man. He's very roguish and rebellious making an impact for the other patients. The head nurse is Ratched being a corrupt authority figure. \nThe rivalry of Randle and Nurse Ratchet played by Louise Fletcher is iconic. It serves as microcosm for the culture wars of the 1970s. Ratchet runs this hospital with an iron fist belittling the men making them talk about what's bothering them. It's until Randle arrives when her perfect world order is shaken up. Ratchet doesn't want to relinquish her hold over the patients so she bumps heads with Randle several times over. \nKesey's novel was meant to offer a blunt study of the institutional process critiquing patients were treated in the 60s. One of his themes included machines always triumph over nature.\nThe book was also adapted into a broadway play. \nThe movie was one of many criticized by psychologists. True it's difficult to properly depict mentally ill individuals. And the film does deviate from the source material a lot mainly white washing the lead. But the original novel has earned a spot on high school reading lists. That's how strong its staying power has lasted. Many of Kesey's themes are still intact such as freedom vs institutionalization as well as rebellion against authority, conformity, gender roles, homophobia, misogyny, racism, and mental illness. He saw that removing people from society not conforming to the norm turned functional members of society insane. \nWith Randle he finds out during his time with the patients that they don't know how to leave even if they wanted to. So he offers a glimmer of hope for them enjoying the harmless pleasures of life not being restrained by strict rules and procedures. Even though the author despised the final product and Nicholson and Forman had a falling out the movie still remains a masterpiece of cinema. \nDefinitely speaks out of the mistreatment of patients and the failing of the system itself. The main central theme remains; being institutionalized for better or worse will inevitably affect your own mental health. Mental health is better looked at today than it was way back. Thanks to this movie it shifted psychiatric practices for the better. For the patients it's up to them to commit themselves willingly to be treated so they can leave themselves. \nNicholson shines as a rebellious patient hero and Louise Fletcher brings this devious nurse to life. Even the music at the end gives off a kooky yet emotional vibe. This is still a true cinematic achievement for life.",

This is also a credit to the supporting cast who help create this level of engagement through their authentic and fully embodied portrayals of patients in a mental ward.

MacMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is a man who poses as a patient at a mental hospital led by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and encourages the other patients to embrace their human behavior and have fun. During which he befriends a mute Native American patient Chief (Will Sampson) who reminisces about freedom in his home Canada. Let's look at the film in context. Before the film, the communist party had spread in Asia, Europe and Cuba and the Cold War was still occurring. In fact, by the mid 1970's, America had lost a war in Vietnam, matching the tragic outcome of MacMurphy in the film. Speaking of, director Milos Forman, a native of Czechoslovakia, made a similar type of movie called The Firemen's Ball, which mocked the home country's communist party and was a milestone of the Czechoslovak New Wave. In the Americas, Ken Kesey wrote a novel about behaviorism and control called \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" which depicted the nurses as the socialists who imprisoned their patients. A decade later, producers Kirk and Michael Douglas bought the rights to the book and asked the Czech director to craft the movie. Although as political as Forman's work strives to be, it works thanks to its nihilistic themes and also Jack Nicholson's wild energy.\n\n(4 \u00bd Lobotomies out of 5)",

Jack Nicolson has that cheeky charmer character down very well but you feel the anger and the sadness throughout. An excellent supporting cast including Louis Fletcher, Danny DeVito and Christoper LLoyd. They have a very set routine in the hospital the classical music plays as they take their medicine. Its very regimented and we see the scary, calm and straight faced Nurse Ratched. She has control and the way she sits and walks is very eerie. You can see why many of the men are scared of her. The scenes of excitment on the boat and the party show what the men have been missing. They see Jack Nicolson character as an influence, as a leader and something they have never seen before. His relationship with Chief becomes very moving as we close on the end of the movie. The climax has the shocking moments, from moments with Billy played well Brad Dourif,Nurse Ratched being strangled and the eventually mercy killing of Randle. We embrace the madness, we laugh at them, we laugh with them, we feel sorry for them and embrace when their regimented day is changed. The freedom seems to be only through escaping or dying. They are some moments where i feel it wouldn't happen, with many times the nurses station being easy access to the patients. The imaginary play by play baseball sequence is memorable as he shows them a different side than the normal everyday. His impact on the men is felt through the enjoyable moments but also in tragedy. Entertaining and thought provoking.",

Will Samson, the actor that portrayed Chief, was a strong acting choice because he strongly depicts the shy nature of Chief in the book, as well as, his physical appearance of a large Native American. However other characters, like Harding, are not as to be desired. After reading the novel, one would picture Harding to be a young, handsome man with high education, but in reality, the actor is a middle-aged, out-of-shape man. The movie also bypasses major parts of the book, like meeting Harding's wife and the development of the fishing scene, failing to stay true to the source material. Seeing how Harding's wife conducts herself and the planning that went into the fishing trip, helps in understanding some confusing scenes in the movie and inevitably makes the book more enjoyable. Even though Forman's casting choices were a bit questionable and he left out major parts of the book, he did capture the ending perfectly creating some closure for the audience but still keep them wondering about life on the ward. In conclusion, there are quality parts to the movie like Chief's character and the ending; however, the movie fails to stay true to the source material making the book a much more enjoyable use of your time.",

In the book, Chief is the narrator, but in the movie the story is based around Mr. McMurphy's point of view; consequently, cutting out the ending of the book. One scene that was altered, is the fishing scene.  Mr. McMurphy is the \u2018Captain' of the ship, but in the book George is the one who knows all about fishing and is the \u2018Captain' of the boat. The movie alters this to make McMurphy more psychotic than he already is portrayed. One actress didn't look like she was described in the book. Louise Fletcher did a great job in the movie, but I was expecting more looks of the character Pam Ferris plays in \"Matilda.\" Overall, the movie was relatively close to the book and not too many scenes were altered of cut out of the movie.",

The plot throughout the movie was fairly similar to the book in regards to laying out the key events but the movie changed specific events. For example, in the movie McMurphy escaped from the fence and stole the bus to go on a fishing trip with candy and the other individuals from the ward, whereas, in the book, McMurphy had to convince many to go on the trip and did not have to steal the bus because the Doctor had to tag along in regards to the agreement of going out of the ward. The movie was not completely true to the source material because George a character used throughout the book did not exist in the movie, the narrator of the movie is from McMurphy's point of view and not the Chief's, and the Chief was seen as the hero in the book whereas in the movie McMurphy is seen as the hero. Lastly, the ending of the movie did not show Chief's escape as detailed as the book because the viewer never experiences Cheif meeting with a man to catch a ride as well as his plan to go to Canada. The ending of the book showed the readers the plan chief had after the ward escape, and the movie ended with Chief breaking the window and escaping from the ward. As viewers, we do not know what happened after the escape Cheif makes if you have not read the book. In conclusion, the book was a better version of the story, the movie's plot/storyline, truth to the source material, and ending lead me to think that the film was less enjoyable than the novel.",

Because of these traits, I would give the movie two out of five stars, which translates to a 40%. To begin, the physical characteristics of the characters were highly different from what was expected while reading the novel.  Jack Nicholson, who played McMurphy, was not nearly as tall, strapping, and of ginger complexion as he was described in the book. William Redflied, who depicts the character of Harding, was not beautiful and graceful, as the book had led me to believe.  While these two character discrepancies loom the heaviest, no character seen in the movie was true to Ken Kesey's original enactment.  Secondly, without the background knowledge stemming from the reading of the novel, the plot is confusing and events happen without reason.  The fishing trip was a blur, without purpose, and out of order.  The introduction of Sandy and Candy was also muddy, as the arrangement of their arrival is never seen being discussed.  Finally, with a differentiating storyline than the novel, key motifs were forgotten.  We were never introduced to Billy's mother, Harding's wife never came into play, Cheswick and Rowler the Squaller suicides were left out, and also, George, the germaphobe, was never present. In conclusion, the movie portrayal of Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was frankly a waste of time and hard to watch.",

Once there, he pretends to be crazy only to pay for his crime in a mental hospital. By the time he gets there, he meets other men, the real patientes, whose suffers from the iron villain, the chief of the nursery, the evil Mildred Ratched - played by  Louise Fletcher. Once Jack gets to the heart of the other patientes, he decides to create a game against their enemy to see what happens when a big unexpected change comes along in a prison molded by rules.\n\nIt's funny to realize that the movie takes place in the 60's and the beatnik movement was all around in north american societies, building up new kinds of thoughts and everything. All those people portrayed as patients, I mean, those one close to Jack in the \"round table\" were really afraid to go back to the real world and that's how the magic comes along during to the whole picture. \n\nJack is the revolution that every mind needs. How can't you not love the way he narrates the game on the shut television? How can you forget the moment that Cheswick comes up against Mrs. Ratched about HIS cigarettes? Milos Forman keep sending messages during the whole fun: Set yourself free from yourself. The greatest weapon It's your mind.\n\nWatch this movie and read the book it's ALMOST the same experience because both arts talks to the heart at the same level. Of course the movie doesn't takes every chapter from the book, but that's just another special touch by Forman. By the moment you finish the book, you run to the movie, and every time you finish the movie, you run to the book. It's a healthy experience, believe me. \n\nOne of my favorites moments from the movie is that one when Jack and Chief becomes friends. Although in the book is even MORE exciting, the movie has it's own charm. Right there, we see two souls whose were desperate to find each other in hell.\n\nEverything in this movie puts the pieces of our lives in place, believe me. In every college that teaches psychology, the students needs to watch this beautiful, warming classic.",

The story I found to be really strong and incredibly intriguing, especially once you hit the second act.\n\nThe acting was by far some of the strongest that I've seen in film, especially Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, I found that he gave an extremely entertaining and thrilling performance.\n\nThe characters were all portrayed and written incredibly well, from the schizophrenic Charley Cheswick to the silent but lovable Chief Bromden.\n\nThe setting, sets and costumes were also really strong, especially the set designs of the mental institution.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film in my opinion is one of the best, especially the song that plays at the beginning and end of the film. \n\nThe film also had some incredibly strong atmosphere, especially at the end of the third act.\n\nThe film also carries emotions really well, from the mental patients to the people related to them.\n\nThe film is also extremely gripping and intriguing, and I hope to watch it again soon.\n\nOver all I give it a \n10/10 - would recommend",

            "content": "This is an oddly watchable film for how dark it's subject matter is and for how difficult it is to watch a man receive electro shock treatment and see a man who has cut his wrists and killed himself. Those are the sorts of scenes you will have to face in this film but you also get funny moments and scenes that are just bursting with life even as men are surrounded by wire fences. Milos Forman made his second English language film with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and he excels at he paces the story well knows when to let his actors shine and balances the tones perfectly. I can fully appreciate why this film is such a classic but in a year like 1975 I don't know if I would call it the Best Picture of the year even though it would easily beat most other Best Picture winners.\n\nRandall McMurphy, Jack Nicholson, is pretending to be insane to avoid having to serve prison time and ends up at a mental hospital run by the steely Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, who proves a worthy adversary. As he attempts to challenge her authority she exercises her ability to control his fellow mental hospital patients but after he takes the men out on a joyride in town she becomes more aggressive. He is sentenced indefinitely which increases his frustration and plots to escape the hospital with the help of some prostitutes but the morning after tragedy occurs as McMurphy attempts to strangle Ratched and ends up receiving more shock treatment as punishment.\n\nWhat was interesting to me about the movie was that it could be interpreted in multiple different ways. The most traditional interpretation is that McMurphy is innocent and attempting to free the mental patients from the evil Ratched, which reviewers certainly give credence to. A more interesting interpretation is that McMurphy actually is mental but refuses to accept it and Ratched is simply doing her job and must subdue McMurphy as he is an obstacle to her noble goals. The direction and the performances allow you to see and enjoy the film from multiple different characters' points of view and that just makes it a richer experience.\n\nFletcher's performance is simply brilliant as she doesn't play the villain as icy and cold with a deep voice as many actresses would have but as sensible and measured with a softly spoken tone. We believe that she thinks what she is doing is correct, in some cases it may be, which causes her to be one of the best villains put on the screen as her motivations make sense and the extreme actions she takes are more tragic than maddening. She is matched by Nicholson who gives one of his best performances as he injects his own manic personality and odd warmth into the devilishly charming protagonist. Dourif stands out as the troubled but sympathetic Billy Bibbit as he masters the speech patterns and nervous tics of a significantly disturbed young man. I believe that Fletcher and Nicholson both earned their Academy Awards and Fletcher's performance is one of the greatest Best Actress winning performances of all time.\n\nForman's direction is great as he allows for long, drawn out scenes that occur in one room in the mental hospital and knows when to cut away. We do have to watch McMurphy face electroshock therapy but it's use does not feel exploitative and we don't see it again and again as we would in a more tawdry production. The final scene works because these characters have been built up so well and we feel that we know them and how they would react in certain situations so their emotional response to the devastating events in the final scenes of the movies draw a genuine reaction out of us.\n\nI would have given Barry Lyndon (1975) the Best Picture award even as I would say it has more flaws than this film because it nevertheless contains some fantastic moments. This is certainly a worthy winner when compared to Tom Jones (1963) and A Man for All Seasons (1966) however and is one of the few real classics littered in there amongst the rest of the Best Picture winners.",

The lack of character development in roles like Billy Bibbit and Chief Bromden limits the audience's ability to emotionally connect to the film and its events. The film pales in comparison to the novel when it comes to character development. Plot development is also a major shortcoming for Milo\u00c5\u00a1 Forman's film. Many essential aspects of Chief's personality are omitted from the film, such as memories, flashbacks, and hallucinations. There were symbolic parts of the novel omitted as well, such as the dog sniffing for ground squirrels in the night. In contrast, the acting, specifically that of Jack Nicholson is suitable. Nicholson is able to transport the viewer to a 50s-era mental hospital by assuming the role of Randle McMurphy. In conclusion, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" slightly disappointed me as a viewer, but I appreciate the acting jobs and casting of the film.",

I am going to focus on the main characters and their fit for the part, the setting and vibe of the movie, and the overall connection to the book itself. Starting with the characters, I believe that all of the actors fit very well with the part they played. The only character that I did not imagine in the movie the same was the Nurse. She is skinnier in the movie than I imagined her to be. She was also a lot younger looking. The acting for all primary, secondary, and the remaining character was very satisfactory overall. The actors were still very talented and played their role well. The setting and vibe of the movie was really good. It truly felt like they were in a ward/ asylum. The overall connection to the book was pretty spot on. The order was correct. The only thing that did not match the book were some events being altered.

Though I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the acting and ability of the actors to portray the uniqueness of the characters, I was a bit disappointed in actor selection. Jack Nicholson does a good job, but I don't think his look fit the appearance of McMurphy's character as described in the book. The same goes for a few other characters; maybe appearance could have been focused on more. The extremely detailed and expanded plot of the book left a lot to be done in the movie adaptation, which unfortunately didn't quite develop as strongly as I would have liked. Many of my favorite details from the book were skipped or completely changed in the movie. The book is narrated by the character Chief, who provides a unique insight towards the mind of a patient in a mental institution. Chief, as well as many other supporting characters, were only partially developed as characters. Therefore, I struggled to connect with the characters emotionally while watching the movie, which is something that is important to me while watching a movie. Overall, it was definitely not a bad film on its own; I simply had high standards after reading the book, which made it less enjoyable.",

            "content": "A touching testament to the power of empathy.\n\nMilos Forman lets you understand what it is like confined in an insane asylum in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Forman adapts Ken Kesey's novel of the same name into a hilariously insane comedy that leaves you feeling destroyed due to its sincere dramatic finale and motifs.\n\nForman's direction is as perfectly in tune as the art of filmmaking gets. His allowance of letting actors just perform uninterrupted for minutes on end is revolutionary as is his incredible storytelling at depicting a harsh reality within One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest that never feels fake.\n\nThe authenticity of the acting within One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is why I think this film is timeless. Jack Nicholson's leading performance captures a genuine humanity with the range of a madman to a kindly sympathetic force of nature. Nicholson is hilarious and maddeningly entertaining. His choices as Randle McMurphy for each face, voice, and posture are all immaculate. He drives home the movie's sentiment that many of the mad are simply misunderstood and not cared for by those in mental hospitals.\n\nThis film has perhaps the greatest supporting cast of any movie. Namely, Louise Fletcher is unimaginably cruel as Head Nurse Ratched. Her belief that she is right and helping is what makes her so scary. Fletcher's performance features biting words and piercing looks that chill you to the bone.\n\nWilliam Redfield is funny as the stuffy and pathetic coward Harding. Will Sampson is brilliant as the apparent mute and deaf Chief Bromden. His massive stature and quiet persona are memorable enough, but his knowing looks and character development are unforgettable. His chemistry with Nicholson is very sweet and touching too.\n\nFurthermore, Danny DeVito is fun as the simple Martini. Nicholson repeating phrases to DeVito's delight is just splendid to watch. Christopher Lloyd is shocking and angry as the constantly enraged Taber. His wide open eyes tell it all.\n\nThen, Brad Dourif is magnificent as the stuttering shy boy named Billy Bibbit. As charming and delirious as Jack Nicholson is, I think Brad Dourif is the most relatable character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is a dramatic weight that presents serious consequences to the events that unfold within the movie. You just feel terrible for Billy thanks to Dourif's tender display of acting.\n\nNotably, Michael Berryman makes an appearance as a silent deformed man named Ellis in a vegetative state that is neat to see him here. Scatman Crothers makes a cameo role as the night watchman Turkle that succumbs to temptation and gives a fierce performance once his job is in jeopardy. It is cool to see Crothers act alongside Jack Nicholson before they appear together in Stanley Kubrick's horror film The Shining.\n\nI also liked Vincent Schiavelli as the quietly mad Frederickson. Lastly, I must commend that endearing and troubled Charlie Cheswick played by the powerhouse actor Sydney Lassick.\n\nEveryone shows up with their best for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Certainly Forman's finest film and one for the ages.",

Cuckoo, while very good, doesn\u2019t age well. Like most anti establishment films, time teaches us, and hindsight takes a toll. How juvenile and 70\u2019s is it to cheer on taking emotionally and mentally fragile men with real problems out to watch you womanize, and setting up the most vulnerable one to get laid? Its adolescent as well as misogynistic. Like thats SO transformative and therapeutic and cool. There is a lot of male college freshman sex humor here, passed off as social statement. Women have no role here other than horrible ballbuster or bimbos used for sex. A good case can be made for this film representing rage at strong women.

            "content": "\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is a wonderful adaptation that sparks so many emotions, even if the novel's author refuses to acknowledge its existence. \n\nFirst, I want to talk about a particular scene - which might actually be one of my favorites. Toward the end of the film when McMurphy was about to escape, he stopped for a moment. He took a moment to say goodbye to all of the people that he's come to know and care for. There was one in particular, Billy, who seemed awfully beat up about it. When McMurphy went to go talk to him, he realized that Billy was really falling for Candy. When McMurphy had a choice between escaping with ease or staying back to support a friend, he chose the latter. Billy got his time with Candy at the expense of McMurphy's freedom. He did this because he cared for Billy and everyone else there. In my eyes, it was a selfless decision and an easy one for McMurphy to make. While it didn't end the best for either, it was something admirable. After doing research, this scene, apparently, is very similar to how it played out in the book. In the book, McMurphy sacrificed his freedom to give Billy some time with Candy, and the end result of all of that was the same. I love how they kept that major moment true to the both versions of the story, because I think it was a real powerful moment. \n\nIn terms of the structure, I really thought the movie flowed well. I understand that Ken Kesey refused to watch the film because of the major change in POV but in my humble opinion, I think that's arrogance. Books V. Movies are two entirely different mediums of art. You can't really write a book in the same way you would film a movie, and vice versa. I felt like it would've been difficult to tell the story from Chief's perspective in the film, especially if it was through voiceover. I thought the film had this wonderful arc and main protagonist in McMurphy, who was full of personality and ambition. I felt like seeing it through the eyes of McMurphy created this environment and this tone where the men could all come together as a family. McMurphy is the reason they bonded so much more, and I felt that his POV was the most complex / interesting route they could've used for this film.\n \nIn terms of time, I felt like the film moved within a straight-forward, linear time frame. I don't know the exact time frame that everything happened, but I felt like it couldn't be too long. It didn't seem like it could've been more than 1 month at the most. However, I do think they made the most out of their limited environment. If you think about it, almost the whole story took place in that psych-ward, and it stayed in the same general room. We rarely got outside of that (except for the playground and the boat) but it felt like we were constantly learning more and more about the environment. I never felt bored because we were constantly moving around and exploring new aspects of that place. McMurphy is a big reason why everything felt like it was constantly moving with excitement. \n\nI think the unity of opposites is a theme we could apply here. McMurphy is so unlike every other patient here. In that, he's also unlike Nurse Ratched. His optimistic personality was contagious, and he differed so much from everyone else in the film. I think his extreme personality was so opposite of everyone else's, but it all mixed together really well. For example, toward the end of the film, his relationship with Chief, who was a silent yet observant man, grew into something amazing. These two essentially became best friends, where McMurphy had Chief's back and Chief had his. Their personalities were opposite but, in the end, they came together. McMurphy changed Chief's life for the better and you can see the impact he had on him. I think that makes the ending especially heartbreaking, when Chief was the one who has to put down McMurphy. McMurphy was someone that throughout the film, nothing could take him down. He was a tough, strong-willed individual who didn't let even the slightest things knock him down. You really didn't know if he was crazy or not. But to see him somber and lifeless toward the end was kind of heartbreaking. For Chief, he had to commit a pity kill. He saw someone, who was his best friend, lose everything that made him, him. It's followed up with Chief running and escaping through the nighttime, doing something that McMurphy never got to do. I think that the unity of opposites worked brilliantly in this film and it was something that really stood out to me. \n\nIn the end, I really enjoyed this film. I felt like everything really came together. The characters were so well-rounded and had so much dimension to them, especially McMurphy. I think the location was used to its maximum potential given how small of a space it really was. I also felt like McMurphy's objective was clear in his want to care for his fellow patients. The entire film really came together and told a great story.",

            "content": "In my adolescence, this was unquestionably my favorite and most personally formative film, its themes of nonconformity, antiauthority, struggle and risk striking a deep chord with me. At some point, after reading the novel, I even performed the play as Mac, though I really was just doing my best Nicholson impression (and not a great one at that). While other movies-especially the aesthetically more avant-garde, those that do formally what this cries for textually-have today become new favorites, Forman's brilliant (and only second Hollywood-made) film still makes an impact on me.\n\nThose thematic overtones of the film are still razor sharp, clear as day, yet inevitably challenging to a perpetually stifling status quo. Forman's deft ability to mix the comedic and the tragic, the bureaucratic and the chaotic-an obvious extension of his antiauthoritarian early works of the Czech new wave, though here more refined-finds its perfect setting in a claustrophobic mental asylum. What happens when the inmates take over an already infuriatingly mad system? Who gets to define \"crazy\"-those who ostensibly *are* or those who are charged with curing the \"illness\"? In an institution where the doctors have no more claim to knowing than the patients, where the experts are as vegetable-like and dead-to-life as the most failed of cases, the lobotomized, what constitutes a cure whatsoever? Who of these people, the outcasts and the weirdos and the chronics, even need to be cured?\n\nHaving now immersed myself in Freud and Lacan in a professional setting, I am now particularly struck by the role reversal between Mac and Ratched. For all her awful efforts, it is Mac who achieves the only breakthroughs in the film-Chief breaking out of his statuesque silence and breaking out of the building, Billy briefly overcoming his stutter, the others learning to stand up for themselves, if only for a moment-while Ratched, in all cases but the Chief's, immediately shuts such breakthroughs down again in order to maintain order. Because for Ratched and her ratchet system, *order* means the functioning of \"giving orders.\" Because \"order\" here works not to establish a routine that facilitates a cure, but in fact prevents it-in the need to maintain the status quo, I am reminded of that quote attributed to Einstein: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results.\"",

Despite any illusions you may have during the first half of the film, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is the polar opposite of a fun movie. It goes from uplifting to horrific in an instant, and the unhinged performances and great script meant that for the whole film I honestly had no idea what was going to happen. It's a really interesting and thought-provoking look at mental health and its treatment in the '70s that is just as relevant if not more so today; especially with mental health issues on the incline worldwide. In many ways, the most disturbing aspect of the film is the mindset of the doctors and nurses. They don't see their patients for who they are as individuals, but rather group them all under the rather vague title of 'mentally ill'.\n\nOn the back of the Blu-Ray here in the UK, it says it's rated 18 for \"emotionally intense scenes\", which I thought was a little silly before I watched the movie. Having seen it however, I think that's a fair warning. Some scenes, especially towards the end, really are quite harrowing. It's a hard movie to rate just because of how upsetting it can be. However - especially with time - I get the distinct feeling this will grow on me even more as I come to fully appreciate it. A very powerful movie with an important message to tell.",

It was very confusing trying to put the parts of the books and the movie together and how the characters matched up to the actors playing the characters in the movie. I thought that the Director Milos Forman did a good job selecting the actors to play the parts but horrible scripted writers. I know that the movie needed to be around two hours long but there is a lot of the parts that are good that were left out and changed. Lets go to the part where the fishing trip accord. The scripted writers thought it was they stole the bus but in the book the doctor and another person went with along on the trip. There is a lot of parts that I could mention but I would recommend reading the book and see for yourself. It didn't follow the book really closely events that were key in the book and there left out of the book.

The movie is much faster pace than the book and much of it is cut out or altered for time. I personally didn't like the acting in the movie and think many of the characters did not match the descriptions given by the book.

McMurphy because in the book he was described as a huge redhead that looked very manly however he didn't. Chief was pinpoint accurate on the way they described him and same with the nurses and patients. This movie reminds me of the Green Mile because the man in the movie has nothing wrong with him but yet they still think that he needs to be killed. Also the Chief and McMurphy also have nothing wrong with them but the institution still believes they need to be in there since there apparently \"insane\". In the movie the emotions that came to me and caused a sad scene would have to be the fact when the nurse pushes Billy Bibbit over the edge and he makes a mistake because he was afraid of his mother finding out. So in conclusion the Movie One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest is a movie you should definitely watch since it shows how people who were in institutions had to go through.",

In this category, I give the movie four stars because the movie did follow the same plot and the characters generally have the right personality and role. However, the movie did skip some events that occured in the book that I would have liked to have seen in the movie. For example, I was disappointed that the narrator of the book, Chief Bromden, was absent in several major events in the movie. Although the events of the movie do play a vital role in its quality, the underlying emotion that the audience feels during the event is also important. The second criterion I used was how well the movie developed an emotional connection between the audience and characters. In this category, I give the movie two-and-a-half stars. The book goes into detail to describe several scenes from Chief Bromden's past and to explain the reasons that several of the patients are at the hospital, but the movie almost completely excludes all of these allusions into the patients' lives. This leaves the audience with an almost apathetic feeling toward the characters and the outcome of the plot. Another element of the movie that plays a major role in the audience's emotional experience is the music and noise overlying the events. The third criterion that I used was the effectiveness of the soundtrack. In this category, I give the movie two-and-a-half stars. The soundtrack did not enhance the emotional experience of the movie at all. The majority of the soundtrack did not make sense. Many of the scenes were accompanied by music that did not match its emotional content or that was strange and confusing because it did not clearly convey an emotion at all. Most of the soundtrack served as a distraction because of its lack of compatibility with the visual events of the movie. \n\nI determined the overall movie rating by averaging the ratings from all 3 criteria. Therefore my overall rating for the movie, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" directed by Milos Forman, is three out of five stars based on my ratings of how well the movie followed the book, the emotional connection between the audience and the characters, and the soundtrack of the movie.",

However, I did not like how the movie did not follow the book, written by Ken Kesey.

            "content": "Directed by Milos Forman and is about Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who gets transferred to a mental institution, the mental institution is ran by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who tortures her patients and so the high spirited Randall is forced to stay in a very closed-minded hospital. Jack Nicholson gives an outstanding and charismatic performance as R.P. McMurphy and really sells the role extremely well and Louise Fletcher does a terrific job and so does everyone else in the film. Mental illness is shown in a very realistic way and it doesn't sugarcoat any of it. \"Power\" is a pretty big subject in the film, Nurse Ratched is very power hungry, Randall views the patients as powerless, when Randall was fighting one of the guards Chief viewed him as powerless so thats why chief came in and tried to help him, it is something that occurs a lot. From the beginning shot it shows nature with Native American like music playing, in my opinion the music symbolizes the patients with what sounds like someone crying. At the end of the film the music plays again also showing another shot of nature but in a less crying and in a more uplifting tone to show that the patients are not suffering as much now that Chief has broken the window and escaped free. The classical style music the nurses play I think symbolizes power as it powers over the patients which forces them to shout. R.P. McMurphy gives the patients joy as the film progresses and he cares for the people around him for example when Billie committed suicide he could have just left and went off to Canada but he decided to stay and choke Nurse Ratched. On my first viewing I thought Nurse Ratched wasn't a bad person but just someone doing her job but as I watched it again I am convinced she is a bad person who pressures her patients. I loved Chief's character development throughout the film, at first he starts out as someone who decides to not speak and pretends to be deaf and he still did (except in front of Randall McMurphy) but as the movie goes on he gains courage from Randall and he gains the courage to escape and utilize his strength which was his strong muscles, the first time he utilizes one of his strengths (which was his height) was in the basketball game. The scene where the supervisor comes in and the patients and Turtle hide is an extremely funny scene but I also felt anxious in the same time thinking if they were to get caught. one of the themes I got from this film was that people with mental illness are not dumb and can think for themselves. This is a film I highly recommend, the film is great in both emotionally and aesthetically and if you haven't checked it out you should.\n\n(btw I haven't read the book but I will in my senior year of high school so wish me luck)",

Films today just don't have that sense of story and character, it's more visual narrative and overacting. There's no overacting here, every performance is understated in their own unique way. Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is cool, calm and collected and yet her mannerisms exude terror. Her authoritative figure and soft spoken voice just adds to this, so much so that the patients in the state mental hospital are petrified of her. Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is just a common criminal who to start with plays along with the other patients. However, upon the realisation that he may not ever get out...he starts to find ways in order to escape. I found his performance captivating and clearly he is great and portraying crazy people, just look at The Shining. He is able to control the smaller scenes with his charisma and own the bigger crazier scenes with his excitable energy. His raucous behaviour puts the other patients at risk of certain procedures such as the controversial electro therapy. What really compelled me was the similarities between the mental patients and the outside world, to which McMurphy says that there is no difference. The screenplay for that scene, well every scene actually, brings life to each character. From the first 30 minutes, every character's personality and state of mind is indicated to us. There are no boring characters, each of them have unique qualities and that is something you don't see in every film. Loved the fishing boat scene, adored Chief's and McMurphy's friendship and appreciated the time and effort spent on character interactions. The way they talk to each other in the therapy sessions just felt natural, and to balance the screen time between them all was just genius. You just don't get films like these anymore.",

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson). He begins the film as a prisoner sent for 'evaluation' of his mental health.

Although Mac was not successful in his attempt to escape, his real success was teaching those men that they should not be ashamed of who they are and how they should lead their lives. The lasting quote that I will remember is from Mac, talking to the group. \"What do you think you are, for Chrissake, crazy or somethin'? Well you're not! You're not! You're no crazier than the average asshole out walkin' around on the streets and that's it.\"  Mac's inspiration towards the other inmates will leave a lasting impression on them, and the lesson I learned from this movie, is everyone is a little crazy. But who cares? No one is even perfect so why not have a little fun? Be a little crazy! I think Mac's motto in life was to live life fun, rather than to die being boring.",

I loved watching how McMurphy's carefree attitude influenced all the other patients. His joy for life was infectious and you could see it as everyone started to become stronger and stood up for themselves. Jack Nicholson was brilliant in the part, and everyone else in the star-studded cast was simply amazing as well. It's a tough movie to watch, though, because everything keeps going wrong. Whenever we are given a slight ray of hope it comes crashing down. And that's a cycle that continues over and over again throughout the film, to the point of annoying repetition. I also found it odd, after all I heard about this film, how mild Nurse Ratched seemed. She certainly manipulates the patients unfairly and is the driving force behind many of McMurphy's problems, but it never felt like she was approaching her care of the patients with wholly malicious intent as I was expecting (perhaps there was more in the book.) I thought the lack of score through most of the film was an interesting choice. It begins and ends with an off-putting tune (played on a saw if I'm not mistaken) but otherwise they just let the dialogue take center stage. This does help, though, to accentuate when the tedious classical music is being played over the PA system and makes it sound just as annoying to our ears as it did to McMurphy. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a heavy film that takes a tough look at what drives the human spirit, and what can crush it as well. The ending is simultaneously depressing and hopeful which is a real challenge. I can absolutely see why this is a beloved story, and I would gladly watch it again (my opinion might go up if I do) but for now some of its flaws just stood out to me too much, perhaps because I was expecting perfection based on all the positive buzz.",

Going against her and the system McMurphy goes around showing the men all kinds of fun and that there is a world out there that they need to take advantage of and not let a mean old woman keep you down.

She also gives off great presence, one that would scare even the toughest of men. Fletcher does a terrific job as this and her demeanor is so cold and convincing as well. brad dourif also does a terrific job here. very deserving of the the golden globe he won in 1976.\nThis film had excellent directing from Milos Forman. As I have alluded to he creates a universal situation in a place where its hard to get your voice heard because of already pre determined judgments. This film also shows true brotherhood  and solidarity among such unique men. Fascinating dialogue written in this script. nicely edited. That electroshock therapy looked brutal. that and a few other moments make the film really intense. sad ending too. \nOverall this film is phenomenal and worth watching anytime its on yo television.",

            "content": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 American comedy-drama, directed by Milos Forman, and is based on a novel written by Ken Kesey in 1962. It focuses on models of oppression and tyranny being a threat to freedom and the importance of the individual. The film is very conscious of what it is trying to achieve and Forman uses many interesting cinematic techniques to portray the themes, primarily the use of camera angles. It brilliantly portrays the 'other', hidden side of human nature and allows the audience to either emphasise with the struggles of the characters or to gain a better understanding of what patients in mental health facilities face. It's main goal was to reflect on current society's role in systematic oppression of the mentally ill in institutions and society in general.\n \tThe story revolves around Randle McMurphy, an anti-authoritarian criminal who had been sent to a prison for statutory rape, but instead gets himself moved to a psychiatric institution for evaluation by pretending to be insane as he believes he can avoid hard labour this way. He meets other patients, ranging from the stuttering Billy Bibbit, to an apparently deaf and mute Native American, 'Chief' Bromden and quickly establishes himself as the leader. He immediately clashes with Nurse Ratched, the inflexible nurse who is unpleasantly emasculating and domineering and runs the ward in a totalitarian manner and uses unpleasant methods to keep control of her domain. McMurphy undermines her power, whilst at the same time, encouraging the patients that they are 'not nuts', to the point where they too recognise Ratched's authoritarian rule and begin to resist. By the end, McMurphy's hijinks cause him to be taken in for a lobotomy - meaning he is effectively dead. Bromden smothers McMurphy with a pillow and carries out the original escape plan, and in doing so, keeps McMurphy's spirit alive. \n \tOne reason this movie is so intriguing is because it emphasises the depressing reality of environments such as mental institutions. It is easy for cinema nowadays to have a brave hero that fights the system and emerges victorious, whilst encouraging other people along the way, but it is far harder to witness the way that real people behave in such environments. However, this film is more about the forced conformity of individuals in an oppressive system. This is shown primarily in the contrasting characters of Nurse Ratched and McMurphy. Ratched is the embodiment of an obstacle to personal freedom; she threatens the patients' physical and mental freedom to facilitate authoritativeness. Her use in the film is to define the borders of power, so McMurphy can be the reflection. The institutions categorise patients to be able to treat them, but it quickly becomes clear that the system is used for control and punishment, especially the group meetings. Ratched uses the group meetings to constantly force the patients to confront their problems and pits the men against each other. The regular enforced schedule means that Ratched has complete control over everyone and this means their individuality has been removed. Ratched's stiff, immobile facial expressions are the total opposite of McMurphy, who from the very beginning breathes life into the dreariness of the institute. He honours the sacredness of individuals, such as by talking to Chief even though he is supposedly deaf and mute. Although he is portrayed as morally ambiguous, he is willing to do all to give the confined men a chance at freedom. By encouraging Billy to have his first sexual encounter, he knowingly sacrifices his own freedom and ultimately pays the price for that. \n \tThe film is shot in such a way that the faces of the characters, and therefore their emotions, are highly accentuated, this creates a realistic effect for the audience as they can clearly visualise the consequence of the events. It also creates tension in the scenes as the camera focuses on eyes and mouths; this accentuates the humanity of the characters. Forman uses a real mental facility and natural lighting to show to the audience that the characters are not that different from themselves. He continuously juxtaposes this with shots of signifiers of containments, such as bars and locked doors, which both stresses the captive nature of the inhabitants and doesn't let the audience forget the truth of what is being shown.  The choppy, moving style of the camera allows for multiple views of each scene, and doesn't bias the viewer to a particular character. The camera angles also create a claustrophobic feel with the images of monotonous, pristine white walls and tiled floors, where the patients almost blend into their surroundings is very drab and symbolises the mental state of the patients and the compassionless system they are held in. In the group therapy scenes, Formen increases the tension as the camera moves from face to face, and shows different perspectives to Ratched's painfully pointed questions. Contrastingly, when the camera lingers on a character's face, like when McMurphy sits by an open window after he sends Billy to Candy, highlights important moments. In that scene, McMurphy has realised that in allowing Billy to experience freedom, he is sacrificing his own freedom. The open window being a direct symbol of his almost freedom, and the camera remains on his face as he closes his eyes as a sign of his acceptance. \n \tThe film has a rather basic approach to the portrayal of mental illness, presenting it as a choice that can easily be 'fixed' by sheer willpower. One of the problematic scenes in the film is when McMurphy takes the other patients on a fishing trip on a stolen boat. He then, in a twist of irony, introduces them as doctors when questioned. But at this point, the camera zooming into each face shows their true confusion, their blind trust in McMurphy has forced them into an unknown situation - which McMurphy clearly did not consider. They clearly don't understand fully what is happening to them and they don't belong there - but their expressions can easily be misinterpreted with the context given by McMurphy. This is also indicative of our own society which parades the mentally ill around and uses them for their own gain, while ignoring their needs. It is also unfair to the audience because the characters have come to be understood in the context of the hospital ward, so to break the careful characterisation for an idealised, fantastical action scene, is a real injustice to the movie and to message that it is trying to represent.\n \tThe audience realises that although Ratched does not believe that McMurphy is insane, she must act like it to be able to exert control over him .The irrationality of the system is compounded when the audience realises that only a sane man can, and would, question the authenticity of such a broken system, but the very act of questioning causes his own sanity to called into question. This seems to defeat the purpose of a system that is meant to be curing people, to the point where it seems insane in itself. The humanising nature of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest brings attention to the failings of our own institutes and the very real problem of forced conformity. This audience awareness allows for a possibility of change in the future to better our clearly broken establishments so that we may too avoid this extent of systemic oppression.",

It's a deeply unpleasant film in many ways but there's a lightness and spirit to it that Nicholson perfectly encapsulates. A true classic.\n\nWith a story as powerful and compelling as this one, it is difficult to go wrong. Its drab and dreary setting is filled with interesting and unique characters and there's so much depth and complexity behind the curtains of what is really a quite simple story line. \n\nThe richness of the source material just forces its way through- the film is subtle as it simply tells a story and slowly lets the message become stronger and stronger until it unavoidably hits home. The dramatic lows of this film are never cheap and the emotion that you feel is never unearned. This film wins you over with its strongest element for me being its villain- Nurse Ratched. Never has another character been as effective at making me as angry as she does.  \n\nThe calmness which exists throughout much of the film does begin to limit it though as it can feel rather slow. Its story is fairly simplistic and you might find yourself having to look for the deeper context yourself at times as it isn't always as pressing as it could be. Again, I think there is a subtlety there that I enjoy but I think this one could still have been a bit more rambunctious at times. There is something quaint about it now that doesn't quite live up to the reputation that it has gained. \n\nI always think of this as a somewhat PG-rated 'A Clockwork Orange'- it doesn't have all of the same on-screen wallop, but its heart is just as dark and fathomless.",

            "content": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book with a pretty accurate movie except some key factors that would've made the movie far better and compare to the book even more. The book and movie kind of paste this humorous and yet disturbing view of mental institutions while at the same time saying something about society in general. It does so in an entertaining and attention grabbing way that keeps you reading or watching. \n\tThe movie had many missing parts from the book that are critical to really understanding what's going on. They removed a lot of Mcmurphy's triumph over Nurse Ratched such as the part where he was in the towel and she lost her cool. This was a huge part in the book because that was when he finally got her to snap, but the movie skipped out on that big critical moment for Mcmurphy and his influence growing on the other patients in the ward. They also skipped out on the part where Mcmurphy \"cleaned\" the bathrooms and pranked the nurse while doing so then later. They never really showed him start to straighten up after he learned he was committed and instead just brought it up in the meeting and was outraged and broke out. \n\tThey changed some scenes to be way more dramatic than how there were in the book. When the patients were demanding their cigarettes from the nurse there was a much more dramatic ruckus in the movie than in the book such as Mcmurphy punching the glass and one of the Black boys and him, Chief, and Cheswick to disturbed for shock therapy. The scene where Pete lashed out when he was tired and shoved the short black boy into a wall was watered down into him just standing and saying he's tired and then escorted to the beds is another example of how things were changed in the movie.\n\tSome of the characters didn't fit their roles. Mcmurphy was described in the book as tall, muscular and well built, rugged with a scar on his face, weighed two hundred and ten pounds, and wore a dirty hat and jeans with work boots; in the movie the actor was way too short and didn't have the build for the role at all and they gave him a beanie that looked like it was bought yesterday with slick clean street clothes. None of the dust and ruggedness that the book describes which would have been easy to project into real life. All of Mcmurphy's description could have been easily fit with a different actor. The black boys in the book were portrayed as varying in size and kind of cowardly, but in the movie they played more of a tough policing role and did not vary in size. While I understand fitting the bill of the black boys in the book could be troublesome or challenging I still think it is very possible just like McMurphy's character. The actor who played Chief however and Cheswick fit perfectly with their role and I was very satisfied with the choices they chose for them in the movie. \n\tOver all though they did a great job turning the book into a movie, but I say the book is far better do it having more build up and it made a lot more sense do to the fact that it described things a lot better than the movie did and took its time doing so throughout the book. Obviously a movie is constricted to a time limit, but the least they could of done is make the main character McMurphy fit the appearance of the book and included more scenes of McMurphy's early triumphs over Nurse Ratched.",

McMurphy proceeds to instigate group insurrections large and small, ranging from a restorative basketball game to an unfettered afternoon boat trip and a tragic after-hours party with hookers and booze.

Despite there being plenty of arguments that it was necessary to make McMurphy the focal character from a practical plot standpoint, depleting Chief Bromden of depth made the ending, the exact same as the book, carry less weight. Likewise, the faster pacing took away from the drawn out conflict between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched and made their final, climatic conflict carry less weight. However, when not comparing the movie to the novel, it is impossible not to marvel at Nicholson's masterful performance and the rest of the cast's convincing take at being ward patients. It's those performances that lift the movie adaptation and help make up for much of the thematic impact that was lost with changes to the plot, and it's what helps make \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" a must-see movie.",

The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.\n\nMany films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.\n\nThe movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.\n\nIn conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film.",

            "content": "Based on the brilliant Ken Kessey novel of the same name ( http://www.amazon.com/Flew-Over-Cuckoos-Nest-Signet/dp/0451163966 ) One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest is directed by Milos Forman and stars Jack Nicholson as Randle P.McMurphy, a convict who fakes insanity for what he suspects will be a cushier life in a sanitorium.\n\nThe book differs from the movie in an ingenious way by describing the events and action from the point of view, and language, of patient Native American Chief Bromden who pretends to be deaf and dumb. If you haven't read the book, read it now because it is unputdownable. Tom Wolfe was so impressed he wrote a documentary book about Ken Kessey called \"The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test\" ( http://www.amazon.com/The-Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test/dp/031242759X ) which chronicles Ken Kessey's adventures with the 'Merry Pranksters' as they called themselves, and advocacy of, and experimentation with, LSD.\n\nAnother brilliant book, in which Ken Kessey comes across as a thoughtful and larger-than-life character a bit like his central character Randall P. McMurphy. I would call it a story of redemption but that makes it sound trite and contrived which it isn't and without giving the ending away Randall McMurphy certainly doesn't live \"happily ever after\" at the end, in a way. ( Friends who have seen the movie will get that little 'in a way'! Hehehe...) It's all about a mad house, So why do I love it?\n\nMcMurphy is the wise-cracking con-artist guy every guy has a mental image of as themselves, including Principals I suspect. You know that, 'I don't take no s**t from nobody' kind of guy. Like my podcasting hero, Doug Stanhope! I would love to be like that. Any retired man who pretends that having reached that pinnacle of life he has reached contentment with himself is a liar. Unless perhaps the Dalai Lama. I feel like I know less than when I started!\n\nMcMurphy is your hero rebel. Nurse Ratched is the 'Establishment'. Put them both together and what have you got? The sixties! Their conflict is entertaining because McMurphy keeps on coming with hilarious ways to get around the rules like a recividist child. I love watching him take on \"the system\". Maybe it's the rebel in me. I maintain that it is simply impossible for any student to ever be more rebellious than a Principal. We just do it differenly!\n\nYou will also love the eccentricities of the supporting characters and their own happy and not-so-happy fates.\n\nYou have to remember this is a drama and so dependent on the interplay of speech rather than fists, sex or fast cars. When I was a kid I watched it and got absolutely nothing from it and was bored to tears. Now it is my number one most paranoid movie of all time. You can't say better than that!\n\n- See more at: http://www.principalegg.com/reviews/review-of-the-top-10-most-paranoid-movies-of-all-time",

The story of a sane man playing crazy and then trying to make the other patients sane while making the nurses crazy, it just has to be seen to be believed. The story is interesting and kinda heartbreaking in the end, (note to self, never fall asleep during an escape attempt, bad things will happen) and it has a great young cast that has gone on to do some great things with Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif  all turning in terrific performances. And yeah, Nurse Ratched is just plain evil.  Now excuse me while I rip a sink out of the ground and throw it through a window, I have places to go.\n5 Beards Out Of 5",

Everything seem to be going as he planed but once he arrives to the mental institution until he meets the unyielding Head Nurse Ratched, who makes Randall change his objective to liberating all the inmates from his tyranny. \nThe 70\u00b4s was a decade that provide numerous classics but still \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is widely consider to be one of the best films of said decade and trust me when I say it's not for nothing. Milos Forman created a film that literally has everything: Incredible acting by all the cast (I mean, it's no easy task to portray a mentally ill character but the actors that were given this cast fulfill it perfectly) with the best being Nicholson delivering his best performance to date as a free spirited, likeable, memorable and charismatic man, and Fletcher creating an unforgettable villainess; the supporting characters are loveable and memorable (my favorite being Christopher Lloyd), gorgeous cinematography that perfectly captures the isolated feel of being inside the mental institution, a beautiful score that enhance the narrative, Forman\u00b4s directing is precise and perfectionist, it has a perfect pacing, perfect doses of lighthearted and actually funny comedy, a well written screen play that adapts perfectly the source material, intriguing character relationships, especially the \"chemistry\" between McMurphy and Ratched; well handled themes that everyone can connect to, it transitions from a loveable drama to suspense vibe in a natural way, it manages to touch your heartstrings with using cheap tricks, and finally, but not less important,  it has one of the most beautiful, simple and memorable stories I\u00b4ve seen on the silver screen that will make you feel a variety of emotions (sadness, depression, happiness, inspired and cheerful) that culminate on a perfectly executed bittersweet ending.  \n \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u00b4s Nest\" is one of those films that are close to perfection, it deserves all the acclaim it has received since its release, I mean, not every film can stand the test of time and still have the same power it had on its release. One of my all time favorite films (quoting Chief, this film makes me \"feel big as a damn mountain\") and a must see for any lover of the seventh art.",

The other team of cast members, who portray the inmates of the asylum depicted in the story also deliver superb performances so there's no singling out anyone for maximum praise. Though Nicholson is the show stealer. \nIt's quite an interesting cast that leaves curiosity as there's a lot of familiar faces that have been seen in well known movies in later years - like Vincent Schiavelli who appeared in 1990s movies: Ghost, Batman Returns and Tomorrow Never Dies; Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future trilogy; Danny Devito from Batman Returns; and Brad Dourif from Child's Play and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. \nIt was great to wintness these familiar faces all in the same movie and as they were younger at the time as the movie was released in 1975.\n\nThe five Oscar wins received by this movie our well deserved, as well are the nominations for the other categories it lost out on. Nicholson has never acted better nor has he  been directed in such a well produced movie in such an iconic way before. At the moment I think it's the performance of his career.\nAs well as that the direction of Milo Forman was excellent and he successfully brings out the realism of the madness within the asylum to best possible extent for a movie of its time. \nThe screenplay was fantastically written by Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben, which is undoubtedly one of the best screenplays ever written for a motion picture and one of the best unforgettable ones of the 1970s. \nAs the movie proceeds towards the end a heartfelt performance is delivered by Brad Dourif, who portrays probably the youngest inmate whom has speech problems, and the way Dourif managed to pull that off was excellent. \n\nThere's really not enough credit to offer this movie as it's one of the greatest movies ever made and one of the most emotional ones that anyone can relate to.",

With\nclashes between characters and the stories delve into the mind of\nmental patients, the film succeeds in bringing a sweet story with also\na dramatic one, even a little humour seasoned in as well. Overall I did\nhave a hard time giving this it's score but in the end I felt this was\nsolidly a sublime film, and here below is why I felt that way.\n\nThe story is pretty neat, kind of different I felt from many other\nOscar winners in the sense that the characters are not dark people and\nthe movie is never scared of being funny quite a bit. It is fascinating\nto watch too, just to see such a rich storyline play out in front of\nyou, you realise why this film makes many of the best films of all time\nlists. One other thing I loved about it was that it is also so smartly\ndone, it's lead character brings the story smart lines and also brings\nthe best out in the other characters, just sensational stuff.\n\nJack Nicholson is superb in this, completely crazy yet funny, dark yet\nexcitable, he just brings a wealth of expertise to the movie and his\ncharacter is one I shall remember for a long time to come in cinema\nhistory. Louise Fletcher is great too, she is very calm, and I mean\nVERY calm yet the way she portrays it just makes it so great to see and\nher chemistry with Nicholson is movie gold. Look out for Danny DeVito\nand Christopher Lloyd among others, truly bringing even more quality to\nthe already high quality film.\n\nMilos Forman directs well in truth, I did feel that altogether\nNicholson among others steal the show and you kind of forget about the\ndirecting involved, but looking back it is done to a good standard. I\nenjoyed the script as well, as said before it contains humour, and that\nmeans the film is never too serious or something that is always dark,\nit has a few sweet spots in it. Even the score for the film is\nhaunting, yet it is also very dreamy and really works well to say it is\nin a mental hospital with patients constantly taking drugs to help\nthem, score goes with it excellently. \n\nSo hard to find much wrong with it, but the reason I don't think this\nis a perfect film is mostly down to the last maybe quarter of the\nmovie, it just slows down a lot and although not bad stuff, the quality\nwe are used to at the beginning affects it's slightly less good end(the\nactual end of the film is fantastic though). I could say that not all\nthe actors are great but well we can't expect everything, to be fair to\nthem Nicholson and Fletcher get most scenes and dialogue so it isn't\nthere fault.\n\nIf you like a classic piece of cinema, go watch it, this epitomises\nlegendary plot lines and characters and serves as a real way to do\nmovies. If your looking for Oscar films, again this is probably for\nyou, this has to be one of the best Oscar winning films around and\ntrust me, some people may find this their favourite film of all time.\nFor Nicholson fans, well where else to start or end than with possibly\nhis best performance, he rules this film and stays with you way past\nthe 2 hours this film lasts, just great really.\n\nOverall I give this a high 9/10, it is Solidly a Sublime film as said, I will\nadd I nearly gave the a Perfect mark showing just how amazing this\nmovie really is. This film is always worth a watch if your compiling\nthe best movies of all times, truly is one the best and the\nperformances are also some of the best. Another good thing this movie\ndoes is not to make mental disease seem just stupid and silly, they\nactually have hearts the characters and can be very nice at times, very\ngreat to see such things happening.",

Each character has their own personalities and the camera will often linger on their facial features to give you a sense of the emotions going through them. The patients come across as such nice people, that you find yourself rooting for them, even when they break the rules.\nNaturally the script only creates half the characters. The other half is brought to life by the actors cast in the roles. As one of his more familiar characters, Jack Nicholson is such fun to watch and really entertains you in every scene he features in. There are also some welcomes additions to the supporting characters with Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito popping up in early film roles. However, the shining star in my opinion is Brad Dourif. His performance for his debut role is fantastic and really deserves the Oscar nomination he received.\nJumping straight into the story without any worry of waiting for it to build up, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a fantastic movie thanks to the well written script and choice of actors.",

            "content": "The era of the 1960's brought forth a change of ethics with the civil rights movement for African Americans, Homosexuals etc. Yet an issue that was hardly glanced upon was the cultural wars between sanity and insanity, that is displayed brilliantly through Milos Forman's, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", which is darkly comical, extraordinarily well written and just an incredibly pleasurable viewing experience. In 1976 the film took home several Oscar's including, best picture, best directing, best actor, best actress and best adapted screenplay, all of these accolades culminated into the overall best film of that year. Upon reaching new decades and even new millennia, Forman's masterpiece always remained predominant in film history, hardly a small task to accomplish yet there was just something about the film that critics and audiences alike just couldn't forget. Was it the acting, writing, directing, story, score or cinematography? The answer, all of the above, for Milos Forman's, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", is the rare culmination of every aspect that makes a film great, actually come together into a nearly flawless package. First and for most Forman's visual style never tumultuously overpowers the frame with meaningless imagery instead opting for intense close shots of his characters that are able to brilliantly capture the tone of the scene and the emotional state of the characters in the frame with a subtle shift in framing or musical queues opting tonal shifts. Maintaining a setting that is as monotonous as a white mental hospital may seem like a visual challenge to be able to keep interesting without cluttering the frame, which Forman accomplishes with ease; because of fantastic framing blocking and lighting Milos Forman's direction is impeccably solid for the subject matter of the film. Only several tracks within the film truly stick with you, that being the ending theme and beginning theme, yet other than those two pieces the score is simple too taciturn to leaving any lasting impact on the viewer, however, the score is not what makes drama so much as it makes a blockbuster due to the emphasis on presentation. Easily the best part of the film is the brilliantly adapted screenplay written by Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben, which is a large contribution the films heart and soul. Along with the actors improvisation the screenplay delivers hysterically funny moments in one scene and emotionally poignant moments in other scenes; overall a fantastic script. Finally the performances of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are what make the film truly unforgettable. Every single character has a personality quark that makes them distinguishable from each other and not to mention memorable. Yet it is the academy award winning performances of Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher that are unforgettably profound on their lasting impact on the audience as well as the wonderful charisma the two actors bring; overall fantastic acting. A recurring phrase with this film is \"unforgettable \"which perfectly personifies the experience of viewing it for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a fantastically unforgettable film.",

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not only Milo Forman's masterpiece, but it is also Jack Nicholson's masterpiece. Even though they have both made great movies afterwards, nothing could compare to how great this film was, and how great they were in it. The plot is about a mental institution and the conditions that the patients had to live under, combining humor, seriousness, and a tragic ending to have a truly great cause. Now, even if you don't care about the amzing script, direction, or acting, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest should still be watched for it's message and to see what mental institutions were like back in the day.",

In this institution he find a new relation with human being although most of all are crazy and dumb people. Randle (Nicholson) bring a new hope, new paradigm and happiness to all his friends in that institution. Tell to them to life as a free man and do everything as our own. This is one the best movie i've ever watched. Both amazing and honest movie you should watch.The ending is blur and not clear for a lot of people. My writing below contain spoiler and the explanation of this ending based on my opinion. In case you didn't get the idea of ending you can read it. Best explanation of the ending is on Chief (big Indian) story about his father,a man who once had respect, honor, and courage but ended up a shell of what he once was. The people around him kept taking and taking until he died. Chief didn't want to see his friend Mcmurphy end up like that. By killing Mcmurphy he was performing the supreme act of kindness by ending his life while he could still be remembered by everyone else as strong and vital (big as a mountain).

All the patients are fantastic as they all have their quirks and problems, but the one that stands out is Will Sampson's performance as Chief a large def Native American who steels the show at one point. The main plot is for the patients to go up against the head nurse, Nurse Ractched played by Louise Fletcher. Who is the somewhat messed up person who is just messed up. She is menacing and awful to the patients, you end up really not liking her along with the patients. This film was released in 1975 and was directed by Milo's Forman and was based off the book by Ken Kesey. The movie absolutely deserved its best picture, lead actor, lead actress, best director, and best adapted screen play oscars. I can't recommend this film enough.",

            "content": "One of the more difficult things to get right in a movie is full and rich character development. Unlike books, movies are shorter, the plot comes faster and the elements are more immediate. A film maker has only a short time to get the characters right before the audience wants to get the plot going--about twenty minutes, certainly no more than thirty. Many films get by with only two or three fully fleshed out character and the others done in broad strokes, using the shorthand of either stock or, in some cases, downright clich\u00e9 players.\n\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is one of the great exceptions. One of the standout brilliant scenes, in this film of many, takes place in the first few minutes when McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is forced to sit in a group session with all the other residents of the ward. This is where the cast of characters are introduced to the audience. With Nurse Rached (Louise Fletcher) as mediator, the personalities and quirks of all \"the crazies,\" as McMurphy refers to them, come to the surface in efficient, yet subtle, fashion. Not only are the characters fully drawn, but the relationships between them are apparent.\n\nPart of this is due to Forman's ingenious camera work. By, for the most part, avoiding long shots, which tend to lend a \"third person\" quality to the narrative, and placing the camera inside the circle of chairs, the audience is drawn into the action and placed in a \"second person\" position and, at one point or another, occupying the place of every one of the characters.\n\nIn this way, the \"second person\" viewer not only sees and experiences the interrelationships of the ward, but is also called upon to form his own relationship with each character--like them or not. The audience \"investment\" in the narrative is established and from there the plot takes off.",

Brad Dourif is amazing as the innocent Billy and there's nothing you can do but love Will Sampson as Chief.\n\nThere aren't a lot of films that have been both as funny and as devastatingly sad as this one.  It steered clear of preaching about mental illness but it definitely made a case for more thoughtful examination of the sick.\n\nThe only real problem is with the ending.

He accurately plays a carefree guy who pretends to be insane, yet the hospital (and viewers) find themselves assessing whether he actually is crazy. I think this is an interesting juxta-position of people, perhaps more so in them days, of classifying a person as crazy just because he was bit more eccentric. The head nurse wonderfully personifies the system through her extremely formal and stern demeanour towards the patients. Audiences will despise her without her technically doing anything wrong. It is light-hearted while also being dark and disturbing at the right times. \n\nI held it off for a while cause I'm one of those people that are weary about going back to old films in the fear that they would have failed the test of time.

What's more impressive, it achieved another grand slam in all 5 major Oscar categories.  \n\nBasically the film is confined inside a mental institution, among a breed of patients, a newcomer McMurphy's arrival stirs Nurse Ratched's tyranny, whose strategy of manipulating those deranged is to coerce them into retread their horrible past and force them suffer under the name of group therapy, such a detestable character, Louise Fletcher nailed it, a borderline leading role, Fletcher's Oscar victory may raise some controversy, but her performance is impeccable in accentuating a devilish incarnation of obstinacy and ruthlessness. Nicholson won his first Oscar in his heyday, as McMurphy, a petty criminal has a sane mind, threatens the authorities as a black sheep in the group, whose devil-may-care boldness and utter naivety (assuming that the institution is a much better place than a prisoners' reforming farm) conflicts in the process of his freedom-seeking and his direct influence on other real mentally-impaired ward mates, ultimately, his tragedy is a boomerang to his gullibility and self-considered kindness, which squanders his best shot of escape and obliquely preconditions Billy's final breakdown. The ambivalence of McMurphy's heroic recklessness is the most intriguing topic of the film, he is not an amiable fellow, a ruffian on the street with a rebellious attitude, it is not in his intention to ameliorate his fellow mates' condition, his presence does not have an initiative motivation, what he does is his knee-jerking response of a living soul who hankers for an unsubdued environment which the society refuses to proffer. \n\nThere are many political allusions can be extracted from the film, to which I shall not refer  since I am no American and am unfamiliar with the history, but the film garners a great amount of impressive supporting performances, Dourif's big screen debut is stutteringly poignant, whose demise is a facile move in heightening the tension, but performance-wise, it is more awe-inspiring than the two leads aforementioned. Sampson, as the Chief, symbolizes the hope of the unsuppressed, his backstory is curtailed and his pretense has never been given a chance to be expounded. Two old-hand actors are surprisingly seen in this film when in their youth, a tough Lloyd and a meek DeVito, and many deceased names also, Crothers, Redfield and Lassick, the latter is another show-stealer, over-the-top but strikingly hilarious. \n\nForman's preference over classical music also reflects in the film, the opening score from Jack Nitzsche hums along with a melancholic tone and the symphony-driven pieces are inserted into the right place at the right time. There are many memorable shots, e.g.  Nicholson being electric-shocked and Fletcher being strangled are too authentic to stare, on the whole ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a sound accusation towards high-handed suppression and dominance, its sociological impact even rises above over the film's own integrity of a gem made with excellent cast and wry irony.",

            "content": "Another film that I've seen a little of but up till now have never fully watched, here is my review for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\n\nPlot: McMurphy is a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal who is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Even though he doesn't appear to have any mental illness, he tries to avoid hard labor to make his sentence in a more hospital environment. But in the mental institution, he encounters and starts to befriend his fellow inmates and begin to have a power struggle against the head administrative nurse, Nurse Ratched.\n\nBoy this is such a great film. There's so much that they put into the story and they use their characters very well. You get interested in them very easily as the film goes on from Billy to Taber (played by Christopher Lloyd who had his debut in this film). But honestly, the real focus and entertainment of the film is Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher as McMurphy and Nurse Ratched. Their on going battle against each other just gets you more and more with McMurphy always trying to escape or fighting against Ratched's rules and Ratched having control over the patients is both suspenseful and sometimes enraging. I say enraging because of Nurse Ratched as a character and how she takes control of the institution. It's no wonder that she's #5 in AFI's top Villains. Even from the little bit of this movie that I saw years ago, I knew and witnessed enough from what I saw that I hated her guts like no one's business. As you go further and further into the movie your desire to strangle, torture, beat, or stab the daylights out of her for how cruel and cold-hearted she can be. We're talking Delores Umbridge from Harry Potter kind of hate ladies and gentleman, and it's not pretty. But thankfully with her, there's also McMurphy who is always trying to get the other patients away from her control. From stealing a hospital bus to bringing girls and booze to the hospital, he was a great opposite of Ratched.\n\nAnd that's my review for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It's a great film that has a great cast and a great story with a lovable hero and a extremely hated villain. It's a great film to watch if you haven't seen it already and it deserved to win best picture during its year.",

Nicholson is supported very nicely by the rest of the cast who he helps to rile up. Originally adapted from the novel by Ken Kesey, the film tells the story of a criminal interned in a mental hospital where he interacts with many people. Jack Nicholson plays this Randle McMurphy who goes in ready to live easy and challenge authority. As he grows accustomed to the institution he becomes the instigator of the other patients and he tries to make them question authority too. However he musch deal with Nurse Ratched, a cold and iron-fisted woman who keeps everyone at bay. Not even McMurphy seems able to prevail over Rached and her tactics in the end. However his new found friend, Chief is able to escape and keep the hope alive after saying his last goodbyes to Randle.

That is why I gave it a rare 5/5.  It is one of the few films that I have given a 5/5.  It is so fantastic.  I can see how this would have inspired other films such as \"Awakenings,\" \"Shutter Island,\" \"Shawshank Redemption,\" and even \"The Green Mile.\"\n\nThe entire power struggle between McMurphy, and Nurse Ratchet was intense at times, and there were moments that you felt really good, then you would feel really bad.  You were always rooting for McMurphy, because he came across as a guy who may have been bad at first, but then like a guy who you would love, and worship almost.  You can see how all of the other patients looked up to him, and worshiped him at times.  The most amazing scene in the movie is when he pretends to be watching a baseball game to prove to the nurse, that you can't bring us down.\n\nThere were a lot of remarkable scenes in this where it was a combination of the acting, what was going on, and the setting that made it so amazing.  Another one is the scene when he try's to get out so he can go to the bar to see the baseball game, and he try's to lift the fountain, and at first everybody thinks he's crazy, but then they get really serious when they see how hard he is trying.  Also the first meeting when he suggests that they should watch the game.  When Nurse Ratchet says that they will change the schedule if there is a majority vote.  Then nobody votes because they are all scared of her.  The scene when the chief talks for the first time is such a great scene.  When he hands him the stick of gum, and then he says \"Thank you,\" so McMurphy gives him another piece to see if he will talk again then he does.  Just another fantastic scene in this remarkable film.  So many memorable scenes.\n\nNow Nurse Ratchet you really hate her, as you are supposed to.  Louise Fletcher played her role so perfectly, and the fact that you hate her more and more as the film goes along shows how convincing she is.  She doesn't really have any personality.  She is just an evil control freak, who treats her patients like children.  Jack Nicholson did play himself a little bit at times, but did take on this really likeable character, who you love by the end of the film.  \n\nThis film also had a lot of actors who went on to have great careers after this.  Brad Dourif's performance as Billy Babbit was so good, and when you look at his filmography what a career his performance in this film sparked.  Danny De Vito, though I will remembe as the Penguin in \"Batman Returns (1992),\"  this did jump start his career if you ask me.  This film just had such a major effect on the film industry.  The word remarkable is what I use to describe the movie most of the time, for all of the reasons I discussed earlier.",

            "content": "\"Medication time ... medication time.\"\n\nWe watch as \"Mac\" is moved from prison to a mental hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.  From the offset he appears to be a square peg in a round hole ... or perhaps a Cuckoo if you will (famous for dropping their eggs into the nest of another bird).  The movie is funny, dramatic, irritating, inspirational and sad.  It gets me every time.  The soundtrack is brilliant and the acting is top draw.  For me the water fountain is symbolic of the whole movie.  Mac has an idea, but is not strong enough to complete it.   But as he says;\n\"At least I tried damn-it, at least i did that\".\nIronically the only man who is strong enough to carry out the task is only mentally strong enough to do so because of the incapable McMurphy.  \n\nIf you haven't seen One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest yet I urge you to do so.  It is an excellent film that has stood the test of time.  After nearly 40 years it is still as good today as it was in 1975.  It still has as great an impact as ever and I would regard it as a classic.  \n\nLets put it into perspective.  The 1970's are considered to be one of, if not the greatest decade for quality film-making.   Cuckoo is one of, if not the greatest film of the 70's.  Jack Nicholson is noted for being one of, if not the greatest actor alive or dead.  His role as R. P. McMurphy is without shadow of a doubt one of the highlights of his career, possibly even a career best.\n\nHaving said that it is not a one man show.  There are many notable performances and many largely unknown actors stepped into the spotlight on the back of this film; Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes), Danny DeVito (er... Twins ... Junior .... Batman Returns), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Vincent Schiavelli (Man on the Moon) and Brad Dourif (Lord of the Rings) to name but a few.\nIt was the first movie to claim all 5 of the big Oscars since It Happened One Night.  Director (Milos Forman - the Czech who was unknown outside Europe), Producer (Michael Douglas - TV actor with a famous Dad), Actor (Jack Nicholson), Actress (Louise Fletcher - in the role of Nurse Ratched.  A role turned down by ever \"name\" actress is Hollywood) and best film.\nFrom any angle, whether you see the take on middle America or not (that they will shut you up and force you to conform one way or another), whether you like Jack Nicholson or not, whether you have read the book or not this movie is up there with the very, very best.  I love it!\n\nAfter thought\nI wonder, is Nurse Ratched was called Nurse Ratched because it sounds a bit like ratchet?  Ratchet being a tool used to tighten or loosen nuts.  Depending which way you turn it.",

MacMurphy wants to make the asylum a batter place by trying to increase everyone's intelligence with a TV set and basketball games but Ratched however thinks he will not defeat her. This film is amazingly psychologic and therefore I have never seen a movie like this ever. I'm actually surprised that not a lot of people have seen this movie sadly because Jack Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career. This film has some well known actors when they were quite young and it has an amazing story, this movie won five major Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress.
