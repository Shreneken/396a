            "content": "It was alright. I've seen better work from Guy Ritchie and The Gentlemen felt like a watered-down, dusted-off version of Snatch. The aesthetic is also very similar to Snatch's but seemed to lose the little edge or bite it had back in 2000. Perhaps it is why I was expecting something more from The Gentlemen. The acting is alright, mostly all well-known actors, most of them have worked with Guy Ritchie in the past and are mostly known for gangster-inspired films. Although I felt unimpressed by McConaughey's performance, the stoic-suave-too-cool kind of guy was archetype-y and felt almost hollow. Could also be the writing itself.",

The acting was done very well and very quick. As for the writing and directing, the quick jumping around through the story can be off-putting or odd on the first watch. However, after watching it a second time, I found it much easier to follow. The film is decent fun if you watch it once. However, I have found the more I watch it, the better it becomes.

I loved brainstorming ideas trying to figure out what the different plot twists and end might be, but they all failed at being correct. That's what made me love this movie.

For example, it's unusual to see Hugh Grant playing such tricky character but he made me believe that he almost acts the same in real life. So when you're watching this movie you can immerse yourself into a different world.\nThere are many jokes and funny moments in this movie. I can say that I laughed a lot!

            "content": "The first thought I had when watching this movie was it's numerous amounts of flashbacks and cut aways to other scenes which I must say I was surprised by how well it manages to do this format compared to other films. This did get a bit confusing at parts mainly the beginning due to the onslaught of information that does start to make more sense as the film goes on but I was able to follow it all none the less. The characters are all very well written and very different to eachother which helps with keeping the audience interested and not getting bored of the movie and I appreciate the subtle humour in scenes to keep people entertained. That's not to say that the overall plot didn't keep me hooked, I can only compare the narration to that of a third person picture book. There is not much description of the scenes from the narration but that isn't required when you are spoon fed the satisfactory visuals and visual storytelling that the movie puts across. One thing I didn't enjoy too much was the overdramatisation of some people, specifically in the terms of the unrealistic way people communicate with eachother and the stereotypical British way of talking and language, this is only some though and the overall generalisation of cast is very well. Each actor does absolutely amazing in their role especially Charlie Hunnam as Raymond Smith, Colin Farrell as Coach and Hugh Grant as Fletcher, that's not to say that the rest of the cast do not do truly incredible in their part. The character of Fletcher is a true stand out and does perfectly as the narrator of this movie and the narration really put this movie together for me and I personally found his and Raymond's part of the story the most enjoying",

We all know I'm talking about the \"alright, alright, alright\" \"Magic Mike\" man himself Matthew McConaughey. It's not that he's a bad actor, but just that he doesn't fit in the film. He stands out in every scene. One could only imagine that he was a studio choice. Apparently, he can't do a British accent. It really feels like they rewrote the film to accommodate this fact. On the flipside thought Colin Farrell delivers another low key genius performance. The rest of the cast is just as flawless. ******************************************************************************************************************************What really shines is the writing. Ritchie and Co. are in rare form. This is a screenplay tighter than a nun's box. Sorry, I just watched the film and the dialogue is so infectious it's rubbed off on me. The plot is just as well crafted. Guy Ritchie is also a genius when it comes to instant character development. He really is a writer that makes great story telling look effortless. I do acknowledge that he didn't write it alone, but how many rings did Jordan get before people realized that he carried everything he touched? Guy Ritchie is a great story teller, it's no secret, and this film is just another feather in his cap.",

The rest of the star-studded cast did really well too. The movie was fun and had a lot of twists, but it should've ended earlier than it did. The last few minutes felt shoehorned in and serve no purpose other than to add more twists and overexplain what happened. It was still a good movie and I had a fun time.

Not to take away from the big names in this movie they preformed well. Hugh grant and Colin Farnell giving the most memorable performances.\nUnfortunately directing let this movie down and what could have been a classic British gangster movie with better directing but unfortunately this flaw has led to a less than memorable film.

East end geezers don't really hang around pubs and markets anymore, do they? Everything is gentrified. People shop on Amamzon. Recording devices in everybody's pockets make crime difficult, and there is reference to this in the movie. This means that the movie is a little less raw and limits what Ritchie can get away.\n\nThat said it is nice to watch an old style movie and enjoy some loveable rouges up to no good. Hugh Grant is very adept as an East End low life journalist mixing with\nthe wrong crowd. Matthew McConaughey brings some Hollywood to the movie and faces off against Succession's Jeremy Strong. Apparently Strong is a very committed method actor which all of the other people on set (McConaughey included) find really annoying. Colin Farrell makes an amusing appearance and the only let down is by Charlie Humman (I spent half the movie trying to work out where he was from).\n\nRitchie made his name with Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels and then went on to make Snatch.

Lots of twists and turns and the perspectives of the characters aren't actually clear until almost the very end.  I really don't know if anyone but Guy Ritchie could do this and I'm not a Guy Ritchie fan.  I found the second Holmes, Game of Shadows, to be just a little too oblique to know what was going on and too hackneyed, grey, \"chatty\", and bleak to care.\n\nMichelle Dockery is brilliantly out of typecast as a sexy, acerbic yet soft and feminine, love of the main character's life.  She is submissive to him while powerful, competent, and fearless at the same time and her role is critical to the plot.  She's definitely out of any \"Downton\" curse.\n\nMatthew McConaughey, who I've suffered through his \"too cool\" in other roles, plays this perfectly believable.\n\nColin Farrell and Hugh Grant are also completely out of any typecast.  Farrell brings so many new dimensions to this character that you really lose sight of who he is.  Same with Grant who is so gritty and slimy you can't imagine him in a rom-com.\n\nKudos to Ritchie for finding these characters in these actors and weaving them into the story\n\nI'm not sure why Rex Reed hates Ritchie so much, but it seems to be emotional.  In the film, there's an exchange between the main character, a truly productive man, and gossip rag editor, who creates nothing, rather leeches off others' creations with vile printer word.  The leech is rebuffed by the main character, rather than shown respect.  Throughout the film, the leech is portrayed as a pathetic weasel brilliantly woven into the script.  I, obviously, don't know this for sure, but frequently art imitates life and the subtext of this film may very well be an expression of Ritchie's perspective on Reed.  Yet it's critical to plot and not obvious until I read Reed's review of this film.\n\nI certainly see the similarities and I only just became aware of Reed's excessive derision of Ritchie as \"an incompetent director\" while Reed is really incapable of creating anything of substance and leeches off the products of others.  Would Reed be turning tricks on Highland if nobody made movies?  Maybe. \n\nThis movie is a mental challenge with plenty if action and dark humor as the story unfolds.  It's one of those classics worth a rewatch",

Headlined by an Allstar cast that includes Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Colin Farrell, Michelle Dockery, and Hugh Grant, this film delivers on so many levels. Not as good as some of his most revered works, The Gentlemen is more focused on the characters in the film. Everyone in the movie is well casted and all the performers deliver their characters amazingly. They all seem to be having fun with their respective characters, which is great to see. The intricate web of deceit and shady business is delicately woven as the film goes on. The story is narrated for the majority of the film in almost a meta way by Hugh Grant's character. We get to witness how things go about in the underworld of the UK, and how things go to crazy shit in a comedic way help give the film the energy that it delivers. All the loose ends connect in such a great way that you will feel satisfied as the movie approaches its climax. It's a scoundrel, foul mouthed, fun yet well placed film. It might not be for everybody, but if you're a fan of Ritchie's previous works, and if you're a fan of dark humour, this is the film for you!",

I had some fun with this movie and I respect it's smart cleaver lines of dialogue so hands down to the writer. But this movie has a different vibe compared to other guy Ritchie films. For some reason to me it feels like it's a cheaply done movie that used all its budget on the stars like Hugh grant, Colin Farrell and of course the main showstopper Matthew mconahay. Maybe this movie simply isn't for me but I did have a decent time while watching meaning I wasn't bored out of my mind. But probably after writing this review I'll forget about this movie. I can see the appeal for most people for liking this. But it's just not my thing sorry not sorry.",

This is a fast moving Guy Ritchie crime film that relies heavily on flash-back/flash-forward scenes to develop the plot.
