The acting is horrible, no real chemistry, no effort put into line delivery just over the top delivery with stupid dialogue. The cinematography is bad with shots being centered on the actor and nothing going on around them, and everything else being out of frame and cheaply designed sets and costumes. It looks Bad to begin with despite the tons of different exotic locations. The editing is bad also with every new location feeling like there is no flow or consistency to them outside of terrible jokes. The pacing in this awful also because  there really isn't a consistent plot throughout this. Rather things just happen until we get to the second half when it becomes a Nardia parody. The jokes are incredibly bad full of pop culture reference humor popular in the mid 2000's, cheap over the top slapstick, gross out humor, and offensive shock humor at times that feels more offensive than funny. The Plot also is worth mentioning again is nonexistent until like the second half but you could take the first half out of this movie and nothing would be lost. One of the worst comedies ever made easily. Stay Far Away.",

None of the jokes work, the movies that are being spoofed aren't even actual epic films and it doesn't have any plot. While the Scary Movie...movies had parody stories, they still benefited from its charming cast and still had a tinge of originality to them. In Epic Movie, however, the infamous Friedberg-Seltzer duo I've been hearing so much about seem less interested in making a consistent movie and instead inserting as many pop culture references as possible. The editing is terrible with characters that come out of nowhere and various nonsensical things, an obvious stunt double in one scene and cliched and predictable jokes (example: NACHOOOOOOOO...cheese-flavoured Doritos are delicious. Hardy-har, how much did they pay the Jack Black lookalike for that product placement?). The actors are incredibly cringy especially Jayma Mays as the stupid one out of the four. In fact, I think Friedberg and Seltzer just cast Kal Penn and Jennifer Coolidge for a White Castle joke and a reference to American Pie. If you saw X-Men and Click, you'd know that two \"jokes\" involving these movies, were already done in the actual movies. And, it gets worse, even when the credits start rolling, they keep you trapped with a mid-credits scene that has V from V for Vendetta for some reason, then there's a parody of the Willy Wonka song from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, then there's a joke involving Mel Gibson in prison. Epic Movie is an epic fail and I strongly advise you stay away from it at all costs. Even Dumb and Dumberer had better jokes than this pile of crap. Didn't get a single laugh out of me.",

Seltzer and Friedberg are really bad about latching onto premises that have promise, and then picking the most one-dimensional, unfunny cast possible. This breed of satire isn't funny anymore, because we've seen it a million times before. Look at movies like \"Kingsman\" or \"Cabin In The Woods\" or \"You're Next,\" for instance. Those are great movies that entertain on the same level as the movies they're poking fun at, and they don't sacrifice the satire and comedic possibilities.

            "content": "Sorry in advance about this but to be honest, watching \"Epic Movie\" is the equivalent of being set on fire in a room full of buckets of diarrhea. Out of the sheer power of the human instinct of survival you'll make it out alive, but afterwards you'll feel dirty, disgusting, smoldering and partially wishing you had simply dropped dead instead. Here is the closest this movie comes to a plot: Lucy (Jayma Mays) finds her adopted father semi-naked on the floor in a way similar to \"The Da Vinci Code\". He is dying after being attacked by Silas (Kevin Hart) an albino white man that whips himself. After doing a break dance in which he spells out a clue for her, she finds a Golden Ticket (similar to the one from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"). The movie switches to Edward (Kal Penn) an orphan living in a Mexican monastery. A parody of \"Nacho Libre\" gets upset when he doesn't appreciate the food and throws his out of a window. On his way out, he finds a Golden Ticket (but not before Nacho shows off some tasty Doritos, available now at the concession stand!) Next we have Susan (Faune Chambers) who is on a plane when all of a sudden snakes pop out! Cue the Samuel L. Jackson impersonator. Susan is thrown out of the plane, lands on Paris Hilton and finds a Golden Ticket inside the dead celebrity's purse. Finally we have Peter. He's a highschooler and a mutant who is bullied because his mutant power sucks (as the movie spells it out for its audience, he has chicken wings instead of angel wings). He finds a Golden Ticket too and joins the other orphans at Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Willy (Crispin Glover) reveals to them that the special ingredients in the chocolate are human body parts. Cue the nut jokes. The children run away inside a magical wardrobe, which brings them to Gnarnia in a spoof of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". Lucy befriends Mr. Tumnus (Hector Jimenez) while Edward is seduced by the White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge). The children discover that they are actually all brothers and sisters (whatever) and ally themselves against the White Bitch. Edward is captured while the rest of the group enter a training montage at Hogwarts. Peter, Lucy and Susan meet a parody of Aslan named Aslo (played by Fred Willard) in the hopes that together they can formulate a plan to save their brother, and the kingdom of Gnarnia.\n\nThere's no reason for anyone, ever to watch this colossal piece of crap. For my own personal reasons I had to, just so I could vow never to watch it again and to write this review but really, why would you even be tempted by this? I watched the unrated version, which at least had the \"Snakes on a Plane\" spoof done correctly, with the actual wording accurate but how bad does it show that in the theatrical version of the movie, Samuel L. Jackson says \"goddamn\" instead of \"motherfucking\"? I counted 9 testicles jokes, 5 piss jokes and 9 other jokes that related to body hair, farts, poop or similar material. When it comes to the spoof segment of the film, several of the jokes don't even make any sense. There's an extended joke where the film makes fun of the actors in the Harry Potter franchise. The joke is that in this film's version of Hogwarts the actors are much older than they should be. Maybe the directors didn't realize that not only are the actors playing Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edward adults themselves (So way off the characters they are spoofing) but the actors in the Harry Potter films were always the same age as their characters (plus maybe a year or two?) so it's just an excuse to have a bunch of ugly people dress up in funny costumes. To the film's credit, that could have actually been a joke. Sometimes it misfires so bad that some of the \"funny\" moments aren't even jokes or references. When you insert a character named Borat into your movie, you make him look like Sasha Baron Cohen and you give him lines like \"This is my sister, she is number one prostitute in Gnargnia\" that isn't a reference, that's just plagiarism. While we're at it, how do you make fun of a movie like \"Snakes on a Plane\" which not only ran its own joke into the ground before the movie was released in theatres but was a parody in itself? I get a head ache just reading my notes about the movie.\n\nEverything could be forgiven if this film was actually humorous but it isn't. There are two jokes in the whole hour and thirty-two minute running time that might actually make you smile. One is a reference to White Castle. Kal Penn was in \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\", so that's an actual joke. I didn't laugh, but I recognize the effort. They later run that one into the ground, but I'll give them that. The other running joke, which is the poor production and special effects, does work. They make absolutely no attempt to make the stunt doubles look like the actual actors, the special effects are terrible and even the sets look cheap. It's probably a way to mask the fact that making an actual spoof of an epic would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but I did laugh at the cheap, fake-looking dead cat and the obvious beaver puppet. Were my standards just falling so low that out of desperation my mind latched onto these moments? Who knows.\n\nThe movie was pretty much doomed from the start because the two directors/writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are two mentally deranged idiots that can't make a good comedy to save their own lives. The blame does not rest solely on their shoulders though. Who green-lit a project named \"Epic Movie\" that contains spoofs of Shrek, Mel Gibson, Ghost Busters, Click, Tivo, Bobby Beats Whitey, Punk'd, Brittney Spears, Star Wars, 50 Cent, \"Get Crunk\", Rick James, Rocky, Batman, MTV Cribs, Laguna Beach, Dr. Phil, Casino Royale, Talladega Nights, Brad & Angelina, Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Siegfried & Roy and insurance commercials? There's maybe one or two of those that could be considered grand, action packed films that could be considered epic in the sense that they blow you away and have to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated but for the most part, what do any of those have to do with Epic Movies? While we're at it, who actually remembers half of those references now that it's been 6 years since the movie has been released?\n\nYou've heard enough. Just from the Dvd cover or any trailer you can tell this limp comedy is about as unfunny as finding your pet stuffed inside a blender. Even the ending of the film is incredibly lazily put together thanks a Deus ex Machina that's allows our \"heroes\" to win. As far as I'm concerned, if you like this or even think it \"isn't that bad\", if you complain that I \"spoiled too much\" or you are willing to give this movie a chance despite all of the negative press it's been given you need to really re-evaluate your taste in everything and I really hope you grow out of it because otherwise we can't be friends anymore. Any movie that references \"Scar Face\" by playing \"Say Hello to my Little Friend\" over and over almost automatically gets the lowest score imaginable and boy, this one deserves every insult it's got coming.
