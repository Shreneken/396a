    "summary": "Dr. Atsuko Chiba works as a scientist by day and, under the code name \"Paprika,\" is a dream detective at night. Atsuko and her colleagues are working on a device called the DC Mini, which is intended to help psychiatric patients, but in the wrong hands it could destroy people's minds. When a prototype is stolen, Atsuko/Paprika springs into action to recover it before damage is done.",

            "content": "I have been interested in seeing \"Paprika\" when I heard that \"Inception\" was clearly inspired by it. Seeing the film's premise, concept, and execution, it is easy to see why that is something that is widely accepted in the film community. The film has a very cool visual style and kept me intrigued to see what would happen next. The movie doesn't always hit the storytelling highs it feels like the premise could have, but I still found myself interested throughout the movie. Similar to \"Perfect Blue,\" which I saw recently and loved, this is a movie that could benefit from additional viewings and further analysis. Overall, it is another great film from Satoshi Kon and I fully intend to finish his short filmography after seeing this.",

It's an experience that has honestly surprised me in multiple ways.",

            "content": "This is a slightly eery and mildly sinister anime film - it made me think of the film Inception, in terms of discussions about being able to enter other peoples dreams and the like, plus the fact that its somewhat multi-layered . The animation is pretty decent, 2D but certainly engrossing never the less. Its not really action packed as such, not at first certainly but the plot and the characters are intriguing enough to keep the viewer watching, as I say. I liked the music played in the background at times - quite atmospheric pieces that help you to feel the relevant emotion as felt by the character on screen - unsure, worried, excited/energetic etc.\n\nI liked the way lighting was used within the animation at times, with some scenes being almost, if anything, too bright - with bold, vivid colours depicting the many items on the move, having been made real by the power of the dream (you'll have to watch it to see what I mean) and in other scenes, the dull, or dark, urban settings are clearly shown as just that, dark and dim. There is a certain metaphor element to this, I suppose.\n\nI thought it was interesting how the scientist/doctor explained the scenarios, the talk about dreams and films interested me and there are some quite gripping moments, when things came to a head. There is some undoubtedly disturbing imagery present at around about an hour in to the film, which clearly justifies the 15 rating/certificate the film carries here in the UK. There is somewhat sexual imagery present, or what at first appears to be so, so be aware of that. Its certainly a quirky watch - a relatively immersive one at that.I would recommend this film to other fans of Satoshi Kon's work - this isn't your average anime film length show, thats for sure.",

Still if you are into anime this is a really good standalone piece with some far out there visual flair. The story is a bit muddled and hard to follow very easily or competently but is still a wonder to behold. Recommended if you are an anime fan.",

            "content": "Satoshi Kon still hasn't gotten his due in pop culture; Miyazaki and Takahata get much of the recognition as the modern masters of Japanese animation. While it's hardly a competition, when he tragically passed at the age of 46 Kon had already completed four highly regarded and distinctive feature films while Miyazaki had 'only' finished one with Ghibli at the same age. Hard to tell how many more boundary-pushing masterpieces we would have gotten had fate not tragically intervened.\n\nBut I have been part of the problem, making it a point to follow up with all the Ghibli films (yes, even Tales of Earthsea, and Earwig and the Witch) while letting Kon's work fall by the wayside. And that's a real disservice, because Paprika is a tremendously imaginative film that intentionally blurs the lines between fantasy and reality. There's whimsy and darkness, all indicative of an inherent contrast that's present in all things, a natural balance that is shockingly philosophical despite being executed with such compelling entertainment value and using a thriller plot as its delivery mechanism. While preceding films may have used the foundational premise (fantasy vs. reality, with some tweaks) to great acclaim in the years before, none have done so with the degree of vibrancy and seamlessness that Kon imparts to his work.  Even on a home screen, Paprika has that magic inherent to all the best films - the ability to take you out of your seat and into a different world, and with the creativity on display here that's far more of an accomplishment than your standard drama. \n\nWith a plot that is equal parts investigational thriller, surrealist think piece, personal redemption arc, and love story, Paprika seems like it absolutely should not work in a 90-minute runtime but demonstrates a surprising care with its pacing, taut but not rushed. It's a film that defies explanation on paper, but one that everyone should see. (4.5/5)",

Honestly, this was BY FAR the weirdest movie I saw in my whole life. For example, there's a moment when the protagonist and her boss are in the lab running from some bizarre stuff and comes from inside a room a pink elephant carrying an albino alligator in a wheelchair. I PROMISE that this is one of the less weird things in this film. And the film could sell itself on bizarreness alone, but we have six main characters, all deeply developed, in a 90-minute long movie (85 without the credits). The president of the laboratory remembered me of Professor Xavier, and the cinema as art is also something deeply explored. \"Paprika\" is another rich movie made by this extremely authorial director, and unfortunately, it was his last.",

Hence one person's dream (the filmmaker's) is another person's (the audience's) nightmare, and one person's (the viewer's) death is another person's (the director's) lifework. Life, too, is a but a dream, after all, the collective hallucination and cumulative imagination of scientists and artists, a cascade of inspiration unbound by language or time or space or intention\u2014and so not so different from a sort of collective unconscious lived out not in sleep but in waking (albeit barely so) society. Hence all that is reality first began as a dream and all that is a dream (der Inhalt) was, likewise, once reality; condensed and displaced through the work of the Other/the Symbolic, the world of the day becomes the world of the night and the realms of our revelries will, through the work of other people, turn real again in turn.",

So, I thought I would give it a try with this bizarre offering from director Satoshi Kon (who also directed Perfect Blue and Tokyo Godfathers).  The plot involves a high-tech device that allows therapists (or anyone) to enter a person's dreams, presumably to better understand them.  But the opportunity for mischief is there...and when the device is stolen, all hell breaks loose.  And in fact, what starts out as a mystery (find the thief) with a made-to-order comic book cop (with flat-top), starts to come apart at the seams as reality and dreams begin to blur.  One of the key scientist-developers, Dr Chiba, also has an alter-ego, Paprika, a young girl who is at home in people's dreams and is able to solve problems there (often in magical ways).  Soon the bad guys are clearly revealed and the psychedelic battle begins and my brain started to hurt.  Instead of the plot resolving itself all nicely-nicely, things got more and more chaotic and less straightforward.  When the ending did come (tying up some loose ends), I couldn't really care too much anymore.  That said, the animation itself is a marvel to look at, in that typical Japanese style, and takes full advantage of a story that likely couldn't be filmed in any traditional way. Perhaps too there is a warning here about technology dominating our reality (that hasn't been heeded 12 years later).",

There are not enough stimulating/creative visuals to warrant repeated viewings to fully understand what it wants to say regarding reality vs. dreams. It is a concept that has already been explored to death in films and done much better.\nYou know there's trouble when the visuals are mostly repeated and that they are only repeated just because the plot demands for them to be interwoven. When the visuals are both boring to look at and repetitious, it becomes taxing on the brain to want to decipher the film's mystery....and that ladies and gentlemen is not a fun time at the movies.",

While there are various weak points to the film, but there is not much point to mentioning them. Why? Well, when something goes for it on a grand scale, as Paprika does, it is better to watch and appreciate what it does right. Beyond the vibrant images, the direction does something special with the choreography, the movement on-screen.

            "content": "I sure picked a doozy of a film for my second excursion into anime. PAPRIKA is an exhilarating, mind-bending look at dreams and the nature of reality that is also one of the weirdest, most visually inventive things I've ever seen. The basic premise for the film is that there is this recent invention, the DC-Mini, which is able to record dreams. However when three of them are stolen, and don't yet have programmed access controls, scientists who were working on the device and a cop have to recover them before the fabric of reality is broken and the dream world bleeds into the real world. Aside from the story, which is very confusing at times because of not knowing what takes place in the dream world and what doesn't, the aspect I most liked in this film was the visuals. It was animated using traditional cel animation (with some CG elements) and Satoshi Kon came up with some pretty awesome stuff to show us. The weirdest was probably a recurring procession with frogs playing instruments, giant dolls, and kitchen appliances. To say this film is confusing would actually be an understatement, although I did understand the setup and the general endgame. Another thing which might be nice to point out, and which I also noticed with AKIRA, is the cautious approach taken with science and technology. One theme common to both this and AKIRA is the danger when technology and science is in the wrong hands. Here, a device which can be used for psychotherapy is stolen, but because of the lack of proper access controls the person using it can enter the dreams of others and bring the dream world into reality. This seems to be a common theme in a lot of Japanese cinema, and it is explored here with enough visual creativity for a dozen films. Overall, despite the confusing nature of the story (which will probably benefit from multiple viewings) I thought this was an extremely original film that was beautifully animated and had a lot of artistry behind it. Highly recommended.",

The more basic details should have been made more coherent, and that's my biggest criticism towards Paprika.\nAs a sensory experience though, it's overwhelming.  You will never see anything quite like this.  Diving into the dream concept with a million times more intensity than something like Inception, the film has a surreal and extremely dreamlike quality about it.

Paprika is a thriller that centers around a device that allows scientists to enter and record dreams. Naturally the device goes missing and it is up to a group of therapists and a detective to solve the puzzle and get it back.\n\nNow the interesting thing about Paprika is less the story itself and more the way it was approached and put together. Beginning the film in a sequence that gives you everything you need to know about what is about to unfold was a great way to start and left you asking the good kind of questions throughout the rest of the film.\n\nThe dream sequences and the real world are interesting in that for the most part you can't tell them apart aside form Paprika herself and when things begin to get strange. Even then lots of those things even have a sense of normal to them. They really capture visually what can be so fleeting to us in our everyday dreams and opt for more strange/believably strange over wacky. Mixing it all together seamlessly (sometimes confusingly seamlessly) for the 90 minute runtime.\n\nOne of the great things about Paprika is the music. Music that is both fitting, unique and actually helps the experience quite a bit. One of those films that does not fear scenes without background noise.\n\nThe story and characters are actually very interesting and gripping. They do a great job keeping you interested in these people and what they are doing. I actually really wanted to find out what was going on, and find out with these characters. Even the exploration of the characters was great and didn't feel tacked on in relation to what they were trying to do. \n\nFaults can be large or small depending on how you feel. I did find some of the reality to dream and vise versa a bit confusing. I found it not a real issue but the thought did come up. Although the dialog was good, the voice over work did lack in some parts, quite a bit for certain conversations. (I will not get into the whole original Japanese and English bit, I am just going over the English version of the film) Lastly the ending did seem a slight bit lacking, Maybe it was the explanation, the reveal? Not to say it wasn't satisfying though.\n\nVisually stylish, unique and fun. That is one of the best ways to describe Paprika. Even better was it didn't take itself too seriously either. Hard not to fall in love with this one as it does not really disappoint in any aspect.\n\n3 out of 4 stars.\nWould I watch it again? Yes.",

The film does a great job with this by giving us some great imagery that goes on symbolic levels.

Also it's a movie that knows it will have confusion, but keeping on that path really makes it fun to think about what is happening. Then it's over the top and it knows that easily as you will be amazed and confused at the same time by the animation.
