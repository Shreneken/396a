This movie has focus on the character's creativity and strong passion to achieve the goal. This film is set in Paris country, it is the country where the rats live in the sewer under the restaurant named Guiteau's. Remy was impressed by the quality of the food. So, he does like to try the chef carrier inside the kitchen. \n\nHe finds his opportunity to go inside the kitchen of Gusteau's when one of newbie in restaurant named Linguini has accident change the taste of pot soup into the worse taste, so Remy lend his help by adding an ingredient to fix it. \n\nThen the dish was served to the customer, and they liked the dish that Remy cooked, to still working his job in this restaurant Linguini asked for exchange with Remy to help him cook for the rest. \n\nThe time has pass with Linguini and Remy that help each other to cook an excellent dish, but all the time they must keep a secret about Remy's identity that he is a rat, while they are getting suspicious from head chef about why Linguini has success with no improve before. \n\nRatatouille has shown audiences in every detail. Pixar has animated a wonderful cooking animation, the sound is also great to listen to, especially sound when chef has work in the kitchen, it is like they let the audience know what real environment inside the kitchen is. Next is the character from this movie, first one is Remy who has a dream to be a chef while he is facing with the reality, he also improves himself to prove where the place he should living in. Survive in a horrible world that human has idea in common that rat is a dirty animal that find a food in the garbage, they shouldn't touch human food or else that restaurant will get complain that they did not has responsibility to cook with an excellent quality of food. So, none of the customers would satisfy with this situation. \n\nIt has many conflicts here with many emotions type mixing in \n\nThese films can be a pressure to many people who have their own dream but in the other hand it has a weakness in this film. The films has been slow in some part that we concern. \n\nAnyway it can be the light to lead many people who still finding themself especially a food lover or someone who find the success can look at this movie as an example to keep improve. We suggest that this movie both has animation and the story with excellent quality, at least should just watch for once, then you will understand why it get accepted and approved.",

The voice cast is equally impressive, with Patton Oswalt perfectly capturing the determined and passionate spirit of Remy.\n\nBut what truly sets Ratatouille apart is its heart. At its core, this is a story about following your dreams and finding your place in the world. It is a film that celebrates the art of cooking and the power of friendship, all while delivering plenty of laughs along the way.\n\nIn short, Ratatouille is a must-see for any fan of animated films.

To be honest, I haven't watched a lot of Pixar movies yet maybe a few, but this must be in the top three without a doubt. \n\nNow talking about the movie, the story was of Remi a rat, his love for cooking, his struggles in the human(enemy) dominant world, and how he went on to become the best French Chef despite being a pesky rodent.\n\nNow talking about character development, Remi main character could not be any better, he is found talking to Gusteau (which is his inner voice),also in the entire movie he doesn't speak to humans which enhances his character 10x times. Linguini's character was great too, the scene were he jumped into the lake, the refrigerator scene, the hair pulling training lol incredibly creative. Collete was hilarious loved her throwing truth bombs like a boss, the three knives scene, the pepper spray before kiss xD. Skinner was funny and yes I hate him lmao. Anton Ego really a class character with his body language, his voice acting, his attitude from the start till he dropped the pen( dropped the ego). Overall the character design was done beautifully.\n\nThe animation, what more to say other than the word \"Magnifique\"? The scene where Remi from his lowest point in life losing his family, friends gets to see the city of Paris, the colour palette shifts from dark dull colours to brightly decorated with glowing yellow lights, the marvelous Eiffel Tower in the background with orangish purple sky, what else do you need?\n\nAlso I loved the scene when Anton Ego having tasted the Ratatouille dropped his pen symbolizing his ego, and that he is no more a critique but a food lover enjoying his meal. The animation and voice acting was \"chef's kiss\".\n\nThe main message that stuck to me watching the movie is it doesn't matter whoever you are and wherever you are from, and however tiny you think of yourself, can contribute something beautiful to the world, as Chef Gusteau said \"Anyone can cook\". Overall the movie was meaningful to me and having watched it, I'm glad.\n\nSide note,  People might think this is a kid's movie as its animated, then no its NOT. The movie has some dialogues and jokes suited for adults. There's a scene where Collete complains about the male dominant sexist society, and yeah a few body part jokes here and there xD, definately not making it a kid's movie. Besides animation isn't a genre in itself, its just a medium to story-telling of any genre. Having said that,`au revoir bonne journ\u00e9e`!\n\n-Sagnik\n\nP.S. I was listening to french accordion while writing this, gets you to the vibe you know :)",

But a HUGE shortcoming is the lack of laughs---basically, there are none. Not a single one. And when you have an almost two hour animated film, that makes for some seriously tedious viewing. It's all story, story, story. The voices are serviceable but only Peter O'Toole knows how to make use out of the long laugh-less script, even if his character is ultimately pointless to the story. Pixar has been in a slump lately, one I hope they can pull themselves out of. With 'Cars' and now this, it seems they've forgotten something they used to have down pat-- beautiful animation can't hide the lack of comedy and general joylessness of the material",

Then, I found the character dynamic between chef and rat quite charming.

            "content": "Ratatouille is a very clever story that could be a very awesome movie. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't give our characters a big enough challenge to overcome. The important details come in second\u2026 or third\u2026 to the main idea of a rat who works in a french restaurant in the middle of Paris. I expected much more character development and a story of a young man becoming an adult.\n\nInstead, the story focuses on a rat who loves to cook, and uses a young man as a puppet so he can cook in a french restaurant\u2026 okay\u2026 should be promising. The story of Ratatouille should really focus more on Linguini and not on Remy.\n\nI don't think the story should focus on Remy. The real story is with Linguini. The story doesn't have any real conflict with Remy. He doesn't fight against anything. I want to see him as a mentor for Linguini. The two make a deal. Linguini will let Remy hide in the kitchen to help cook. And Remy will teach Linguini how to cook and be a chef. This gives real purpose and meaning behind the relationship. This does something important. Creates a bond between the two.\n\nLet Linguini know the truth about his father early on in the movie. Like the very, very beginning. Then as he's working in the kitchen, he has to really impress the other chefs. And he has to learn how to take over the family business. That's when Remy comes into his life. We get to see Linguini face a problem. Overcome that problem. Then live up to the challenge.\n\nThe movie is really about Linguini living up to the challenge of being on his own and becoming an adult. Remy doesn't need to work in the kitchen. He can cook anywhere, which we see at the very beginning of the movie. What we need is Linguini becoming more than just a puppet to a rat.\n\nLinguini has no real development. He doesn't grow as a person. He doesn't change at all. He really doesn't have any real motivation at all. This kid really needs something to do. What I want from him is this: He's trying really hard to impress the other cooks in the kitchen. And he just can't seem to get anything right. So he agrees to let the rat help him cook and in exchange, the rat teaches him to cook. At the climax of the movie, Linguini has to run the kitchen himself\u2026 without the help of Remy. And that's where we see Linguini really take charge and become a man. I love this because he would have a really great story himself. He starts as a cowardly boy and ends as a confident man. What a story arch!\n\nReally drive home \"anyone can cook\"... even Linguini! The boy who doesn't know anything about the kitchen! Because if a rat can learn how to cook, the boy would be able to cook as well. Let him restore his father's legacy and earn more stars for the world famous restaurant that his father started.\n\nThe ending is a real bummer. There's not much of a conclusion and it's a little bit sad. I really want to see everyone come full circle. It's not good watching the world famous restaurant closing. Let linguini take over and follow in his father's footsteps. Show the restaurant becoming a five star restaurant again. \n\nKids will, of course, love this movie. And Ratatouille is a fun movie to watch. It leaves you wanting more and unfulfilled.\n\nRatatouille really should focus more on Linguini. Make him the center of the story. Give Linguini something to accomplish to really snail in a story arch. And, of course\u2026 gives us a happier ending.\n\nChris Mann writes reviews for movies streaming online.\nGet an expert's review.

Brad Bird does an amazing job as director/writer and crafts an excellent story. Patton Oswalt is great as Remy and Peter O'Toole is a perfect cast as Anton Ego. The writing is also well done, Ego's review near the end of the movie is a highlight. An amazing film, go see it!",

But the issue is that there are other Pixar films that are conceptually and emotionally better. Again\u2026.if we are going on what Pixar film is probably the best made one, it's a toss up between Monsters Inc and The Incredibles for me. Yeah, I'm just stalling on this review. I could be here for days talking about the themes alone, but there's a YouTube video that already describe everything this film did right. If you can, watch \"Why Ratatouille is Pixar's Magnum Opus\" by Schaffrillas Productions. He explains why it is the best Pixar movie Better than I ever could. My only thing is that this movie falls under the same category as Finding Nemo for me. Has a few better moments then some of the 5 out of 5 Pixar movies (Anton Ego anyone?), but there's not a huge emotional moment, and the movie constantly tries to bring Chef Skinner back, which seems like kind of lazy writing. Also there's a stereotypical betrayal which is so dumb, but it's \"technically\" needed. Besides that, some parts of this movie feel like an Indy film. Again, watch the Schaffrillas Productions video, he goes into so much more detail than I do. Wanna watch arguably the best Pixar has to offer! Watch this well cooked movie on Disney+ and see for yourself!",

So it's about a Rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef at a famous restaurant in Paris. However the only problem with that though is that he's a Rat. However he does eventually ends up in this famous restaurant in Paris after he parts away from his family. However he realize he could have his dream come true when he meets a human named Linguini and helps him out cooking delicious meals while no one knowing the truth on who's the real cook. To be honest with you I actually thought that this movie had really interesting premise. That they actually used really well also they really handled the animation on the food really well and the story it's self was a  pretty interesting. However the one problem that I have with the movie is that it's really not that memorable. Sure the characters are likable and well animated but they aren't as memorable as Woody, Buzz m, Nemo, Marlin, Dory, etc. Another thing about this movie is that I feel like the pacing could've been better. Ratatouille is not one of Pixar's best movies but it does keep you interested in both the characters and the animation, so while it might not be as memorable, it does put a good taste in my mouth. 8/10",

Ratatouille was not just an entertaining movie that told the tale of a cooking rat, but a lesson that can be learned around the world. Not everyone can be something they truly desire to be, but a dream can come from anywhere. It can come from any spark and occasionally that spark is to bright not to put out. I suppose we all can pursue what we so desire, no matter the origins or background. And if the heart says it be true then I see no path that leads otherwise other than mere disappointment. There is no secret in our hearts and souls, we rebirth to see things a different way another time yet if we opt out how many more chances will we get before we take out seat? Pixar may invoke these spirits and dreams into the hearts of children but it certainly did mine in too.",

            "content": "I've probably watched Ratatouille once a year, every year, after its conception in 2007. I find the animation to still be enjoyable although a bit dated. And any movie that takes place in Paris is inherently alluring. The music, the characters, the voice acting, all of it makes for a very entertaining children's movie. But I find that Ratatouille ultimately diverts from this path of predictable children's movies and becomes more than a sum of its parts, a gestalten.\n\nRemy and Linguini's relationship is overwhelmingly human. Linguini is clumsy and cowardly and achieves little on his own. Remy is a rat, rats are small. But together they become more than they ever could have been on their own. Linguini would've never been a great Chef without Remy, and possibly even more importantly, his love for Colette would've gone forever unrequited. This is nothing new, but it surprises me that so few understand their own limitations and wish to pursue happiness individually. Not just this, but the burden of consciousness is too heavy to carry alone, the necessity of companionship is not only represented in Ratatouille but defined by it. No one can become great alone. You can stand at the summit alone, but you either got there by standing on the shoulders of a friend, or on the backs of those you've taken advantage of.\n\nLater on in the film the power dynamic changes as Linguini becomes more confident. They have a falling out of sorts, and both seem to believe for a small period of time that they can be better on their own. But the confidence that Linguini gains is no doubt due to the efforts of his 'tiny chef,' Remy. But does this mean that Linguini truly owes Remy anything? Or does Remy owe Linguini anything? Morally, I'd say that it doesn't matter, since asking this is addressing them as two separate entities when in reality they are 2 halves of 1 whole. And they later resolve this as well, coming to an easy reunion when they realize what the audience knew all along, that they can not do it alone.\n\nWhile Ratatouille doesn't entirely reflect my time in Paris, there is a definite charm and romance that is very accurate to the actual city. I was often uncomfortable in Paris, I don't speak French, there were a lot of homeless people, and the fear of being pickpocketed was ever-present. Walking the streets can sometimes seem grimy and uncomfortable, but this can quickly change as you take in the city from the rooftops. Seeing buildings that are centuries old layered within talented street performances and artisan merchants selling handmade wares. And after a day of appreciating some of the greatest artists of all time and dining on the most petite Parisian meals, you take a riverboat and watch the Eiffel Tower light up the waters of the Seine. And an uncountable number of lovers gather at the shores to light candles, listen to music, and feel peace in each other's embrace. And it is at this point that you realize the beauty and romance of Paris.\n\nAnd I think Ratatouille captures this feeling exceptionally well, as the rats and grime are present, and so is the charm. Ultimately coming together to make a greater whole, solidifying the theme of the movie.\n\nAnd if nothing else, Ratatouille stands as a reminder that people can, and will, change for the better.",

The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.\n\nThe next thing to talk about is the \"genre\" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.\n\nThe voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.\n\nAnd finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.\n\nOverall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.",

The animation and atmosphere are beyond perfect in color, design, detail, and everything else. Remy is an engaging character along with Anton Ego and some of the chefs. Also, the concept and message are really great, even if I feel there execution is not that good until the end. However, the highlight is Ego's epiphany, a scene I fell in love with when I was 8 and still think is a top 5 Pixar moment. These aspects make the film more than worth watching. However, the story has issues. The fact that Remy has a long portion of little dialogue or focus bothered me. Also, Linguini's motivation constantly changes and kind of suck at times. The romance was pointless, the other rats were unimportant, and parts of the film just feel unnecessary without being entertaining or emotional, meaning the padding is more blatant. However, this is still a good film, so check it out.",

Now, generally, this is top-notch in Disney films, but, in order to preserve cultural accuracy, Disney has given up some of the feel-good charm of the settings.\n\nOverall, a delight to watch, brilliant story, and excellent movie.",

            "content": "Ratatouille, directed & written by Brad Bird & Jan Pinkava, produced by the very credible Andrew Stanton & John Lasseter, put out yet another Pixar CLASSIC, to go along with Toy Story, Finding Nemo & Monsters Inc. Ratatouille had such a warm hearted message behind all of the counteractive devices, winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film that year. Bird & Pinkava created this outside the box narrative, that packs a tremendous amount of weight. Though it lacked the sentimental value that most of the Pixar movies had before; Alfredo Linguine said \"Remy is a singular unexpected source\", and that's THE PERFECT way to describe this film. It has such a counteracting plot; a rat, cooking food, but it was still super charming, and portrayed a few inspirational messages like, be who you are, and greatness can come from unexpected places.\n\nBrad Bird did an amazing job creating these great detailed characters. Remy was an unusual \"hero\", for lack of better words, to the Pixar family; nevertheless, he was very entertaining, bringing this level of wit, and humor to the table (no pun intended). Linguine is such a cringey, disordered, and awkward character. The way Remy & Linguine bounce off eachother, is nothing short of charming. Colette was a consistent plot device, that helped the intensity aspect. I wish she was a little more involved, but they took her character the safe route, and I was okay with it. As for the antagonist in Skinner, he was just a straight up dick. He served his purpose well, I just thought that his character could've been a little smarter. My favorite antagonist was Anton Ego. We got a small taste of him in the first act, then goes missing until the third act. Ego brought this level of sophistication, that made him very blunt, and intimidating. The way he wraps up the film, was my absolute favorite part of the movie! It spoke to all the critics out there, and it just really hit home.\n\nThe cinematography by Robert Anderson & Sharon Calahan was absolutely gorgeous! There are so many fantastic colors all over this movie, really embracing the city of Paris. Not only was the scenery amazing, but the low angle camera shots really helped show size difference, and helped build a specific mood.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most strangest premise Pixar has put out, but it paid off amazingly well, with the great balance of characters, wit, and genuine story telling.",

They don't get enough credit for how good they are and I still don't know how Brad Bird made a story about a rat wanting to cook and forming a bond for human and using him to cook but it's expertly done. Remi and Linguini's relationship is developed so well as both of the need each other, I also love Colette and Linguini's relationship and Remi and Gastesu's relationship.

I can see why my parents foisted it on me as a child because it appeals more to adults than some of the more lowbrow entertainment pushed out by Disney and there are definitely jokes that parents will understand better than their children. However because this film is targeted at children I think that it does not appeal to it's intended audience and therefore fails as a piece of entertainment. \n\nThe idea of a rat with a great talent for cooking teaming up with a hapless young wannabe chef lacking in self esteem is entertaining on it's surface but there was something too cerebral about this film. This is unfortunately balanced with an overdose of slapstick comedy that felt out of place in a film that takes itself so seriously and feels like it was written by a divorced, middle aged screenwriter. When the two figure out how to work together in order to produce delicious, inventive food you do feel slightly happy but it all feels like such a chore with the scenes of disaster occurring as the human chef is too uncoordinated to cook the meals. The end of the film in which a cynical critic gives their dish a positive review because it takes him back to the warmth and optimism of his childhood felt like such a cynical ploy to court critics by slapping them on back that I was not emotionally moved as I should have been. I really truly appreciated some parts of the film as the movie did look warm and colorful in a way that many animated films don't and both humans and rats were expressive without being creepy. \n\nI am sure that this film works for a lot of people and I can see why they could even love it but it has never connected with me emotionally and so I cannot call it a fulfilling film.",

This movie covers sexism, animal cruelty, jealousy, and a child's thirst to burst their bubble all under the humorous plot and amazing voice acting that makes up this film. Every aspect of this movie is perfect, and Colette is someone every young girl can look up to. One speech she has resonates with me so much. She says, \"How many women do you see in this kitchen? . . . Only me. Why do you think that is? Because high cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid, old men. Rules designed to make it impossible for women to enter this world. But still I'm here. How did this happen? . . . Because I am the toughest cook in this kitchen! I have worked too hard for too long to get here, and I am not going to jeopardize it for some garbage boy who got lucky! Got it?\"",

Peter O'Toole, though not in it for large portions, is terrific as Anton Ego; especially at the end. Peter Sohn (Emile), Lou Romano (Linguini), Ian Holm (Skinner), Brad Garrett (Gusteau) and Janeane Garofalo (Colette) are also very good, all of those characters are memorable.\n\nThe premise is executed superbly, despite being absolutely bonkers - it actually adds some feasibility to it, which is nuts. The animation is brilliant, with Paris coming alive splendidly. I really liked the music, also.\n\nI couldn't recommend this higher. One of my favourite Disney films, easily in their animated top five without doubt.",

That is reflection on people that wanna do more in life than just live and die without anyone caring about you. As a musician I can confirm, some humans can feel like Remy when they are surrounded with people that don't give a damn about music, listen to generic mumble rap, and I hang out with other musician friends who are creating unique and amazing music. Remy wants to become a cook, chef because he doesn't give a damn what others say, and follows his dream. (why should he eat garbage when it is so much better food out there, and his friends and family do not care) (Why should I make brainwashed music and not make better music)\nThis movie is good and I don't even like that many CGI movies.\nBrad Bird did an amazing job, also telling the animators about his vision. The graphics are beautiful so much even the CGI food looks tasty, animations are detailed, (if anyone knows how long was it rendering each frame and whole movie i would like to know)  I think it was the last movie I saw with my dad when I was 8 and I really liked it, because it has something to give rather than a lot of CGI stuff that is made only for more money. It was about food and I like that, because every person can relate to that. Great movie",

The voice acting also fits the characters really well I personally couldnt see anyone else voice these characters. \n\nThe characters are fun to watch and are  extremely well written and portrayed. The characters are also very memorable  from Remy to Auguste Gusteau.\n\nThe cinematography fits the film really well and makes the style of the film really pop out. The film also has some really nice shots especially for an animated film. \n\nThe animation is exemplary and probably the best I have seen in a Pixar film to this date. The animation is vibrant, detailed and extremely good at getting the characters emotions across. \n\nThe settings in the film go from a farm house to a high class french restaurant. \n\nThe style in my opinion is really good from the colour design to the way the film plans out. I especially like the parts where Remy or somebody els is trying new or old food. I felt that it gave a very atmospheric and colourful representation of trying new food. \n\nThe film also has some very good dialogue from the way its spoken to the way its written. \n\nThe film also has some very unique and talented editing especially when their in the kitchen. \n\nThe film has a very steady and nice to listen to soundtrack which fits perfectly with the film.\n\nThe story follows Remy a rat who takes food properly getting lost from his family after being run out of their home. Remy then finds himself at one of the worlds most famous restaurants to become one of frances greatest cooks. \n\nThe film also has some comedy though far and between still has me laughing.\n\nThe film also has a really good atmosphere especially with the scenes in the kitchen. \n\nThe film in my opinion is also extremely enjoyable to watch again and again. \n\nThe film does have a couple small things wrong with it, but they barely take way from it.\n\nOver all I give it a 9/10 - my favourite Pixar film as of right now",

Brad Bird wrote and directed Ratatouille with his usual eye for usual shots and perspectives. His track record for excellent direction is inarguable now as The Iron Giant, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, The Incredibles, and now Ratatouille are all wonderful and unique. Ratatouille is a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe setting in Paris is so romantic and lovely. The romance and the adventure of cooking both work plot-wise. The animation is so fluid and colorful with more detail than you usually see in Pixar's repertoire. In fact, I think Ratatouille is the finest film Pixar has ever produced. It is funny and cute. Families will surely enjoy Ratatouille. The kids will love Remy the rat, while the adults will appreciate the more mature themes of family, love, and dreams.\n\nI must mention Camille's musical theme for Ratatouille, \"Le Festin\" is such a beautiful tribute to French Jazz and Chanson genres. It's a light and airy accompaniment to truly caring Parisian attitude and luxury. Le Festin is like a comfort food all on its own. Michael Giacchino's score is just as thrilling and romantic as Ratatouille's atmosphere and environment.\n\nLastly, the vocal talents are so fitting and mesmerizing in Ratatouille. Bird really cast apt voice actors for each role. Patton Oswalt just carries the film as Remy. He is thoughtful and sympathetic even though he plays a rat. His existential ruminations are quite charming. Ian Holm is genius as the greedy French Chef Skinner. His mad ravings and hectic delivery with his seedy French accent are captivating. Peter O'Toole's deep soothing voice as Anton Ego exemplify the harsh nature of critics as well as their deep reverence and joy for their chosen area of critique. Brad Garrett pulls of a very different charming and bubbly voice as the late Chef Gusteau. \n\nMany of the other supporting roles are very fun voices such as Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, and Will Arnett. But, I have to give respect to Brian Dennehy as Remy's rat father Django. Dennehy gives Django a serious weight and adds much appreciated grounded quality to Ratatouille.\n\nJust watch Ratatouille and have a good time during this animated feast!",

When fate places Remy in the city of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unwanted visitor in the kitchen at one of Paris' most exclusive restaurants, Remy forms an unlikely partnership with Linguini, the garbage boy, who inadvertently discovers Remy's amazing talents. They strike a deal, ultimately setting into motion a hilarious and exciting chain of extraordinary events that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down. Remy finds himself torn between following his dreams or returning forever to his previous existence as a rat. He learns the truth about friendship, family and having no choice but to be who he really is, a rat who wants to be a chef.\n\nWho doesn't have \"Ratatouille\" in the back of their minds as one of the more inspiring, fun animations of the past decade? I mean, come on, I practically grew up with this film and it just gets better with time. Hi, this film is \"Ratatouille\", an animated food porn show with a great story and great characters behind it. \n\nOne thing I love about this film is the heart. I think heart is something you need in not only movies in general, but in animations specifically. If you really think about it, this concept is ridiculous, but it's fun. With commitment, they can make this film not only believable, but make it something that both kids and adults can love. And you know what, they did it! This film is so inspiring and so relatable at the same time. It's something that lifts your spirits and keeps you engaged, which is props to the story and concept. \n\nEverything from the voice acting to the directing to the animation was great. Brad Bird has constantly given us some amazing stories with amazing directions and that can't be understated. Him, paired with this cast that brought the characters to life worked great. And then all that paired with some fluid, beautiful animation gives us a story that we can all enjoy. \n\nIn the end, \"Ratatouille\" was a fun, beautiful, and insightful animation that I'll enjoy for years to come.",

Overall, the film is a very \"feel good\" movie. It is about someone following their dreams and succeeding at them, which is something that is great to watch and explore. It made me think that it's nice to see a story of an unlikely hero succeeding. In terms of the story and writing, I felt that the film was incredibly well-done. I enjoyed that despite the father's distrust of humans, he chose to come through in the end and support Remy in his time of need. Acting-wise I thought that the actors picked out for the voices of the characters was spot on. I especially loved Patton Oswalt's Remy. I felt that he added a sincerity to the character that really shone through. Directed by Brad Bird, I felt that the shots chosen for the film were wonderful. I especially enjoyed the sequence when Remy gets distanced from his family and pulled down the sewage drain. It was such a great look into the world of a rat, and really set up Remy's misfortune before finding Linguine. The sewage sequence was also a great example of the animation of the film. I felt like everything was so realistic, and the colors were beautiful and well done. Overall, I enjoyed the film! It's such a classic, and one that I can watch over and over again.",

            "content": "\"Anyone can cook\"\n\n\tHave you ever wondered if rats have dreams and ambitions too? Well they do. A story focused around a rat wanting something more out of a stereotypical dumpster-diving life, Ratatouille is another Pixar masterpiece. The irony of a rat being the head chef and basically best chef in Paris just shows you that Brad Bird is on another level than other animators/directors when telling a story. Patton Oswalt voices the main character, Remy, a lovable, determined, and gifted rodent who aspires to be a cook. After being forced out of his home and separated from the rest of his family, Remy finds himself in the great food city of Paris. He later stumbles upon a human named Linguini who takes him in and together they help one another restore the tattered reputation of Gusteau's.\nThere are two recurring themes spread throughout the movie and these are exceeding expectations and doubt of capability. The quote that is scattered throughout the movie is \"Anyone can cook\". This means exceeding expectations that others have on you. The two themes of this movie go hand-and-hand. When others doubt your capability you have to exceed their expectations they have in order to be successful. Remy's father doubted his ability to be a cook numerous times throughout the movie. He explained that humans are dangerous by showing him the dangerous contraptions humans have to kill rats; therefore he shouldn't go near them. He is very unsupportive of Remy's dream until the very end where he saw how perseverant and passionate he was. Another scene from the movie where doubt is evident is when Anton Ego, the food critic, builds up hype around his second visit to Gusteau's. He doubts Gusteau's ability to serve him a decent meal and when he's served the Ratatouille meal, he is overcome with joy and is eager to meet the chef (Remy). The ability of Pixar to capture this moment that Ego has of flashing back to a childhood memory and comparing the meal to the warmth and safety of his home relates to all of us so well. Anton Ego indirectly doubted Remy, a rat, to prepare him a delicious meal and when he met Remy, it was apparent that Gusteau's famous quote \"Anyone can cook\" was true. Pixar does such a wonderful job in all of their movies with this where, with careful observation, there are hidden messages that directly translate to the real world. If you are truly passionate about something, then go for it. There's going to be periods of doubt you or others might have in you, but you need to overcome those doubts in order to exceed expectations. \nI love Pixar because it has an amazing ability to hit every emotion in such a brilliant way that makes it standout from other animation companies. Their ability to create a relationship/connection between the characters and the audience makes their storytelling so tremendous. The genre may say children and family, but these movies are truly for all ages. Giving his review on Gusteau's at the end of Ratatouille, Anton Ego says, \"I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.\" This movie will do just that; Ratatouille is so good and you will be left wanting more, and that is why I highly recommend seeing it.",

But this is the first time I\u0092ve watched the entire thing from start to finish since it was out in theaters.  I love the characters in Ratatouille, and the journey that Remy and Linguini go on through the story.  The voice cast is spectacular, particularly the amazing addition of Peter O\u0092Toole as a condescending food critic.  The animation of the food looks spectacular in the movie (it always makes me hungry) and the massive amount of research about French cuisine that the writers and artists put in pays off big time.  I always feel that Ratatouille is just a little too long, though.  I feel like they could have easily cut all the confrontation between Remy and his own family and the movie would be perfectly streamlined.  That added level of conflict is wasted because no one watching needs to be reminded that rats don\u0092t fit in with humans, and that Remy\u0092s behavior is unusual.  The movie has a great conclusion, though, and I have the biggest smile on my face after the little epilogue.

Patton Oswalt is perfect for the role of Remy especially seeing how Remy's more famous than him nowadays (I did like his Netlix stand-up comedy Talking for Clapping though). The animation, like any Pixar film, is great. The film offers a more lighthearted outing from Bird in case parents think The Incredibles would've been a bit too nuts for their children. However, the thing I liked the most is the presence of the mouth-watering dishes in the film including a variation of the titular dish in the final act. A Pixar film that's funny as well as boasting an unlikely hero that teaches kids \"anyone can cook\" regardless of whether they're human or not (shame it's just a cartoon and animals probably can't do so due to their lack of thumbs, ah well).",

Adding detail to our protagonist Remy in his animation as well as the food, decor and atmosphere of Paris.

It's a 'grumpy dad' v 'rebellious son' antic for drama. Been there, done that.\n\nOther than that, Ratatouille shines a spotlight on culture, criticism and creativity from unexpected sources.

Ratatouille has an inspiring message of \"anyone can cook\", (or anyone can be whatever they dream to be) and don't judge a book by its cover. That sounds like two clich\u00e9 life lessons but Brad Bird tells it in such an abstract way. The gorgeous backdrop of Paris and the beautiful French song Le Festin along with the score make this genuinely heart-warming and inspiring. Kids enjoy the adventure but adults enjoy the deeper meaning.",

            "content": "Ratatouille is a 2007 animated film produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Jan Pinkava and Brad Bird, and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n      The movie is set in Paris, where Remy, an ambitious young rat, aspires to be a cook, following the footsteps of his idol, Auguste Gusteau. Despite his family's wishes and the irony of being a rat in the environment of a kitchen, Remy finds a way to become a successful chef, as he meets Alfredo Linguini, who works as a garbage man at Gusteau's former sous-chef's restaurant. The hardworking rat discovers that he can control Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair, which leads them to build a mutually-beneficial relationship.\n      Linguini, who turns out to be Gusteau's illegitimate son, gains the ownership of the restaurant, stengthening his disparities with the former owner. Meanwhile, France's top food critic, Anton Ego, who already had bad history with Gusteau, announces he will be re-reviewing the restaurant. That, in the midst of stormy relationships and moral conflicts, leaves Alfredo in a delicate situation.\nIn an adventure of familly conflict, unusual relationships and overcoming obstacles, Ratatouille proves to be an incredibly well scipted work of art. It shows the connection that can be brought by differences an the persistent chase for a dream. The movie also portrays beautiful sceneries and cityscapes, and it immerses you in a sensory experience of visuals, tastes and smells. All in all, Ratatouille is a great film tht can be enjoyed by the whole family.",

            "content": "My thoughts on RATATOUILLE\n\nAs another animated film being directed by Brad Bird, there was no denying the fact that this was going to be great, especially when coming from Pixar. It didn't seem like an idea that kids would be interested in, a rat who wants to be a chef. But they would probably still enjoy it. It's a pretty odd idea too, since these two things obviously don't go together.\n\nAs a kid, I liked it fine. I just thought it was cute seeing a rat wanting to become a chef, but never thought why or how, I just accepted the idea and went along with it. But, like any Pixar movie, I really started to understand the story as I got older and I get something new out of it every time I watch it. The idea of a rat wanting to cook makes sense when the moral of the story is that anyone can cook. Obviously, it's not possible for a rat to cook, but the moral represents that even the most unlikely people can become a chef or whatever occupation they're going for, exceeding expectations. I LOVE the dialogue written in this movie, it is so compelling and thought-provoking. It's especially interesting for people who are willing to become a chef or wanting to judge something, which explains why I love listening to the dialogue, I'm judging something right now.\n\nThe animation makes the film's atmosphere feel so delightful. The warm and rich colors in the backgrounds make every single shot look like something out of a beautiful painting. Just look at those shots of Paris, they are gorgeous! Add Michael Giacchino's brilliant score and you feel like you're really in Paris. Oh, and the food... I can't even describe enough how amazing the food looks! Just looking at it makes me want to salivate. Warning, do not watch this film on an empty stomach. And the character designs on the humans look very creative and cartoony, and you can tell since Brad Bird directed the movie. It gives the characters a lot more personality and makes them memorable.\n\nBut are the characters interesting? Well, not all of them. The characters that I think are the most interesting are the side-characters, but they aren't given enough screen time. They give the other chefs these really interesting backstories and makes me want to learn more about them and see more of their interactions, but they're mostly set off to the sideline. The film is mostly centered on the friendship between Remy and Linguini, which I don't think is nearly as interesting. Linguini is just your typical dork who is looking for a job, nothing about really makes him stand out. The head chef, who is the villain, is not very interesting either, he just wants to capture the rat to keep the restaurant from closing down. But his motivations are understandable, he's just following orders.\n\nAnother problem is that I think there are a few too many subplots. There's a conspiracy about who really owns the restaurant, there's a critic who wants to shut down the restaurant by giving it a bad review, there's a realization that Linguini is in fact the son of the now dead owner of the restaurant, there's a romance between Linguini and Colette, and the head chef gets fired who then wants to take down the restaurant as well. That's a little too complicated for kids and even adults to follow. That's one of the few weaknesses of Brad Bird's work, that even though the story is well though out and well written, the narrative structure isn't very flowing. I mean, it works fine, but maybe it could've been easier to follow if after one or two more rewrites.\n\nBut that in no way says that I don't like RATATOUILLE, I actually love it. Yeah, I think there are some serious flaws with the film, but there are so many good things about it, and it works unbelievably well. The music, the animation, the dialogue, the FOOD, and the overall atmosphere still makes this a very solid Pixar film.\n\nGrade: A-",

Some people may take this following remark as very personal and unreasonable, but here is the thing: I don't have tolerance for stupid human characters. How Linguini talks and behaves really got on my nerves; for almost the entire time, I just wanted him to be more confident and don't walk as if his muscles are made of spaghetti. Patton Oswalt, as Remy, brings depth and laughter to this film, Peter O'Toole is excellent as Anton Ego, and Michael Giacchino's score is simply beautiful.

            "content": "Being Brad Bird's follow up to his amazing animated film The Incredibles, Ratatouille demanded my viewing.\n\nI've seen Ratatouille so many times in my life that by this point it is probably my 10th viewing, but I can happily say that still to this day it manages to entertain me in almost all the ways that I could hope. The only criticisms of the film would be that there is not too much creativity put into the Rat-themed universe due to the focus being predominantly on Remy's relationship with Alfredo Linguini. Due to the film suggesting that the only contact they can have comes from the physical engagements, there is not much room for banter between them when there could have been. And although the film was able to go a long way on the basis of the physical relationship they share with all its slapstick merits, I felt like the theme of banter between characters was not explored well enough. There is a universe full of potential in Ratatouille but I felt it ended up rather limited to a small scale setting and few characters. All in all, the premise in Ratatouille does not have as much creativity as it could or any sense of adventure as it goes for more of a comic relief angle the entire time, and it works in doing so at the expense of the sense of adventure synonymous with many other Disney Pixar film. The scale of the tale is very small even if it has some brief moments where it goes beyond the boundaries of its setting, but it is a thoroughly well written feature with a hilariously clever screenplay and a lot of fun characters to boot which is later converted into an unforgettable experience by the wonderful animation of the film.\nThe animation in Ratatouille is exquisite. After wowing everybody with The Incredibles, Brad Bird returns to amaze viewers once more with the animation in Ratatouille. Capitalising on the French setting of the story, Ratatouille maintains a beautiful sense of scenery by using traditional French buildings and streets as the basis for the story. Everything is very detailed and while the colour of the film is somewhat monotonous in a realistic manner, the actual detail on all the scenery is beautiful. With different tones of colour blended and extensively detailed three dimensional animations, Ratatouille is a wonderful visual experience. The quality of the three dimensional animation is stunning with all the character movements and such being so organic even when they move by in very quick pans. And all this is put into the charming design of the characters who all maintain their own iconic elements such as the cute little rat at the heart of the story or the stereotypically French antagonist with a comically short stature. Due to these character elements and the way Brad Bird puts them to clever use in the story, the main sense of humour in Ratatouille comes from the visual slapstick of the feature. The quantity and quality of all the slapstick more than makes up for the somewhat simple nature of the premise as there is plenty of clever visual humour used in the contrasting size of the rats and the human beings, but most importantly the way that Remy controls Alfredo Linguini like a marionette puppet. The entire concept is a hilarious one, and Brad Bird is able to find creative situations to put that into which successfully stretches it all over the 111 minute running time without ever getting stale. The visual gags of Ratatouille make it a thoroughly fun experience, and it is really the best thing that the film has to boast about in the end. Ratatouille is full of unforgettable imagery and detailed animation, and to add atmosphere to the experience of the film there is a beautiful musical score which is culturally appropriate in fitting the French setting of the film. All in all, Ratatouille looks good and sounds good, and the voice cast plays its role in ensuring the latter.\nPatton Oswalt is perfect for portraying Remy. While he is known for his whiny persona from many films and television series such as The King of Queens, he adds elements of that to his voice work in Ratatouille while combining a true sense of energy with a passionate sense of articulation for speaking about food. Patton Oswalt speaks with the mind of a true chef in Ratatouille which makes it all the more funny for the fact that he is portraying a rat since he is thoroughly dedicated to playing it as legitimate. Patton Oswalt is spot on in Ratatouille.\nLou Romano is also spot on in capturing the awkward nature of Alfredo Linguini. With a tone in his voice of constant uncertainty, Lour Romano manages to grasp his role firmly and play around with it. As it is his job to share chemistry with a silent rat, he has a lot weighing on his shoulders, yet he easily spearheads it with a perfect effort. Mainly coming from his interactions with fellow talented voice actors Janeane Garofalo and Ian Holm, Lou Romano brings a likable role to Ratatouille which becomes the source of plenty of vocal humour in the film.\t\nPeter O'Toole is also incredibly dedicated in capturing the sadistic nature of Anton Ego. He delivers his lines with such a raw power which comes in a subtle format and combines with the sophisticated nature of the character. His edginess is very dark and his tone of voice is appropriately commanding which makes him a cleverly manipulative antagonist who finds ways to dominate the screen in the snobbish way he speaks. Peter O'Toole takes on a nice contrast playing the antagonist for once, and it is very welcoming to have such a legendary actor on board.\n\nSo Ratatouille has some minor story flaws to it, but with astoundingly incredible animation and a hilarious sense of slapstick comedy, Brad Bird directs another winning feature from Disney Pixar.",

An interesting and funny story about a rat that relates to humans, helping one of them from being almost worthless to almost \u00e2??looking like\u00e2?? more of a success. It well defines the purpose that people are pretty much aways much more than they may look or seem, mixed in with a theme that both movie critics and food critics can practically gorge to.

It may not be all that well remembered compared to Pixar\u00e2??s other films (as it has seemed), but either way, it does have a very inspiring story and quite an interesting plot.

However the atmosphere of the film, both in its food and enviornment, are thing you wish were in other films. Beauty is something that most of Hollywood ignores, but not Pixar. Also Ego is one of the most memorable villains of any movie. He is no physical threat (being a frail old man), he doesn't appear in most of the film and he technically isn't a villain- just some guy doing his job. However his mere presence and personality dominate all the scenes that he is in- a perfect trait for any good film character,",

His hero is a lovable chef named Gusteau who owns a 5 star restaurant and has written a book named \"Anyone Can Cook\". This inspires Remy, whom in the rat world, is somewhat of a legend for his ability to sniff out rat poison and save his loving family from getting sick.\n\n The visuals in this movie have distinct depth, crisp sound and quality,almost 3 dimensional pictures which is the best of all the Pixar masterpieces. The movie envelopes the senses and takes you on a journey with Remy through the sewers and pipes and riding the book called Anyone can cook, to become a great chef in Paris.\n\n By this time the sinister food critic Anton Ego brilliantly played by Peter O'Toole has reduced Gusteau's restaurant to 4 stars causing Gusteau to fall into a deep sadness and death. The restaurant drops to 3 stars and a new person Linguini makes his way into their kitchen as a bumbling garbage and dish washer as he follows his quest just to have a job.\n\n The character development of the restaurant kitchen chefs are outstanding. We meet the sinister, short Napoleonic chef named Skinner. His goal is to profit from the great name of Gusteau to a line of fast food item bearing the resturants name.\n\n The love interest is spot on named Collette who has the fire to take on the boys as a brilliant chef. She helps Linguini who bungles through all tasks given to him to keep him employed.\n\n The irony is that Linguini has no talent as a chef and Remy does. Remy controls Linguini under his chef's hat by pulling his hair like a puppet and turns Gusteaus' back into the top place to be in Paree.\n\n The conflict begins as Remy's rat family tears him between his life as a rat, loyalty to his family and friends and his love of cooking. \n\n The one roadblock left to gaining the 5 stars back is to please Anton Ego and its brilliant the way O'Toole brings us to his love of food and distain for happiness but wrapped in the coffin like home Anton vows to take down Gusteaus' brilliant new chef Linguini. The end result is outstanding visual story telling at its best.\n\n The best Pixar effort yet, outstanding from start to finish. This bridges the gap and I haven't pulled for the rats this much since the movie Williard and the rat named Ben.\n\n The kiss between Collette and Linguini is magical and the best line comes from Linguini after his dad says \"you can't change nature\" Remy says, \"change is nature\".\n\n So like the great food critic Anton Ego states, \"Surprise me\". Ratatouille is a delicious surprise. \n\n Well done and take the whole family to see. A feast for the eyes.",

It follows the story of Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat with a keen sense of smell and a love for cooking. He comes across Linguini, a talentless cook who is desperate for a stable job. The two team-up and work in Gusteau's, a once top restaurant in France. They face an amusing antagonist, desperate to find out the secret of Linguini's exceptional talent for cooking. But Brad Bird is not stupid, as soon as he gets kicks out one villain, he ups the conflict by introducing another more sinister villain, Anton Ego, voiced brilliantly by Peter O' Toole. To top it off, Ratatouille matches The Incredibles fast, fun pacing that goes hand in hand with an excellent score.",

The dialogs are strong and well thought out. The scenario impeccable and won't let you go once its starts. The voice acting is superb. All of it, pure Pixar.\n\nOn an interesting note: apparently, they finally got the hang of animating wet fur, and seem pretty close on getting it for wet hair.\n\nThe only negative thing I can find is that Skinner and Anton Ego are both designed a bit too strongly on the \"evil\" side, which is not a habit for Pixar.

He is able to determine what is in a dish, and is able to tell that a dish needs something to improve it just by the scent. \r\n\r\nHis family doesn't understand because, let's face it, they're rats. He gets inspiration from a popular human chef (voiced by Brad Garrett) who believes that anybody can cook. and looks for a way to show off his talent. \r\n\r\nHe finds a garbage boy (voiced by Lou Romano), and uses his hands (by literally controlling the human's arms by pulling his hair as if they were connected) to create his creations that brings \"Gusteau\", the restaurant named after and once owned by the late master chef the rat idolizes, back to the popularity it once had. \r\n\r\nNow, the two have to keep their work together a secret and join forces when the master chef that took over the restaurant when \"Gusteau\" died wants to use \"Gusteau's\" name for financial gain with inferior frozen food products leaning to international dishes. \r\n\r\nWell, Pixar has done it again. They have produced a visually amazing world right down to the littlest detail. They nailed it when they animated the rats' movements right down to the movement of the hair over the muscles. The humans however lean toward a more cartoonish look, and look like they're made out of plastic and much of their movement is more cartoonish than realistic looking. \r\n\r\nThere are strong performances from the actors in this film. However, there was a problem with the French accents. The characters who were suppose to be French had obviously fake accents to no accent at all. \r\n\r\nAnother problem with this movie was that there was very little laughs in this movie. Of the laughs that are in the movie, it comes from physical comedy more than anything else. \r\n\r\nI also didn't like the storyline surrounding \"Skinner\", the master chef of the restaurant who wants to turn the name \"Gusteau\" into an inferior product, after \"Remy\" helps the now-former garbage boy, \"Alfredo Linguini\" become the head chef of the restaurant, thus kicking \"Skinner\" to the curb. I thought \"Skinner\" trying to prove \"Linguini\" to be a fraud was just done poorly. \r\n\r\nAnother poorly done subplot was the love story between two characters. I personally can't stand when one-hald of the love story doesn't realize they are attracted to the other side of the plotline until something happens that makes them realize they are in love. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty forgettable in this movie. None of the music was memorable like in what is possibly the most popular movie in Pixar and Disney's history, \"Toy Story\". \r\n\r\nI really can't recommend this one for adults. However, it's a good time-waster for the kids.",

In this film we experience a daring but clever rat who finds his way to become one of France's greatest chefs where he follows the steps of the beloved Gusteau who is voiced by Brad Garrett.\nRatatouille is an instant classic in which everyone should watch and cherish upon. This clever plot and tremendous animation will have the audience gaze upon the beautiful scenes, well-fitted dialogue and superb voice acting. I don't even want to talk about the plot any word more, it is absolutely gorgeous and is a MUST see for anyone who hasn't already seen this brilliantly crafted film. The memorable characters, and the stunning animation (need I say more) is a reason why director Brad Bird is in top of his game. Ratatouille is fast paced and is a reason why films are enjoyed.\nThere are many laughs and well many heart warming scenes. This movie will make you hungry, and hungry for more of Disney's finest masterpieces like ratatouille. 5 out of 5 for Brad Birds wondrous film which personally, is my favorite film of all time.",

Some of the landscape scenes are beginning to look real, these Pixar guys are amazing. The story is well structured, original and fresh and the characters are lovable, funny and memorable.

It's just not as compelling to me as the others, but there were some great laugh out loud moments and I did catch some references to classic Looney Tunes and possibly a tip of the hat (weirdly) to \"When Harry Met Sally\".

Along the lines with the more recent 'Chef,' 'Ratatouille' is a love letter for food, except this one does it with more cleverness, humor, and that classic Pixar class.  It does so well for me that it has gone down as one of my favorite Pixar films of all-time.  As someone who has traveled to Paris recently, 'Ratatouille' captures the perceived romance and beauty of the city perfectly.  Paris also happens to have some spectacular food.  I was even more impressed when I learned that certain buildings were modeled after actual buildings in Paris, such as Gusteau's and the storefront showing the dead rats.  Yes, there are a lot of rats in Paris.  Aside from this you have some pretty great characters.  Remy voiced by Patton Oswalt is the embodiment of Chef Gusteau's \"Anyone can cook.\"  A rat who uses his talent to defeat the odds, Remy is a likable and a hero you can root for.  Lou Romano does a perfect job playing the dopey, but sincere Linguini.  One of the best characters has to be Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego.  Hearing the late Hollywood legend droll on as the thin, vampire-like food critic is quite the treat.  Of course, Pixar delivers when it comes to visuals.  The food looks so good that you simply want to take it off the screen and take a bite.  This film has humor, heart, and even some dark comedy to boot.  As a film both kids and adults can enjoy, I give this Pixar masterpiece my highest rating.",
