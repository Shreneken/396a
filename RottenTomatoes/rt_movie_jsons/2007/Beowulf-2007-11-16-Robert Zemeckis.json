He successfully slays the beast but thus incurs the wrath of Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), a creature as vicious and vengeful as she is seductive.",

But Robert Zemeckis is a director above just providing the entertainment in a movie. Here he takes a gripping approach to the character and finds the humanity beneath legend. The actors are all terrific across the board, bringing each of their (motion-captured) animated characters to life. It's a vivid and gothic dark ages tale, a hero's quest with full-blooded psychological underpinnings, and the most gorgeous looking animated film of 2007",

            "content": "What do you get when you take a good poem and add strange romantic subplots and make the main protagonists responsible for all of the destruction?  You get this movie.  Allow me to elaborate (Alert: This review contains spoilers).\n    Firstly, this movie creates a strange romantic quadrilateral between Hrothgar and Beowulf (the book protagonists), the Queen, and Grendel's Mother.  Plus, there are many other odd romantic encounters within the movie.  Nothing like that is in the book.  In fact, as far as I remember, there is not a mention of sex within the book (if there was, it was very brief).  This quadrilateral+ creates abusive situations for the queen and others, which again, was not in the book.\n    Secondly, this movie makes the main book protagonists responsible for all of the destruction.  This is because in the movie, Hrothgar and Beowulf are the fathers of the two monsters, a dragon and a giant humanoid, who cause all of the damage because they were seduced by Grendel's Mother (despite the strange genetic mechanics of all of this).  In the book, that was not true.  In the book, Hrothgar was a good king who brought prosperity to his people.  In the movie, he is an incompetent drunkard.  They really went out of their way to tear down these two characters.      So what does all of this mean?  Why did they distort things so much?  I think it is because they wanted to change the theme.  The theme of the book is that humans can be great if they act bravely and strongly.  The theme of the movie is that male sexual desires INEVITABLY (caps for emphasis) cause the destruction of society and create abusive situations for others.  To make that massive theme shift, almost a 180, they had to create and distort events from the book.\n     That theme shift alone makes this movie worthy of a 1-star review.  But, even if it were standalone (not connected to the book), I wouldn't give it any more stars.  The mechanics of the events in the movie were awkward (didn't make since with each other), the cinema was reminiscent of a video game cutscene, and the plot was still awkward and not compelling.\n     So, even if you tried to disconnect the movie from the book, it would be worth 1-star.  Connected to the book, it is surely 1-star.  It is unfortunate that a fairly good epic poem has to be associated with a movie like this.",

Anyone (like myself) hoping to glean what Beowulf is will get serious mixed signals.  Better to completely revamp the plot line like the Christopher Lambert movie so people know it isn't going to follow any actual poem plot points.\n\tAnimation I am sure is very advanced for 2007, but it is going to date the movie over time, and I don't know why they even used it.  Sure you need animation for a dragon, but to roast a pig?  Also I didn't realize why images came very close to the screen until I read this movie was meant to see in 3D - it is dstracting to watch in 2D.\n\tI am not a fan of Angelina Jolie, and while you can excuse Beowulf for pausing, even an idiot would know not to stick his penis in a light socket.

However, note that some people will be surprised by how bloody and gory this film is in spite of earning a PG-13 rating in the US and a 12A rating in Britain.

For some odd reason the critics liked this go around but the audiences weren't fooled and clearly they were right, as Beowulf has faded almost entirely from the public eye ever since it was released. This movie is such an incredible abortion I'm surprised the conservatives didn't try and ban it entirely.",

In the right light, it almost works and is almost believeable, but these scenes are few and far between, instead you get scenes that look like they came out of Playstation 2 cutscene.\n\nI'm not usually hard on cinematography or animation style but this movie looks downright bad to a point where it has a debilitating effect on the rest of the movie.

            "content": "If the Norse fantasy, filled with drink, women and demons enchants you, why wouldnt it, then Beowulf may just be worth you time and money. This simple story propels itself with its outlandish action sequences and mythology, that it is quite easy to be whisked away by its charms, much like the films antagonist. In the time of yesteryear when kings ruled the land, monsters and demons plagued the forests and the seas and warrior were rife, King Hrothgar and his kingdom are troubled by Grendel, a violent and gruesome beast that doesnt take kindly to the tunes and soul from the kingdom, decimating all in its path. After one atrocious attack, The King sends a message to all warriors, any man who can kill the Grendel shall receive an almighty treasure. It doesnt take long before Beowulf and his men show up to aid The King, defeating the Grendel and saving the land, however Grendel is the least of Beowulf's worries when his demon mother finds out and strings Beowulf's men up, leaving him no choice but to encounter her. Simple yet effective, the film has a tonne of subtext which is wonderfully woven throughout by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery's script. The dialogue is hearty and carries a weight to it, the script also knows however when to allow visuals to do the work, and for this Beowul exceeds many an animated film, it doesnt need to spell everything out, even if its easy to get lost in mythology and rather difficult to pronounce names. The cast is super brilliant, Ray Winestone is marvelous as Beowulf, thundering out lines like a warrior, yet managing to emote with a secret and insecure side. Anthony Hopkins does a marvelous job as the king, Hopkins is always magical and here he does what weve come to expect from him, however there are at points time when his dialogue is extremely hard to follow, due to the nature of his hybrid scottish/welch accent. Brendan Gleeson is marvelous and subtle as Beowulf's right hand man, John Malkovich is sinister and marvelous as the cowardly kings aid and Crispin Glover smacks the weird out the park as the Grendel himself. This isnt just a film for the men however as female talent in the form of Angelina Jolie as the seductive demon, Robin Wright as the Queen and Alison Lohman all turn in equally powerful and contrasting roles, adding an even bigger weight to the men's escapeds. The women give the piece a sense of vunerability and hope, it really is testament to great casting and terrific writing. Robert Zemekis also must get a pat on the back for executing such a visually stunning, if not slightly dated CGI adventure, that flings and slides the \"camera\" into places you need to be. Rather than stick to conventional animation, here Zemekis mixes mo-cap with CGI, giving the whole feel and look a living and breathing element to it. Scenes are made more nail biting with slow tracking shots towards characters as we allow the facial work to emote exactly what is going on and make no mistake about it, this is a pretty dark and disturbing piece. The music steals the show however, for all the good work done visually, the audio is of such a high caliber its impossible not to get goosebumps on the back of your neck, with loud drums, pounding bass and atmospheric strings, it gives a serious sense of scale to the entire thing. For all its wonderment and boldness, the film does lack in a few departments. As mentioned earlier the animation is stunning, even now, however in places it seems mismatched, for example Angelina Jolie's face seems to come across as the most photo realistic out of all, its okay when compared with Winstones gruff exterior but with Grendel and some of the other female models, it really stands out to have had a lot more work done, it feels slightly inconsistent at times, luckily her face is not seen for a massive portion of the film. Her inclusion although essential is also not explained very well, she doesnt have a name, that i heard, were never quite sure what or where she came from, nor what she really is. Why does she have such problems? It's hinted at from time to time but never set in stone. Also the movie time hops a huge chunk of timeline and although it does a grand enough job of holding Beowulfs character arc in the foreground other characters get lost in the shadows. Malkovich, Wright and Lohman all just seem like something huge has went on, however we the viewer were not and never will be privy to that information, its a minor gripe as your imagination can surely fill in the blanks, i for one would have loved to have maybe had some more chunkier support exposition. Also sometimes characters reasoning's can become questionable or even hint at some foreboding subtext that never comes to fruitation, watching this film, i cannot help but feel that there was a much larger film in here somewhere. Despite these niggles, Beowulf is enjoyable, wonderfully epic and full of adventure, it might not make a whole lot of sense for those unaware of the source material and it can some times leave you feeling a bit lost as to character motivations, the animation, execution and acting are all done to a caliber that is hard to dislike.",

The dragon no longer mystifies us with a time long past; a time of wonder and limitless mountains, but becomes another opportunity to bring up more laughable violence as a cheap replacement for valor. Beowulf, the hero loses all his honor, as he now becomes the enemy of everything he once stood for. The most telling line from this movie is when the king, in response to the idea of Praying to Jesus, says \"what we need is a (real) hero.\" Truly, if the director and screenwriter's point was to show the folly of trusting in man rather than in God, then their point is well received and valid. But if the point of the movie was to get us to respect the Hero known as Beowulf and to give us a good representation of the Ancient Epic Poem, they have fallen very short and all semblances are rendered lifeless.

Seriously, Ray Winstone's Beowulf is an incredibly loud hero. He wants you to know how proud and mighty he is, and to me, this is an example of the kind of fantasy hero we need. The entire film is made with computer models that are animated with motion capture techniques. While it is unique to see an animated film employ motion capture technology in this way, I find that the 3D animation doesn't really match up to some other films that came out before this film. However, the film's flaws can be forgiven, thanks to the film's pleasantly violent action scenes, and the ending was climactic and satisfying.",

            "content": "With the look of being an awesome visual effects action adventure, Beowulf sounded like an awesome experience.\n\nThe animation in Beowulf rests on a line between realistic and animated which is likely to appeal to some but perhaps leave others finding it strange. While on first sight I found it to be animation much like in Shrek and wasn't amazed by it, as time went on and the action began to kick off I found it to be awesome and very innovative. While some of the characters looked lot like the people from the Shrek movies and some of the scenes such as the epic dragon sequence are rather reminiscent of Shrek in visual style which make it rather derivative, as a whole the animation in Beowulf was thoroughly impressive.\nAlthough the design of some characters, particularly the female characters in Beowulf with the exception of Grendel's mother looks rather generic, there is so much excellent detail in the animation which makes it an impressive film, and there is no denying that the efforts of Robert Zemeckis have grown in his many years as the creator of so many animated films. And so of course it is no surprise that it is him who presents the groundbreaking animation to the film. Although occasionally some movements are stiff, considering the quality of the scenery and the way that the film has its characters look both like humans and animated characters at the same time as they journey through the universe of the film is really refreshing. I was very pleased with the look of Beowulf because of the animation which clearly spent its $150 million budget on the most important aspects of the film. In comparison to the 2001 big budget CGI film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Beowulf massively triumphs the standard for computer animation by giving the movement of everything a much more organic look while also ensuring that everything looked the most genuine it could possibly be for an animated film of such complex context. Frankly, Beowulf is an unforgettable visual experience which captures a strong colour palette for the setting of its mystical universe and puts it into context that is so easily convincing that it is a very appealing film. As far as fantasy films go, Beowulf sets a new standard for the quality of them by making its film entirely built out of visual effects and putting it to great use for most of the time. Although admittedly there were a few scenes that were extensively long without any action which were a little bit boring, Beowulf triumphed that by making it up to viewers with some awesome action scenes. Although there could stand to be a little more, all the mystical creatures and swordfighters clash fairly hard in Beowulf which supplied a lot of entertainment to me as a fan of sword and sorcery as well as fantasy action films. While Beowulf needed a little less conversation and a little more action, it was a well scripted feature which managed to ensure that when the action hit it was thoroughly effective. So Robert Zemeckis' ambitious animated adaptation of the epic poem manages to exceed the low quality of many of the other adaptations of the story and turns itself into a front for exceptional visual effects while not skimping on intelligent writing or storytelling, and it manages to keep entertaining for a fairly consistent basis throughout. And combined with the visuals is a powerful and intense musical score which dramatises things well and captures the epic scale of the story well at the same time which made the story even more effective. And though some viewers will be thrown off by the slow plot and some scenes which are rather randomly silly, audiences who can appreciate how it stays true to its source material while working as sufficient entertainment at the same time will have a strong appreciation for Beowulf.\nAnd though the cast are all animated, they manage to give some very good performances which shows them interacting with the universe excellently and making it very convincing.\nRay Winstone gives a great look to the titular protagonist Beowulf. Although I was not familiar with his name before seeing Beowulf, it is easy to remember him for his heroic look in the film and the way that through the strength of motion capture technology into an awesome performance. His unflinching strength as Beowulf gives him the credible skill of a Spartan and the way he fights his way through dragons and giants is awesome. He makes a hell of an action hero and puts a dedicated ferocity into his performance which strengthens it and gives the film a great lead to play the hero. Ray Winstone nails the part and his voice articulation has a gritty strength to it which altogether make him perfect for the role of Beowulf and ensure that he makes the character unforgettable from a visual perspective.\nJohn Malkovich was also a great member to have on board in Beowulf, and Angelina Jolie also supplies a strange sort of seductiveness to her role as Grendel's mother which manages to hypnotise the mood of her situations and leave them lingering somewhere between erotic and horrific. Her simple attractive look and tone of voice was able to execute that kind of mood with ease, and it made her an effective addition to the cast.\nCrispin Glover's voice didn't seem all that appropriate to the role of Grendel though. While physically he was fine, whenever he spoke it seemed like some kind of joke that he would be given the role because it certainly breathes no strength or intimidation into the role of Grendel. He is the only real casting flaw.\n\nSo while Beowulf isn't a perfect film, it tells its story on the scale of an awesome fantasy action adventure which is well acted and serves as a front for the awesome age of computer generated visual effects that we live in today and reminds us just how skilled Robert Zemeckis is at telling a story.",

Killing several villagers, the monster puts an end to the party. When Goat leader Beowulf (Winstone), his right-hand Wiglaf (Gleeson) and a dozen of his most loyal men arrive, he promises Hrothgar and his wife Wealtheow (Wright) to defeat Grendel.

The following night Beowulf, who is naked because wants to fight Grendel as his equal, and his men await for the troll to come. After a fierce battle, the Goat warrior is victorious.

Zemeckis used the same technique he used in his 2004 Christmas tale 'The Polar Express', in which everything, including human characters, are computer-animated using motion capture. The film portrays the characters more realistically and with much depth as compared to the original poem, which is rather fanciful. Overall, the tale speaks of how men will become weak when lust for an attractive woman is involved. Roger Avary and renown author Neil Gaiman have done a great job adapting the poem, thus creating more 3-dimensional characters and a much more plausible story line. The visuals look good (though occasionally quite flawed) and Alan Silvestri's score is splendid. Pretty hard to tell for acting because everything in the film is computer-animated, though using motion capture. Even Angelina Jolie looks irresistibly gorgeous and lustrous. They must have done something to her lips. Overall, an enjoyable film.",
