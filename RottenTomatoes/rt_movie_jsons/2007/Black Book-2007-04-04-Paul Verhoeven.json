There was unnecessary nudity to the point that the film was trying to be a porno. The characters were almost all unlikeable, and many could have been developed better, but the acting was reasonable. The gory action was entertaining, but it only made up a small portion of the film, with the runtime being too lengthy. The cinematography, editing, and visual effects were average,  the sets/props/costumes were fine, and the soundtrack was forgettable but fit.",

            "content": "On its surface, Black Book is a relatively conventional WWII drama with added thriller-mystery twists to capitalize on the hidden loyalties of Resistance fighting and Verhoeven's penchant for explicitness to differentiate it. However, there is a greater significance lurking beneath the surface, as the writer-director uses the dangerous backdrop as a criticism of the black-and-white view of politics and morality in wartime, drawing distinct parallels between characters of supposedly conflicting loyalties and creating a diverse cast of characters with very different motivations. Still, there is an undeniable pulp to the narrative that does feel like something of a detractor; driving events in the plot are occasionally not entirely sensical and often out of character. A bit odd to call the film 'Black Book' when the object that the title refers to is introduced with barely a half hour remaining in the film's hefty runtime. Though there are some early hints of promise, Verhoeven never seems to really exploit the massive potential for suspense inherent to the premise. A bit overstuffed but far from a bad film. (3/5)",

But what was hard to believe was the text that said in the beginning - based on real life events. Were they just referring to WWII in the backdrop? Though Carice van Houten gives her best shot, this multidimensional dream character was never converted to an Oscar vehicle. \n\nBackdrop is Denmark has come under Nazi rule and Jews are fleeing the country. Carice van Houten (Rachel Stein) is a Jew living in hiding. When her hideout is blown, she tries to make a run out of the country. She gets together with her family and gets on a boat. Rachel alone escapes a ruthless slaughter when a German patrol boat intercepts them. After she smuggles herself back into the city helped by a resistance group, she decides to fight for their cause. Her role is to setup a honey trap to a German Captain and assumes a new identity as Ellis de Vries. \n\nCarice van Houten fits the role perfectly upon her looks where she has to be equally cute, sexy and generous on nudity. Production values were extravagant for bringing an authentic feel to the period. With too many melodramatic moments and a highly commercial approach to presentation has not done enough justice to live up to the words in the beginning 'Based on real life events'. The resistance group is full of caricature characters you will find in any sort of group - an aggressor, a thinker, a comedian, a guilt driven paranoid etc. The dilemmas, perspectives and consequences that happen on the immediate aftermath of German surrender to the Allied Forces has never been dealt before - that too this period is not just a commentary based factual display but a proper thriller thread is induced here. Background score found wanting of elevation at certain moments, the action sequences look dated for its time. \n\nSeduce you through sex, violence and drama",

Of course with this director one expects controversy but he plays this one relatively straight and marks a certain maturity in storytelling. Verhoeven also co-wrote with long time collaborator Gerard Soeteman. Carice Van Houten makes an impressive perfomance along with many familiar Verhoeven regulars. Verhoeven's move away from Hollywood proves that he is much better when he chooses his subject material and has artistic freedom. This is a much more intimate film than either Starship Troopers or Basic Instinct. He goes back to his arthouse roots and for the most part has made a very watchable film, sharply written and edited without the flashy style we have come to expect. The sex and violence are there of course!",

With Black Book he does a significant departure from that genre, and directs quite possibly one of his most powerful films. This is a standout drama, a breath of fresh air from a director who has always seemed to make action films and Sci Fi films. If y6ou enjoy Verhoeven's work, but want something quite different, then Black Book i8s a great choice. Set during the Second World War, and follows the Dutch resistance as they infiltrate the local Gestapo headquarters, Black Book is a fine mix of drama and thrills and has enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. This is a superbly acted film, and captivating and highly entertaining from start to finish. Black Book is a fine drama that is steadily paced, and it's a well layered film that doesn't have a single dull moment. Overall, it's a powerful  picture, one that will stick with you long after you've seen it, and warrants multiple viewings as well. Verhoeven crafts something quite unique here, and it is a riveting drama, one of his finest yet, and considering that his last great movie was Basic Instinct (Starship Troopers was good, but it didn't compare to other previous works directed by Paul Verhoeven), Black Book is a richly detailed film, one that you can get thoroughly involved in, as it will leave you guessing into a tightly woven web of thrills. I would easily put this picture as one of Verhoeven's best, and it's a film that never ceases to amaze.",

            "content": "Not a whole lot of really good movies about the resistance in WWII, and even less featuring a female lead actor.  This is definitely one of the best in the first category, up there with Flame and Citron, and far better than Defiance, Soldier of Orange, or Army of Crime.  There is a few things that didn't go great with me, for one the B-17 bomb that landed right beside their boat would have put a quick end to the movie and killed them both, and the action, although not bad, did seen a bit one sided in favour of the resistance when it should have favoured the Germans, and the people getting gunned down could have been preformed better.  But those are minor setbacks to an otherwise great movie, that tells it's story very well and doesn't glorify anything or end in a unrealistic happily ever after.  It doesn't shy away from gore, although not particularly common when it's shown it doesn't hold back.  Also the nudity is rather similar and doesn't hold back, and that in itself is a character in the movie, as holds a big importance to the events.  Like all movies about the resistance or occupied territory in WWII many of the characters are double crossers, trying to survive and join the winning side, and it makes for characters that almost always cannot be trusted.  Often we can detect this beforehand, but it's not too obvious.  The story isn't exactly fast paced, but it's not really slow, and has the content to keep us engaged, as if we don't something important will surely be missed.  The ending is good, has us torn between who to root for, who are the real bad guys and who is bad but we still like. It ends good, most loose ends are tied up, but we find most of our characters dead, through various causes, mostly bullets.  Overall good movie, could have benefited from better action and slightly faster pace, but all in all portrays what it tries to almost to perfection.",

I don't know about you, but it seems like Paul Verhoeven is getting a little bit carried away with his artistic license with this film, because, come on, Paul, as much as we're glad about your returning home to the Netherlands, two-and-a-half hours of you calling all of the names in your little black book seems to be a bit too experimental. Actually, jokes about this film's artistic integrity aside, this is yet another Paul Verhoeven thriller about a woman exploiting her sex appeal to get men killed, it's just that there's a bit more tastefulness to this film than your usual film by Verhoeven. Well, I guess it's safe to say that with \"Basic Instinct 3: I Did Nazi This Coming\", this delightful saga about the killing of some guys who were just hoping for a nice night with a hot lady has returned to form, because this is the supposed to be the most commercially successful and renowned Dutch film of all time... which isn't really saying much. I love how this was supposed the most expensive Dutch film ever upon its release, and it's also the most inexpensive film that Verhoeven has done since \"RoboCop\", meaning that not even \"Showgirls\" cost this little, as the box-office returns will tells you. Well, apparently Dutch films really are cheap, because even with a budget that, in USD, is about $21 million, this film has been about as prettied up as leading lady Carice van Houten herself. Of course, unlike Van Houten, this film didn't really \"blow my mind\" (Like I said, I bet these German slaves to seduction did \"Nazi\" that coming), as it is not exactly without quite a few faults.\r\n\r\nI was going into this film expecting some thrills, but I was mostly fearing that Paul Verhoeven would get to be a bit too carried away with this thoughtfulness as the teller of this, for him, more weighty story, thus I am relieved to say that entertainment value is generally firm, though I can't say that my fears were entirely dashed, as there are still limp spells in atmosphere that establish blandness, or at least intensify it, as bland limpness is reinforced enough on paper. At just under two-and-a-half hours, this film outstay its welcome a bit, and does so with repetitious material whose blandness could never be entirely washed away, and whose being accompanied by the aforementioned atmospheric dryness leaves steam to gradually dilute at the film progresses. There are more cold spells to this dramatic thriller than there should be, and that challenges your investment enough, yet doesn't do so alone, as there are also questionable moments in atmosphere that are more overbearing than cold, because whether the film is getting a bit carried away with its violent imagery or getting to be a bit melodramatic, there are more than a few lapses in subtlety, a few of which prove to be glaring. Verhoeven handles this project ambitiously, but hasn't conditioned himself through the years to handle subject matter of this much importance, even though may of this drama's aspects are driven by actiony thrills and intrigue, and perhaps his success as a dramatic storyteller would have been helped if the film was more well-rounded. You certainly get a reasonable understanding of the characters and their situation, but there's only so much expository punch-up to sell you on the full weight of this worthy story, at least enough for you to ignore the conventionalism, because even though this film about an ordinary, but struggling woman exacting revenge on the Nazis with both her companions and her attractiveness could have been turned into a rather refreshing thriller by its own right, Verhoeven hits too many tropes for the film to not simply feel like a cross between a formulaic and somewhat watered down femme fatale thriller and a formulaic and somewhat watered down wartime drama and espionage thriller. There's not a whole lot of punch to this film, and while there is enough force to the inspiration behind this project to almost drive the final product into decency, resistance from pacing and subtlety issues, underdevelopment and conventionalism overpower this ambitious effort and secure its underwhelmingness. Still, the point is that while the film falls short of rewarding, it comes close, carried on the back on many an inspired aspect, one of which being the very thing that our lead Rachel \"Ellis de Vries\" Stein character uses to get the job done: good looks.\r\n\r\nCinematographer Karl Walter Lindenlaub has had a history of lensing pricy thrillers that choose to direct most of their attention in the forming of eye candy to technical spectacle, rather than visual style, so there's not a whole lot that's especially appealing to this film on a visual level, but Lindenlaub's eye is still sharp, gracing the film with a crisp definition that emphasizes color strikingly and occasionally plays with lighting beautifully. The film is pretty prettied up, maybe not to a stunning degree, but certainly to an attractive degree that gives you a lot of room to admire this film's art direction, supervised by Cornelia Ott, - with help from Roland de Groot, Maarten Piersma and Wilbert Van Dorp - and featuring production designs, by Wilbert Van Dorp, and costume designs, by Yan Tax, that intricately and handsomely restore the Nazi-occupied Netherlands with distinct immersion value. The film uses its money well when it comes to putting together a distinguished and engaging look, even though there could be a bit more uniqueness to the photography and art direction, so on a technical level, the film excels about as much as you would expect from a Paul Verhoeven film, only with a few less explosions and whatnot, but what drives the final product is its substance. As I've said, storytelling betrays the value of this film's subject matter, which is limited to begin with, because this isn't your garden variety \"Oh, how the Jews suffered, and oh, how depressing it was\" type of Holocaust drama, but rather a war-era thriller with some dramatic touches and relevance to Nazi misdeeds, thus making for a story concept that was never to hit too much, but still has a potential that Paul Verhoeven, when particularly inspired as director, does justice to with an effective capturing of the intensity within what action there is, while keeping heart pumping enough to make the dramatic touches fairly compelling. If nothing else, Verhoeven keeps entertainment value going more often than not, sustaining your engagement value through and through, and therefore drawing your attention towards the other commendable areas in storytelling that don't exactly drive the decency of this dramatic thriller alone. There's not a whole lot for the performers to work with, yet with what they've been given, the cast delivers on charisma and heart, with beautiful leading lady Carice van Houten being particularly convincing in her portrayal of an ordinary woman putting herself in extraordinary situations that will test her morality while she goes on a dangerous adventure to give those who have wronged her what she feels is harshly just. Van Houten has only so much to work with, being perhaps at her most engrossing when she's, well, naked (It's a bit disrespectful, I know, but hey, she is indeed good-looking), but her commitment as leading lady is potent enough to help in gracing this film with the heart that, while not enough to carry the final product beyond a degree of underwhelmingness, comes close to rewarding.\r\n\r\nWhen the book is closed, you're left with an overdrawn thriller with too many lapses in pacing, subtlety and uniqueness to sustain steam enough to keep underwhelmingness at bay, which isn't to say that there's not enough good looks to cinematography and production value, intrigue to subject matter, and heart to direction and acting to make Paul Verhoeven's \"Black Book\" an enjoyable, almost rewarding thriller that could have hit harder, but nonetheless gets you by just fine.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",
