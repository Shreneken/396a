The well-dressed quartet faces unexpected challenges to a lifelong bond when each one enters Carry Nation High, where senior Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Staub) rules the school's social cliques with an iron fist. As peer pressure threatens to divide the girls, they must learn how to band together and how to achieve true empowerment.",

There is no movie which leaves me with such high levels of serotonin. I cannot fault these girls, or the writers! The incredibly racist stereotypes are so easy to ignore when the soundtrack is as good as it is! Please watch this movie, please give it 5 stars, you're delusional if you don't enjoy it. I'll have you know I studied a movie in my english class once so I KNOW what i'm talking about. I adore this movie, I need it injected in my veins",

While, as a movie based off of a toyline targeted towards girls, it was something of a foregone conclusion that this wasn't my thing, part of me tried to keep watching but it just came off as rather forgettable and bland. Many years later, I decide to cut corners by watching some caustic critics review it because I'd rather not be caught actually watching the film and dealing with some awkward questions and it seems I made the right call all those years ago. From its appearance, it appeared to be a truly shallow film with obnoxious humour, bad performances, questionable messages and a story that doesn't feel like it does a very good job encouraging its demographic to go buy Bratz dolls. One could argue that it actually brought out the worst in teen comedies (albeit a family-oriented one, rather than a pure PG-13 one). Transformers is the definitive victor here for best live-action film of 2007 based off of a toyline (and both had Jon Voight in them as well!).",

True fans of the Bratz Universe will appreciate the dedication to detail and the expansion of the lore that this movie provides. Some of the scenes are stereotypical and disappointing (especially the depiction of Jade's mom), but overall this is a display of very healthy family/friend relationships. The focus is on friendship, not on boys or popularity. The characters are dynamic, and the mean girl is delightfully mean. The undertones are whimsically Marxist. The musical numbers are incredible, and the outfits are insane. If you want to think and learn, watch Schindler's List. If you want to eat cookie dough and laugh with your friends, watch Bratz.",

Granted, I was 15 when I first saw it and I did somewhat enjoy it, but since it was one of my favourite things still, I didn't mind the parts I was unsure of.\n\nWatching it again now, though, I see the huge glaring problems. The acting by the majority of actors is pretty awful (example, Chloe in the shop admitting she doesn't have money for a new outfit). The story itself is dumbed down to your average teen high school movie but its morals are twisted and confusing. The music is pretty terrible. The worst part, personally, was that all of the fantastic parts of the Bratz, the interesting adventures, the morals that occasionally popped up to teach you about friendship and life, Burdine Maxwell and the Tweevils (who, in all honesty, could have been horrible or amazingly campy in a live action remake). Basically, everything larger than life and interesting about the Bratz was removed and replaced with flimsy, stereotypical backstories and personalities that are impossible to relate to or connect with in most senses.\n\nFor a child or a young teenager who likes Bratz, this is enjoyable. For anyone else, it's pretty awful.",

The casting of the main 4 girls is on point, but everyone else is just in the movie to be filler. My main issue with this movie is its dumbass  villian. Are you serious? A spoiled blonde bitch  named Marilyn who is the daughter of the principal. Give me a break! Why were none of the other females given their brat names it kinda seemed like they just made it up. Also another thing that irritated me was the brat boyz (omg) Dylan isn't black in this movie and they made him deaf how stupid is that and where is kobe and eithan or even motorcycle cade? They really screwed the pooch on the guys in this movie. Overall this movie needed to be about the brat girls in high school getting ready for their senior prom with the also popular brat boyz alongside, and develop their struggles with adulthood, love and friendship as high school draws to a close. I wanted this to be fun, smart and emotional and got neither. This should've been great.",

            "content": "I wonder what it would be like to live day-by-day knowing you had participated in the creation of  the film adaptation of Bratz. You know, those dolls with the freakish lips and faces that dress with lower class than the \"Me so horny!\" Vietnamese hooker from Full Metal Jacket. Yes, those dolls.\n\nOne immediate question this film poses is, \"How does one create a film based on a line of dolls that dress like Vegas strip hookers?\" Or, there's also the questions, \"Who the hell funded this film?\" and \"Who thought this was a wise investment?\" There are many questions, with answers I don't think I'll ever get.\n\nGoing back to my first paragraph, I wonder what it must be like to be in director Sean McNamara's shoes. What could have possibly drawn this man to this project? Even taking into account his extensive directorial credits that include Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network episodes, what could possibly make anyone with such credits for directing programs for children want to take on a project that was destined to fail from the first pitch that there should be a film based on this particular brand of dolls?\n\nI wonder if perhaps it was money being offered. But even so, what sort of monetary offering would be enough to entice anyone to direct something like this? Sure, you have the money, but you have the eternal shame in knowing that you helped birth one of the worst films ever made. But, this theory doesn't really hold water with me through even just a quick browsing of his work - specifically, his films.\n\nA check of his filmography shows a strong leaning towards dramas, including ones with a faith angle and uplifting storylines, too. Though they received \"meh\" reviews from critics, his work with Soul Surfer and Spare Parts seem to be very well received by audiences. Hoovey seems to be decently received. He also directed a drama set during the Civil War which was met with mixed reviews called Field Of Lost Shoes, and even has a fantasy film coming out later this year called The Moon And The Sun which does sound a bit interesting, admittedly, considering its oddball premise. This to me, even though I have not seen his other work, shows signs of a much more ambitious director who has many ideas and lofty goals, complete with some solid fan followings for his works.\n\nPlus, if his website's biography is to be believed, it raises more questions about why he directed this film. From this biography, I learned that the age of 12, during a trip to Ireland, his father bought him a super-8 camera. And as the plane taxied down the runway, he recorded it. This simple moment was apparently enough to inspire him to want to become a film-maker. I also wonder what else made him want to become a film-maker.\n\nEvery film-maker has their ambitions and inspirations, so what were his? Did he want to be the next great American (Maybe even international) director who would influence a new generation of film-makers and have film scholars talking for decades about his work? Did he want to create film classics? Or, was it perhaps something more modest, like being an indie director with creative freedoms and explorations into ideas mainstream films wouldn't allow for, complete with a small but dedicated fanbase? What were his inspirations? Classic American films? European or Asian art house films, perhaps? Or maybe, much like Quentin Tarantino, his inspirations are eclectic, obscure cult films? What were his goals? What were his inspirations?\n\nI'm desperate to find out how and why. How did whatever goals, inspirations, or moments in life all lead to such a tragedy of film-making that had absolutely no hope of being remotely good? What went wrong? What led you to this point, Mr. McNamara? I don't think I've ever had a bad film confound me so much, and seen some major shit. But even with films that I hate more so than this one, they still had loftier goals and ideas that might have had some potential behind them. This is truly one of those rare cases where the idea was utterly hopeless. In fact, I haven't had a film make me ponder so much about its meanings since the Yasujiro Ozu masterpiece, Late Spring. Bratz is the antithesis to a film like Late Spring - it makes you ponder and contemplate for horrified and bewildered reasons, like trying to make sense of a tragic, senseless death.\n\nThe film focuses on 4 racially-stereotyped friends: Cloe, the bland blonde-haired white girl, Yasmin, the girl who's so Mexican there's a mariachi band in the house, her and her mother sing \"La Cucaracha\" at one point in the film, has an annoying brother with a thick Spanish accent, and there's also a Chevy Impala in their driveway (As if to remind you, \"Hey, did you know that they're Mexicans?\"), Jade, the smart Asian, and Sasha, the smart black girl whose parents are divorced.\n\nThe girls have been the best of friends ever since they were little and talk so much that they even skype one another. The girls are also obsessed with fashion and constantly discuss their outfits with one another. The girls are now getting ready to go to high school, where they assume that they'll all still be the best of friends.\n\nBut, as it turns out, that won't be the case, thanks to the principal's daughter, Meredith Baxter, who inexplicably has a dictatorial-style reign over the school and social cliques. Soon, the girls are split into different social cliques: Cloe joins the soccer team and immediately becomes only friends with the soccer team, Sasha becomes a cheerleader and only hangs out with other cheerleaders, Jade thanks to her stereotype, joins the science club and only hangs out with other members of the club, and Yasmin joins journalism, though she is most upset by this change events. It also turns out that Yasmin has singing talent, and with help from a deaf kid who is apparently a musical prodigy himself, she starts to grow in her talent. All the girls also meet attractive boys in their respective clubs.\n\n2 years later in high school, and after being separated from one another, clumsy Yasmin inadvertently starts a food fight that results in all 4 girls being sent to detention after a statue of the principal is damaged during the food fight. After briefly hating one another for ending up in this situation, they become friends again, determined to end the cliques and get everyone to hang out together, resulting in a series of confrontations with the bitchy Meredith and planning a musical number for the upcoming talent show.\n\nThe storyline should have been a light, fluffy, albeit stupid bit of comedic fun. But even at the most basic levels, the story is completely doomed, which is made worse by how badly this film botches its messages about social cliques, self-esteem, and friendship. There is no reason to root for any of the characters as they are all soulless stereotypes which believe that through fashion and musical numbers, people will be brought together. No, Bratz. No they won't. The storyline makes me ponder the mental states of 3 - count 'em - 3 writers of this utter abortion, especially with all the stereotypes, poor messages, questionable role models, and complete lack of anything resembling a modicum of quality. The story is of such low quality that my brain felt like it was shutting down because of how the story will do absolutely nothing to engage it. You know how some people say that they would rather watch paint dry, and throw it around too often when discussing something they hate? Here, that would not be just throwing it around. Watching paint dry would literally be more stimulating than paying attention to this story.\n\nI wonder how desperate an aspiring actor would have to be to agree to be in a film like this. Are you really so desperate to make a name for yourself in Hollywood that you would star in this film? You'd have less shame appearing in hardcore porn or bizarre fetish videos than you would starring in Bratz. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the cast was left with severe PTSD and found themselves locked in the padded room of an insane asylum for the rest of their lives after starring in this film. At a minimum, if I had starred in this film, I would have gone into hiding and never speak to anyone again out of shame.\n\nThe acting is horrible, but very difficult to properly describe. In fact, I will never be able to fully describe it to you. Well, to start off with the actresses, imagine the most irritating depictions of high school or college girls you've ever seen, or even just of prissy, fashion-obsessed girls you've ever seen in films. Now take those irritations you've felt and multiply them at least one hundred fold. Those are the performances given by the actresses in this film. They give performances that are bad beyond any earthly word. I don't even know if the darkest depths of Hell have a proper word for this sort of bad acting.\n\nThe other cast members are hardly any better, and continuing his downward spiral, Jon Voight appears in this film as the principal, and seems to have given up any semblance of respect he once had for acting. He gives one of the most hollow, soulless, dead-behind-the-eyes performances I've ever seen in films.\n\nThe acting is bad past the point of extraordinary, and crosses into the realm of legendary. You won't believe it, and you can't describe it to others. It is something that must be witnessed, but that would be too cruel a task to do.\n\nThere is no entertainment. There is literally nothing of redeeming value to be found. There's hardly a story, there are no likable or living characters, there is no funny humor, every song and dance number is excruciating (And this is coming from someone who gave Xanadu 5/5 stars and Grease 2 4/5 stars), the messages negate themselves, and it's overall an annoying, boring, and soul-sucking experience to endure. Have you ever known what it's felt like to watch a film so bad that it feels like it's sucking out the will to live? That's what Bratz will do to you, I shit you not. I hated the characters and hoped that they would all die, so the film would end faster, or perhaps that I would die and the agony would be over.\n\nThough I would talk about the humor in a longer paragraph, I'm not going to. It is unspeakably bad.\n\nShortly before he died, Roger Ebert released his final list of the 10 best films he had ever seen. One of them was Citizen Kane. In the brief section about Citizen Kane, he talked about he and other film scholars spent several hours studying every single frame of that film. EVERY FRAME. I would never do that, no matter how much I loved a film. But it wouldn't take that kind of examination to tell you that every single frame of Bratz is a complete failure. Just pause the film at any point and try to find something of value in that still frame. You can't. There is nothing.\n\nBratz has now cemented itself as being not only one of the 10 worst comedies, musicals, chick flicks, and family films, it has now gone down as one of the 10 all-time worst films I have ever seen, period. Save your sanity. Save your soul. Save yourself. Once you watch Bratz, you will not come out of it the same person you were before. It is a life-changing, unforgettable bad film that will haunt me for the rest of my days, as I forever try to figure out how something so horrible and misconceived was ever allowed to exist or be pitched to studios in the first place. It is one of the ultimate tragedies of bad film-making. A film so heinous, it could be reclassified as a war crime or at least, an inhumane form of torture by the Geneva Convention.",
