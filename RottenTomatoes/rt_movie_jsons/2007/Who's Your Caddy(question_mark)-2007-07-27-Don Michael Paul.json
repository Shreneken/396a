C-Note forces the issue by purchasing the land adjacent to the golf course's 17th hole. As the club leaders search for a way to revoke his membership, C-Note realizes his family's honor and golf history are at stake, and digs in for the fight of his life.",

Big Boi does a great job as our protagonist.  Some of the other characters can be really annoying and there are some gross out jokes I think we could have passed on.  Also, I wish this could have done better if it went the full R like Caddyshack and not PG-13.  Rappers work better in stories that don't have the restrictions of one f-bombs and no nudity.  But it's still fairly good.",

Nothing seems to suck the life out of me like a laughless, lifeless comedy which is why I sort of had a fondness for \"Who's Your Caddy?\". I can't quite recommend it, but considering my mood going into the picture, the fact that I came this close to recommending it simply astonished me.\r\nThe movie is an obvious retread of that untouchable classic \"Caddyshack\", and while it never approaches greatness like that picture, it is buoyant and likable most of the way. There are some crude moments, but the movie wisely keeps its boundaries. That's rare for a movie such as this.\r\nOutkast rapper Big Boi is surprisingly enjoyable in the lead role, and he has surrounded himself with a cast that appears game for anything. Even disgraced actor Jeffrey Jones is decent in the throwaway role of the perpetually foiled bad guy much like his character in \"Ferris Bueller\". \r\nA little push and some ambition and they really could have had something here. I laughed a few times, and smiled a lot. Just not enough for me to whole-heartedly get behind \"Who's Your Caddy?\". Still, if you saw me heading into the theater you would have thought I was going to my own execution. There's a pulse here, and some promise that is only marginally realized.",

Watching it right now as I type this review. \n\nCaddyshack got a much needed reworking in this film. I had grown tired of that boring and unsatisfying \"comedy\" of sorts. This is a refreshing new direction for modern film and I believe this is the beginning of a prosperous film career for Big Boi. The polo scenes were exhilarating to say the least. The story touched me deeply, with the final scene leaving me in tears. It is a great step in illuminating racism in our society, revealing that people of all cultural backgrounds can enjoy the thrill of golf. Truly, it has been years since a film has come along with such cultural impact. Bravo.\n\nAlso nice sideboob.",

I am very surprised I didn't see C-Note and the gang eat some fried chicken with a side of watermelon.  It also reinforced white stereotypes too.  I love how the black people in this movie think that \"the man\" is putting them down because C-Note pushes his way into an exclusive club, in which their is a six year waiting period, demanding admittance and when the white man doesn't let him in he's being racist. NO, there's a waiting period you jackass.  My favorite line of the movie is when the white man calls one of his \"posse\" a moron and he says \"Did he just call me a nigga?\" NO he called you a moron listen up next time.   This movie single handed sets black people back 100 years. The only movie worse than this is Battlefield Earth.",

He tries to bribe but it doesn't work. he decides to buy the estate right next door to get on the owner's nerves,who has a lot of prejudice against black people. He tries everything to keep him out from accepting him to then try to revoke his membership to even order a hit to get him out of his hair. Will he succeed?\n\nThe movie's alright. It's better then i expected but not the greatest either. I wanted to see it cause Big Boi was the main actor. Some part are really funny. You got some funny heads like Sherri Shepherd,Faizon Love and Bruce Bruce. Lil wayne also makes an appearance. There's also Terry Crews who played in Friday after next and White chicks. The point of the movie is plain and sample. Some things turned me off how as soon as there's black people around people gotta try and act \"ghetto\" with the peace love. It's a stereotype that turned me off not all of us actually act like that, having the little rich boy acting black with grills etc. That part could have slightly different. If you're looking for a stupid kind of comedy and you're a Big boi fan this is the movie for you. I enjoyed it and Big boi can act good as well.",

Everything even remotely funny is in the previews. In fact, it makes bold attempts at being...I don't know...cute. It feels like a kids movie, it really, really does, some family-oriented adventure about getting into a country club. But then you throw in the numerous references to \"hoes\" and completely idiotic overexagerations of what is 'gangster.' For example there's a pimped-out golf cart (complete with 'spinners') that's introduced during a stupid rap melody in slow motion. The director obviously did this as a cheap sight gag, but the only thing I heard from the people beside me was \"that's retarded.\" Well said. In fact, that might be the best way to review this movie, being short and simple: retarded.",
