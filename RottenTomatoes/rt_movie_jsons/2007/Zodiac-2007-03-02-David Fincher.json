This movie is about real life and the Zodiac Killer was never caught.

Since then I still watch it & it's an all-time great for me. Then came part 2. It was cool seeing the previous films actors, who all had aged & all, once again doing their thing(s).

So disappointing, with so many other directions they could have gone, in my Mind at least. Wasn't even happy to see them together again after the first 15 minutes or so. Any1 who hasn't seen the original would surely walk out of any theater this plays in, imo. A total FAIL, in just about every way-again, imho.

Fincher does a great job in painting a picture of the times-something he does very well. He also does a great job of painting a phot of the disconnect between police departments at the time, which seriously impacted investigations like this and the Golden State Killer case-solved in the 21st Century. The case precedes the work of the FBI in his great series, Mindhunter. The acting by Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr, and others is really very good. The movie is good, and interesting but frustrating by nature.",

David Fincher's commitment to keeping the film's consistent accuracy to the real-life crimes with each and every detail is to be applauded with respect, with only portraying scenes of the crimes that actually had surviving eye witnesses, rather than depicting crime scenes out of his imagination of the ones that had no survivors to tell how the actual crimes went down.

The movie covers the dense timeline of the \"Zodiac Killer's\" many crimes and the police investigation that followed, in an attempt to identify and eventually prosecute him. The main character of the movie is Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhall, a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who became engaged with the investigation due to the Zodiac Killer's contacting of several San Francisco-based newspapers. For a while, investigators thought that the Zodiac would be found, and they identified some promising suspects. However, the trail eventually ran cold, due to the (presumed) end of the Zodiac's spree and bureaucratic roadblocks among the police and the government, and it seemed that everybody had just moved on. Graysmith, however, did not, and was willing to put his familial relationships and his career on the line in order to write and publish a book about the Zodiac. What I enjoy most about this movie is that while its creators were tasked with the challenge of having to cover a vast number of years and a multitude of information within a traditional ~2.5-hour span, it felt to me that not a single detail went overlooked, and not a single (important) event was left out. Additionally, I felt that the movie's creators and actors did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of life in America, specifically San Francisco, in the 1960s-70s, from the set and costume design and the hair and makeup, to how the actors interacted with their environment and each other. I feel transported back in time every time I watch this movie. I'm also incredibly impressed with the range of emotions each of the actors is able to convey within the movie, especially since I've seen several of the cast members in less \"serious\" roles, so their performance in \"Zodiac\" is beyond impressive to me. These characteristics contribute to the unmatched \"rewatchability\" this movie holds. If you are in the mood to watch a movie, I would absolutely recommend that you go watch \"Zodiac.\"",

Viewers should be warned to watch when fully awake; the pace can seem a bit slow at times. However, those moments are chocked full of stellar acting and smart dialogue. I was most interested in learning about the happenings of the Zodiac Killer and the search for him. Being born in 1999 ruined any chance that I could have been privy to any original news coverage, so this was an information gathering viewing for me as well. All in all, the performances were good and I was curious to see the culmination of the main characters time and effort. Perhaps this is an unpopular opinion, but my favorite performance was that of John Carroll Lynch! He never fails to make me feel uneasy on screen when playing a (suspected) killer.",

This time I finished it, and it was a long ride. The pacing was not slow, but there was so much to cover that the movie felt like a miniseries. It wasn't a bad thing tho, because the first and third act were amazing.\n\nThe first act was an Iron Man and Hulk show, and the third was another superb showcase of Jake. All three actors reflected the obsession that many people had about the mysterious case back then, but Jake's character was definitely the most investing because he spiraled down very quickly. \n\nThe characters here wouldn't be interesting if the story wasn't great to begin with. The script worked wonder at not only draw audiences in, but make them feel the drag and tiredness that the characters went through.\n\nOne of the problems was Jake's character, who was introduced early on but didn't do anything for the first 2 acts. \n\nOverall, even though it felt long, Zodiac was an excellent thriller. 9/10",

            "content": "Zodiac is an incredibly thrilling experience from start to finish. The film does a lot of things very well, with flaws few and far between. First off, this film has a star studded cast with the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr, and Jake Gyllenhall, with Jake giving what may be his best lead performance in a film ever. The movie is mainly dialogue, with a few murder scenes by the zodiac killer thrown in the mix. These scenes are not bad by any means, but they're pretty basic and dull, and some of them even get cut off before you see what happens. The other major flaw to this movie in my opinion is the handling of Downey Jr's character. I really liked where they were going with the character in the first couple acts of the film. However, the character gets a little bit left behind and we do not get to see much of an end to his character arc, some people might be okay with it but it wasn't quite enough for me. Besides those two flaws the film does not have any other flaws that stick out enough to affect the score I'm giving this film. This film does a great job at keeping you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what might happen next, or who the new suspect will be. The thing that surprised me the most about the movie was how suspenseful it could be, as I could feel the stress building up in me, fearing for what could happen next. The greatest strength this film possesses is its ability to keep you entertained for so long with so much dialogue. It never gets stale at all through the course of the movie, and that's a rare occurrence in modern films, as I find a very large amount of movies like to rely on flashy action and comedy to keep viewers entertained. The characters also work so well together and bounce off of each others' performances, to really bring this amazing film to life. Overall, this movie is definitely a right time, right place kind of film, that you won't be watching on a regular basis unless you're a hardcore fan of the crime genre. This is a great film to put on during a movie date with someone special, or even a movie night with your friends or family, but is definitely best watched as a solo flick so you can really get a grip on the story. Easy 4/5, and would've been a 5 with more care towards RDJ's character.",

The acting is not bad at all, neither is the cinematography, but the adventure loses energy as it goes, and seems to lack dramaturgical edges, however much Jake Gyllenhall's character runs around in his obsession to solve the mystery. But Graysmith is at least presented seriously in this deeply grave plot, while other characters, like Robert Downey jr's reporter, who appears like he's some kind of parody act, obviously overacting, as if this is to underline the lack of focus and cooperation within investigators and media. But does that really work? The same also goes for some of the police characters, except from Mark Ruffalo portaying Inspector David Toschi. Together with Chlo\u00eb Sevigny he probably does the best acting performance, keeping the tension at a certain level. It's sometimes hard to find a good balance and true intention in David Fincher's direction, and it's likely a logic to ending up with a series of questions due to the nature of the plot, which actually lacks a conclusion. But as a drama, it might feel like having been gazing into a dark void that only has been growing more empty. It's perhaps a great point with it, but that's all there is.",

He might've got some hangups, but that doesn't sound like Zodiac's style to me; I doubt Zodiac even knew he existed until Graysmith wrote his first book on the case years later. And Graysmith has been pointing his finger at Arthur Leigh Allen since the start, only to end up being embarrassed when DNA tests did not match Allen. Not really the guy you want to focus on in this case.\n\nThe film tries to recreate the 60's & 70's, but the dialogue doesn't ring true in that respect; the chosen profanity and certain phrases are irritatingly from the new millennium. Annoying little details are thrown in, such as Toschi's obsession with animal crackers, that add nothing to the film. The details of who each person is is not of particular importance in this story; we should only care who the Zodiac and his victims are. History has shown that Dave Toschi, for example, did a lousy job on this case, so detailing his little eccentricities is irrelevant and uninteresting because he was a failure. Some of it is most likely not even accurate, such as his idly watching Belli and later a boardroom of newspaper editors carelessly handle blood-stained pieces of cloth without immediately intervening to protect the evidence. The police techniques and their dialogue feel phony and contrived. The acting is only so-so; competent but somewhat wooden. These people seem like actors acting, rather than involving us in the drama and mystery of the story. Downey Jr. seems to simply be playing himself, for the most part.\n\nAlso the story is told out of sequence, which Fincher seems to think is artful license but comes across as pretentious and confusing for those only moderately familiar with the Zodiac story. Fincher does get credit for revealing the Kathleen Johns story as a probably hoax - but why even take the time to show that scene then, when it could just be alluded to? The movie is too long as is and needed trimming. Graysmith on a date? Come on. How does that have *anything* to do with this legendary case?\n\nIt's a mediocre time passer, not much more. It's already become outdated in some ways as of 2021. The definitive film has yet to be made.",

It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it, especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie, but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing, even if you knew the whole story.\n\nIn the small towns of California, there are several brutal murders, eventually going onto San Fransisco. These murders are extremely violent and very random, and every time it happens there is a message or sign that is left by the killer that calls himself the \"Zodiac\". He sends letters to the press on how and where he killed his victims and teases the police that they will never catch him. But Robert, one of the newspaper cartoonist starts to obsess about the killer, who he is and how they can capture him.\n\nWith an all star cast, we had absolutely no problem with acting because it was terrific. Jake and Mark held their own very well. The whole story is very chilling and kept you going. The Zodiac Killer is a case that forever will remain a mystery and it was a great idea for a film, Fincher added a Se7en type of feel to this film. It's so funny how I knew the story and how it ended already, but I was actually just waiting to see what would happen in the next scene. I would highly recommend this film to any thriller fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's a great one for 2007. 8.7/10",

It makes sense that at some parts the police was moving a bit quicker in the case and that in some parts they were not getting any clues. Makes sense doesn't it? The acting was incredible, the characters were likable and we understood more and more about the case. We get evidence, clues and we sort of have to figure out who the killer is ourselves. Was it Arthur Leigh Allen? Maybe. We don't know. The movie makes us feel like that. If you like mystery movies, you will love this.",

James Vanderbilt's screenplay convinced me to research everything about the real events as soon as the movie finished, which is undeniably an impactful effect of watching such a well-written, captivating narrative with well-developed, authentic characters. David Fincher's commitment to being as historically accurate as possible is visible on-screen, a remarkable result of a massive preparation that very few filmmakers would even think about performing. With some of the best editing work in the history of cinema, the lengthy runtime flows better than expected, but the amount of information to digest is overwhelming and tiresome, dropping the levels of entertainment, especially during a certain period of the second act. Nevertheless, a phenomenal third act, three outstanding performances from Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and Jake Gyllenhaal, and an emotionally compelling, realistic approach to extreme obsession turn the entire film into one of the best of its genre. Another massive recommendation from this side.\"",

But hey, sometimes there is magic that comes with first experiencing a film that's absent on all subsequent viewings. This time around, I watched with a more critical eye (and a couple of aquavelvas) and still give the film a (90), a 5-star score. There's a style to a Fincher movie and I felt some of the scene cuts and the color palate were identical to Gone Girl. It also has to be one of the fastest 157 minutes you'll ever watch, switching storylines between Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), Insp. Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), and the Zodiac murders themselves. As the most recognizable unsolved murder outside of Jack the Ripper, probably, the movie wasn't going to draw its own conclusions (at least nothing that isn't in the real Robert Graysmith's book) or create a Tarantino-like alternate history ending, and still keeps you hooked throughout. Gyllenhaal as Graysmith is the cartoonist who slowly pulls at the strings of the killer until he is enveloped in evidence and research, leaving his family broken. John Carroll Lynch as Arthur Leigh Allen, or the Zodiac Killer! (prove me wrong) is calculating and imposing, a perfect fit. Also, need to give credit to Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery who rounds out my favorite scene in the bar with Graysmith, empty aquavelva glasses covering the table and snorting cocaine in the booth. Lastly, need to discuss the \"basement scene,\" which during the first viewing is probably the most anxiety-inducing of the film, but after mulling it over (and after listening to the discussion on the LCB podcast), it doesn't really make much sense and is included to put our protag in \"real\" danger.

            "content": "Zodiac is quite simply the most meticulous, engrossing, and well made police procedural film ever!\n\nOkay, that's a bold statement considering the many outstanding police procedural films made over the years. But at least in the last twenty years, I do feel that Zodiac (2007) is the best. Masterfully directed by David Fincher, the film is ultimately about obsession for the truth and how we as viewers see and relate to truth through various mediums including film.\n\nBased on the book of the same title by Robert Graysmith, Zodiac tells the true story of the manhunt for the Zodiac Killer, a serial murderer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, taunting police with letters, bloodstained clothing, and ciphers mailed to newspapers. The case remains one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes. (Wikipedia)\n\nThe story opens with the murders interwoven with scenes of the editorial staff of the San Francisco Chronicle dealing with the received cryptic Zodiac letters. Here we are introduced to lead political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.). Following the murder of San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine, we are introduced to police inspectors Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). This mid-section of the film forms the bulk of the police investigation but ultimately leads nowhere as Toschi is not able to find hard physical evidence to incriminate the prime suspect. The final third of the film follows Graysmith as he obsessively tries to tie the circumstantial evidence from three different counties together to find the killer. With all of the main characters, the obsession to find the truth behind the Zodiac's true identity wreaks havoc on their personal and professional lives. What's most fascinating about this film is how director David Fincher is able to pull audiences out of themselves to reveal that we as the public and movie viewers do the same thing, obsessively seeking the truth. All mediums during that time period are explored as we listen to radio callers and view television news broadcasts regarding the Zodiac killer. We also see a barrage of thousands of informants as they all give their interpretation of the truth. Of course it is one of these informants that ultimately leads to the prime suspect, but how we deal with all this information and sift through it, is one of the most mind blowing elements of this film. Perhaps most interesting is how the film is a commentary on how we as audiences view films like this. We too are drawn into the obsession and are frustrated by how we are forced to ignore the obvious \"circumstantial evidence\" due to a lack of physical evidence. Like the real life characters, we are also swayed by our own bias perspective and fears, sometimes forcing the truth because of our desire for completion and resolution. However, the only satisfaction we are able to find is the same satisfaction Graysmith achieves by his 99% identification of the Zodiac's identity. We are reminded that just like in real life, the crimes sometimes go unsolved.\n\nOn a technical level, there is so much to admire about Zodiac like it's brilliant construction, precise historically accurate production design, subdued realistic acting, beautiful cinematography and framing, and dynamic ever changing soundtrack. This is the first mature work of David Fincher and perhaps his masterpiece. There are two things that I specifically appreciate about Zodiac; the pacing of the film and David Fincher's restrained directing.\n\nThe film's deliberate consistent pacing is brilliantly appropriate here. Some critics have described the pacing as \"slow\" and lacking in action. The pacing, rather, is intense and unrelentingly suspenseful. It also is never static. The pace of the film slowly builds in momentum especially in the last hour keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The pacing also aids in the film's more creepy moments. Cars stalking victims in the middle of the night. Investigators coming uncomfortably close to suspects. All this is made even more frightening when you contemplate that these crimes and events really happened. I also find the atmosphere and pacing in this film to be far more unnerving than any slasher film. \n\nThe second thing that stands out for me is David Fincher's unusually restrained directing. Fincher, known for his over the top graphic violence in many of his other films like Seven (1995) and Fight Club (1999), is quite restrained in Zodiac. This doesn't mean there aren't any violent sequences. The few murders that are depicted are quite shocking and brutal, but none of it is gratuitous or glorifying. In fact, the violence, while brutal, are depicted exactly as it was described by survivors of the Zodiac killer. Fincher has stated that he did not want to inspire the next serial killer in any way. Rather the violence serves in building the tension and adds urgency to the story. That being said, Zodiac has far less violence than any other Fincher thriller. It's far less distracting too. Through the restraint, we can focus on Fincher's remarkable skills as a director, as he sweeps us into this enthralling story and authentic time period.\n\nFor all of these reasons, Zodiac is my favorite police procedural and in my top two David Fincher films.",

It is 160 minutes and mostly driven by the dialogue, yet somehow feels quick paced and riveting. Of course, it uses some of the tropes such as people walking and not looking at each other while carrying a conversation to do this, but it does so effectively all the same. It is tense and at times terrifying even though we all at least somewhat know the ending-- something that I believe is very underappreciated when films do it right. It has fabulous acting by Downey, Ruffalo, and Gyllenhaal; even though you know all of these actors so well they are entirely believable as their characters. This film creates a sense of paranoia even when we know absolutely that someone is not the culprit. The editing, done by Angus Wall, really brings Zodiac together into a thrilling and intelligent serial-killer movie.",

It based on the true story America's most notorious serial killer. Zodiac tells the story of the manhunt for the Zodiac Killer, a serial murderer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, taunting police with letters, bloodstained clothing, and ciphers mailed to newspapers. The case remains one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes. Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith who is the cartoonist is obsessed with investigating the murders and researching into the Zodiac killings. With a lot of help from his fellow friends, Dave Toschi and Paul Avery played by Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey, Jr. Okay so as it is the Zodiac investigation goes on throughout the entire movie and when Robert watches Dirty Harry for the first time, in his vision it's really based on the Zodiac killings loosely and then he meets Dave for the first time. Like I said in the couple of seconds the Zodiac investigation goes on throughout and it's gonna take days and months and, hell, even years. With all that said and out of the way, I will say for one thing that I am going to tell you about. I think the ending is crap! There are some scenes nearly at the end is that Robert continues his investigation and  in the next later and after that it just ends abruptly with some disclaimers about how it ends. I don't know if you notices this but it looks like this movie had no ending. Well, I know it's based on a true crime and it is based on the 1986 non-fiction book of the same name by Robert Graysmith played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the film. I just help the fact that it ends so abruptly. So yeah, the downside is the ending. Despite this, I still think this is a good movie. I mean, not perfect by any means but it is a pretty good crime drama that is so true. If you David Fincher's directing style you'll like this. It had a memorable cast that you'll recognise and it had good writing, solid directing, stellar acting and historical authenticity. You know the rest. Give it a watch and see if it'll grip you and you'll know the story is true.",

            "content": "Most fictional mysteries conclude with the perpetrators being expose and their motives revealed. Zodiac revolves around a mystery which has never been conclusively solved \u2013 the identity of the Zodiac killer, who terrorized California in the late 60's and early 70's. Zodiac suggests a solution to this enigma, but also leaves room for the viewer to reject the film's interpretation. This ambiguity is a sign of respect for the audience's intelligence. None of the suspects were ever conclusively proven to have been Zodiac, so I appreciate not having the director's pet theory being depicted as fact. The film achieves this ambiguity not only through the content of its script, but also by having three different actors portray Zodiac in his onscreen appearances, none of whom play any of the suspects.\n\nObsession is the main theme in Zodiac. Several characters destroy their lives by focusing on the case to the exclusion of everything else. The effects of the case on the investigators are as much the focus of the film as Zodiac himself. Focusing more on heady themes and less on the brutal murders (reenactments of Zodiac's crimes make up only a small portion of the runtime) is admirable but requires a higher level of skill on the part of the writers and actors. While Zodiac isn't as brilliantly written as The Silence of the Lambs, the writer, actors, and director display a high level of skill in their skillful depiction of the ruined relationships and lost opportunities which accompany the characters' obsession with catching the killer.\n\nZodiac also beautifully captures California during this time period, with its period-correct San Francisco skyline, absent the Transamerica Pyramid, which is constructed in a time lapse midway through the film as a clever method to depict the passage of time. Such relics as a police telephone box and Atari's Pong also make an appearance. Perhaps most interestingly for me, given my interest in commercial aviation, were the accurate airline liveries which appear in the film, with several of the main characters flying on a plane operated by the defunct carrier PSA midway through the film. For me, the movie was almost worth watching simply for its glimpse into the time period. Fortunately, the film is not solely interesting as a period piece \u2013 Zodiac is also an intriguing murder mystery with an engrossing depiction of obsession.\n",

It was good to see the events depicted in film format, even if some liberties were taken.\n\nMy major issue with the movie is that, while interesting, I didn't find it very captivating. I felt that I was watching a documentary at times, rather than a film for viewing pleasure. While not necessarily a terrible thing, it wasn't what I was hoping for or expecting.\n\nI also found that the cinematography ranged from passable to bland for the majority of the film. I grew extremely tired of the 'fade to black' transitions and the 'time, date, location' typography on the screen. Do we really need to know that an hour has passed?\n\nI found the musical score to be hit or miss. At times, it was tense and dramatic and really accomplished the goal of amplifying the suspense on screen. Other times, it was almost whimsical and didn't fit the tone or atmosphere of the film or subject matter.\n\nThe plot was all over the place and, quite honestly, a mess. I'm sure that this was true of the actual events that the film is based on, so it's easy enough to give it a pass in this regard.\n\nHowever, the scene where the Zodiac attacks the couple while wearing some kind of fantastical black outfit was ridiculous. I'm not familiar enough with the case to know if that actually occurred, but that costume accompanied by the atrocious script and questionable acting from all three parties involved made it quite a horrible scene.\n\nWhile not the perfect film, Zodiac is an interesting and educational - if somewhat overlong - experience.",

The pounding music will eat away at you while you try to follow alongside these detectives, reporters, and hobbyists at uncovering the identity of The Zodiac Killer.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal leads the fray as a cartoonist that is interested in reading, riddles, puzzles, and conundrums. His manic portrayal is fascinating and intriguing as you relate to this average man trying to do the right thing. Mark Ruffalo is quite sympathetic as the detective in charge of the Zodiac case. His frustrations become yours as his leads give you hope as well. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious as the journalist invested in the Zodiac killings and head target. This leading cast along keeps you alert, on edge, and engaged at every moment of Zodiac's lengthy running time. You never feel the time pass as you are mesmerized by this gripping true story.\n\nI cannot recommend Zodiac enough. Fincher may never outdo this epic investigative film. Zodiac is a beast unto itself. The long length encompasses so much time and information, but Zodiac helps you along and keeps everything in order. I found Fincher's sense of suspense and intrigue completely entertaining throughout Zodiac. If you have never seen Zodiac, you are in for a wild time. You'll hold your breath as Zodiac takes it away!",

And because of its length and scope, you really experience the passing of every increasingly defeating year. A roller coaster of optimistic intrigue and pessimistic exhaustion.",

With more than two hours and socks of duration the script can not be dropped into monotony, and even when the same is repeated in ideas, is saved by the great performances, telling the story of a serial Killer that ravaged California during the 1960s and 70, the film little develops the killer because, it was never discovered that it really was, so we have a concentration in a journalistic nucleus and a police officer, the latter to support the first, and running out, we have a nucleus with more poetic freedom, which in the case, is the murderer, the script, even if one repeats ideas at times, has a spectacular rhythm, in addition to telling an extremely instigating story in an even more instigating way, through speculation, all 4 characters that involve the two core cores are well developed, in terms of script the work is not perfect, but it is well above average. The film flees in talking about some social issues in the middle of the way, like racism for example, does not end up not going that way, which is not bad, since it is difficult to focus on something other than \"Zodiaco \", with a palette of gray but clear colors, the film transmits very well the 60s and 70s, in addition to centered camera angles, and always using plane against plane, the film direction is very good, the subjective camera is little used , but we have beautiful open plans, as well as a positioning in closed spaces that always goes through a \"Sinister\" climate. With a trio of actors that would come a few years later become synonymous of quality in the cinema, the performances are great and follow the whole. \"Zoadico\" is the right movie in the wrong year, released in 2007, a year where we had \"Black Blood\" and \"Where the Stars Are\". weak does not have \"the film really you're kind of forgotten, but still.

            "content": "Zodiac is crime/drama film directed by David Fincher, and it was released all the way back in 2007. A decade ago! Dang, that is hard to believe. Anyway, I wasn't able to see Zodiac when it initially released in theaters and really I had never even thought about it until I saw it got added to Netflix this month. I immediately added it to my list and finally got around to watching it. Zodiac may not be as good as Se7en, and it's definitely not the best crime/drama movie ever made, but it's still pretty damn good.\n\nPlot\n\nAs you might have guessed based off of the title, Zodiac, the movie is all about the Zodiac killer, and the people who try to figure out the identity of the killer. I won't go too deep into spoilers, but if you were alive when the Zodiac killer was actually active or if you have read the book, you'll know at least some of the story. Essentially, there's a serial killer on the loose in California and he likes to taunt the press/police after he successfully commits a murder. The movie follows the detectives, a journalist, and a cartoonist as they try to figure out who the killer is. I wasn't alive during that time, and I never read the book or do any research on the subject. So this was a whole new story to me, and I feel like I benefited because of that. The entire time I was trying to figure out who the killer actually was. The director does try to throw a few curveballs at the audience, but I feel like they were almost unnecessary and actually hindered my final assessment of the film. Not that throwing curve balls at the audience is necessarily a bad thing, but the twists just weren't executed all that well.\n\nAnyway, the story kept me enthralled from start to finish. I was completely invested in the investigation by about the half-way point. I didn't look at how much longer was left in the movie once, and I even put off going to the bathroom because I did not want to pause the movie. That's how into it I was. One challenge that Fincher really overcame was the timeline. This movie spans a lot of years. And sometimes that can harm a film dearly. Jumping weeks, months, years at a time can sometimes kill a film's momentum, and lose the audience in the process. But this movie doesn't do that. It can jump weeks or months and you'll hardly even notice. It never loses momentum and it never becomes a drag.\n\nOverall, the story of Zodiac is incredibly gripping and well done. Fincher does a great job of making a \"cold case\" into a movie that actually has a resolution that is satisfying, and he is able to make even the boring stuff seem interesting.\n\nCharacters\n\nAlmost all of the characters in Zodiac are great. They're engaging, unique, and have great arcs. But Paul Avery, who is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., is the weakest character of the entire film. I get that Fincher was a bit hogtied when it came to each character's arc, but man what a waste of Robert Downey Jr. His character has a pretty small role in the film in the grand scheme of things and doesn't actually add a whole lot to it. He drinks, he smokes, and he helps the case along a little but for the most part he's just there. And it gets to a point in the film where he's completely unnecessary, but they give him a few scenes anyway. I mean, Zodiac is a long film, so cutting out these excess scenes with his character would have trimmed at least a few minutes off of the 2 hour and 37 minute run time. But it is Robert Downey Jr. so I guess they didn't want to cut any of his scenes. Now, I want to make it perfectly clear that Paul Avery doesn't hinder the film or impact it in a negative way. He just doesn't add a whole lot to it and overall seems unnecessary. The rest of the characters are great, though.\n\nPotential Audience\n\nZodiac is a mature film. The first half of the movie contains quite a few murder scenes, and I would say that no one under the age of 16 or 17 should watch it. Heck, some people well into their 40s may find some of the scenes in this movie disturbing. It all depends on how much ultra-realistic violence actually impacts you. If you like crime, drama, or thriller movies you'll definitely have a good time with Zodiac. Just don't let your young child watch it.\n\nConclusion\n\nZodiac is a great film. The story is a quite the ride and the characters keep you engaged. The film does run a bit long, but because the story is so fascinating I doubt you'll even notice how long it truly is. If you have Netflix, go watch it as soon as you can. If you don't have Netflix, go rent it for a couple of bucks-it's worth it.",

It's quite long, but the film is well made and sticks pretty well to the true story, feels, in a way, like a documentary. It's surprising how the film's dialogue can be very tense, suspensful and very scary, much more than the death scenes. The film spends more time developing, following the characters and shaping their personality and role in the story. Bottom line, this is an other achievement by David Fincher and makes you wonder who was, or is, and where the hell is the Zodiac now? Recommended !!",

All the stress and panic he caused just with his letters. I don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t know if it really happened, but it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s mind blowing to see how they live tv broadcasted the killer speaking. It was interesting to watch all the investigation that went behind this case and how determined Jake\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s character was to find who the Zodiac was. \n\nDidn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t like the CGI so much and all the remodeling of what it might have been during the late sixties around San Francisco. The writing is really good, the movie goes by quick. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s a really sharp and somewhat smart movie.

The camera is very smooth, the colour palette is again very stylish, the score and soundtrack haunting and the acting is superb. David Fincher knows what he is doing. His films always suck in the audience even though not much is happening. This story for instance is based on the true story of a cartoonist getting obsessed with the Zodiac killing that took place in southern California in the late 60's and early 70's. When you start to create true stories, it gets harder to follow the classic Hollywood three-act structure. This film starts off very interesting with all the characters getting equal amount of screen-time and the creepy zodiac written letters begin to start coming in. Down the stretch, it starts to become a bit of a bore when the zodiac killer becomes absent in the story. While I can't really fault the filmmakers for this because this is a true story and the filmmakers were trying to depict the story as real as possible but it's something to take note of before you watch it. This is one of those films where many little clues are dropped here and there throughout the film and while many of them might fly under the radar or you may not remember all of them, they all come back at the end to make an impactful ending. Overall, this is a really well-made film. If you like David Fincher's other work like Gone Girl and the Social Network, I think you will enjoy this one.",

Shooting in a striking\nvisual palette, Fincher crafts his camera around the San Francisco\ncityscape and surrounding areas to striking effect. Building's form in\nfront of our eyes, taxi's weave through the city at night and basements\nbecome more ominous than we could've ever imagined under his watchful\neye and the script by James Vanderbilt (whose sadly not gone on with\nthe promise shown here) does a great job at condensing the drawn out\nsaga into a cohesive whole and his work on the film seems perfectly\nsuited to a man of Fincher's powers.\n\nZodiac's failings to initially make a mark upon release are hard to\npinpoint, although there were lots of critics that hailed its slow\npaced stylings and dialogue heavy scenes, there were equal amounts of\nnaysayers that seemed to prefer their Fincher more Fight Club than the\nprocedural that takes place here, although the films sparring violence\nis haunting - a stabbing scene in particular is hard to forget - and\nthe moments where Fincher takes us into the heart of suspect\ninterrogation showcase a tension and unease that only the best of films\ncan do.\n\nA great cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr\ndo great work without ever taking over Zodiac and Fincher's film takes\nall its power and crafts all its magic through the use of its couldn't\nmake it up if you tried narrative and an understanding of material that\nno doubt came from Fincher's renowned attention to detail.\n\nA long watch and a film not made for the average popcorn muncher that\nfloods our cinema screen in this day and age in search of their next\nCGI spectacle, Zodiac is a meticulously crafted and tension riddled\njourney through a time in American history that to this day remains an\nintriguing and engaging subject matter, Zodiac is the hidden jewel of\nFincher's filmography and a film well worth a repeat viewing for those\nthat may've only watched once.\n\n4  1/2 animal cracker boxes out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Zodiac is a rare movie that manages to hold your attention throughout its entire runtime and makes you want to go and research about its story even more after it has finished. The movie is masterfully directed, written, edited, and acted - making it one of the best thrillers I have ever watched. \n\nThe plot of the movie revolves around the investigation of the infamous Zodiac killer in the 1960s in the San Francisco area and how a cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a homicide detective, David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and a news reporter, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), aim to crack his identity but see their personal lives greatly affected by their involvement in the case.\n\nThe main reason why I absolutely love this movie is because it is able to draw me in completely into its story. 'David Fincher' is one of my favorite directors and I really feel that this is one of his best-directed movies. 'David Fincher' and cinematographer 'Harris Savides', portray the 1960-1970 era terrifically. The costumes, the sets and era transport you straight to the 1960s-1970s and make the movie visually appealing. Moreover, 'Fincher' induces a suspenseful and tense atmosphere to almost every scene in the movie, especially the scenes when the 'Zodiac' killer is shown. This kept me intrigued throughout the whole movie and like the characters in the movie; I kept trying to crack the case myself. The thing that pleasantly surprised me the most, however, was, how well the humor in this movie was handled. The dialogues written by 'James Vanderbilt' were really funny and 'Fincher' used humor really well to keep me engaged in the portions of the movie when the characters are not doing much but talking. The interrogation scenes or the scenes in the 'Tribune' office become memorable because of this humor. \n\nThe other thing this movie, surprisingly, nails really well is its handling of its characters and its pace. Since the movie has a wide array of characters and spans over a pretty big era, this movie could have really become messy and overlong, but it is so well edited by 'Angus Wall' that I really could not think of looking away for a moment. Each moment in the movie is engaging, whether it is the characters talking or any action-taking place. Also, 'Fincher' does an outstanding job of handling all his characters well, especially, his 3 main characters, all of who manage to make a lasting impression. None of the supporting characters come off as unnecessary (most of them are intriguing) and add a significant amount of detail to a story that is riveting to say the least. \n\nFinally, the acting in this movie is also all-round terrific. A massive amount of credit has to go to the writing of these characters but in the end, it is the actors who really bring these characters to life. The supporting cast does an extremely good job in the movie. Particularly, 'Brain Cox', 'Anthony Edwards' and 'John Carroll Lynch' make big impressions. 'Anthony Edwards' and 'Mark Ruffalo' share some truly funny moments and complement each other really well in the scenes of investigations. 'John Carroll Lynch' has a few scenes in the movie but really manages to impress with a complex performance. The major cast is similarly exceptionally impressive in this movie. 'Downey Jr.' is at his cocky best as 'Paul Avery' and though he does not have as much screen time as 'Gyllenhaal' and 'Ruffalo', he really shines in his scenes and shares some truly hilarious moments with 'Gyllenhaal's' character.  'Mark Ruffalo' is also terrific as 'David Toschi'. He gets some the best lines in the movie and he delivers them with aplomb and manages to also really impress in his more serious scenes. My favorite character in the movie, however, was 'Jake Gyllenhaal's' character because I felt I really saw the case like he did. I felt that 'Gyllenhaal's' character was extremely difficult to make convincing and 'Gyllenhaal' did terrifically to make this characters motives and incentives seem believable. He infuses his character with tremendous likeability and that makes it hard to not root for him in the movie. \n\nOverall, I see Zodiac, as a hidden masterpiece that stays with you long after it has finished and manages to constantly engage you with its tremendous characters and brilliant dialogue. A movie that manages to really define what a serial killer thriller should be like -- Zodiac is one of my all time favorite thrillers, probably just below my all time favorite thriller - Se7en.",

What Fincher constructs in this truly unique mystery is very deliberate, dark, brooding, and subtle, but his passion on the subject bleeds into every detail from the intricate design of the 60's and 70's to the cat-and-mouse game itself played between predator and prey.  Although in retrospect some of Fincher's choices in direction for this film seem rather outlandish, the premise itself is no doubt right up his alley, and with a wonderfully gripping script developed by Vanderbilt, Fincher carries his stylized, yet withdrawn artistic flair throughout the film with total command over both the audience and his impressively complex depictions of real-life individuals.  Although with its length it comes off as plodding and perhaps even a bit contrived at times, Zodiac is executed in such a manner that even the most boring scene under less talented oversight can be seen as compelling.  This is the rare mystery film that does not let up on tension or deliver a nice, clean-cut ending delivered in a gift-wrapped box.  Zodiac will leave you with a lingering sting in knowing that this heartless, cold, calculated criminal may still be out there.",

One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives encrypted letters written by the same killer calling himself the \"Zodiac\", after this the police started an investigation with the help of a political cartoonist and a crime reporter.\n\nZodiac is one of the most compelling pictures I've seen in years,  is so explicit and is so well done that is almost impossible not to feel empathy for it. With 162 minutes so well filmed by Harris Savides and so well accompanied by the music of David Shire (with some rock classics) makes this movie a delight for the eyes and the ears. For people who didn't notice it, the visual effects are excellent in some scenes.\n\nOne and another i have to say thanks to James Vanderbilt for that exceptional adapted screenplay, what great screenwriter.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. as the reporter Paul Avery, is maybe the protagonist that less time appears on the scene, but without doubts is the most convincing performance of this picture, in spite of that, for me the best was Jake Gyllenhaal as the cartoonist Robert Graysmith, and i'm not a fan of this actor. Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi it's ok, but is always the same, never surprise us.\n\nIn conclution, if you like Fincher's work, you need to see it, it's very advisable. 8/10",

If you like a neat story and some great acting check this one out. The plot is A San Francisco cartoonist becomes an amateur detective obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac killer.\n\nI thought this was a great and a real original film. I enjoyed the music and i also thought that there was a lot of thrills in this movie. It was not predictable and the movie started off with a bang with the first murder by the Zodiac killer. \n\nMy favorite scene of the movie was when the zodiac killer says before I kill you I'm going to throw your baby out the window I also liked every scene when Robert was at bob vaughn's house those were great scenes. I liked these scenes because they were creepy and unexpected. \n\nI have to say that the acting overall was great but the people who stood out to me were Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal. The way they played there characters were great. What was different about Jake's performance was he was barely shown in the first half of the movie but then he was shown a lot towards the second half of the movie. My favorite character was the zodiac killer/Liegh. He was just the most interesting character and the actor who played him was creepy and brilliant. \n\nI would give this film a 8.6 rating. I thought the acting overall was wonderful. although the movie was very long I thought that it was the perfect length to tell the story. The music was chilling and creepy it really set the mood/tone of each scene. The camera work also was great I liked the one shot of the bridge I thought it was cool how they shot the scene. I didnt love the time lapses bc I felt there was too many but then they started to space them out towards the end and show less of them so i liked it more towards the end. I thought the last 30 minutes were great. \n\nI would recommend this movie to any crime fans and anybody who was from the era. I would watch this movie again to understand it better it was a complex movie.",

Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr, Mark Rufflio, and the rest of the cast are fantastic in it and they are perfect for it and if it was someone else that was not as good, then the movie would've been boring. There's some funny moments in it, and the movie doesn't focus on the gory effects, but more on the anxiety of it as I got really invested by it. The writing is really great, and I was focusing on it too because if I don't listen to them talking, then I would've missed something and got lost, which is something that I never done in a genre like this besides some romance films. I also like that no matter how long the case is going, even if they give up on it, there's always going to be someone who wants to solve the case. It's very unpredictable, it really make you feel like a detective and make you want to look at every little detail of it.

This is a long film that doesn't have a ton of action, but it is very thought-provoking and tense throughout.

            "content": "David Fincher treads into the dark and heavy true crime world, where everyone's a suspect and obsession is everything. It's a more  suitable story for him than say Panic Room, with a lot more subtext going on and sets him onto the true path to greatness, in my opinion. Zodiac is based on a true stories set between the late 60's and early 90's. It follows the obsession of 3 men, who's paths intertwine as a serial killer, who calls himself the Zodiac, goes on a murderous rampage and enjoys publicity with his work by playing a game of cat and mouse with the media. To this day, the Zodiac has never been found guilty, however there were many a suspect and this film tries its best to touch on what it can, without coming outright and pointing the finger, even though it cant help itself from blurting it out from time to time. Paul Avery, a big shot news reporter, with quite the penchant for fame and booze teams up with a fellow team member and cartoonist, Robert Greysmith, once the letters come flying in thick and fast and the bodies start racking up. Both men fall into a downward spiral, hunting for a man that cannot be found, eventually David Toschi gets dragged into it as a detective, who looses a lot more than sleep over his decade long obsession with catching this man responsible. It's a long winded, thick and fast who done it, without the big reveal as such. The ensemble here is top notch, not one actor out of place, Jake Gyllenhaal is ace at the code breaking and book worm cartoonist, bouncing wildly off his counter part Robert Downey JR, who plays Avery, an alcoholic drug abuser who shoots for fame and just about loses everything. The chemistry between them is brilliant, if not a little short lived. Mark Ruffalo makes up the trio with Dave, this man is such an understated actor, Ruffalo has been at it for some time now and every role he touches, he smacks with professionalism and a naturalistic nature, very few actors to date can touch on. You can see the struggle in this mans eyes constantly, Ruffalo lives this character he doesnt act him. The supporting cast of semi regular Fincher faces and Chloe Sevingy are also well cast and yet again sadly their inclusion is understated. The story is a lot to chew on, so naturally the film hurtles at breakneck speed in order to get as much information crammed in as possible, this was Fincher perfecting his craft per say, his pacing has always been top notch, but here he fires scenes that are literally blink and you will miss some very important information. As mentioned earlier, hes still honing at this point and some of the character development with Paul Avery and some supporting actors kind of just doesnt happen. It's not critical as our focus fully shifts onto Jake and Mark for the final half but to continually refrence him once every 20 mins just feels slightly too tacked on for my liking. The film is gorgeous as per, however compared to the last outing, Fincher is more reserved, he uses his techniques to great effect, in order to gain a sense of dread and desperation. sparingly using tracking shots for when they really matter and it works. It's as if he just had to get all of that out his system and figure out what worked best for what. The grade on the film is also perfect, giving a real sense of time about it, each era is reconstructed brilliantly from colour schemes on set down to musical score, even the actors aging make up is brilliant. This film does however not lure you in, its a long film and unlike most of his other films, Fincher just presents his idea to you, if you like it you will invest and be truely horrified with its tales, however he doesnt try too hard to win everybody over. He isnt waiting for everyone to catch on and names and faces will come and go as quick as minutes before becoming a by product. This movie is strictly for Fincher fans and crime purists, anyone else will be left with a sense of boredom, confusion and most likely deflation by the end of the third act. A return to form and a stepping stone to greatness. under rated but far from perfect.",

            "content": "When it comes to actual events, sometimes there is question towards the art it inspires whether good, bad, or poor? I believe this is true when portraying a tragedy and how the artist is responsible not only displaying, but delivering a message from the event. Cinema is greatly reflects this when films are released with the hook, \"based on a true story.\" The range is broad when a hook like that is thrown, for what is true, what was made up, and what was left out. Where did this true story originate from (book, eyewitness account, memoir, rumor, etc.,) and was there anything learned from it? When a film is made from it, that is when a line is made from the s***y filmmakers to the brilliant ones. The one example I must point is David Fincher and his work in the Zodiac. Zodiac is based on the true story of the terror Zodiac unleashed with 5 (and possibly higher) murders and messages he sent to the media. What makes it fascinating or horrifying is the Zodiac Killer was never apprehended or identified even as today. People have become obsessive about the identity of the killer that it inspired books, movies, confessions, and hoax. Among these pieces, the most known is the non-fiction book Zodiac by Robert Graysmith which chronicles the events of the Zodiac from the widespread panic that was caused to obscurity. I have not read the book, but I assume Graysmith became obsessed with the subject so much that I thought of director David Fincher in his film the Zodiac. Zodiac is definitely an outstanding accomplishment from Fincher who directed The Game, Se7en, Fight Club, and Alien3. Zodiac is a lavish and authentic work with Fincher not only obsessed with telling the story, but the look and feel to it. It must have taken countless of hours and days and months to make the film while paying attention to the smallest detail. We get the looks, fashion, the music, the vehicles, and even the food when it comes to the Zodiac. The film centers around the story of the \"Zodiac killer\" and the investigation that followed by different branches of the police to a dedicated detective to even the cartoonist Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). However, Graysmith is often overlooked when he expresses interest over the Zodiac. Yet, Graysmith manages to get a little help from crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) with note he has on the crime. Their newspaper, The Chronicle, then begins to receive letters from the killer taunting the police and promising to strike again. Fincher manages to reflect the tension and anxiety the city of San Francisco had. It is sometimes a little difficult to believe certain scenes happened which I would point out, but do not want to ruin it. However, it seems like Fincher has spent a great deal and focus on every scene even after film moves into the 90s. This is a definite works as a period piece even focusing on the toll it had on the characters. My favorite of all was Downey Jr. as Avery. He was pretty amusing as the film's antihero while Gyllenhaal displayed the flawed hero. He is dedicated to stopping the killer, but is oblivious to his personal life. Other performers to highlight are Mark Ruffalo, Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, and others.",

Maybe I'm too seasoned a horror fan to be affected by the scenes of graphic violence, but nothing had me at the edge of my seat. What kept me watching (all 157 min.) was the incredibly deep drama of watching a cartoonist, a crime reporter, and a detective try to solve the Zodiac murders. The film works best as a drama, and an academic piece of film. Its directed with restraint and discipline by Fincher, who never loses sight of what he wants the film to be. He doesn't take any shortcuts by killing off a main character's wife, or even a main character at that. He doesn't do anything that didn't happen, and quite frankly that isn't as exciting as watching his film Seven (a film easily comparable to Zodiac). That being said, this film has a lot more to say than Seven about the nature of man. The Zodiac killer was obsessed with \"The Most Dangerous Game\", and that short story's themes run deep. The killer hunted humans, but so did everyone else when searching for him. Man is the most dangerous game, and it can overtake people's lives if they let it. This film is good, it might even be great. I just wish I enjoyed watching it more. I'm not saying I wanted Fincher to add anything exploitative, but perhaps a shorter run time would have been better.",

            "content": "Zodiac is, without doubt David Fincher's masterpiece and unbeknownst to everyone at the time, it will become the benchmark for all future Fincher films. It is the perfectly realised balance of a fine script, brilliant performances, technical acumen and above all an implacable restraint that is made all the more potent for the films one hundred and sixty-two minute length. All the problems with Se7en (still a great film) are obliterated in Zodiac, a far more difficult film to \"enjoy\" mostly because of the enormous cerebral pressure it places on the thinking viewer. The themes here are large: American obsession with serial killers, media interference in police procedure, pulp fictions obsession with true crime, the attention to detail of the obsessive, the reflexive nature of societies imaginations, the costs of obsession, the effects of time and memory on history, etc. If Fincher refused to turn the camera on his audience in Se7en, he does so with a cool calculated gaze in Zodiac, a film that rarely wavers into Fincher's characteristic flounces, such as helicopter shots or ambient police torch-light. Much of Fincher's integrity comes from a clear intention to tell the truth of the story, possibly because it is the first \"true story\" film Fincher will make, and his intention to avoid glamorizing the serial killer as he did in Se7en. By keeping so close to the facts of the story, by retaining a self consciousness about the end product, the meticulous perfectionism that characterises Fincher's directing style becomes the perfect vehicle for a long drawn out film about obsession on details.\n\nZodiac's opening scene is a fine example of the films merits. With Three Dog Night's lilting cover of 'Easy To Be Hard' wafting, the scene is of Vallejo, California on the fourth of July, fireworks bursting over the city. Darlene Ferrin (Ciara Hughes) is on her way to pick up Mike Mageau (Lee Norris), but the camera examines the houses celebrating fourth of July from her eye as she drives. When she drives Mike to a secluded lovers lane, another car approaches and although Mike wants to leave, Darlene claims everything is alright and doesn't make a move to drive away. Donovan's haunting 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' comes over the radio and increases as The Zodiac steps out of his car and shoots the pair. It's the scene that will become the defining murder leading to a suspect by Robert Greysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), the cartoonist at The San Francisco Chronicle who becomes obsessed with solving The Zodiac's puzzles and then the murder itself. Opening the film with the murder that causes the films denouement is not only clever writing, it also speaks to the fascination of the Zodiac obsessives. Fincher makes a film that the obsessives will love, even as he casts a shadow over the costs of that obsession. Greysmith, the writer of the two books the film is based on, is an obsessive, and James Vanderbuilt's decision to base the story on the fanboy who writes the books rather than the story of the killer is all the more powerful because it includes the detectives working the case as complicit in that obsession. If Greysmith becomes preoccupied because he loves puzzles and can't prevent himself from falling down the rabbit hole, then even more chilling is the fate of detective Dave Toshci (a soft-spoken Mark Ruffalo) who becomes haunted by association. Both men are reflected in characters who represent an alternate choice, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Junior) who sinks into depression and substance abuse against Greysmith's vigilance, and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) who voluntarily gives up detective work altogether because of the impact on his family against Toshci's being demoted and barred from the case for sending his own Zodiac letters. All four men will be ruined by their obsession with Armstrong as the only one who escapes. Fincher inserts wonderfully understated images to reflect this obsession, such as Greysmith, alone in his apartment filled with files about the Zodiac case after his family have left him, flicking through his newspaper clippings chillingly preserved in a family photo album.\n\nZodiac is the film where Fincher first gets his reputation for needing seventy takes on a set, and being so fastidiously precise that he gains support from the real life Toschi as well support from Vallejo police who hope the film will spark interest from the public. The film works within the obsession, becomes the obsession if you like, making itself another media representation of what it is seeking to expose. The Zodiac killer played with the media, using it to enhance his  notoriety. From the badges Paul Avery has made that everyone wears that say \"I'm not Paul Avery\" through the comment William Armstrong makes to David Toshci when Avery supposedly discovers the Zodiac's first victim, \"It's very real. You know how I know? I saw it on TV,\" to the incredible collection images used in the montage of media lettering and zodiac puzzles sliding and moving over the top of the detectives trying to do their job.   This obsession with representation through the lens makes the Zodiac a different serial killer, a modern serial killer, and this becomes Fincher's second film that points to a problematic relationship with the camera. The Zodiac is never caught, which is interesting seeing as he calls famous people regularly, sent letters to the press, and forged personal relationships with the people obsessed with catching him. In Panic Room, David Fincher told us video surveillance becomes a self-cogitating nightmare, the lens always pointed back at us. In Zodiac he uses the media and film in the same way, revealing a relationship with technology that uses us more than we make a use of it.\n\nIt's easy to talk about Zodiac all day, but I wanted to make one additional mention of the incredible performances, which Fincher has claimed, came \"from the fifty-fourth take.\" It is a film that uses detail almost like a character, but this extends to the performances, with everyone at the top of their game, making this Fincher film the best in his collection.",

Time and time again he's made movies that defy and challenge our capabilities for tolerance with an appreciation to delve into the darker underbelly of the living.  He did it most notably with SE7EN and FIGHT CLUB and has not stopped since [GONE GIRL, playing now, is his latest].  ZODIAC is certainly no exception but for the fact that it is based on a true, technically unsolved serial murder case that impacted an American nation for over a decade back in the sixties and seventies.  By setting its dark tone at the very start and building up to its frightening, inconclusive ending, Fincher manages to crawl his obsession with cruelty and madness under our skin.  It's a terrifying tale, told in a very simple step-by-step, matter-of-fact manner, painting an ugly portrait of life and then subjecting us to keep a mesmerized gaze at the screen only to realize we've been conned into watching a horrible reality steeped in a unending nightmare.  Something that's hard to wake up from or to fall asleep after. Sensational for all the right reasons, with ZODIAC Fincher once more proves he's equally smart as an artist with a vision as he is a storyteller with a lure.",

            "content": "The 2007 film Zodiac-about the infamous (and anonymous) hooded Zodiac serial killer who first emerged in the late 60s-is a hefty slow burn of a film about the process in bringing a mysterious murderer to justice. It is also a very dark and cynical look at the American Judicial System, where the misuse of media, coupled with mass hysteria and the lack of communication (or too much information) can lead to more harm than good. Being directed by David Fincher, his usual color palate perfectly exhibits the (lack of) hope of finding a faceless person with vague clues and intuitions into a bleak reality of false dawns and insensitive actualities. This isn't Dirty Harry-referenced in a very tongue in cheek way-were a Magnum can make a Perp squeal and confess. No, Zodiac depicts the arduous and time-consuming detective work where Due Process is the only lawful method of bringing people to justice. Showing such a time consuming process-a process that spans more than twenty years in the picture-has a fallout of the film being roughly 2  1/2 hours in length, but the viewing experience never \"feels\" long. The way Fincher glides from month to month (or year to year) is at first eye widening, then anxiousness creeps in, then it becomes darkly funny to finally wrap things up in a slightly underwhelming manner. Like Stanley Kubrick before him, Fincher isn't the most heartwarming filmmaker and he depicts things in a sterile, unflinching-or un-Finchering-way. Not to say the film is devoid of emotion as Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo both portray two tortured souls who commit their lives to finding out the true face behind the mask. Their descent into an endless abyss of circulated information is both cynically funny and depressing.  At the core of Zodiac is not a police procedural, nor is it a homicide mystery. Rather, it is a portrait of obsession and the lengths people will go to find solitude from their obsessions. It never really \"builds\" to anything in a traditional film watching sense, which may feel unsatisfactory. This lack of conformity leaves Zodiac sticking out like a partial fingerprint at a crime scene-there is a larger story behind it all-and Fincher patiently lets it all unwind in a grueling, timely, manner.",

So many other films with a famed murderer as its subject tend to strive away from the real-life tragedies and make it one juicy filet of madness.  But \"Zodiac\" doesn't focus on the criminal behind the actions - it is instead like \"All the President's Men\", portraying a group of people who would not rest until the truth finally came to light.  \n\tFamously, the Zodiac was never identified, nor brought to justice, yet the film gives us closure that can't be felt through a Wikipedia page or a true crime novel.  It's a rather quiet, slow film, its 157 minutes just as long and frustrating as the investigation itself.\n\tThe film opens with a murder, bizarre and bloody, and instantly we feel the same sort of eyes-agape anxiety the public felt during the time the Zodiac was at large.  The killer shoots them, a flashlight taped to his gun.  The victims are a clean-cut couple at a lover's lane, and only the man survives.  We already begin to lock these minute details into our brain to look for patterns, inevitably.  \n\tBut Fincher isn't fixated on the killings, nor does he try to make them cinematic.  They are quick, horrifying, and almost awkward.  Real murder isn't artistic in the way the shower scene was in \"Psycho\", after all.  \n\t\"Zodiac\" is intent on solving the case, not dwelling on the carnage.  We are introduced to Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), a reporter, and David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), a detective.  The three are the most involved in the solving of the case, even if Avery eventually falls off the deep end.  Graysmith dedicates much of his life to it, which eventually disintegrates his marriage, while Toschi busies himself with other things, but can't help but still be curious about the murderer's identity.  \n\tThere are so many false leads and dead ends that they are just as maddening to us as the people who actually lived it.  Sure, the Zodiac killer eventually stopped being  pressingly infamous, but the fact that we never find out who he is is like receiving an everlasting bug-bite that you can never scratch.\n\tThe public is always fascinated with serial killers, transforming the gore into a paranoid thrill ride.  The backstories, the psychology, the mindset of the murderer can be an uncomfortably compelling thing.  Even I'm guilty of this.  But even with the most research, the most inside details, it's impossible to know the people that were touched by all the untamed danger. \n\tThe film spans over two-decades, and the beauty of it is that there are moments of terrifying intensity with others that are deadly boring.  But without boring bits, \"Zodiac\" wouldn't nearly be as good.  It's so true to life that those moments of nothingness make the film feel even more authentic.\n\tIt's a long, imperfect ride, but \"Zodiac\" has a fantastic set of actors and a top-notch director on its side to make even the dullest of bits turn into something of interest.",

            "content": "How do you make a dramatic film about a real-life serial killer who was never caught? It's a pretty tall order, but I think they found the answer to the question with Zodiac. The first way they managed the seemingly impossible task was to avoid all the Hollywood tropes you find in serial killer films, in fact this one is so far removed from those cliches that it almost doesn't fit the genre. You see the focus is not really on the killer, we get a few brief scenes of his murders, but they take up a very small portion of the story. Instead this is about the people surrounding the case. It looks into the intricacies of police work, the time spent in the newspaper office dealing with the letters they received, and even the obsession of one lone man who \"just has to know.\" There are loads of scenes that, in the hands of a lesser director, could easily have been boring or slowed the pace of the film. Yet David Fincher finds ways to make digging through paperwork, and questioning suspects seem exciting. Somehow, despite the fact that I knew the end result of the true story, they managed to keep me engaged and questioning whether they would be able to nail this next suspect.\n\nI won't waste time talking about the acting performances, because they all were amazing. In fact I would say these are the finest performances I have ever seen from Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Anthony Edwards. But every other performance was solid as well. The visual look of the film was also amazing. Just like playing intense music, the dark look to certain scenes added to the unsettling atmosphere. It felt like at any moment someone could get murdered or someone could be revealed as the killer. It was masterfully accomplished because I imagine that was exactly the feeling that people had back in those days. Yet Zodiac isn't all perfection. There are some moments in the movie that feel unnecessary for the main storyline. I know that the director and writer met with tons of people who were there at the time in order to find out how things actually happened, but as a result of this I think they included more minute details that were completely irrelevant to the story they were telling. This resulted in a longer run-time than I think the film warranted. My only other complaint is that, yes it's Hollywood cliche, but I want closure. I like that they held to the true story, but it's so unsatisfying walking away without the bad guy being caught. It's a minor complaint in what is otherwise an amazing film, which I highly recommend.",

Less than half way through the film, the three principle detectives interview Arthur Leigh Allen at his work place and through a couple of semi-closeups two of the detectives actually speak right to the camera - displacing any pre-conceived notions the audience might be entertaining about Allen being just another suspect in a long list. Brilliant.",

I say it's the best because of its story which is strong and relatively easy to follow not to mention a very successful and talented cast including Jake Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. So with these three powerful leads it sets a high expectation for the film, and for me it never really seemed like disappointing. Going back to the story/plot everything is done really well including characters evolution, music etc. but also Zodiac sticks to the point of the story and doesn't have any surprise twists or turns which would probably mess with the story. A dark suspenseful thriller that I really enjoyed and liked how everything turned out.",

            "content": "The talented \"Zodiac\" murder brings upon three detectives (one being an amateur since he is a cartoonist) that begin to build lives around finding the killer. A cartoonist may not seem to fit in with being a detective, but it is worth it, since \"Zodiac\" is based on a true story. Lots of mystery films rely on detectives instead of other people that would make a film fascinating. The cartoonist Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is the amateur detective: creative, enthralled, and hooked to solving who the \"Zodiac\" killer is.\n\nAfter getting into \"True Detective\" on HBO, this drew me into watching \"Zodiac.\" The letters that the killer writes to newspapers shows how far detectives would go to solve a murder. The killer keeps up to date to find people to kill, and even broadcasts himself on the radio anonymously. This film is definitely the where a murder crosses the line.\n\nThe two other characters involved are distracted. The alcoholic journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey JR), receives a letter from the \"Zodiac\", quits his job, and remains in solitude and does nothing, except drink. He chooses this behavior because when the \"Zodiac\" gives notifications of any of his homicides, he makes it his goal to kill people immediately. The overwhelmed detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the head of the case, but the killer's strategy is too perfect for Toschi to solve. Safety is the major concern for both Avery and Toschi, because the \"Zodiac\" knows they are targeting him. But Graysmith is the most disciplined with puzzles to crack which person the \"Zodiac\" is.\n\nGraysmith and Toschi have a strange relationship. Toschi dislikes Graysmith. Graysmith spends days and nights with files and reports to finish the investigation. This makes Toschi to be annoyed with Graysmith because...Toschi sees the \"Zodiac\" is impossible to solve.\n\nThe script is written by James Vanderbilt and is long. This caused some of the dialogue to be talked through quickly, which was why the investigation or conversation scenes required viewer's full-on attention.\n\nThere is a reason why this film is well-played...Fincher's directing style of multiple takes to make scene have a purpose. If you remember the opening scene in \"The Social Network\" (with Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara) that conversation took ninety-nine takes. The frequent takes of the fast dialogue in \"Zodiac\" is perfect. That made me watch as thoroughly as possible, and get involved with the film.",

As a child who grew up during a time in which this case was highly publicized I realize I may be in the minority of people who will find this film highly intriguing.       With that said, for me, every level of this film works. All of the performances in this film are deeply convincing, with Gyllanhaal, Downey and Ruffalo perhaps doing some of the best work of their careers.  Fincher as usual, keeps this film extremely morosely tense from its opening scene and throughout the entire film. As a film, it is intelegently written following the Graysmith book, rather than the actual investigations.\nSPOILER ALERT; Keep in mind that there were many suspects in the actual Zodiac case and there is an equal amount of data dismissing much of the circumstantial evidence revealed in this film. But as a film, I find it to be highly under appreciated and consider it be be among the decades best.",

The characters in this movie are ridiculously well developed. For a dialogue heavy thriller, Zodiac is every bit as entertaining as an action movie- and it is twice as engrossing. The movie is ultimately a tale about obsession. It chronicles one man's exhausting search for truth, even as his obsession begins to get the better of other parts of his life. The protagonists in this movie are sucked into the intrigue and mystery surrounding the Zodiac Killer, and Fincher captures this intensity and desperation perfectly. At times frightening, at times frustrating, Zodiac is the best police procedural I have ever seen. Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo deliver the script perfectly and manically. And in their borderline hysteria, the viewer is effectively and equally entranced as the characters.",
