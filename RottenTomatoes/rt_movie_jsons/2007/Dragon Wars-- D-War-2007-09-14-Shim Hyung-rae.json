            "content": "One of the worst piece of shits I ever watched. I'm ashamed to say I bought a theater ticket for this. There was no story flow. One scene it looks like there about to get eaten by the giant snake and for sure meet their doom with what looks like no means of getting out of the scary situation.  The next scene literally 10 seconds after, they're eating hotdogs in a small joint contemplating on what to do to stay alive and figure out wtf is happening. Like wtf just happened?? Ur about to die, then ur eating hotdogs. It didn't explain shit on that. Honestly it was more like a comedy to me it was so bad. And not a good comedy. A painful carrot top wasted 2 hours of my life embarrassed I watched this cus I'm bored comedy. I would rather watch frankenshish from syfy or the ginger dead man over this it was that bad.",

            "content": "I saw the movie when I was a kid and I watched it now (I'm writting this review while watching the movie). I would say that the plot's main idea was quite interesting, but the problem was that everything occurs really fast in the movie. It also has some plot holes like: it was supposed to be \"Dragon Wars\", but the good Dragon appears around 10 or 15 minutes of a 1 1/2 hours movie and only during the final battle scene; why does the \"old man\" vanishes at the end? and why does he barely appears? (maybe around the half of his participation was in Ethan's flashback at the beginning); they don't mention how did Sarah realised about everything (literally, Ethan went to meet her at the hospital and she didn't know/remember anything and, in the next scene, she magically knows almost everything that's going on); was the whole movie just to get to the point where the good reptile becomes a real dragon kills the other one and leaves with the sphere? just that?; does Ethan just walks back home at the end? \nFrom my point of view, I'd say it could've been a great movie (as I said, I believe that the plot's main idea was good), but they just wasted it (I mean, they could've expanded more things and correct the plot holes)\nSadly, I'd say they wasted a good idea",

I guess I kind of liked the huge flashback part in the beginning but it was so disjointed from the rest of the film I didn't understand why it was even there outside of showing off all the graphics used in the Lord of the Rings styled battle scene, and that was dumb because it was so derivative. Actually I'd say most of this movie is derivative. I'm really disappointed too because I usually like Korean films, but I guess just like in America, they can't all be winners.",

Even by big dumb blockbuster standards, the script is extremely generic (flat characters in particular are one of my biggest peeves in movies and TV), and even during the climactic battles it's still no more entertaining than any of its dialogue scenes, which I can assure you are anything but.\n\nPeople seem to praise the special effects, but I have to disagree. While the CGI monsters themselves are very well made, the actual compositing (the integration of the CGI into the live action footage, as well as greenscreen work) is terribly done, resulting in the monsters often looking poorly pasted on top of the picture and not at all like they're actually there.  \n\nUnless you are wowed by the special effects, this movie has little to offer. It's too terrible to be enjoyed by its own merits, and too tedious and generic to be enjoyed ironically. Don't waste your time.",

            "content": "Rating: 2/5\nSo Bad it's good rating: 3,5/5\n\"Dragon Wars\" a.k.a. \"D-War\" is a pretty lousy movie, but at least it's got one thing going for it: Dragons! It's the story of Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr). He's the reincarnation of a man who, 500 years ago was charged with protecting a princess from the evil Buraki, a giant serpent. The woman in question, has been reincarnated as Sarah (Amanda Brooks). The young woman contains the essence of the Yeouiju, which can transform a serpent like Buraki (an Imugi) into a Celestial Drago, but only when she turns 20. It's nearing Sarah's birthday and Buraki sends his army of dinosaurs, dragons and soldiers to go get her! Ethan must save Sarah or she will be instrument in the destruction of our world... or whatever consequences Buraki transforming into a dragon will have.\nWhen this movie features the dragons, it's awesome. There is a nice variety in the creatures that attack the humans and we get two good, long scenes featuring them. There is one scene in the past, where they simply annihilate the village where the past lives of Sarah and Ethan are living and one in the present where they battle helicopters, tanks and soldiers. We've got soldiers riding velociraptor-like dinosaurs, we've got two-legged Blastoise-like monster with cannons on their backs, we've got flying dragons and sword-wielding ground troops. The battle sequences with these guys are really awesome and the special effects are top-notch. We also get some cool moments where the evil Buraki goes on a rampage in present day. The scenes where it is slithering across crowded streets, knocking hundreds of cars over, crawling over buildings, encircling skyscrapers in its coils and eating people is truly awesome. We even get a pretty sweet Imugi vs. Imugi battle and a dragon vs. Imugi fight towards the end of the movie. If you just like seeing giant monsters wrecking stuff, there's a lot to like here.\nWhenever there are only people talking in the movie, without any dragons anywhere near them, it's downright terrible. This is the kind of movie where characters really under-react to the destruction that's around them. Craig Robinson in particular looks really unenthusiastic, even when being chased by a towering serpent capable of reducing buildings to dust. You can tell no one's priorities were in any of the scenes were people are acting too, because for no discernible reason, no one ever sees the monster moving as long as it's off-screen and every single person in the world, except for that one comedic guy no one believes, is fast-asleep whenever the monsters show up. Even from an overall story level though, this is really bad. The climax of the movie gets resolved in a Deus-Ex Machina that really cheapens the movie and makes it obvious that writer/director Shim Hyung-rae wrote himself into a corner and had no idea what to do with his own story. The movie becomes really laughable in hindsight because you realize if a character in the past hadn't been a total moron, the whole situation could have been avoided and millions of lives would have been spared. \nWhat this movie has going for it is the laughable storyline, which includes flashbacks within flashbacks, a confusing story that's just an excuse to tie in scenes of monsters wrecking civilizations together and a half-dozen clunky moments of characters interacting with each other that will leave you scratching your head in confusion. The special effects are good and pretty exciting, but the story sucks. That means the movie is great for making fun of and makes for a great background movie at your party. When people are talking your guests can either laugh or ignore the movie. When the dragons start wrecking the place, it'll make for great conversation. I say rent \"D-War\" (I think that title is so nutty it's awesome) on Blu-ray, watch it with your buddies that want to have some laughs and you'll have a good time. (On Blu-ray, June 20, 2014)",

Image a 200-meter-long evil serpent from ancient Korea with an army of giant lizards, flying dragons, black-armoured humanoid warriors, and immense reptiles. A spectacular and dynamic action-packed display of computer-generated imagery (CGI) awaits you in Dragon Wars!\r\n\r\n\tAccording to a Korean legend, long ago there lived great serpents called Imoogies. They lived in the heavens with their legions of followers. Every 500 years one Imoogi is rewarded for its good deeds with a chance to become a Celestial Dragon. The Imoogi needs to receive from heaven the gift of the Yuh Yi Joo. It is the strength and power of the Yuh Yi Joo that allows an Imoogi to transform into a dragon. One evil serpent, Buraki, wanted to possess Yuh Yi Joo; heaven would not allow it and so hid the Yuh Yi Joo on Earth. Heaven sent down its best warriors, Haram and his master Bochun, to protect the Yuh Yi Joo. A female named Narin was born with Yuh Yi Joo which would become completely formed when she reached 20. This is when the evil Buraki and his followers attacked the village searching for Narin who was saved by Haram. Defying the rule of heaven he threw away a special pendent and ran away with Narin. With Buraki still in pursuit they jumped off a cliff and died. Now, 500 years later Bochun, Haram and Narin are reincarnated in present day Los Angeles. Bochun/Jack finds Haram/Ethan and gives him the pendant who finds Narin/Sarah the day she turns 20. Buraki and his army attack the city wreaking havoc and destruction in their quest to find Sarah. Haram/ Ethan gets a second chance to protect the Yuh Yi Joo.\r\n\r\n\tThe director of this fantastic action fantasy B film, Hyung Rae Shim, did an excellent job bringing this legend to life. He used flashbacks to tell the original story so we can predict the destruction coming to LA. It took Shim five years to make the most expensive and elaborate film in Korean history, creating a familiar atmosphere for international audiences. His direction demonstrated good timing, technical and artistic techniques.\r\n\r\n\tThe qualities of the visual effects are astounding and extraordinary. A director must image everything he cannot see when shooting a film. To accomplish this, Shim built his own special effects studio, Young Gu Art, to create the CGI. The battle scenes are complex and realistic. Wave after wave of continuous heart-pounding action keeps you enthralled.\r\n\r\n\tI really admire Shim for the fantastic technical effects he accomplished and increasing the reputation of the Korean film industry. He took a big risk making this film and I believe that it will stand the test of time. Dragons are good for films. Period.",

Any other monsters would can result in disappointment, just like how Dragon Wars.\r\n\r\nEvery five hundred years, a woman protected by a man transforms in a serpent to fight against a dragon in a battle between good and evil. Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon. So right off you know the story won't go anywhere as it include random scenes that makes you wonder if you're watching the most expensive high-school movie ever produced. I'm serious, there so much inconstancy like how a helicopter crashes into a building and then magically blows up when the pilots get out for some reason. It's also very uninteresting to have a hero who's useless for most of the movie which made me feel like also watching a comedy just because on bad certain scenes are.\r\n\r\nSo the story isn't what anyone wants to watch in this movie, they want the monsters, and they disappoint for the most part. These monsters just look terrible and terribly animated. I will say I did enjoy when the monsters got released in Los Angles and the battle began. To bad they were terribly filmed and not as cool as they could have been. As for the epic finale, i'll just say i've seen better in terms of monster movies. I mean the area where the final battle looks so bad and incomplete with bad special effects. The final battle is a let down, it's last less than three minutes. Now I originally was going to give this a 30% before I saw the ending. The ending makes you feel you wasted your time and got ripped off.\r\n\r\nIt's such a shame to see a movie featuring Dragons be this bad and so poorly made. I mean it's not often we see Dragons being the main focus of a movie let alone in a watchable movie, but maybe one day we'll have a decent movie featuring Dragons. Until then, avoid this at all cost.",

First, I will say the opening started off with an old man faking a heart attack in front of a boy's father; sending the father off for 'help' as an excuse to explain to the boy that he's a re-incarnation of a 'protector' from 1507 a.d. Korea. Next was a pitched battle scene from that same era, and that actually fooled me into thinking this could be an interesting movie. How wrong I was. To me, it all went downhill from there. This film tries to invoke imagery from such classics as \"The Neverending Story\", \"Dragonheart\", and even \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\". However, I'm left debating whether this was actually worse than \"Reign Of Fire\". From the moment I first saw the 'evil dragon', I had my doubts, and they were satisfied. Instead of wings on the side of it's head, there's a 'hood' similar to that which cobras exhibit. There are even mild attempts at comedy relief, and those failed miserably. Solid half-star material if I've even seen it (and trust me...I have).",

The battle scenes that permeate the second half of this picture are exciting, well directed and a lot of fun.\r\nYou only wish that the writers didn't take so long to set-up those wars. That set-up is a tedious, boring and laugh-filled mess. After a half hour of ridiculous explanations and contrived dialogue, you're ready to scream \"Enough!\" at the screen. Everything is as clear as mud, but once the action gets underway, none of that matters. You don't need to understand the first half of the film to enjoy the second.\r\nThe cast is bland and forgettable, and veteran B-lister Robert Forster even looks embarrassed to be in this. It's a pretty silly performance and a lame part to begin with. But, if you can make it past the mystifying, completely unnecessary opening half, there are some enjoyable moments here. The special effects are quite remarkable considering what the filmmakers had to work with. The battle sequences are a blast, and so much better than the big-budget \"Godzilla\" remake. \r\nI just wonder why the makers of \"Dragon Wars\" felt the need to lull us to sleep first. There are some laughs, but mostly blank stares and puzzled looks. The script is needlessly complicated and overly plotted for what the writers set out to accomplish.

It's absurd, ridiculous, and for all intended purposes, non-existent. I didn't go into this for a great story, but when the lead female is supposed to be 19 years old, turning 20, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense that her friend takes her out to the bar for a few drinks. And honestly, how does half of LA not notice a giant fucking snake slithering around? Even more so, it seems that everyone who has encountered these giant cobras and winged raptors and Star Wars: A New Hope dewback-esque creatures with magic rocket launchers strapped to their backs doesn't seem to worried.\n\nOh hey, there's a magic army that worships Sauron after us, let's go hide out on the beach or at the local coffee shop.

Personally I hated the modern setting of Los Angeles when it should be Korea and the people should be Korean. Though the film was popular in Korea just not with American and English audiences.  BTW this had a very high budget for a Korean film well over 70 million dollars to create those stunning special effects.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/11bkabr.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a Korean legend, every five hundred years, a woman protected by a man transforms in a serpent to fight against a dragon in a battle between good and evil. In Los Angeles of the present days, after a mysterious accident, the reporter Ethan Kendrick recalls his meeting fifteen years ago with Jack, who owned an antique shop and told him that he was the one supposed to protect Sarah Daniels. Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon.\r\n\r\nSo according to the title Dragon Wars I expected to see massive battles between dragons but NO just one wreaks havoc and its minions follow. So I hated the story I think it's wrong Era and Wrong Place to set it in and the story is unfocused to what it should be doing. I think my favourite was the scenes set in ancient Korea because at least that had something to do with the story. The acting isn't to bad I disliked the female lead but our hero did okay. The special effects in all respect are the only great part about the film I mean it did have a very high budget to bad the effects just saved the film from being a major disaster. And the creatures are cool I guess. The music is really good and as for the editing and stuff like that pretty good.\r\nHere are some facts I found.\r\n\r\nThe music associated with Muraki and his army makes extensive use of the \"Dies irae\" melody, a medieval chant traditionally used in ceremonies for the dead and, since the nineteenth century, in contexts evoking the macabre and supernatural.\r\n\r\nThis marked the first Korean production in nearly three decades to receive wide theatrical release in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe final edit for both the US and Korean versions of the film run approximately 92 minutes, considerably shorter than the 110 minute cut first shown at the American Film Market in Santa Monica, CA on November 4, 2006, and again at the Berlin Film Market on February 8, 2007. According to D-WAR production company Younggu Art Entertainment, the film was tightened to improve pacing based on feedback from preview screenings.\r\n\r\nOverall failed again Korean monster flick that could have been nothing but epic and my final verdict is not recommended.",

And Dragon Wars plays like a homepage to major elements of this or there legends but is it just me or is this film just bad? I mean this could have been an amazing movie but there is just so much unfocused stuff and things that trail off into nothing. And the amazing fact is that they set it in America and not Korea? The only thing that saved this movie were the amazing special effects, and some major creature designs of their culture. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/255niqg.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBased on the Korean legend, unknown creatures will return and devastate the planet. Reporter Ethan Kendrick is called in to investigate the matter, and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl, stricken with a mysterious illness, named Sarah is supposed to help him. The Imoogi makes its way to Los Angeles, wreaking havoc and destruction. And it will be the start of a massive climax to end this legend.\r\n\r\nPersonally I hated the story it is 100% unfaithful to the legends and how they have placed the setting in Los Angeles and only a brief moment in Korea. It should be Korea and it should have Korean actors for a Korean film.\r\nAlso despite it being Terrible it was a big hit in Korea landing in there highest grossing films of all time.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/aelfew.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n20% for story: I liked the ending scene at the massive temple with the fight but that's about it.

Its funny how they or most would even try.\r\n\r\n30% for characters: Indeed there interesting but overall still bad only because there American and annoying. Again Koreans might have made the film interesting.\r\n\r\n90% for special effects: This movie cost around $75 million dollars in American Money or $69 billion won (South Korean money). Making it the highest budgeted film for the time, to bad the amazing effects were the only good part.\r\n\r\n39% for everything else: Some amazing music but that's it and some epic creature designs but that's it.\r\n\r\nAlothought its better then his first film Reptillian big time but Is it worth anyones time?

I say this with no disrespect to BvP which is truly a misunderstood sub-genre classic.\r\n\r\nBut back to D-War. The film deserves credit for its sheer audacity alone. Not only do we have a giant snake ripping things up from feudal Korea to modern day America, but he also has at his disposal an army of black armoured soldiers (think the Uruk-Hai from Lord of the Rings on a tight budget) who ride around on the backs of dinosaurs... with rocket launchers!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the storyline is a bit off-the-wall (referencing obscure Korean legends), it is somewhat refreshing to watch a film about a giant monster that is not an alien visitor run amuck or a result of genetic engineering gone awry. The special effects are mostly solid, if not spectacular. Indeed there are times when they get a little bit ropey. However, the budget of  D-War budget was fairly low for a film of its kind so this is forgivable as the film is a fairly impressive technical achievement overall.\r\n\r\nEnough of that!, I hear you say, Tell us about the action! Well, I am happy to say that for the most part it delivers. The first act contains some fairly cool over the top kung fu fighting that looks, how shall we say, inspired by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Toward the end there is a great battle between the dinosaur people and the US army in a busy city which packs a nice punch. There is also one of those epic CGI showdowns to cap off the finale. Unfortunately the pacing of the middle of the film is a bit too slow, consisting of several chase scenes (apparently the only weakness of a Demi-God snake monster is to drive away from it very quickly) and some hammy detective work. Luckily it does not take itself too seriously, offering some goofy humour every now and then to keep the tone light and stop the film from becoming too dependent on a lacklustre storyline.\r\n\r\nOverall, D-War is an enjoyable romp well worth checking out if you are up late and in the mood for some B-movie style action.",
