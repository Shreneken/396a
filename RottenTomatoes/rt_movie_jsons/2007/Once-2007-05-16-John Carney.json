    "summary": "A vacuum repairman (Glen Hansard) moonlights as a street musician and hopes for his big break. One day a Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova), who earns a living selling flowers, approaches him with the news that she is also an aspiring singer-songwriter. The pair decide to collaborate, and the songs that they compose reflect the story of their blossoming love.",

            "content": "Throughout high school and college, music was a huge part of my life and education.  One of the experiences that brought tremendous joy was jamming.  Creating new sounds and rhythms on the spur of the moment, sharing chord progressions with other musicians through instinct, skill and some luck.  It's never perfect, but it's always immensely fulfilling and enjoyable.  Watching the film Once (2007) was akin to being part of such a jam session… a deeply personal and incredibly satisfying 86-minute jam.\nOnce tells the tale of an Irish guy (Glen Hansard) who fixes vacuums at his dad's shop during business hours but then operates as a street busker at night in order to play his music and earn some extra cash.  While performing he meets a young immigrant Czech girl (Markea Irglova).  Though she works odd jobs (selling roses in the street and cleaning houses) she also comes from a musical family.  She and the guy soon begin collaborating and creating marvelous songs.  Their melodies seem to express feelings they share for each other, though the guy is getting over a recent break-up and the girl has an estranged husband.\nThe music is so enchanting.  Almost every song was written by Hansard and/or Irglova.  The two are professional musicians and had previously performed together as a folk-rock duo.  This would be only the second acting experience for Hansard and the first for Irglova.  Their acting inexperience aside, the two have an extraordinary chemistry and both deliver honest performances.  The movie is a very low budget one, filmed in just 17 days with handheld cameras and using natural lighting.  This technique elicits a feeling of intimacy and compliments the tone of the lower working-class existence that both characters live in.  \nWhile technically this film would be categorized as a love story, it is not a predictable one.   Like any great jam session, predictability is not allowed.  And that's a very good thing.  Viewing Once was an emotionally renewing and rewarding experience.  It was a stellar reminder that unforgettable story telling, like great music, doesn't always require big budgets.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this Irish film, due to the music played, the down to earth characters and comic aspects it contained. Its not excessively sentimental but it is a bit heart warming (i.e. in a good way!). The camerawork featured gives it a feel of perhaps a low budget documentary or TV show but that sort of worked in its favour I think. It certainly didn't feel like a Hollywood version/Hollywood-ised Irish film. Its contemporary and I liked the performances, particularly Glen Hansard as Guy.\n\nThe two main characters certainly do appear to have a genuine spark and I enjoyed seeing them open up about things, talking and enjoying the time they have together. If your a fan of music (primarily folk based music I suppose, it has to be said) and romance type films, then I'd highly recommend this film. Its perhaps not brilliant but its certainly good - it has a genuine feel to it and is undoubtedly worth seeing at least 'once'.",

Glen Hansard plays a Dublin busker, working in his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop while busking in his spare time.  Marketa Irglova plays a pianist with a broken vacuum cleaner, bringing the two together in friendship and musical partnership.  Hansard is charismatic as the idealist musician, but Irglova steals the show as the bluntly honest and deadpan sidekick.  Despite the fact that the songs sometimes feel like they run a bit long, the original music is excellent and the chemistry between the two main characters feels genuine.  The handheld camerawork almost gives the film the feel of a documentary and the Dublin streets make a great backdrop for the charming story.  Many of the interior scenes seem under lit, but that's a small complaint for such an enjoyable film.",

            "content": "This is frequently compared with Before Sunrise, and I'm pretty sure Careny viewed Linklater's first installment in his Before trilogy as an inspiration making this little indie gem. Never have I ever thought I would be once again overwhelmed by the same emotions while watching Before Sunrise for the first time, let alone from watching another film. But whilst the conversations and what they offer of random insights of life form the true essence of Linklater's masterpiece, as well as the bulk of his body of work; Carney's propensity to infuse the spirit of music in his movies and his knack for making it find its way across them has never been so palpable, and so prominent, as it is here. Not only is \"Guy\" and \"Girl\"'s mutual passion for music the force that draw them together, but it's also their way of communicating their feelings with each other; a language that's more expressive and revealing than either English or Czech. It's one of these movies that have music as an integral part of them so much so they can nearly be classified as Musical films. Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born is a case in point. Correspondingly, the movie channels empathy in all of us, something that's further bolstered by the impactful and raw soundtrack that seems to capture the heart and soul of busking, and the hand-held camera and grainy images that lended a sense of realism to this sensational experience. What held Once back from a higher score is that it seemed that the two leads' consequences of their past loves that hinder their relationship suddenly popped into their minds, as if they've been quite oblivious to them except at some exact point. That's why the denouement feels abrupt to me. Still, Once is quite possibly my new favourite Carney.\n\n(8.5/10)",

The story is fairly straightforward and the cast, albeit seemingly a bit green in the acting biz, weren't half bad either.

The two leads are charming and have a beautiful chemistry with one another which permeates the entire film. There were a few times I struggled to understand dialogue because the accents were so thick, but I don't feel like I missed anything vital. Ordinarily I don't like a lot of shaky handheld camera work, but since this is a movie that is relatively still, all the cinematography does is ground the movie to make it even more gritty and realistic. There's not much more I can say about this film, because the story is basic and often becomes secondary to the music. The magic of Once is definitely in those songs. The nice thing is that the lyrics are often relevant, and reference things that are actually going on in the film. It's the kind of movie I could see myself watching when I want to relax, because there is a soothing nature to the music and the story. I personally prefer John Carney's second attempt at this kind of story (Begin Again) but that doesn't mean that Once isn't a treat that I can easily recommend.",

            "content": "Skyrocketing the career of the man who would go on to create Begin Again (2014), Once sounded like a chance to see where it all began for director John Carney.\n\nMusical films very rarely please me due to an obsession with style over substance and a frequent excess of singing which gets in the way of genuine storytelling. With Once, the budget is so incredibly no that there is no room to obsess over massive amounts of glitz and glam. In actual fact, the film is captured with cinematography techniques and resolution which is somewhat rough, giving the film the feeling of a home movie. It isn't something that is frustrating, it simply puts a strong feel of realism into Once and works as a budgeting technique at the same time. One of the greatest elements of Once is simply how realistic it is. \nOnce is realistic in terms of style, story and even as a musical. In terms of narrative, Once is a film where not too much happens. In that sense it can be rather slow at times, but its 86 minute running time ensures that it doesn't stretch things on for too long. Much of the realism in the narrative lies in the fact that it is such a low budget film that it is devoid of the Hollywood conventions found in big-budget star vehicles. The film has elements of comedy and drama, but it feels very genuine. Like real life, the film story is unpredictable and so when the drama happens it is not some massive build-up for an unleashed climax but rather stems from natural interactions between the characters. It's almost as if there is no screenplay for the film and the actors are humans being shot from afar, and this is a feeling influenced by the cinematography. Once is not a film with tedious subplots, an abundance of characters or cheesy romance, it is a genuine story of love and music. In that sense, it is beautiful. As someone who is picky with musical films and can't stand generic love stories, I can certify that Once successfully transcends my standards for both genres and stands out as a production of pure artistic vision. John Carney's ambition to find such grace in a simplistic premise is a remarkable achievement in which his success cannot be  denied.\nAs a musical, Once is unlike any other that has ever been made. The musical numbers in the film occur when the characters are singing to themselves or to others, when they are sharing an artistic passion with the people around them. And instead of hiding behind an unseen orchestra, the actors actually have to play the instruments on screen much of the time. And when the cast is singing they have to do it in extended shots, such as the scene in which Marketa Irglova walks down the dark streets and sings \"If You Want Me\". The music in the film is truly beautiful, made up of words that mean something and instruments rather than catchy beats and corporate sponsoring. The soundtrack in Once is a truly marvellous collection of songs, the kind with passion and spirit yet also a feeling of serene grace to them which illuminates the heart of the film and brings out its greatest strength. Any time there is music in Once, the film is at its truly greatest.\nAnd it is difficult to imagine many people walking out of Once having not been touched by the many talents of the two leads.\nGlen Hansard is perhaps the most memorable thing about Once. The man is a professional musician with hardly any acting experience under his belt, but he is clearly a born artist. His performance in Once is hardly a performance, it feels simply like he is giving his heart to viewers through a restrained one-off performance. He never goes melodramatic or sentimental with his performance, but he conveys a really humane feeling of vulnerability at times. He is sympathetic the entire time, and whenever he crosses paths with Marketa Irglova on screen the way his eyes light up is truly a sign of passion. Of course, it is his musical talents which really sell his effort in Once because his talents with a guitar are second only to his remarkable skills at voice articulation. When he puts them together and plays the Academy Award winning \"Falling Slowly\", the hypnotism of the music's beauty is so rich that it almost left me in tears. Glen Hansard has the power to make viewers truly feel all kinds of things with his music skills in Once, and he leads the film remarkably by making his talents of all kinds seem so organic in execution.\nMarketa Irglova is also a marvellous presence. Capturing a similar spirit as Glen Hansard, Marketa Irglova conveys a true feeling of vulnerability in her effort, seeming like a lost foreigner in an English-speaking land. This means that she has the sympathy of viewers from the get-go, and as she spends more time developing chemistry with Glen Hansard we gain a greater understanding of not just her character's weaknesses but her strengths as well. She captures the audiences the same way she captures the other characters, and her natural persona is such a beautiful asset to Once. And of course, her singing talents are remarkable. Though English is not her first language, Marketa Irglova sings with fluent grace in her words and the times that her accent leaks over into her singing actually puts a twist on her words and serves to add a mysterious allure to them. She really has a remarkable way of articulating different tones of voice and emotions into what she is saying or singing, and it is clearly because she really believes in the words that flow out of her. Marketa Irglova's performance is a product of subtle brilliance in acting and captivating spirit in singing.\n\nSo Once may have a simple narrative and a slow pace, but the beauty for the film lies in its realism, its magnificent soundtrack and the extremely talented leads.",

            "content": "\"What's the Czech for \"Do you love him\"?\"\n\nIt's going to be very difficult to find another romantic musical feel as natural as John Carney's Once. In most musicals when you hear the characters singing out their lines there is something that doesn't feel authentic about it and you're reminded that it's just a movie, but in Once every moment unfolds in such a natural way that at times it feels as if you're watching an intimate documentary of two passionate musicians. The relationship between the two leads also develops in a rather refreshingly authentic way and the story avoids all the worn out cliches found in most romantic films. The dialogue, the song writing, the performances, and the chemistry between the two leads makes Once a beautiful love letter for aspiring musicians everywhere. Made with an extremely low budget and interpreted by two non-professional actors (Glen Hansard is actually the band leader of The Frames in which Carney was once a member of), it still manages to be emotionally engaging. The performances are incredibly natural and intimate, but the cinematography does suffer a bit from the low budget because the camera work is pretty amateurish. The scenes that take place at night and the lightning aren't that great, but the story more than makes up for it. I'd say that it even helps make the experience all that more natural. There are even several spontaneous moments in the film that work to its advantage, such as the unscripted scene in which Hansard's character sings a song in the bus about how his heart was broken. It's a small film, but it hit all the right emotional chords in such a powerful way. \n\nThe film begins in a rather funny note as the unnamed main character (Glen Hansard) is playing his guitar and singing for money in the streets of Dublin when all of a sudden a junkie takes his money and he chases him down through a couple of stores. One night as he is playing, an immigrant girl (Marketa Irglova) congratulates him for his music. The two begin talking about music and pretty soon they establish a nice friendship. He is living with his widowed dad (Bill Hodnett) and helps him fixing vacuum cleaners in his repair shop, and she sells flowers in the streets while trying to care for her mother (Danuse Ktrestova) and young daughter. He goes on to explain that his ex-girlfriend cheated on him and she's living in London now. The unnamed girl also tells him her story and explains that she is married but that her husband is living in the Czech Republic. The two married when she got pregnant but he had to return home. Despite being very fond of each other the two decide to remain friends. They collaborate together to make a music demo so that he can take with him to London to see if he can sign a music contract, and the film focuses on their time together during these days as they each share their stories and sing revealing songs to each other.\n\nIt's refreshing to see a romantic film like this that feels so authentic and natural. It is more about two people who are very fond of each other and develop feelings for one another in a very honest way. Similar in style to Carney's Begin Again, the film focuses on a different kind of love and we see it in an early scene where the guy asks the girl to spend the night at his place and she immediately is offended and leaves. It's a simple story, but it tells it in a heartfelt way that is hard to ignore. At the same time the music also becomes part of the story and it builds it even more. Irglova and Hansard are delightful together and you really believe what they are feeling through their songs. They carry this lovely film in such a way that it makes most other romantic films seem completely fake. Add Once to the list of must see films for music aficionados because it is truly a wonderful experience and a well written love letter from Carney. \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "It's already just a little short compared to many other films, which is not surprising considering its budget, but considering how uneventful it was, it should have been much shorter. And while I like the idea of a relationship between a male and female where they don't just magically fall in love, it was not enough to make this a good film. The music is good, but it's overshadowed by the monotony of the story itself. It's incredibly predictable, so watching it becomes boring after 15 minutes or so. I'm amazed at how many people liked the film and I have a feeling it's simply because it was a low-budget indie film. But I can't criticize a person for liking something, I guess.\nI'd say the best thing about the film is how they approach the musical aspect of it. It's mixed into the story rather than forced into the story like many classic musicals.\nAnd I just can't help but point out that it took about 30 minutes for me to really know what the characters look like. There's a serious lack of close-ups that led to me hardly caring about the story. This is a fundamental error that is overlooked for reasons I cannot understand.\nI'm utterly amazed that this film is as favored among critics as \"The Dark Knight\" and other fantastic films. It does not seem nearly as well thought-out  as \"The Dark Knight,\" so it's either an accidental masterpiece (that doesn't even have close-ups), or it's extremely overrated.",

            "content": "Once is a film that stands out more than most films in the music genre and there's good reason. There isn't really many other movies that can capture the beauty of creating music and friendship. This movie follows the career of a man who writes his own songs and plays them in the streets of Dublin for money. One day, he meets a woman that takes liking to his tunes and they soon play music together after realizing their special connection. The relationship between the two leads played by famed songwriter Glen Hansard and MarkÃ (C)ta IrglovÃ¡ really shows a sweet connection and makes this a really sweet film. The music they create together not only shows the power of their connection, but also shows the beauty that they can create together. The songs written were absolutely beautiful. The most important part of a musical is its music of course and the music was mindblowingly great. The characters that were in smaller roles were also well acted. The band overtime becomes really good friends and share a sweet bond together that shows the perks to friendship and that's what this movie perfectly exemplifies. The two leads also had amazing chemistry and an inspiring story of love even though love wasn't physically said. I rooted for them to last as a couple but this story was more reality than expectation and I loved that. Not everything has to be scripted and appeal to a certain audience that expects a they came together through fate story. A film can be what it wants to be and if it's not what you wanted or thought it would be, sometimes that's what makes a movie like Once special. This film also manages to be informative in more than one way. Through the recording scenes, we get to see what a recording process looks like and all the effort that is put into making such music. It glorifies that making an album is not an easy process, that it takes hours on end to create what the band themselves think sounds appealing. This movie, for someone learning how to write lyrics and make beats, can really comfort them by showing that these things take time and effort and not a ton of people understand this concept by doubting themselves. The end of this movie is the ultimate lesson that doesn't beat you on the head but cuts deep. Showing that sometimes you need to move on and accept that you need to do what's right. The guy accepts that the girl is taken and respects that throughout the film and they still manage to create a really special relationship. He thinks that it's right to seek the woman he truly believes is his and rightfully live that way. Once portrays great lessons of love, how to deal with heartache, how to be patient with your music, and shows how beautiful friendships are and how important they are to influence your decisions. If not for the girl, the guy would not have gone to London and started his dream to create a record. It's the friendships like the two leads have that only seems to come around once. A",

The lead performers are real-life musicians who had never acted before and their chemistry together is undeniable when it culminates in the writing of their oscar-winning song, \"Falling Slowly\". The film is shot documentary style which works great for the authenticity of the story and you feel connected to these two artists. The film has a very unconventional ending that I loved, but there is a hidden element to an interaction between the co-stars that is spoken in Czech and not subtitled, which upon reflection adds more to the characters' motivations. I think John Carney's later effort Begin Again is more accessible due to the thick Irish accents in Once and unconventional love story, but if you want to see where it all started and hear the fantastic music Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova crafted, I'd recommend it ten-fold!",

They both have some bad pasts with love and each expresses it through the music they make. Featuring the Oscar winning song, \"Falling Slowly,\" this one is a really special one. It was shot for about $150,000 and made over $20 million in the box office. Both leads are non actors and at times it shows.

The two main characters are an Irish street musician and a girl, an immigrant from Czech who plays piano. They met on a street, then gradually get closer through making music together. A point worthy of note is that a boy, acted by Glen Hansard, a member of the Irish rock band, The Frames, and a girl's singing scenes. I felt this film is done like a documentary because angles and cuts are not so perfect, but these camera work would make us feel as if we are watching the scenes beside them. Also the actors and actresses seem really natural. However, after seeing this, some people may feel something is missing, or be dissatisfied with the ending of the story. I think it is because this movie, Once, is a love story though, the boy and girl are not together in the end. We can find something special in ordinary life, and it makes our hearts warm. This film has no big mood swings, but attracts me in many ways. If you like music and romance drama, I'm sure it will be one of your favourites.",

The story couldn't be simpler, but I don't remember the last time I saw a romance that was this genuine and heartfelt. \n\nGlen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are natural actors, maybe because they're not actors at all, and they are completely at ease on camera and utterly enchanting when they're on screen together. Their chemistry is unmistakable, and the music they make together is simply magical. Not only is this one of the best romantic movies I've seen, it's also a musical to be cherished for generations.\n\nThe song \"Falling Slowly\" is achingly beautiful, and the melody, much like the movie itself, will stick with you long after the film is over. The film has a healthy respect for the power of music, as in a key scene where Irglova breaks down during a song she's written for her estranged husband. That scene is also a favorite of mine for another reason: it shows the two character's sudden but tenacious bond without the use of a single line of dialogue. It's a moving moment in a film full of moving moments.\n\nIt's about as far from a Hollywood production as you can get, and director John Carney keeps things understated and muted, relying on the star's considerable charm to pull you into the story. It works like nothing a major studio has ever released, right up to the heartbreaking end that remains true to the film, these characters and perhaps most importantly, the audience. \"Once\" is a film to fall in love with, for the first time or the tenth.

How else do you frame a street busker's journey from the dusty, tourist-filled curbs of Dublin to...well, a fulfilling passion? Notice the word choice. Once's modern romance often flirts with heartbreak but the do-or-die vigor carries quite a tune. And thankfully, the tunes comprise one of the loveliest soundtracks ever.\n\nWriter/director John Carney presents this R-rated musical about a busker (Glen Hansard) and an immigrant (Marketa Irglova), who spend a fateful week collaborating on an album that tells their love story.\n\nBefore filming ever began, actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova were already romantic collaborators. This makes sense given the palpable affection that they give off in each scene. Their heartfelt songbook echoes this sentiment tenfold. \"Falling Slowly\" deserved its Oscar win for Best Song. Likewise, \"If You Want Me,\" \"When Your Mind's Made Up,\" \"Lies,\" \"Leave,\" and \"Fallen from the Sky\" also deserve such a prize which is why this rightly lauded flick got adapted into a Broadway musical. On screens big and small, however, the material and music  pulses with naturalism thanks to writer/director John Carney's vision and obvious love for perfect chords.\n\nBottom line: All the Right Notes",

It stars Glen Hansard  as a street musician in Dublin who also works in his father's vacuum repair shop who meets a Czech immigrant played by Marketa Irglova and these two are attracted to each other but decide to stay friends. Then the street musician wants to get enough money to go to London to track down his ex girlfriend and possibly win her back so these two people start writing up songs and then they plan to get into a recording studio and lay down some tracks and when they do start laying down some tracks it is awesome. This is such a great movie the performances are wonderful the musical scenes are done so well and the ending of this movie is really kind of special. This is a very special movie that nobody has been able to do since and probably never will. This is a must see movie",

It is a lovely musical that simply cannot be missed at all. Even if you don't exactly like the musical genre, you've got to give \"Once\" a chance, since it is truly just such a wonderful film of its own kind and would easily rank as one of the best musicals in this generation. A film like this one cannot at all be only seen, but it must be witnessed and felt in order to truly be enjoyed.\n\nFull review at filmbroadcaster.weebly.com",

It is a different kind of love story, and thats why I liked it. The music is great, and the direction is quite good despite the obviously low budget. It was clearly shot on video but overcomes that low-definition look with it's characters and story...and the look becomes part of the charm. I definitely enjoyed this one.",

            "content": "This Irish drama about musicians written and directed by John Carney was a pleasant viewing and listening. This naturalistic movie, set in Dublin, Ireland, stars musicians Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová. What a treat! Collaborators prior to making the film performing under the stage moniker The Swell Season, Hansard and Irglová composed and performed all of the original songs in the film! Amazingly different, this film will show love scenes with no sex, song lyrics instead of a narration,  musicians with everyday problems and families, not drug abusers without morals... or chasers of fame and fortune. \r\n\r\nShot for only 130,000 (US$160,000), the film was delightful to watch, and it received enthusiastic awards such as the 2007 Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film. Hansard and Irglová's song \"Falling Slowly\" won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Original Song and the soundtrack as a whole also received a Grammy Award nomination.\r\n\r\nOnce spent years in development with the Irish Film Board. It was during a period where the film board had no chief executive (for about 6 months) that the film was given the go-ahead by a lower level executive on the proviso that the producers could make it on a budget of approximately 150,000 and not the initial higher budget. They made it and I am glad they did... because I enjoyed it. Every bit of the story about Guy (Glen Hansard) and Girl (Markéta Irglová) was so realistic that I almost thought that I am watching some reality show about two musicians, but at the same time I could feel close to them, thanks to the wonderfully developed screenplay. My surprise was that neither of the two leads is a trained or experienced actor - Hansard and Irglová are both professional musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead to be played by actor Cillian Murphy. He was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy thought that he was too good in acting and declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old)  but felt that he is not as good in singing to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, was the next choice. He was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed. That's how we got an intimate, family movie with love and wonderful songs...",

            "content": "\"Once, only once here to be done to as we do with only one chance, here for the wonder of under the stars for the one and only once!\" Man, that's a weird song, and I can't really say that I'm crazy about it, but, 1990s song or not, I still feel that it fits, because Roy Harper, like this musical, is folk rocky, and plus, no one remembers the Roy Harper song \"Once\", either. Well, I guess this film has seen a fair deal of success, but a lot of that success is based on the fact that it got made into a stage musical which hit the Broadway in 2012 and took home some Tony Awards. Man, I've been joking about how the theatre industry has gotten so lazy that some of their better productions are musical adaptations of films, but I just figured that the stage musicals were more inspired than I feared, seeing as how I don't visit the theatre as often as I would like to, and then I saw this film and realized that the apparent best musical between late 2011 and early 2012 was a musical adaptation of a musical. Either that's phenomenally lazy or, as irony would have it, an audaciously unique twist on a revival of a musical, but either way, the point is that this film's story has hardly been told only \"once\". There's an opportunity to reference \"Three Times a Lady\" somewhere here, but I'm not even going to try and go there, partially because I'm kind of spent on love songs after this film. Oh well, this is still a pretty enjoyable musical, at least in its film form, though, I must admit, it hits missteps more than just \"once\".\r\n\r\nA minimalist indie rom-com-dram, this film was bound to get a little bit slow, and just as I predicted, even with the absence of dull spells, as well as the presence of more than a few relatively fun moments, when the film slows down, - as it often does - blandness starts to kick up, resulting in something of a limp pacing which reflects dragging. Considering the length of the film, you would figure that this film's narrative is pretty tight, and sure, much of the storytelling gets the job done in a neat and swift fashion, but in plenty of places, anything from aimless filler to overlong musical numbers bloat the structure of this film, which, of course, has little time to kill. At under an hour-and-a-half, this is one brief film, and that's fine and all, considering that, like I said, there are plenty of tight areas in storytelling, but on the whole, the considerable shortness of the film's length is a bit questionable, particularly when it comes to exposition, because as fleshed out as this character study is in plenty of areas, much engagement value within the leads feels rather undercooked. Moments of hurrying dilute the full weight of this somewhat thin character study, and such dilution in engagement value is in no way challenged by this film's level of originality, which is reasonably fair, but not consistently, as this film has its fair share of moments in which it hits tropes, and pretty hard. Needless to say, this would be easier to forgive if it wasn't for this formulaic structure's having a tendency to slip into tropes which are tainted enough by thinness, because no matter how charming this story may be, there's just not a whole lot to it, turning in characters and conflicts which are too down-to-earth to be all that terribly intriguing. Sure, the film does a pretty decent job when it comes to handling its improvably drawn substance, but it can only do so much, and its efforts are often betrayed by shortcomings that extend beyond a natural persuasion and retard momentum until the final product finally collapses into underwhelmingness, something that it hardly stood a chance of completely evading. Still, in spite of its shortcomings, the film endears, delivering on anything from plenty of charm to, yes, even pretty decent tunes.\r\n\r\nAs a pretty independent musical, this film's soundtrack could have collapsed into considerable indie underwhelmingness under the weight of questionable contemporaneous musical sensibilities, and sure, as surely as plenty of them run together, plenty of the numbers hit bland spells which are pretty common within today's indie folk industry, but on the whole, I was pleasantly surprised by this film's soundtrack, which offers plenty of folksy heart and lyrical genuineness, anchored by catchy melodies and imperfect, but soulful vocals from leads Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová. Not simply entertaining more often than not, this film's soundtrack boasts a very heartfelt soul that is still alive and well within plenty of modern folk tunes of the nature of this film's musical numbers, rewarding and underwhelming, and breathes much life, not just into the enjoyment of the film's musical value, but into the effectiveness of the film's story, which deserves to be flavored up in its interpretation. Again, this film's story concept is not only formulaic, but pretty thin in weight, offering only so much in the way of intrigue to its characters and conflicts, but not so little that a fair deal of endearing color is absent, for there is a certain potential to this naturally limited romantic opus, and it is often done an adequate degree of justice by a script, courtesy of John Carney, which is flawed, to be be sure, but with a certain wit, as well as a fair deal of genuineness to what characterization there is. Carney's efforts as writer prove to be endearing, though arguably not as endearing as his efforts as director, because even though the steadiness of Carney's storytelling often gets to be too steady for its own good, its tenderness carries a warmth that makes the meditations upon the depths of substance fairly effective, particularly when joined by colorful musical compliments. When the film hits, it's reasonably resonant, but if Carney's directorial atmosphere has nothing else going for it, it's an abundance of charm, and that's enough to back entertainment value with a reasonable degree of kick and color, further flavored up by charming onscreen performances. Due to there being very little in the way of weight to this film, leads Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová have nearly nothing to work with, but they engage about as much as they can with character so undercooked, embodying their roles' heart enough to deliver on much charisma, flavored up by very convincing chemistry which sells the relationship upon which this romantic opus is built. The performers carry the film I reckon, because even though there's only so much of this film to carry, the heart within Hansard's and Irglová's performances is every bit as difficult to deny as the heart within the colorful soundtrack, and Carney's performances as writer and director, and while that's not enough to carry the film too far, the final product charms time and again as a colorful, if improvable flick.\r\n\r\n\"Once\" it's done (Get it?), slow spells in atmospheric and structural pacing, scarce expository depth, conventionalism and a natural story concept thinness drive the final product into underwhelmingness, but through a decently heartfelt soundtrack, clever script, endearing and sometimes effectively resonant directorial atmosphere, and charming performances and chemistry between leads Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová, John Carney's \"Once\" stands as a generally entertaining and thoroughly charming portrait of love and music, flawed though it may be.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

I also loved the sly and unexpected humour I found in this film. Wonderful, natural and realistic  performances from Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard and overall a thoroughly original, refreshing, enjoyable and wonderful film.",

Some scenes really look like parts from some hidden cam TV show. Obviously, John Carney didn't use any extras and filmed just spontaneously in the streets of Dublin.\n\nIt doesn't hurt either that it has the best original pop soundtrack I can remember, you may even call it a musical. But not one of those were random people just start singing and dancing for no apparent reason other than ruin the realms of cinematic realism but because they sing together or busk on the street or just record a demo tape. If all musicals would be like that, I wouldn't despise the genre that much.\n\nBut not only the musical parts work well. There's deft drama and a bittersweet if not heart-breaking ending to it. A bittersweet ending as I like it.\n\nFinally, some words about the leads. Glen Hansard has not only of the best-looking red beards of all time, but also an amazing singing voice and some talent as an actor. Marketa Irglova, looks a loooot older than her eighteen years, is also a talented musician and a capable actress. They have just enough chemistry together to make the film work, but not as much as Hollywood perfectness demands.",
