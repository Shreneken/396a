    "summary": "Based on Satrapi's graphic novel about her life in pre and post-revolutionary Iran and then in Europe. The film traces Satrapi's growth from child to rebellious, punk-loving teenager in Iran. In the background are the growing tensions of the political climate in Iran in the 70s and 80s, with members of her liberal-leaning family detained and then executed, and the background of the disastrous Iran/Iraq war.",

            "content": "\"Persepolis\" is an autographic story told of a girl named Marjane Satrapi. Marjane Satrapi's novel is about her upbringing in Iran, living through the revolution, leaving for Vienna, and her hardships. The film is in a comic-drawn style. The story follows her as she grows up, sharing her personal experiences from the war. The movie also shows how her hobbies and interests are looked down upon and being hounded to look modest.   \n\n\tThe style of animation adds to the way the story is told. This comic-style movie is primarily shown in black and white, with only small parts in color. It is different from the more common style, which is shown as more color added when the character is happy or as the story progresses. Instead, Marjane's story only shows color during some turning points in her life.   \n\n\tThis story is told in time and jumps through Marjane's life. Marjane's story begins as a little girl at the start of the revolution. It shows the reality that even as a small child Marjane is exposed to losing family members or seeing death in her country. The movie jumps to her teenage years in Vienna as Marjane tries to live a life trying to assimilate and feeling guilty or ashamed of where she is fromâ€”later coming home to a war-free country that changes to being morally strict.   \n\n\tThe style of the cartoon is simple and clean; I believe this is to get the message of how Marjane's life was across to the viewers. The characters and background are simple drawings, and the art style of the characters' emotions is very straightforward, with smiles or frowns with no shadows. The viewer is focused on the story being told instead of watching everything going on in the background.  \n\n\tThe film did an excellent job of showing how Marjane kept her rebellious side to her in the political climate in Iran. It's an eye-opener for people to relate their lives. Watching this movie makes me question what if I had grown up with the strict rules women had in Iran. Would I rebel or follow the rules and live unhappy, unable to express myself?",

It's also insightful and I liked the characterisation. I felt the main character, Marjane, reminded me a little bit of the MTV comic book character Daria, who had her own show. It understandably has quite a dystopian feel to it at times, once the plot starts to build. One of the voices I found a bit grating. It's certainly a quirky and indirectly somewhat thoughtful/insightful watch I suppose. Yes, I'd recommend this film as something a little different. Also, I should perhaps point out that the film is originally in French, although I saw it with the English dub. The special features on the Blu Ray disk contain English subtitles.",

            "content": "About three weeks prior to working on this film review assignment for my Comic/Graphic Novels class, I completed a Collaborative Informative Research Assignment on the life and career of Marjane Satrapi. I became very intrigued by her story and her publication of the book Persepolis, which led me choosing to do my Online Public Film Review (for the same class) on the Persepolis film. Now, I understand that watching a movie because of a fascination with the book can be dangerous, as sometimes filmmakers tend to twist certain details to fit their own depiction of the story. However, I felt that this production would be different, given the genuine feel of Satrapi's story. Persepolis details the life Satrapi lived as a nine year old girl in Iran. The story depicts Marjane Satrapi's life, and how that coincides during the same time of the Iranian Revolution. Throughout my watching of the film, I was able to key on a specific theme used during the production of the film, which is the use of flashbacks during the story.\nThroughout Persepolis, there is an extensive use of flashbacks, which can be described as Marjane reflecting on the experiences she had gone through in the past during the current moment. The goal of the flashback is to separate the past and the present. Also, I believe that the flashbacks cause Satrapi to reflect negatively on the past to an extent. It almost feels like the past is trying to haunt her, and creeps into her memory when she least expects it. I would assume that the experience of living in that kind of environment can be mentally draining on a young nine year old girl, so I'm not surprise these flashbacks are causing negative reflections. Satrapi's Persepolis make use of flashbacks to detail the past and present of her life, as well as bring about negativity within Satrapi's character.\nIn the film, Persepolis, a main theme of flashbacks are used. The flashbacks reveal the past events and present events Satrapi has encountered during her time, and cause her character to reveal negative emotions due to the events of the past.",

Grounded entirely in reality, it follows our lead Marji, a very likeable and empathetic character, as she goes through adolescence and adulthood, all while contending with family issues, disillusionment, loneliness, depression and her inability to find a place in the world. She isn't just a grumpy, sullen, laconic bore that a lot of these stories are about, who simply skulks their way through life and we're supposed to find their behaviour moving and profound. She has interests, she has passions, she has conversations and arguments, and she deals with them in a realistic way. The black and white aesthetic is perfectly suited for both the highs and lows of Marji's life, and the comedy scattered throughout keeps things from becoming too depressing or monotonous. It likely passed under so many people's radars because it wasn't the kind of family-friendly CGI film that usually dominates the industry, but Persepolis is a wonderful little gem hidden amongst them.

            "content": "Persepolis has a strange stylized look. It is somewhat simplistic, and looks like a comic strip. I canâ€™t say I like the look of it that much, and the choice to do most of it in black-and-white didnâ€™t help because in the few scenes where they show color it looks so vibrant and beautiful. Iâ€™m sure it was a stylistic and thematic choice to limit color, but I donâ€™t think the overall product benefited from that choice. In fact Iâ€™m not even sure why they chose to make this movie animated since it is such a gritty adult story, and there wasnâ€™t anything that would have been difficult to capture in live action. That being said, the look of the film didnâ€™t hinder the story-telling in any significant way, I just question why they made these visual choices. The plot of Persepolis is one that centers on the life of a young Iranian girl who is struggling to find her identity and place in the world. This struggle appears significantly harder because she lived in such tumultuous times for her nation. It feels a lot like a history lesson of events that took place in Iran, as well as a cultural guide to living in that region, but all told through the life experiences of one woman. I did find it educational, and I liked seeing how their lives were both similar and entirely different from life in America. You could tell this must be grounded in a true story because it showed so much detail, and they fleshed out the family well without having to lay out a lot of exposition for world-building. I sympathized with Marjane as she struggled through life, and I wanted to see her succeed, but somehow I never got fully engrossed by this film. Perhaps I was having trouble drawing parallels in my own experience, perhaps it was just the artistic style that I wasnâ€™t connecting with, or perhaps Iâ€™m just a cold-hearted jerk. Itâ€™s not that the story in Persepolis was bad, or that I didnâ€™t care, I just lacked the proper emotional investment. That being said, it was still a solid film, and I could see where it would be a powerful experience for some viewers. At the very least, I was never bored by Persepolis, and I felt like I learned something new from people who lived through events I only saw on news reports in the past.",

            "content": "- Home, war and the Eye of the Tiger: Persepolis -\n\nPersepolis is the story of Marjane \"Marji\" Satrapi and her younger years during the Iranian revolution and some of the Iraq-Iran war. Nurtured by her modern, liberal family, feisty and idealistic Marji adores Bruce Lee and aspires to be a prophet. She witnesses the fall of the Shah and sees even more conservative Islamic fundamentalists fill the vacuum. Persepolis is a coming-of-age epic, and as a captivatingly animated story of an adventurous young woman, it could easily be the lovechild of Spirited away (Hayao Miyazaki) and the 90s cartoon version of Madeline.\n\nI love how Satrapi is represented as a young girl. She is passionate, outspoken, a bit goofy, and naive. It shouldn't feel \"fresh\" to see a dynamic woman main character in 2018, but it is. I enjoyed seeing a movie from a female gaze that's directed by a woman.\n\nRebellious teenage Marji - who wears forbidden Michael Jackson badges and barters for illicit heavy metal tapes - is sent to Vienna where she can be herself in safety. She lasts a few years, trying on ill-fitting identities (hardcore punk, nihilist hippy). But after suffering hapless romances, racist incidents, and cultural impasses, Satrapi returns back to Iran to be with her family - despite the oppression that she will endure.\n\nSatrapi has a fantastic grandmother, and their relationship is magic. I have never seen this often-special relationship represented so perfectly. Satrapi's grandmother has amazing life advice, such as \"The first marriage is a rehearsal for the second,\" and that to keep firm breasts, one must dunk them in iced water each morning. She guides Satrapi by encouraging her to stay true to herself and isn't afraid to give her a reality check when she needs it.\n\nThe animation is borderline-psychedelic. Persepolis is a rich world of patterns, textures and amazing noses of every vector. The weight of snow on tree branches, steam rising off food, curling iron banisters, bomb blasts, birds twisting around in the air, and single tears running down cheeks are all poetic, and they convey normally indescribable parts of memories, places and time periods.\n\nTo watch Persepolis is to step inside of Satrapi's mind's eye. The story is told as a flashback from her perspective. Spaces meld into one another, time blurs, scenes fade in and out. The movie ends with the audio of a memory in the past. The overall effect is so lush and sensory, and I thought the representation of mental space was a feat. The scenes that explain some of Iran's history look like shadow theatre, with shuffling waves and bouncing 2D planes. It made it easy to digest the historical information.\n\nThe movie is almost entirely black and white and is full of silhouettes and literal darkness. The outlines of the casualties of war and figures fleeing in the night - nuances of what it must be like to live through a war and then to live with the memories of it - are expressed with elegance.\n\nPersepolis has so much to give: visual delight, eye-opening history lessons, warm fuzzies about matriarchy, and a potent dose of girl power. I came away from this film with a new understanding of Iran's history and political situation. Persepolis humanizes what is to most of us a complicated, far away thing. Making a film that allows different people to empathize with each other is a wonderful gift for humanity. It's a film that left me feeling nourished, visually, but also personally; to me, Persepolis captures the life of a young woman in a way that rarely happens in film. I found Marjane's relationships with her mother and grandmother and her struggles with fitting in with groups (and the wider universe) relatable and validating.\n\nFor the love of brilliant, beautiful, autobiographical coming-of-age tales about war, devotion, and Iron Maiden, watch this movie!\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/persepolis, and was written by Madison Plummer.

Unlike the comic, color is used in the present while black & white is used when the story is told, to illustrate the past.  Also, the movie wisely uses movie's ability to use audio & music, such as some excellent musical montages, from \"Iron Maiden\" to \"Eye of the Tiger\", which is effective in condensing the story to movie length.  Plus, Sartrapi isn't afraid to attack to problems & inconsistencies of the Iranian Revolution, noting that the Shah was horrible ruler but what replaced him ended up being far worse (as she said to her school teacher as a child, they went from having 3,000 political prisoners to 300,000).  It is also nice to see Iran was a thoroughly modern nation that still tries to be one, despite the oppression.

I personally love the idea of not providing a solution or a justification for a solution as an ending of a movie, Persepolis showed the hope, sense of belonging and identity of the lead character without giving out a definite resolution. The choice of 2D black and white animation to narrate the story is very interesting and particularly effective. B&W still has, hidden in its monochromatic, high contrast backdrop, an extremely effective method of creating an engrossing, focused environment that resonates with the audience. The autobiographic movie with its Iranian revolution setting, and lead character's journey through her womanhood made an excellent use of the medium. The west often makes heroes and villains or rather celebrities, be it good or bad, out of people just because it is good business, I don't think Persepolis belongs to that category of capitalism. A fresh and welcome change from western ideological sell-outs which tells a captivating story and gets out the way of our thinking, and in the process makes you reflect more rather than when you're given set pieces. Kudos to the director and her team for coming up with such an enthralling depiction.",

Everywhere one looks, there is a sense of fear and terror throughout, making it impossible to stay or even live. So getting a documented look at the place is tricky. Luckily, we have the 2007 animated feature \"Persepolis\" to show how life in the Middle East is uncomfortable. Based on the graphic novel of the same name by Marjane Satrapi, who also co-directs the movie, this breathtaking film showcases how strong animation can be for adults, and make something brilliant in return. \"Persepolis\" is a gritty look at how one woman saw through her eyes the radical changes of her country.\n\nThe story is told as an autobiographical tale of Marjane and her life growing up in Iran as a girl, and eventually as a woman in Europe. Unfortunately, Marjane sees many terrible things happen along the way. Things like the Islamic Revolution, the war between Iran and Iraq, being a foreigner in a new place, and many more. So, Marjane must adapt to the changes of society as she grows up into a woman trying to find her identity in this crazy world.\n\n\"Persepolis\" is a fantastic film worthy of watching multiple times. As stated before, the story is an autobiographical piece of work, with a few fictional elements thrown in. As an American watching this movie, I can say that it is interesting to see a new perspective of a culture that's rarely shows its true nature. Despite the fact that the setting is in the Middle East, the whole film is spoken in French, which is a nice contrast to both language barriers of French and Arabic. Speaking of the language, the cast does a good job in the French version, portraying each character perfectly. The music sets the tone of the movie perfectly as the entire production is very dramatic. But what really sells the film is the animation. The majority of the film is done in black and white, with a few spots in color, making the movie very close to its graphic novel roots. It's mesmerizing, breathtaking, and beautiful to look at. Everything is well-designed and just gorgeous to look at.\n\nOne final note is that while the film is animated, this movie is definitely not for children. The subject matter of surviving through terrible times is very mature, as well as the themes present. In fact, there are a lot of thematic elements present, including strong language, violent and sexual situations, all of which are for the adult mind. This movie shows that there is a market for adult animated films to be made, this is a perfect example of it.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Persepolis\" is a fantastic film for adults, showing how the events at home can truly change a person.",

            "content": "While animation is an art form primarily associated with children's entertainment, there are more than a few animated films which deal with more mature themes and are geared towards an older audience. PERSEPOLIS is one such film. Co-directed by Marjane Satrapi, who based this on her experiences as a young girl growing up in Iran, it tells a story about the struggle to find one's identity in a rapidly changing world. In Marjane's case, her formative years took place amid the chaotic years of the Islamic Revolution when the US-backed Shah was overthrown by populist revolt and an Islamic Republic established in its place. Even though communist revolutionaries, such as her uncle, were imprisoned under the Shah's rules, the Islamic Republic that replaced it was in some ways even more repressive. As a way of escaping this, Marjane is sent off to a French school in Vienna but she eventually comes back to her family after bad experiences leave her alone and almost destitute. Yet, the Iran she returns to is even more different than the one she grew up in and left before. Ultimately, this is a simultaneously complex and simple look at Iranian life through the eyes of a young woman. It's complex in the sense that Marjane has conflicted feelings about the country of her ancestors, yet simple because it is presented through the eyes of someone who has yet to find themselves. This film is based on a graphic novel, and the mostly black-and-white animation style reproduces this look faithfully while also adding a sense of childlike wonder. It was a simple, yet beautiful, way to tell an important story. I hesitate to say that Marjane's story is representative of all Iranians' experience, yet it is valuable precisely because it is a personal experience. The story of her life growing up is tragic and hopeful, sad and yet still not without humor. This rollercoaster of emotions and unique look at an oft misunderstood culture are the film's strongest selling points, aside from the top-notch animation and score. For viewers looking to expand their horizons a bit, PERSEPOLIS has everything you could possibly want from a great film: action, romance, tragedy, humor, etc. It has it all, and most importantly it provides unique cultural insight. Highly recommended.",

And because of that it grapples with issues surprisingly personal and complex, though no less rare in the movies, mainly the various pubescent stages of its female protagonist beginning from childhood as she struggles with the highs and lows of romances, onset depression and the particular doom and gloom of her family's revolutionary past. The animation style is beautiful, smoky and haunting -- think a black-and-white \"The Simpsons\" with a more picturesque depth of feel -- and further goes to accentuate \"Persepolis's\" central focus on the eternal reflection of a political war waged in shadows.",

As beautiful as 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' may be, they do not teach us about the world things we haven't known before. 'Persepolis' gives us a tangible example of the diversity of cultures, ways of thinking and acting and how someone may be found to be living in the wrong place.\n\nI do not believe that this is an anti-Iranian film, after all, one of the \"takeaway points\" of the film is to be proud of who you are - which the director/author clearly is, and she makes it a point of pride. However, politics in Iran are definitely under attack here - but why not? Just because it is an animated film does not mean it cannot contain messages. Clearly, what was happening in Iran at the time of the Islamic Revolution was not right, irrelevant of whether one believes it is 'anti-Iranian' to think that way or not. And, I think, most importantly, it shows to world-audiences (and especially US audiences) that Iran has also people who are like themselves, just that one cannot express it openly, and that Iran used to be quite a \"normal\" place before the revolution - not unlike Europe or anywhere else in the 'developed' world.\n\nDefinitely, it is a highly recommendable film for its artistry and its heart-wrenching story.",

I understand how popular was the book in France, following the story a young girl as she comes of age against the backdrop of the Iranian Revolution. France had its share of involvement during the Iranian revolutionary times, and somehow the audience was very sympathetic to the film which ends with Marjane as a 24-year-old expatriate in Paris. \r\n\r\nThe film was co-winner of the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. In her acceptance speech, Satrapi said \"Although this film is universal, I wish to dedicate the prize to all Iranians.\" The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Ratatouille. \r\n\r\nCinematography presented in the black-and-white style of the original graphic novels was explained by  Marjane so the place and the characters wouldn't look like foreigners in a foreign country but simply people in a country to show how easily a country can become like Iran. The present-day scenes are shown in colour, while sections of the historic narrative resemble a shadow theatre show. The Iranian government-connected organisation Iran Farabi Foundation sent a letter to the French embassy in Tehran stating, \"This year the Cannes Film Festival, in an unconventional and unsuitable act, has chosen a movie about Iran that has presented an unrealistic face of the achievements and results of the glorious Islamic Revolution in some of its parts\" but despite all of the objections, the Iranian cultural authorities allowed limited screenings of the film in Tehran, albeit with six scenes censored due to sexual content.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that this critically acclaimed animated autobiography missed to involve me into the events which were told in a storytelling style which was nothing out of average. I will still give it a positive score... for the effort!",

            "content": "Persepolis- 4/5\n\nCo-Director's Marjene Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud's Persepolis was my first experience of a foreign language animated film, and I must reveal how amazed  I felt after watching Persepolis which is  a dark portrayal of how a rebellious and outspoken girl deals with the continuous problems with her narrow-minded society and all the components of the story are really wonderfully presented by the Director's. Dark, Beautiful and filled with examples of the distraught state of Iran in the period shown( especially dealing with Women), Persepolis is a really subtle and beautiful portrayal of how a rebellious and outspoken Iranian Girl deals with the continuous  social and personal problems faced by herself, it has superbly shown the Post-War Iran and the limitations and humiliation that Women have to face there  and in Persepolis Co-Director's Marjene Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud have made a really beautiful yet Dark Animated movie which is filled with funny and sad elements and with some really brilliant visuals, some great voice-acting and a harsh but  realistic story, Persepolis has to be one of the most unique Animated Feature Films ever made which will keep you devoted to the film from the beginning to the end.\n\nThe Story of the Movie is based on the comic written by Marjene Satrapi and it revolves around the world of Marjene Satrapi(Chiara Mastroianni)  growing in Iran, and the story starts when Iran is at war with Iraq. This results in changes in the life of Satrapi and her family, where she meets her Uncle Anouche(Francis  Jerosme) who is a huge inspiration for her, she realizes how women are oppressed  in her city, and after the war ends she is sent to Vienna due to the distraught state of Iran. She lands at Vienna as a child and grows up there developing  an outspoken attitude and  learning about the disadvantages and humiliation of being an Iranian and she meets some friends, and after she reaches the age of 18, some personal adultery problems such as drugs and smoking causes a real problem for her and she decides to return to her family at Iran, only to see that the state of Iran is worse than what she had experienced leaving some years and her rebellious and outspoken attitude leads to some problems and finally she realizes that whatever she may do, women like her will always stay in an oppressed state.\n\nPersopolis contains some really dazzling visual effects and some brilliant animation. The Animation may not be as realisitic and wow-like as nowadays but as it is it's quite brilliant and the black and white animation maintained throughout the flashback parts of the movie are really well detailed and some of the shape shifting and reactions of the character's are really well shown in the movie and the animation team really deserves a lot of credit for such brilliant spectacles. The Voice-acting in the movie is quite spot on as well, as the whole cast has portrayed and voiced there respective characters convincingly. Chiara Mastroianni has done a splendid job in voicing and narrating the story of our Protagonist Marjene Satrapi and her distressed voice in presenting the grown up Marjene was quite brilliant, also she did a splendid job in voicing the Teenager Marjene. \n\nCo-Directors Marjene Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud took a bold decision in making an animation film with a controversial and harsh script such as this, but they made the film in such a beautiful way that even though it focuses the oppression of women in Iran and how they're underlooked outside Iran. Even though it deals with some harshly realistic social problems, the moments of comedy and fun along with the brash moments of the Outspoken and rebellious Marjene give the public a piece are so wonderfully presented that it prevents this movie to become a distressing drama which would've been horrible for an animated film. They picked a brilliant crew and some really good actor's for voicing the character's and they picked a super visual effects and animation team which ensured that this movie will not fail on the visual parts. All In All in Persopolis they've made a unique animated film which in a beautiful way presents the social problems faced by the narrator during her life at Iran and also outside it.\n\nOne can only assume that the comic written by Marjene Satrapi is on her own life and growing up at Iran, so it is quite bold to make such a comic on such a controversial topic  so all credits to her for creating a comic which was brilliantly adapted into a script by co-director Vincent Paronnaud in a way which will keep the audience interested and with moments of sarcastic comedy and fun moments, he makes sure to keep the magic of an animated feature ticking in the film. He created a really good script with suitable dialogues which all we're delivered superbly by the actor's and all credit goes to both Satrapi and Paronnaud to create such a script of Persopolis.\n\nBackground music is quite vital for any animated feature film in my opinion, and the music in Persepolis is quite superb throughout the course of the movie. The Variations of music used in this movie is quite marvelous, many type's of different music are presented in Persepolis and the variations of the music on the different sequences are quite outstanding. Be it a comedy scene, a depressing one of a scene shown the outspoken attitude of the protagonist, the music throughout the movie is quite superb and really helps the audience and the movie both alike. Olivier Bernet deserves a lot of praise for delivering such beautiful music in this film. The editing of the film was quite well done as the movie was quite perfect for an animated movie and the editor also StÃ©phane Roche  deserves praise for her contribution to this film.\n\nPersepolis is a different kind of an animated film which might not be liked by everyone and its quite a unique animated film, with a story explaining the difficulties faced by the narrator during the course of her teenage and adult life, and although moments of fun and comedy do make the movie entertaining and fun, the point which Co Directors have wanted to show are shown quite superbly and there hard work in making a beautiful yet dark movie as Persepolis results it in becoming one of the most unique and best animated film I've ever seen and a really good start to foreign language animated films.",

            "content": "What I got from this animated feature (based on a series of graphic novels) is that revolutionary Iran was and is a paranoid, dangerous, soul-destroying place to live. Which is why the parents of heroine Marjane send her away to Austria. The headstrong young girl who loves heavy metal and punk rock is simply unwilling to conform to the dictates of the Islamic Republic. But in Austria, she is an exile, outcast. Her hipster school friends find it fascinating that she has seen revolution and war (with Iraq) and death, but fail to grasp the true horror of it. Frustrated and alone, she returns to Iran after several years away to find that life there as a young adult is even worse than it was as a child.\n\nPresented through black and white drawings that are at once flat and surreal, the visual style of Persepolis reminded me somewhat of the Madeline books by Ludwig Bemelmans. This film is originally in French, but my DVD also had an English soundtrack. I began in French and switched to English because I found the dialogue so fast and the images so full of detail that I was missing things by reading the subtitles (my French is also good enough to tell that much was being left out of the subtitles, which was an additional distraction). Yet the English didn't quite fit. The voice acting is excellent, but the tone and rhythm do not fit English; it looks better in French, if that makes any sense.\n\nBeing, presumably, semi-autobiographical (the director/author has the same name as the heroine), the film lacks a certain narrative direction. It is a series of incidents that show the brutality of the Iranian regime and the loneliness of the exile trying to function in an alien culture. Technically excellent, the movie is disturbing and depressing. It is a heartfelt personal story, but I'm not sure what it adds to the larger  discussion about modern Iran.",

And the jokes are somewhat unfunny for me, 'cause I already knew it from the novel.  If there's something I really like from this movie, it's perhaps the score.  It's quite engaging.",

Undoubtedly this is a story that needs to be told, and co-director Marjane Satrapi first told it in her graphic novels - so as such this feels a little selective, perhaps missing the greater depths the novels could achieve.  This is not to dismiss the film - it is a fine piece of work - but it always feels like there is more that could be said.\n\nThere are two versions available, the French language original, and a dubbed version.  The dub version - with guest voice artists Sean Penn and Iggy Pop and Gena Rowlands - is very well done, though I'd recommend sticking with the French original.",

            "content": "Persepolis French animation film directed by Marjane Strapi and Vincent Paronnaud. The film is based on the autobiographical graphic novel of the same name by Marjane Satrapi. The film co-won Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival in 2007 - the movie also received Best Animation Feature nomination at Academy. \r\n\r\nPlot of the movie is about a well-to-do young girl whose family pets the ideas of communism, to face the despotic Reza Shah Pehlvi of Iran; but the sudden emergence of Iranian Revolution of 1979 put her to face hardships to follow religious state. I would struggle to criticize this film with some of its baseless representation of firstly Iran, secondly its people. \r\n\r\nFilm portrays veil as if this had, all of sudden appeared new to the people of Iran or as if the veil mean suppression and strangling. Although, nobody talks same way about Religious habit that Nuns in Christianity wear, or any nuns in different religions. It seems, the movie defies the people's right to practice their religion. Marjane should've realized that Muslim women in France, and Europe and beyond wear Hijab, does the rule of Iran or other Muslim country, apply there? Doesn't recent French law to ban 'Hijab' in France (where she now lives) proves so much to her regarding, circumstances imposition of laws by government, either under Islamic Umbrella or Christian Umbrella? \r\n\r\nFilm extensively weighs on Iran-Iraq War. The film depicts it as if Iran waged that war, although Iraq attacked Iran with biological weapons, shipped to Saddam Hussein from the US. Movie also gives a dialogue 'each side receiving weapons from the west'...I am sorry but which country from the West was shipping weapons to Iran? \r\n\r\nMarjane also narrates that millions of people died on both sides (Iran-Iraq war) for nothing; while the Iraqis might have died for nothing (since they waged war on command of the US) Iranians died defending their land (true as it can be). Film also states that government of Iran executed anti-revolutionaries. Well, once again Marjane, it's exactly what French did with Algerian Freedom-Fighters in Algeria.\r\n\r\nMY ACCOUNT OF SCENARIO:\r\nI ask all those reading this review, to watch movie and analyze its totally poor approach to present facts. Are the century old rich cultures of the world, going to alter ways  of living accordingly - the embodiment of culture-code; to adopting rather lifestyle of French and Americans, so to be better judged and portrayed and being acceptable universally'? - Based on this movie's senseless depiction of events! \r\n\r\nNOTE: 1. If the circumstances like these are suffered by Marjane as Sunni Muslim than I reckon, she should've troubles living inside Iran, since the majority of Shiite people there are hostile to Sunni Muslims. 2. It's ridiculous that audience on RT are voting this film higher ratings, despite not knowing the region and Iranians, closely, as much as we the neighbors of Iran do :-)",

From a young girl dealing with the Islamic Revolution, to a young adult shipped off to Europe to escape what was going on in the country only to find other horrors abroad, to returning as an adult to find she no longer fit in with the country from which she came.\nWith elements of religion, politics and of course history, this film takes a somewhat light look at some powerful moments which had it been done in real life, would have likely made for a completely different film.\nI loved every moment of the film up until the end.  The film has a somewhat non-ending. It almost feels as if the film was trying to tell a story about the relationship of this girl with her grandmother but you don't get that from the film as a whole.  Instead, the film just kinda ends.  It doesn't work its way up to the point of her making this movie, which I think would have given the film a proper ending.  Instead, it just has a credit roll and feels a little unfinished.",

The animation itself blew me away; simple black and white line drawings interspersed with colour as adult Marjane remembers back to her childhood. The detail within the animation is breathtaking and  at times i was torn between taking in all of the detail and trying to keep up with the subtitles. This is definitely a stand out film for the year for me so far; i have never seen anything like it and I enjoyed it so much more than I expected to.",
