    "summary": "Outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) terrorizes 1800s Arizona, especially the Southern Railroad, until he is finally captured. Wade must be brought to trial, so Dan Evans (Christian Bale), the owner of a drought-stricken ranch, volunteers to escort him to the train. Along the trail, a grudging respect forms between the men, but danger looms at every turn, and the criminal's men are in pursuit.",

But if it does fail, at least it does it with a little panache. Bale and Crowe seem so perfect working opposite each other you wonder why they haven't worked together before. Character actors Ben Foster, Alan Tudyk, and legendary Peter Fonda perfectly fill their supporting roles. But the whole affair has a been there-done that feel to it. It's a derivative western, with wagon chases, horse chases, gun battles, and an epic shoot-out set piece at the train station where that train is coming at 3:10. All well-done, if flashy and unoriginal. Crowe's character seems too carefully crafted--he draws, he's literate-minded, and shows flashes of a caring heart. Crowe can pull it off smoothly, being cold-blooded when called upon and philosophical when needed. But it robs his arc of impact, and ends up being glib and unsatisfying. As modern westerns go, 'No Country for Old Men' and 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada' still hold the crown as classics. This one, for all its fine acting and thrilling action beats, can't match the frontier sweep and deep, psychological morality that IS the western",

This movie is the western equivalent of Star Wars.  The best storm troopers suddenly can't hit the side of a barn when called upon to shoot the good guys.  And all Crowe's character Ben Wade has to do if he's suddenly grown so attached to Bale's Evans is to call his men off, as if he didn't know they'd kill him! And knowing so well that they would, why would he then kill his own men rather than walk away??  You mean to tell me, he grew such an amazing conscience in 10 minutes that his loyal men must die too?

This is a laudable quality for a genre generally characterized by stereotypes and cliches. Of particular interest is the unique dynamic which permeates the relationship between protagonist Dan Evans and the outlaw Ben Wade, enabling the film to consistently impress the viewer with its willingness to permit its characters the gift of true depth and complexity. There are no simple archetypes here; as a result, we grow to care about the outcomes of the film's central conflicts on a more deeply human level. Among the one or two developments which stretch the viewer's credulity, I must include the Fonda character's unlikely ability to stoically recuperate from a shot in the gut at near point-blank range, essentially shrugging the injury off following an improbably laid back experience of 19th century bullet-removal surgery. Petty qualms aside, 3:10 to Yuma presents the Western in a refreshingly unique light, achieving a level of depth uncharacteristic of the simple morality tales which the genre typically embodies.",

But what if his body is damaged by war, his property threatened by corrupt men, and his means of providing has strict limits? Then that wish strays further from his grasp. It would take a unique opportunity to turn things around, to allow him to become the leader he yearns to be.\n     Christian Bale as Dan Evans is a marvel of restraint in his portrayal of a decent, but frustrated rancher, trying to keep his property from being taken by the railroad company. In this post-civil war era western, Evans gets his chance to reverse his fortune by escorting a dangerous, captured outlaw, Ben Wade (Cameron Crowe) on the 3:10 train to Yuma to stand trial. His reward money for this feat would be enough to clear him of all debts and, more importantly, allow him to reclaim his spot as the respected head of his family instead of being seen as a lame war veteran, lacking the means to stake his claim to his homestead. \n     I'm not especially drawn to the western genre, but this modern remake by James Mangold is thoroughly entertaining as it balances well-paced plotting, intriguing characterization, and fantastic acting by the two leads. I've never enjoyed Crowe more in a role than this one. He is perfect as the charismatic criminal, drawing out equal parts admiration and disgust from those around him, including Evans' oldest son who, on the threshold of manhood, seeks to succeed where his father has failed and wonders whether Wade may have more valuable life lessons than his own dad. Wade unapologetically follows his own bliss, whether that means deep diving into literature and the bible, or remorselessly snuffing out lives to gain advantage for himself. \n     Once the pistols are holstered and the story concludes, the one thing that lingers is the relationship between the two leads. There is grudging admiration by each for the other's talents. While Crowe's character seduces with his plainspoken views about whether a person deserves respect or deserves to die, there is also a part of him that longs to be the stalwart, committed and disciplined man represented by Evans (Bale). This is a perfectly realized film, that fires on all cylinders: story, action, conflict, theme, acting, and cinematic splendour. Whether you love the western genre or not, this is an absorbing morality tale, cloaked in tense action sequences and top notch acting. I rate it required viewing!",

I chose to watch it again more than 10 yrs later to see what it was that left an indelible mark in my memory.\nRussell Crowe as Ben Wade: complex, brilliant, courageous and absolutely uncompromising in his own inner compass. He cuts through all the pretenses of those around him since he was not blind to his own, or better said, he did NOT allow himself to have any for himself. In his ever encounter, from the bar maid to Will Evans (Dan Evan's son), his incisive and laser awareness of their psychology gives the viewer a hint at the depth of the hidden sensitivity and intelligence of his character. Perhaps the most admirable quality about Ben Wade is his no B.S. authenticity to himself and then to others. He makes no excuses for his way of being and is fully aware of the entirety of how he fits with broad picture of society. Becaue of this, he has no need to make embelishments for who and what he is and neither does he have false humility. He is an outlaw and lives it fully and with no compromise or excuses. \nI find this aspect of Ben Wade as quite refreshing when seen in the context of the average man who is beset with endless guilt and self-doubt in EVERYTHING they do. Ben Wade is like the vulture or the ants in the forest floor. He knows his role in the great circle of life and fulfills it with no fuss or muss. \nThe movie is actually a bromance between Ben Wade and Dan Evans. Their encounter with each other brings out the deepest, perhaps tenderest, aspect of themselves which heretofore had been dormant. The many scenes of their short conversations with each other are filled with nuances of the trust/intimacy they began to experience in each other's company. It is safe to say, specially with the way the movie ended, there has not been anyone in each of their lives with whom they had been willing to expose so much of themselves to the other. It may very well be how it is when we know death is just around the corner -- it heightens every experience and encounter.\nWhen I asked my BF if he had seen this movie and if he did, if he remembers it. He says, \"Yeah, it's about a guy who turns on his whole posse.\" I can see, on the surface how this can be seen as such. As for me, I saw it quite the opposite -- the time in which Ben spent with Dan and his son Will so changed his perspective, his whole being, that by the time Charlie Prince, his right hand man, shoots Dan in front of him, this made it glaringly clear he (Ben) no longer belonged to the same band of brothers and therefore had to end it.\nAn amazingly beautiful and unpredictable story done to perfection by superb actors, directing and editing.",

Mangold updated the Western genre with a quicker pace and tense scenes in order to keep the audience engaged. 3:10 to Yuma is as entertaining as Westerns get.\n\nChristian Bale is so relatable and sympathetic as the lead Dan Evans. Russell Crowe is a charming villain and terrifying killer as Ben Wade. Ben Foster is a scene stealing killer without a conscious as Charlie Prince. These 3 leads complete 3:10 to Yuma powerhouse cast of actors in their prime all commanding each scene with their notable presence.\n\nLogan Lerman is really good as the belligerent teenager William Evans and gets some interesting moments. Peter Fonda is a tough Pinkerton Byron McElroy with an axe to grind. Dallas Roberts is perfect as the cowardly Grayson Butterfield.\n\nThe shootouts and violent and thrilling that keep you glued to the screen. But, the best scenes are Bale and Crowe exchanging insults, comebacks, and pasts with their respective ethos in life on full display. It's like they develop a respect for each other on screen before our eyes. 3:10 to Yuma delivers one of cinema's most ponderous friendships with its blistering finale. The last conversation between Bale and Crowe while they hide out in the station is fascinating and moving. Their acting prowess coupled with Macro Beltrami's touching and enchanting Western score culminate in cinematic euphoria. Bale and Crowe give nuanced performances, while they tear up the screen with a slash of bullets.\n\nLastly, I really liked Gretchen Mol as Alice Evans. Her scenes opposite Bale draw out the best and most sincere lines from Bale. When he admits he is embarrassed at how everyone looks down on him to her, I was just silenced by his aura. Mol plays the uncertain and worried wife with a stern realism and a quiet grace.\n\n3:10 to Yuma is as cool as Western films get. It has all the drama and character development of a great character study, while never leaving you bored like many bloated Westerns. 3:10 to Yuma is not a slow burn, but rather a fast flame.",

            "content": "The style of 3:10 to Yuma is amazing, and I\u2019m starting to think I need to catch up on more of James Mangold\u2019s filmography. He knows how to capture stunning visuals and thrilling action. I was riveted by most of this movie simply because he utilized all the tools in his arsenal to keep the intensity cranked up. One of the most vital aspects of this story is that there is always a sense of impending doom because the odds are stacked against our heroes. That\u2019s how it felt throughout the film, and even the calmer moments were presented in a way that allowed us to sense the possible danger. I liked the characters in the film as well, because even though they were filling traditional roles they all had nuance to make them more complex than the stereotypes we\u2019d typically see in a Western. Unfortunately, there are two big problems with 3:10 to Yuma that kept me from loving it, despite all the amazing elements that went into the film. The first issue is related to the plot. I have always struggled with films that start to feel pointlessly repetitive. It\u2019s tedious to watch when the characters keep making the same stupid choices and seeing the same consequences played out in a slightly different fashion each time. The number of times that Ben Wade is left without a gun pointed at him so that he can attack one of his captors or escape them is ludicrous. At a certain point I was yelling at the screen trying to figure out how they could let it happen again. It was like an endless cycle of ineptitude, and the fact that it kept repeating got boring at a certain point. There\u2019s one other thing that just doesn\u2019t work in 3:10 to Yuma, and this is something I\u2019ve been proclaiming for years...Russell Crowe cannot act. His role in this film requires a lot of subtlety because he is a complex character who puts on a rough exterior while having more complicated thoughts inside. A strong actor would be able to pull this off so that we\u2019d see the inner conflict in his performance. But with Crowe we have a guy who appears to act erratically because we have no sense that he\u2019s making choices based on anything he\u2019s feeling (he appears to feel nothing.) It\u2019s a shame because the rest of the cast is crushing it, and the story has potential for brilliance, but there are a few choices that hold it back from achieving greatness.",

Honestly, it's been a long time since a movie kept me guessing this much about what the characters will end up doing in the end. This especially surprised me considering this is a western where characters are usually flat as a board.\n\nThe themes of the movie were well trodden, but the movie brought them up in very elegant and honestly beautiful ways. I just felt it was much more poignant than what you'd usually expect out of a western.\n\nThe production of this movie was also great. Everything looked the way I expected it to. Nothing felt cheap. Technically the movie was also incredibly solid and cohesive. Not outstanding, but still good enough to seal the deal.\n\nThe fact that I started off telling myself \"I bet this is going to be the most predictable plot...\" and quickly changed my tune to coming up with wild theories about what's going to happen is what really sold me on the experience of this movie.",

Also we liked the Acting and the developing Relationship between Crowe, Bale&Son. All in all very good BUT The Story line is completely implausable. \n\nThe twists and turns the movie takes are far-fetched and you cannot relate to the decisions the main characters makes. There are so many (too many) situations where we could not enjoy the movie just because its so implausable people would behave that way... \n\nExample:\n\n1.) \nAs a traindriver would you make a halt at a station when you hear there is a gunfight in the city? \nIf Yes: Would you still halt there if all the rifles are pointed directly at your station?\nIf Yes: Would you still stand there if they are shooting at your train?\nIf Yes: You should not be a traindriver....\n\n2.)\nAs a laborer who has to load boxes onto a train. If your trainstation is surrounded and everyone is pointing their rifles at your direction and obviously there will be a major shootout any second from now. Would you:\n\na) fear for your life, hide and hope you don't get shot\nb) think its more important to put these boxes onto the train right now! \n\n3.)\nAs a guard of one of the most feared criminals in the US. Hunted by his Gang and deep in territory of the Apache tribe known for killing all intruders. At night would you:\n\na) stay as invisible as possible\nb) light up a major campfire to warm yourself up a bit.\n\nIt's the little things I wrote here - and there are a lot more of them. They make the movie unrelatable - especially because the Story line is super strange as well.

Crowe is also good in his role as Ben Wade, the man who terrorizes 1800s Arizona until he is captured.\n\nThe direction from James Mangold (his first film since the absolutely superb Walk the Line) is very good because he keeps a tense atmosphere going from start to finish and also allows good action sequences, some of these are well-filmed and there is excellent cinematography to be provided thanks to the glorious sunny weather. The script is well written by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas and Halsted Welles because it makes the story easy to follow.\n\nSome of the violence can be a little uncomfortable to view in places but this is part of the story so therefore it has to be included. Westerns are now quite rare on the screen so it does create anticipation when they appear, unlike the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\nThis western remake is one that is enjoyable as the original because it works very well due to the gripping action sequences and the terrific performances from Bale and Crowe.

            "content": "3:10 to Yuma isn't perfect, but in a world where the western is all but dead, it's pretty enjoyable. Perhaps the most refreshing thing about the movie is its focus on characters over action scenes. There's plenty of the latter of course, especially in the third act, but it's primarily a character driven story revolving around troubled rancher Dan Evans and fierce outlaw Ben Wade. The relationship is really fascinating, but takes a hit during an abrupt change of character in the third act that is completely unnecessary. It's not enough to truly ruin the film, but it definitely makes an impression.\n\nEvans and Wade are played by Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, respectively, and they're expectedly great coming from such talent: in particular, their banter back and forth really drives the film. Logan Lerman does solid work in a supporting role, and Ben Foster nearly steals the show with a delightfully crazy performance. Director James Mangold really seems to understand the western, as he nails the atmosphere in this one. The sets and costumes fit, and Marco Beltrami's score is subdued yet stunning.\n\nWith a few touch ups in the final act and maybe some reworked pacing, 3:10 to Yuma might be a superb western, but as it stands, it's not a bad time. At the very least, it's one of the few remakes that isn't completely horrible, which is always admirable.",

Those caught in the middle living by and by, have another living they have abide, follow, that's dignity. Out in the west, it's kill or be killed, unless you have a little dignity as a unlawful legend. Dignity is only for those whom make us who we are. Other dignity we see immediately in others whom we idealize, whether a respectable family man. Regardless, you the fastest gun slinger out here, you make the rules once old rules are broken. Out here your known by your family, your known by whose shoes you have walked in, whose shoes you are going to walk in, and whose shoes you knocked right off their foot. Your legacy remains, cause you survived, stayed out of trouble, danger, kept your nose clean. Some legacy remains when your good at what you do, and your more dirtier then what your family proceeds you.  Some legacy dies when you get mixed up in it. \nWe follow this group, when it leads us to riches, has the greatest mind to plan a job, can follow what's right and mix it with what's wrong, and justify that the cause is justified. Not all unlawful man have the blood thirst, just good man, doing right, that follow the wrong path when cruel life's fate takes a wrongful turn. \nThere is more to the unlawful man then meets the eye. You never know what will turn up with every path we cross. \n \"Come to wake some snakes\"\nLiving life according to dignity, getting paid for honest days work. Accepting payment from a dishonest man for being honest to you, is only fair between you too, but not when you have moral code to follow for the town and law (Wrong Legends & Rightful heroes). Your town is filled with law man, that you can't cheat. \nWe all live according to some moral code, a man whom defends his family's honour, providing for their family, and some being loyal and following the right path. Sometimes those whom are good, and don't follow their word or yours and are disloyal and not listening, you cant help but being honest to others and dishonest to those who are dishonest (God & Man).\nWhatever we follow in this God forsaken town, whether it's laws, codes, money, morality, it's always comes down to life or death. What we consider justice, we take in our own hands, trial, or something unforseeable.\n\nSome paths we take for money more harder to earn then others. whether these paths are moral or immoral, it gets even crueller in every town you go. When we live according to some dignity in towns where ungodly ways are bred, where undignified men live we live according to a life we know, born into, can't help ourselves bu t fall victim to temptation. When being in the wrong place and time can either be life or death, it can be rewarding and unrewarding. We don't know what dangers loom, some more familiar with the dangers, as they live among them their whole life, living according to a dignified life is harder to comeby.  \nWhen dignity is no longer an option, and we do everything for money when we are desperate, pays for our life town to town, pays for lifestyle, pays for loyalty, pays for our way out of prison, we live according to a life that made us the legend we are, and the victims it has claimed. When dignity is insignificant, when we have revenge on our mind to care. When we can talk our way through anything, charms, wit, knowledge and it's insignificant, when we have rewards to think about. When we go from town to town, we have law and order to abide to, that makes it peaceful for a reason, that no money, no life, no reason matters when we must uphold what our duty is. We don't always know what we get into, or what dangers lurk from town to town, when different paths come through those doors all the time, and time is money, when we got business on our mind. When living according to dignity doesn't matter when we got an army or out numbered, out gunned and all that matters is living.\nWhen no duty is worth our life, and we are playing the Devils hand and gambling with our life. There is nothing we live according to when your faced with death, and all you have to do is be just like the thing your not. When living according to the gun, there is no dignity in the lives we have taken, for the actions we have done, when we live according to something deeper, the love for your family, being known for something that puts his family on the right path to something greater then a child of a someone whom has to settle for less, that one last sense of dignity that puts those shame to rest from town to town, and you can live either for your family, or live in your children. \n\nWhen we have to live according to something we follow, but not by its teachings, but as a reminder when life changed and went all wrong. When we had to decide which path to take on our own. \n\nWhen we can't change what we have done, and correct what we did wrong,  but we have a chance to do what's right, because we see eye to eye on one thing that is good in our life whether it's a good man having to die for his family when the government, people and a unlawful man is responsible for when everything went wrong in his life to take his life. \nWhen the last bit of dignity we have to follow is putting everything back as right, living the life we are intended to live, paying for the life we lived from the lives we have taken, and earning the life we worked hard for because someone handed his life unto us. The one right path we cross in our entire life we restore ones dignity. \n\nOr is giving back worth it, when your undignified your whole life to put a stop to it. When in the it is what we do our entire life that catches up with us. If we live according to life from town to town, we live on, our legend lives on, we never pay, and we live the life we intended because we did it on our own thanks to some helpful chumps along the way. Who is watching us, when there is no god, no man, no law, rule, code, money, family, life that holds us down or stops us when we are just that damn good.",

But from watching this movie I can guess that it is one of the better ones, and it was a really enjoyable movie.  It has some great actors, all who when put in cowboy suits, hats, and wield handguns are very badass and satisfying to watch.  It's a basic plot, and I belive a remake of the 1950s original which I haven't seen.  It has a good pace, not all shootouts but with good characters, and the war of the film slowly diminishes as the film goes on.  I love the main character, and his gang and hoped throughout the movie that he wouldn't pull something to save the guys who are trying to take him to the prison train.  To me the worst thing that could have happened was if the farmers kid became the hero and killed one of the bad guys that i like so much.  The ending wasn't what I was expecting luckly, and I wasn't disappointed.  The action was good, fast paced shootouts, and the most obvious thing is the incredibly over exaggerated accuracy of all the weapons and their users.  It dosen't really effect the movie itself too much luckly, but it could have created problems.  Anyway really good western, my fav at the moment, and has me inspired to look more into the genre.",

He is nasty and a stone-cold killer and yet so charismatic. He plays alongside the protagonist, Christain Bale. Now although Bale's Dan Evans doesn't really have any interesting character traits that make him different than many other heroes in Western movies, but Christain Bale always brings a great level or dedication and heart to his roles that he makes it work. The rest of the cast including Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman and Dallas Roberts all do an excellent job too. Now with lots of movies I've seen, either you get great acting, or great action. It's hard to find a film with both. This film has both. Bullets fly, and when they hit, you feel it. I also love how the wild west is shot in this film. In reality, I just love the aesthetic of Western films. If you are new to the Western Genre, this is a great one to start with  because this film is fantastic!",

Compared to other major Western I've seen I'd say I like this more than Tombstone, but I still think the remake of True Grit is the best.  Aside from two minor aspects and the fact that Westerns aren't my genre this film really has no issues.  The film looks great, has some thrilling action, has a great cast, and has some enjoyable characters.\nThe story is as follows.  You have a man named Dan Evans (Christian Bale) who is heavy in debt and has to leave his farm with his family if he doesn't pay them off.  Meanwhile you have a desperado named Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his men who rob a stage coach owned by McElroy (Peter Fonda) and nearly kill him.  Wade is arrested but they need to get him on the train to Yuma.  However, his men are still on the loose including his most loyal follower, Prince (Ben Foster), and will try to stop them.  The sheriff of the town, the doctor, Evans, McElroy, and even Evan's son, William (Logan Lerman), ban together to take Wade to justice while fending off his gang and other threats they encounter along the way.\nAs I said the film looks good and has some enjoyable action, but what stole the film was the cast and characters.  Russell Crowe and Christian Bale were excellent in the film and they played off each other great.  This would not be half the movie without them considering that most of this film is the relationship between Evans and Wade.  Crowe plays an excellent villain.  He is definitely bad and deceitful but also has some good in him which is showcased at the end.  He also has excellent charisma.  Ben Foster also plays another intimidation villain.  Logan Lerman does a fine job as the son.  I'm not too familiar with this actor.  The only other film I've seen him in (I think) in Noah and I didn't care for him there.  However, he does a decent job here.  \nPeter Fonda was good as well, though he was underused.  They kept him alive in the beginning just to kill him off in a bit of a distasteful way, which I didn't care for.  The pacing could have been a bit faster too.  There were a couple scenes that could've been cut out.  Those are really my only problems.\nOverall, definitely give this look if you love Westerns, action movies, or just want to see Russell Crowe or Bale give great performances.  It's my second favorite Western after True Grit, though that can change.  I haven't seen that many Westerns really.  It's not a film I'd watch regularly because, as I said, I am not a big fan of Westerns, but I can't deny that it's still a great movie from a critical standpoint and I did have fun with the dichotomy between the characters and some of the action.",

The film has a great sense of tension and you have absolutely no clue wether to like or hate Russell Crowe's character. Ben Foster is a great villain and Logan Lerman was pretty good.

The second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story \"Three-Ten to Yuma\" and remade from the 1957 classic of the same name, the film follows Dan Evans, a one-legged rancher struggling with money and under the threat of losing his land, takes the offer to bring gang leader Ben Wade to Yuma Prison on the 3:10 train.  The film follows most of the events of the original, with some major and minor additions and changes, including one of Dan's boys a young man who surprisingly tags on the dangerous journey, and is a good shot, and changing some of the ending, but is still a great modern Western.  The worthwhile new additions are grit, and more and ramped up action that though it can change pace sometimes, but the pace remains even throughout.  The film has smart writing from Halsted Welles (who wrote the original), Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas, which is brought to life by James Mangold's smart direction.  The film measures up to and surpasses the original thanks to the additions and changes, as well as amazing performances, especially Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, and even Logan Lerman, who had a bigger role than I expected, and even though he was starting, he is convincing enough to carry a portion of the picture.  This film also focuses how the events affect the characters, nailing the execution.  This is a must-see remake that shows that even changes can still make this a modern classic, another example being the True Grit remake.",

            "content": "3:10 to Yuma - 3:10 to Horse Shit\r\n(Be Advised - Spoilers)\r\n\r\nOn Monday, midday, I thought I'd treat myself to what in my family was termed a \"funkie.\" That would be the movie you'd turn on on weekend afternoons, in the midst of the heat, that would usually be a gun opera or involve oversized lizards.\r\n\r\nSo my choice what a neuvo Western called \"3:10 to Yuma,\" starring Russel Crowe and Christian Bale as the antagonist and protagonist, the charming sociopath and the frumpy one and one-half legged ex-Massachusetts militia man turned Arizona cow farmer. And then there's Ben Foster, the young actor who keeps getting case as quasi-psychotic weirdos or psychopaths, a la the boyfriend in Six Feet Under, or the creepy criminal in Bruce Willis' hostage movie, who burns himself to death at the denouement. And some miscellaneous bad guys, my favorite of which being the silent sharpshooter Mexican.\r\n\r\nThe thing I really didn't like about the film was not the improbabilities--why was the stage coach robbery so badly planned. I mean, they're running behind a coach loaded up with a backward-facing Gatling gun. Well, and for that matter, why doesn't that early machine gun hit more of them? It isn't that Ben Wade (Crowe) stays inexplicably in town after \"taking\" the comely frontier town bar wench (could they really have been that attractive and worked in a bar for long). It was the faux psychology. The last time I'd seen such a psychologically shallow film parading itself as something deep was Clint Eastwood's \"The Unforgiven.\" That one won some award. Apparently there's a prize for most self-deluded.\r\n\r\nI mean, how hard is it to make a Western? The template is already there, either in Eastwood's early films of the great operas of Sergio Leonne (\"Once Upon a Time in the West\" is about as good as it gets). You take archetypally exaggerated characters, pit them against each other in archetypally charged situations, and bring them to an archetypally loaded climax and conclusion. You don't need to fuss around with real motivation, with complexity of psychology and relationship. Unless you do, and then you have GOT to get it right.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to tell a story of human psyches, for God's sake, know what you're talking about. Don't get your information from other shallow movies that are pretending to be deep. Or maybe being as deep as they can, because they've never looked inside for their source material.\r\n\r\n3:10 to Yuma was, I guess, as story of fathers and sons and redemption. In Wilberian terms, it's the story of the \"red,\" self centered, ego-centric level of development maturing into an \"blue,\" family/village-centric level of development, the story of the transition from the social form of the strong man to that of the strong law. Ok, fair enough. Deadwood, David Milch and HBO's fantastic ballad of civilization, did it for three years. It's a great subject, rich and deep.\r\n\r\nExcept for in this film. Just as in \"The Unforgiven,\" human motivation is presented with the form of depth--yes, fathers and sons have complex relationships, and sons have to choose their idealized figures and then come to grips with their real world men; darkness must be struggled with and brought to the light, socially, interpersonally, and intrapsychically--but it doesn't actually have the substance. It's like someone quoting Shakespeare, and at first it seems they are taking those pieces that are meaningful, yet pretty soon you realize they are spouting those parts that they believe are deep, because of what they've heard or read. But not what they have felt.\r\n\r\nThat's this film: callow, un-heart felt, bleak in its confused morality, shallow in its understanding of human nature and minds. Blah.\r\n\r\n(This review and others at http://www.deepmoviereviews.blogspot.com).",

I want good, emotional, dramatic westerns, and 3:10 to Yuma has been the best one since Unforgiven.  I don't even understand why it's considered a dying genre even though there's still nothing cooler than gunslinging action.  Sorry to start the review with an aside, but I felt like it had to be said.\r\n\r\nI saw this film several years ago when it was released, but never reviewed it.  I finally bought a copy out of the bargain bin and rewatched it.  In other words, my day was made.  If you like gunfights and explosions, there's something for you.  If you like good plots and sensible character motivations, there's something for you.  And if you just like watching two actors give amazing performances, there's something for you as well.\r\n\r\n3:10 to Yuma tells the story of a rancher who is about to lose his farm, so he agrees to escort an infamous outlaw to the next town so he can put him on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison.  However, the journey proves to have many surprises and requires more tough decisions than he ever suspected.  Neither of these characters are flat.  They both have complex psychologies, and like in real life, their inner feelings affect their actions more than simple logic.  This is especially true of the rancher, who has a family to think about, and is constantly fighting a moral war with the outlaw where the fate of his son's future could be at stake.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale does some of his best acting in this movie, and Russel Crowe gets a chance to show off his chops in a non-actiony role.  He also did this in A Beautiful Mind, and once again he kills it.  All the other actors seem very well fit for their roles, with the exception of an out of place Luke Wilson, whose part is mercifully short.\r\n\r\nThis story is very well fleshed out with very few pieces out of place.  There is a choice near the end which I can't discuss due to spoilers, but it is probably the only reason I docked 10% on this one. Nonetheless it leads to such a tits ending that it's very hard to complain.  If you are a fan of the western genre, see this film then show it to everyone you know, so hopefully the power of this genre can return to its place on the silver screen.",

The music is good and there are signs of a dark gritty western that start to draw you in, however there are only so many times in a story when what is happening is inconceivable,  the story throughout has more holes than a polo mint factory and as time goes on whatever I was drawn into, slowly took me out again and then there is the ridiculous way the film comes to an end.  Disappointing after a fairly promising start.",

It is the railroad, that is itself both a force for good and bad. \r\n\r\nThe heartless rail company wants to buy Wade's poor scrap of land, which is why the banks are trying to force him out, but it is the train the implacable iron horse, invulnerable to the desperadoes attacks on which the embattled forces of good are relying to bring Wade to justice and, arguably, to bring civilization and the rule of law out to the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditionally the western is a genre in which elemental human drama of good versus evil can be staged in the vast arena of the frontier. For all this, 3.10 To Yuma is an enjoyable yarn and Fonda in particular strengthens the movie some, as the grizzled warrior and survivor of many such battles in the unending war of the American west. I highly recommend this movie to all.",

            "content": "The word remake differ in tone depending on the genre of films. In horror it's very common to expect nothing that'll match the original with the remake failing to understand what worked and what didn't the first time around. In the action genre it's obligatory that the remake will either be a rehashed, worse than the original, and at times overshadow a good film due to its poor reputation. For Western the word remake is a more positive phrase as \"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"True Grit\" match their original counterpart. The difference with \"3:10 To Yuma\" being it's one of the rare occasion where many believe the remake surpasses the original.\r\n\r\n3:10 To Yuma is about a small-time rancher agreeing to escort a captured outlaw who's awaiting a train to go to court in Yuma. Driven by it characters rather than a conventional goal. The plot is traditionally simple and with modern complexity presented in the characters. It two central characters analyze not only each other, but the depiction of the old west. Both the lawmen and outlaws take liberty in action to get what their job done. Dealing with the ideas of honor, respect, pride, and the ultimate question what is good and what is bad or what is right and what is wrong. It doesn't pick a side rather it more explores the depth of morality. Portrayal of the old West remains realistic until the final act becoming over the top for an appropriate reason. While it is established (or predicted by the viewers) that nothing would be gained if the destination was met for either central characters it doesn't take away anything from the character's arc. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately despite having compelling villain he is sadly a plot device. Not bad in a traditional sense he serves nothing, but in the way he can't suffer negative consequences while being held captive. Upon killing one of his captors he must remained unharmded because the plot needs him in good condition for the climax. Our heroes morality is tackled when debating to kill the criminal on the spot; however, the heroes make several bad decisions during their journey you know they won't turn against the law. You'll never feel the lawmen will become an outlaw nor the fear for a second care for the outlaw life in risk given how well he's treated by his lawmen. The ending can garner mixed results. It's an ending that is wholly satisfying and nonsensical. Closing the film two central character arc in manner that makes a reflection on one man life as lie and one man life as the truth. Nonsensical thinking upon it as nothing was accomplished by our central character and that each seal their fate knowing the outcome of their action. As a character study it succeeds in area you wouldn't expect it too, but the narrative never makes it come full circle.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale plays his role quiet low key, controlled, and generates considerable sympathy for him. Russell Crowe is equally match Bale as a clever and ruthless leader of his gang of robbers, but his very subtle take that his character is getting tired of his life, and his gradual bonding to Bale worth watching. Ben Foster portrays a borderline psychotic in a manner that also avoids stereotyping in good performance. These actors are supported by good supporting actors by Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Dallas Roberts, and Logan Lerman. In fact it is the character interplay is the driving heart of the film, and keeps you transfixed throughout. This interplay is brilliantly facilitated by writer-director Mangold, who sets it in a spectacular environment and embellishes the story well-handled complexities.\r\n\r\n3:10 To Yuma is an intelligent character studied even if the story it tells is not on the level of wit as the characters we analyze. It's a Western that is founded by its actor interplay and character interactions under James Mangold direction that give it great success. No matter if you're a die hard Western fan or not one in favor of the genre \"3:10 To Yuma\" contains strong characters and equally powerful cast that complements an intelligent look at the old west.",

We follow the story of a down on his luck rancher who takes the opportunity to make some money by acting as an escort for a captured outlaw in order to get him to a prison train so he can face trial for his crimes. The rancher is played by Christian Bale while the outlaw is Russell Crowe, both of whom are excellent. As the story unfolds, we learn about both men's flaws and failings and indeed those of the others who accompany them. There's all the things you need in a Western, with plenty of shootouts and sweeping landscapes. However, it is the smaller, more intimate moments that make this film stand out as they are brilliantly acted and directed. Crowe's character is darkly fascinating and complex while Bale's manages to be simultaneously stoic and fragile. There's a really high body count and a few grisly moments but this is a classy, well done movie that I found hugely enjoyable",

Personally I love westerns and there have been many great westerns over the course of the genre's existence. One of the most recent westerns is James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma, a film that I think is great. Now I have not seen the original so I can not compare them, what I can tell you is how great this film is. Let me start out by talking about this film's writing which I thought was brilliant. The writing to this movie was just so good, the writers created such an amazing story that had me invested for the whole running time. One of the things that make the story so interesting is the film's two main characters. What I mean by that is the two main characters, Ben Wade and Dan Evans, are written so well. Each of them have back stories that tell you quite a bit about them and they both have motivations for what they are doing, to be honest I actually cared about both characters even though one was a good guy and the other was a bad guy. James Mangold's direction helps bring the story to life, he just does an incredible job at directing the actors and putting the camera in the right place. Speaking of cameras the cinematography for this movie was beautiful, the camera just made the open landscapes look incredible. The score for this movie was also great and fit the film perfectly. If I had to choose one thing in this movie that stood out the most it would probably be the performances. All the performances in this movie were amazing, especially the two main performances. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are just phenomenal in this film, both give one of the best performances of their career's. Ben Foster is also great in this film and I'd even say he's up there with Crowe and Bale. In the end 3:10 to Yuma is a fantastic film that I would highly recommend!",

Unfortunately, almost no other character gets their own justice of ever being fleshed out, or stuck with almost nothing to say (Alan Tudyk and Peter Fonda are reduced to a disgracefully small amount of screen-time). Ben Foster (Angel from X3) makes a breakout performance as one of the best Western badasses of this age. A cameo by Luke Wilson, more or less, threw me off for a moment, but it was a neat turn for him. Not the best Western, but pretty clever. Now I need to go see the original and compare.",

Christian Bale plays a man who joins a posse to take Russell Crowe's character, Ben Wade, an infamous outlaw, to a train set to depart at 3:10 to Yuma in a town 3 days away. The story is not highly developed, but Westerns have never relied on complex stories, rather straightforward ones that are done well, and this fits that bill quite well. Christian Bale does an okay job, but most of the time he lacks emotion in his role, which makes the relationship with his son hard for me to care a lot about, and that makes the whole premise of why he's doing all this falter. Russell Crowe does a fantastic job in his role, and was easily the best part of this movie. No other characters are particularly remarkable, which again is a trademark of Westerns, and the action is top notch for what it tries to do. But Bale's failure to engage his role in the capacity it requires makes this movie not as good as it should be, but it's still a good movie that I would recommend.\n\n3.5 stars: Good, not great",

Shortly thereafter, Wade is captured by the law in Bisbee and Evans finds himself one of the escorts who will take Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma train in Contention for the reward of $200. Evans's effort to take Wade to the station is in part an effort to save his land but also part of an inner battle to determine whether he can be more than just a naive rancher in the eyes of his impetuous and gun-slinging son William Evans. The transport to Contention is hazardous and filled with ambushes by Indians, pursuits by Wade's vengeful gang and Wade's own conniving and surreptitious demeanor that makes the ride all the more intense. \n\nI can't believe it took this long for my favorite western movie to be made. Of course there are the classic ones with John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. No one can argue that those will remain classics for a lifetime. Western movies now just usually don't seem to work, but with this film it really breaks down the behaviors of an old western movie. It's well executed, well directed, well written and has tremendous acting. The shootouts are groundbreaking, and the sound effects are truly spectacular.\n\nTwo of the worlds greatest actors are in this which makes the movie whole. Who knew Christian Bale could be fantastic and especially in a western movie? Russell Crowe plays such a dark role that I couldn't look away from him in any scene you would see him in.  I have to congratulate Ben Foster because he had to be the best thing out of the movie. He's one of the few villains in any movie that knows how to play such a terrifying character. Director James Mangold has never disappointed me and this is without a doubt his best and most brilliant work ever. \n\nHands down this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's very fast paced, it has a great script, awesome tone and amazing set of characters. Would I recommend this movie for anybody? Absolutely.",

Russell Crowe is at his absolute best in the role that all actors dream of playing sometime in their career; that of the effortlessly cool anti-hero. He's a rockstar, suave and dangerous as the notorious outlaw Ben Wade. Christian Bale is just as good, if more reserved, as the humble and reluctant hero and family man Dan Evans. He's brilliant, as always, and together the two actors are dynamite. There's also a handful of great supporting performances: the underrated Ben Foster is creepy and cool as Wade's right-hand man, old-pro Peter Fonda also elicits cool as a rough and jaded bounty hunter, Gretchen Mol is beautiful and understated in her small role as Dan's wife. Dallas Roberts as the guy with the money surpasses the limits of his role, he's a character actor to look out for, and it's always good to see Serenity's pilot Alan Tudyk. Hmm...so did I mention I enjoyed the performances? The directing isn't the most imaginative, but Mangold can tell a decent story. The film is a little slow at times, and there are some momentary lapses in plausibility (How does Dan run so fast with one leg?), but it's a thoroughly entertaining film with plenty to admire.\r\n\r\n*(Actually, \"The Proposition\", \"Seraphim Falls\", \"The Assassination of Jessie James...\" and about a half dozen other great movies that have come out since \"Unforgiven\" could have been that movie, but nobody saw those.)",

Christian Bale's character doesn't really progress through the film, and what begins as righteousness becomes more like stubbornness. Russell Crowe's character is confusing and seems to fluctuate as it pleases without obvious reason - is he bad? Is he good? Is he having some kind of redemption? It is definitely hard to discern his motives for ignoring his entire gang in the final scenes - which, to give them credit, were well-done - and then shooting them all.  Confusing, or just lacking explanation.\nAnother point, which is more of personal preference, was that I thought there was too much shooting. Pistols and shotguns are a staple of Westerns - but when they're happily and endlessly fired off at each other throughout the film they lose their impact. Old pistols and shotguns are incredibly loud and modern films really have the technological capability to show us that. I prefer the approach taken by the modern reboot of True Grit, where the pistols are used sparingly and after the half-way mark - we've been waiting for someone to fire a shot, and when they do, it's incredibly loud.",
