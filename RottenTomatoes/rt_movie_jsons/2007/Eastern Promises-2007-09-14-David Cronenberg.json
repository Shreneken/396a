            "content": "Director David Cronenberg began exploring the body horror of organized crime in his previous film, A History of Violence, and he continues this pursuit in Eastern Promises, focusing on the infamously vicious Russian Mafia. This group has become a film stereotype for the nastiest of bad guys (thus beloved of screenwriters), and Cronenberg is presenting conventional movie fantasies of these people rather than a gritty expose. Everyone talks like Boris Badenov and drinks way too much vodka at banquets while listening to sad Russian folk songs. Viggo Mortensen is brought back as the badass undercover agent infiltrating the gangsters' organization to take it down, and has done his usual meticulous preparation for it, but was this role really worth the trouble? His nude fighting scene in the bathhouse always gets mentioned, but at this point in the film we already know he will have to survive to keep the plot going, so is it really that suspenseful?\n\nEastern Promises' biggest flaw is its McGuffin \u2013 the dead girl's diary that the bad boys will do anything to retrieve and will take out anyone who has read it. We are supposed to simply accept that cute midwife Naomi Watts would take this piece of vital evidence for a dead Jane Doe home rather than immediately turning it over to the police, and that she apparently has no sense of the nastiness of the Russian Mafia, even though she works in a downtown London hospital, and must regularly see their victims and thugs being wheeled through the corridors. This is really asking too much of us, yet the whole plot hinges on this device. Cronenberg, so effective at creating creepy body horror films that get us thinking, is simply out of his element making a plain old dumb gangster film like this.",

Things get complicated when Anna (Naomi Watts), a nurse in the local hospital, finds herself involved with the criminals when a young girl dies in childbirth, leaving behind a newborn. Watts does a pretty decent job in her role, as does Armin Mueller-Stahl as the seemingly kind but ultimately ruthless mob boss.  Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel ham it up nicely as a pair of Russian killing machines, sometimes taking it way over the top.  The violence is brutal (check out the spa fight) but not as pervasive as one might think. The final ten minutes or so contains a twist that seems out of place and totally unnecessary, but, beyond that, David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises proves to be a pretty effective gangster film.",

            "content": "First and foremost, the actual plot to this film is barely important; it's the tiny enclave of the Russian mafia and the individual characters that compose this select group that draw the attention, with Mortensen as the enigmatic but capable Nikolai, Cassel as the drunken inheritor who skips by on family connections, and the film's top-notch villain, Mueller-Stahl's Semyon who puts on the airs of a wise, harmless sage but is ultimately revealed to be harboring extreme cruelty and a substantial lack of empathy. I don't feel that the film as a whole is as revelatory as some seem to believe (and not as interesting as Cronenberg's earlier outing with the lead, A History of Violence, but that might be my love for that film's small-town America setting), as Mortensen makes the best of a script that forces him into a somewhat predictable 'criminal with a heart of gold' arc, albeit one that peppers in interesting stops along the way. Everyone loves the sauna fight, one of the earliest of its brutal and bold-faced, unromanticized, long-take style to have made the jump from foreign films (particularly Korean action) before going mainstream with films such as John Wick years later. The performances certainly elevate the film above the depths that it could have sunk to; if the original premise was not refined to incorporate more interesting characters, it would have ended up relatively generic. Though Mortensen adds plenty of nuance to his role, I am an even bigger fan of Mueller-Stahl, who provided a bait-and-switch villain that feels convincing and far from cheap; his performance in the somewhat middling but underappreciated action-thriller The International had similar undertones.

I was thoroughly confused at first, and found myself searching for answers. Thankfully, the plot starts to weave the disparate storylines together and bring all the different characters into one story. I quite liked how the characters\u2019 motivations were formed, because I felt that I knew each person and what they were seeking through almost the entire film. It helps that the cast is delivering great performances across the board. There\u2019s some nuance to this film that elevates it slightly above most other mob/gangster movies for me. I think mixing in the element with Naomi Watts, as a civilian trying to negotiate with the Russian mob to get what she wants, was a crucial component that kept this from feeling like another carbon copy of other crime dramas. She was engaging, and I liked how determined she seemed despite the potential danger of her situation. I think my biggest complaint about Eastern Promises is that it sometimes moves at a slow pace. The entire film is loaded with quiet moments. Even though I was into the story, the lulls in the film sometimes threatened to make me lose interest. It\u2019s also a highly explicit film with both sexuality and gore. This is stuff I don\u2019t normally handle well in any situation. But there is enough in the story that intrigues me, so I was able to forget about the objectionable things when they passed. I\u2019m no expert on accents, so it\u2019s hard for me to tell whether Viggo Mortensen is doing an amazing Russian accent or a terrible one. Either way, I know it was weird hearing that voice come out of his mouth. He does embody the type of character they needed for that role, though. I always like when an actor can pull off dangerous and likeable in one performance, and he nails it. I did enjoy Eastern Promises, even if it wasn\u2019t totally my cup of tea.",

His simplicity, and even cliches, has a panache that any filmmaker would die to have for. His lucid flow on storytelling is why it all looks so simple and easy. He doesn't rely much upon antics, but when there are their to work upon, he makes sure he builds them up sincerely and weaves them out sharply on the screen. Take the holy ceremonial or mythological ritual sequence that these gangs go through before claiming their titles or roles in their community. That entire sequence where Mortensen surrenders himself to their religion or the game that they believe in and feed themselves in, says a lot about the integrity of these characters.\n\nThese tiny characteristics of the characters is why we care, this attractive nature of theirs makes us root for them from the start. There isn't much action in the film, but only once does Mortensen throws a punch, and that entire sequence is not only well choreographed and shot but also brilliantly performed. Nikolai; the protagonist, played powerfully by Viggo Mortensen is not your average Godfather-like mafia member, he wants to prove himself and he does.\n\nNaomi Watts cloaking as Anna, the sort-of voice of the reason of the film has unfortunately very less to invest. In fact, Vincent Cassel as a spoiled brat has much more threat to convey with his uncertainty. Stephen Knight, the writer, is not overprotective or melodramatic about his content, he gives up easily but wisely, he makes sure that there is another surprising layer attached to it, to ground the emotions and justify these killings. Eastern Promises has a promising premise, scoffing off the usual crime drama rigmarole, David Cronenberg focuses on the heart of these characters.",

It\u2019s simplicity leaves some things to be desired and more action to reward viewers could have been added, but with everything making sense and being so polished, it\u2019s hard to be too upset. 7.75/10",

Not to mention the typical Russian villains.\n\nBut here, WOW. I feel like this is the best Russian portrayal I've seen out of Hollywood. Any better than this and it'd be some kind of joint Russian production. You could tell the production did its research, most of the actors took their Russian lessons seriously, the Russian dialog made sense and was surprisingly natural. Hell, they even finally hired real Russians to play some of the extras.\n\nAnd Viggo just... He just knocked it out the park and into another galaxy. I always heard he had a talent for languages, but to hear it here was a shock. He nailed the language. Bravo to him. I might even go as far as to say that this was Viggo's most impressive role yet.\n\nI also have to say that I was really surprised by the quality of the cast here. They all did a serviceable job.\n\nNow the story took me by surprise. The third act of the movie is refreshingly unexpected. I thought I had a good grip on it all, and then I was pleasantly proven wrong. It elevated the movie from a good movie, to a great one.\n\nI can recommend this movie to anyone with a completely clear conscience.",

I couldn't suspend disbelief with the characters or the story, a mix of cliches and strained credibility.  Oddly, Mortensen seems to have received Best Actor nominations for his performance here, which tells me more about the questionable standards of those who make such nominations though he's at least serious about his character in this.  The direction is probably the worst aspect of the movie.  It veers from routine to jarring, almost amateurish at times. Whether the script called for it or not, the opening scenes are gruesome and disjointed for no good reason.  Other scenes struck me as contrived or stylized in the way they were staged.",

Eastern Promises isn't all that dissimilar to A History of Violence, dealing with similar themes of ordinary citizens getting caught in a darker world lurking all around them: this time around, Cronenberg takes us into the seedy depths of the Russian mob and one woman's entanglement with the aftermath of a rape. Despite running just 100 minutes, the film takes its time in establishing the facets of the story, as well as the inner workings of the mob, never feeling like detaild have been glossed over or rushed. It's not too intricate or complex, with just enough development to keep the intrigue alive and the story moving at a solid pace. It's an acting powerhouse across the board, but the clear standout is the Oscar nominated performance from Viggo Mortensen as Nikolai, playing a pretty convincing Eastern European. Mortensen's role only gets stronger as the story progresses and the intricacies of his character's arc are revealed: a fight sequence in a sauna, already a masterful scene as it is in its sheer brutality, becomes even more impressive in what it reveals about Nikolai as a character. If A History of Violence proved Cronenberg capable of simply exploring different themes outside of the realm of body horror, Eastern Promises cements his skill in a very different genre.",

            "content": "With A History of Violence in 2005, David Cronenberg seemed to take his career in a more mainstream direction. It wasn't the horror or dark science fiction that many had come to know him by, but an arresting thriller that was actually based on a graphic novel. It was a big success and, two years later, led to Cronenberg sticking with his leading man Viggo Mortensen and attempting something similar with Eastern Promises. You could say that their second collaboration delivers something even more satisfying.\n\nPlot: Deeply affected by the death of a Russian teenager in childbirth, nurse Anna (Naomi Watts) takes it upon herself to find her family and save the baby from foster care. With access to the girl's diary, Anna is led to Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the owner of a Trans-Siberian restaurant. Semyon isn't the endearing character that he makes out, however, and the closer Anna gets to the girls story, the closer she gets to the enigmatic 'driver' Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) and the bloody underworld of the Russian Mafia.\n\nWhen you think of a mob movie, your memory will most likely be jogged to the glamorously brutal Italian American variety. The obvious ones being the exemplary work of Scorsese's Goodfellas or Coppola's The Godfather. You may even consider the violent Cuban's of DePalma's Scarface and the Puerto Rican's of Carlito's Way or perhaps the Irish goons from The Coen brothers Miller's Crossing. With Eastern Promises, though, Cronenberg decides to focus on the Russian mafia operating from a restaurant in the drab, Hackney borough of London. Although it mines the same well as some of the aforementioned films, it feels like a fresh take on the mob movie, primarily because it's an ethnic group of mobsters that don't often get attention. \n\nSteven Knight's screenplay focuses on the murky world of people trafficking while exploring the tradition and initiation of Russian criminal codes. The gangsters of this story have to earn their positions and their stripes which are represented in tattoo form and by doing so, brings forth an genuine air of mystery and intrigue to the characters. This is the master stoke of the film. And Cronenberg knows it. He's not overly concerned with the plot itself. Sure, it plays out with a good degree of tension and more than holds your interest but the real draw here is what we don't see. It's the machinations of this criminal underworld and their untold code of ethics that intrigues the most. This is exemplified with some great performances; Naomi Watts delivers the perfect bewilderment of a women out of her depth and while I'm a huge fan of Vincent Cassel - and his loose-cannon, Kirill, gets a substantial amount to do here - even he isn't the standout. It's the unnerving work of Armin Mueller-Stahl who brings real gravitas as Semyon, the patriarchal head of the family and the quietly affecting, yet very intimidating, Viggo Mortensen who own this film. When we speak of mystery and intrigue, Mortensen's loyal driver Nikolai is the epitome of it. It's an absolutely captivating performance which rightly gained him his first (and long overdue) Oscar nomination with his involvement in a steam-room brawl worth the nomination alone.\n\nWhere the film is slightly let down is in its rushed denouement. For the most part, it revels in a particular pace, but when it's drawing to a close it feels muddled and determined to finish within a particular running time. Up until then, however, it's a brutal and punishing crime yarn that hits many a strong note and breathes new life into the mob film. \n\nA viceral, stylish and compelling story that benefits greatly from masterful acting. It's arguably both Cronenberg and Mortensen's finest work. This Eastern themed film keeps good on its Promises. \n\nMark Walker",

Viggo Mortensen delivers one of his best performances, right after \"Captain Fantastic\", and has a great chemistry with Naomi Watts and delivers a great Russian accent. The latter delivers a great performance as well and makes the viewer feel for her. The thing that most surprised me was the very authentic Russian accent by Vincent Cassel who as a Frenchman has an accent anyway but his performance is just brilliant. The story is great and is laid out in brilliant way. The movie jumps right into action in the opening sequence and then makes the viewer curious for more within the first ten minutes. A refreshing change here is that this movie is not predictable but has many twists and revelation that are very unexpected. Cronenberg portrays his characters here in an unconventional fashion but it is exactly that what makes them and the movie so interesting and intriguing. He builds up the story gradually and as the movie progresses the story unfolds in a very exciting and suspenseful way. With many medium shots and close ups the cinematography helps the viewer take in all the emotions and feelings that the characters show. In this movie facial expression often say more than words and that is exactly what the camera catches and what makes this movie so intense. All in all we can say that this is an amazing drama where all the elements fit together and where suspense is present form begging to end.",

            "content": "Eastern Promises is the least Cronenbergey Cronenberg film that ever Croned a Berg; and that's alright.  \n\nEnter the seedy world of, uh, London, where the Russian Mob runs the streets.  Vincent Cassel plays a bumbling fuck-up mafioso, whose only saving grace is being son to a local Vor (made man, essentially) played by veteran actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Along for the ride is Cassel's driver, muscle, and all around bad ass, Nikolai, played by Viggo Morgenstein.  \n\nAlthough Nikolai is the main draw of the movie, the film is rich in Russian Mafia traditions, so we're partly lead through the exposition of those ideas by \"the average joe\" character of Anna, played by Naomi Watts.  \n\nAnywho, Naomi Watts works at a hospital when her life gets flipped turned upside down by a 14 year old girl who dies giving birth.  Watts is like \"oh shit\" and finds a diary and a business card on the body, and decides to investigate.  She heads to the restaurant/club on the card and meets a guy who ends up being a mob boss who ends up getting pissed off about the whole thing, and sends Aragorn to off Naomi Watts' Ukranian Uncle.  Following the success of the hit, and the years of loyalty within the family, Aragorn gets upgraded in status, and you get to see his cool tattoos.  \n\nThe rest of the film involves Watts trying to get justice, while dealing against villains way outside of her league.  \n\nThe film is notable for being one of the finest films regarding Russian criminal organizations, avoiding ridiculous stereotypes while also showing the brutality, deception, and ritual culture of the clandestine groups.  The film is also known for its realism, with Aragorn's tattoos being considered so accurate that customers would weep into their pickled herring anytime he would go to a nearby Russian diner for lunch.  The movie is also noteworthy for discussing the underestimated and extremely significant criminal market that is human trafficking, and the effects it has among countries, groups, and women.\n\nAll things concerning the story aside, the film is also extremely proficient technically.  The acting is damn fine (especially from Morgenstein), the cinematography is gritty (matching the tone of the film perfectly), the music is haunting, and the pace of the film is so close to perfect that I don't even know how they could have made it better.  Aside from that, great films have something regular films don't: memorable scenes.  Eastern Promises has a lot of those, almost all of which are carried by Morgenstein, including a scene where he carefully preps a corpse for disposal, and another where he fights some dudes in a bath house with his dick flopping all over the place.   Awesome.  \n\nTL;DR - 9/10\nCronenberg is solid.  Motherfucker made The Fly.  Although crime is not a film genre he's deeply involved in, Eastern Promises proves that the dude can do whatever he wants and make it dope.  So if you're looking for a realistic crime movie about the Russian mob, with some great acting and a solid storyline, then here it is.  Watch the movie.  Or buy it, so that way when people come over and see it on your shelf, they'll know you mean fucking business, and they'll be weeping into their pickled herring in no time at all.",

His dark and brooding overall style along with signature moments of explicit violence and sex are still there and this is why people are drawn in, but I've seen so much better not just from the man himself but from others in the same areas that he's recently tread with this one (LITTLE ODESSA covers Russian mafia better) and SPIDER (check out CLEAN, SHAVEN instead) and A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (the obvious choice is Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS).

            "content": "Mob loyalty has nothing to do with familial ties, brotherhood, emotional neediness, or any other term that might suggest a genuine, true bond - mob loyalty has to do with fear, a four-letter word written in the blood of a Benedict Arnold who just had his throat slashed.   Coincidentally, \"Eastern Promises\", a mob film, opens with an enemy getting their neck cut open, with all the subtlety of exceptionally over-the-top porno.  This event is crossed and eventually revealed to be connected with the death of Tatiana, a murdered (and pregnant) 14-year-old girl.  Perhaps it's needed for \"Eastern Promises\" to introduce itself with these ugly events - they prepare us for the stirring brutality to follow.\n\tTatiana's nurse, Anna (Naomi Watts), is understandably disturbed by the tragedy; only the baby is saved, the mother damaged beyond belief.  Desperate to find out who would have wanted to harm Tatiana, Anna fortunately finds her patient's diary, with a bookmark leading to the local Trans-Siberian Restaurant.  There, she meets Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the aging owner she initially believes to be a friendly sort.  As she gets more and more involved, though, Anna finds that she is no longer just a woman trying to make right; she has become a woman that has angered a nasty crime syndicate that will stop at nothing to prevent disorder from befalling their meticulous system.\n\t\"Eastern Promises\" also involves Semyon's driver, Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen), whose scrappy but slick deliverance (and tolerance) of violence finds him climbing the rankings of the blood-stained organization like a knife wielding vampire warrior.\n\tDavid Cronenberg began his career as a horror maven with a creepy fixation on fantastical bodily destruction, and though he still isn't afraid to throw around explicit shots of murderous injury, he has matured, aging from a kid fascinated by the fears of delusion to a wise filmmaker who amplifies unease in the scope of grimy reality.  \"Eastern Promises\" is one of his best movies, a more psychotic peer to Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\".  Whereas \"The Godfather\" lined itself in foreboding placidity, ready to erupt at the nearest mini-climax, \"Eastern Promises\" is liked a panther on the prowl, searching for the slightest misdemeanor, delighting in its punishment.\n\tThere is humanity to be found, mostly through the increasingly fearful Anna and her anxious family, but \"Eastern Promises\" is a captivating thriller mesmerized by the businesslike manner violence is so frequently carried through.  The mafia calls for hits, retributions, and silences; a murder has nothing to do with emotion, but with order.  Any chance of derailment could result in the downfall of the structure these Russians have so carefully built from scratch.  Sex trafficking also exists in their world (upsettingly, but honestly so); is it possible that the old ideals of finding a better life in a wealthy country can survive here? The film pushes its characters far enough to make them wonder just how long they can continue on a path that can only end in premature death.\n\tThough he begins as a secondary character, Nikolai eventually becomes the most magnetic character in \"Eastern Promises\", as he is quickly brought up in the ranks and progressively pushed into situations only a grizzled veteran would be able to handle.  Mortensen's performance is simultaneously foreboding and inexplicably heroic; in his best scene, he ferociously fights two hit men to the death in a bathhouse, his only clothing coming in the form of his numerous tattoos.  The brawl is vicious and lethal; every hit is intensified, not only because Nikolai has no armor to speak of, but also because it tests the boundaries he probably never thought about overcoming.  \n\tIf not for Watts' delicate performance, \"Eastern Promises\" would cannibalize itself within its fortress of carnage; Watts serves as the film's most optimistic aspect, standing as one of the too few characters that will make it out of the story alive.  With its balance of character study, criminal fixation, and lingering humanity, \"Eastern Promises\" is a successfully ambitious mob film that acts as a career best for the always engrossing Cronenberg.",

The film has a very good story that is complimented by the performances of its actors, and it's a movie that is steadily paced and takes it's time for the story to unfold, therefore it's a movie that you are invested it more often than not because you are hooked at will happen next. Cronenberg's direction is immaculate and he crafts a fine picture with Eastern Promises. This is a solid film that is sure to please fans of Cronenberg's work, even if it's not a horror film, which is what he's most famous for, Eastern Promises is a taut, exciting picture that steadily unravels before you, and you simply cannot look away as it's truly an intriguing picture from start to finish. With memorable performances from its cast, especially that of Viggo Mortensen in a finely tuned performance that is menacing, cold blooded, this ranks also as one of his most intense yet. Eastern Promises is a visceral Thriller that is both brutal and beautiful in the sense that what Cronenberg has created here is simply a superb piece of cinema.  If you have a taste for something different, and love David Cronenberg, then you're sure going to enjoy this film. Everything that is presented on-screen is near perfection, and it ranks among Cronenberg's most memorable films in the last few years.",

With Eastern Promises, Cronenberg creates a gritty, dark atmosphere with great performances, especially with Viggo Mortensen, he had a great performance. Eastern Promises centers around the Russian mafia and their elaborate human/sex trafficking ring. Naomi Watt's character soon finds up what they're into after finding the diary of a woman who died in her work shift. That woman turned out to be pregnant and a prostitute in that mob's ring of trafficking. The plot unravels, and the movie just gets better and better. This movie feels like a psychological thriller, a mystery, and a brutal mob film. Eatern Promises is surprisingly compelling, unusually dark comic, and in the end, it pulls the rug from underneath. Great performances, great character complexities, and great directing makes Eastern Promises a brutal, gritty, and interesting experience.",

Also, there's only one intensely harrowing scene to be found, and it doesn't make the rest of the mislaid character examinations that lead nowhere (does it matter that Viggo's friend is in the closet?) and ineffective scenes depicting brooding old men any better. All in all, it's not that I require heady hyperviolence in order to enjoy my mob movies, it's just... ok, yeah, there's really no way to ruin a mob movie for me faster than to remove the heady hyperviolence. 2.5/5 Another Cronenberg dud, imho.",

The acting is probably the best part of this.  Viggo Mortensen pretty much steals the show and Naomi Watts isn't bad herself.  However, it's let down by some very jarring tonal shifts.

There were both the likeable and the hateful characters. A very good performance by Viggo Mortensen. His Russian accent disappeared a couple of times but I'll forgive him. Armin Mueller-Stahl was pretty damn good too. Naomi Watts was consistent, but that's all the praise I can give her. Though the film should have been about her, she took the backseat and it really was Viggo who stole the show. I was pretty disappointed by Vincent Cassel. He was all over the bloody place. \n\nThe whole film was a strong, continuous narrative. I've heard people complaining about the lack of surprises in the script. I really did not think they were necessary. I predicted a lot of the things before the end of the film, but I was delighted in the way they were presented. It's not the best thriller there ever was, but it's an engaging story. I wasn't expecting a great piece before I watched this, so I'm pretty happy with what I got. \n\nI will list a couple of weaknesses, however. The ending was lacklustre. I needed a bit more umph. For God's sake, the head of the Russian Mafia is going to be arrested and we're not even going to give that 2 minutes of screen time?? The ending wasn't all Hollywood, which I'm pleased about, but all I ask for is a reasonable conclusion with all loose ends tied up. The ending, plus a couple of really cringe-worthy moments in the dialogue, prevented the film from reaching the heights it was capable of. That's just my opinion. \n\nStill though, solid 4 stars.",

Add to that Mortensen's aggressive performance and you've got something brilliant. The rest of the cast deliver too and there's some strong dialogue and generally just some very cool scenes. The only problem is, sadly, a pretty big one- story-wise it just doesn't live up to the premise. \n\nIt seems on track at first but things begin to feel rushed and incomplete and I couldn't help but wonder why this film wasn't longer- it could have stayed interesting to the two-hour mark and the film really needed the extra minutes to seal things in but instead we get plot developments that all seem to end with 'Luzhin saving the day off-screen'. Things feel fast at times as if they are just there to fill in space between the key moments and worse yet, nothing is hard to predict here. It's done well so I wouldn't call it clich\u00e9 but there is definitely a lack of some originality and excitement with the storyline. Add to that the mind-bogglingly half-baked attempt at creating a romantic relationship between Luzhin and Khitova and there's definitely some disappointment when all is said and done. \n\nDespite such faults, it's never a bad film- the dialogue is fine and the cast, along with the direction, keep us entertained throughout. As a result, I do recommend it but if you are after something that feels unconventional or new and fulfilling, look elsewhere.",

Despite Mortensen and Cassel's strong performances, Eastern Promises fails to reach the point of depth found in mafia films of the past, and the story fails to deliver past the momentum of the gruesome action sequences. However, David Cronenberg's solid direction makes Eastern Promises an extremely gripping and an overall well-done film.",

The plot twist was kinda left hanging (I feel like it could have been explored more at the end), but dayum, Viggo was werqing it all through the movie and he was intense! Naomi Watts was perfect - kinda wasted, but her role was vital, so. Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl (the two mobsters) were both amazing. The entire cast was just amaaaaazing to be honest. It was gritty, well-paced, intense, dark, compelling etc. - carried by the hugely talented cast. My only qualm with this movie was that it was a tad long, but it was well-paced, so it's not a major complaint. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense dramas or crime dramas!",

Instead, he decided to make it ends so abruptly that audience would not know the so-called climax was actually the final climax.

Extremely original, as a mob movie has never been created. The role of creating an eye into the harsh Russian mob of London they use a character involved in situations completely out of her element. It is complicated due to the immense different perspectives but not hard to follow. The view of the Russian culture is not exactly flattering but brings the viewer deep inside dark realities, but also on the surface of a few stereo types as well. Not the work expected from relatively no-name writer Knight. Most films would depict one of the three mob members as pivotal characters, but using an outside entity is unique and greatly thought through. At some points too much is attempted, for example the narration of the dead mother with whom you need no further explanation but the story that follows her giving birth. Watts is nothing extraordinary but is completely believable. Mortenson's character is chilling and his heart is deep inside, brought to surface by his instinctual decision making. He does an incredible job, his role is the glue to the film. You are unable to take your eyes off his movements and your mind off his mentality, second guessing yourself constantly. Cassel's character is intriguing, meant to illuminate disgust in many ways. I am grateful for what Cassel can bring to the screen, especially with this portrayal of a pitiful sociopath. The interactions between Cassel and Mortenson's characters are fascinating, like viewing the food chain out of order. The original story is eventually a little\nwashed out with too many side stories and facets to the mob issues on screen. The violence is raw, not film action but real grit and blood. Although ending unexpected in a certain unrealistic way, it is a suitable finish to tie things today and create a conclusion to the conflict at hand.",

Nobody knows who that girl was, all that she had was a diary written in Russian. Anna is determent to find the baby's family. But the content in the diary might be dangerous for the Russian mafia that becomes involved when Anna is foolish enough to let a Russian restaurant owner/mafia boss translate the diary. Something that aren't so good, considering that he has hired such brutal hitmen like Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen).\n\nViggo Mortensen who once again team up with Cronenberg give us a marvelous performance as the brutal but loyal mobster. He even looks Russian and also speaks it. Vincent Cassel is excellent as Mortensen's premature psychotic partner, Kirill, that are constantly rebuked by his father, the mafia boss, Semyon, played wonderfully by the great Armin Mueller-Stahl. In other words, there's great performances all over the place.\n\nI liked the plot, because it's a family blood bonded story that makes movies like The Godfather great. It is a quality gangster picture, with a dark overtone of lawlessness, and a lot of on-screen violence that are truly shocking and powerful, specially a scene were Mortensen has to fight of two Chechen mobsters in a Turkish bath, bare naked. This is certainly another great gangster film from Cronenberg. Thumbs up.",

I find those two emotionally engaging and infinitely rewatchable. However, if we are talking about the best Cronenberg film, I would gladly say it is \"Eastern Promises\". It's complex, intelligent, and a very compelling film about identity. This is Mortensen's best performance to date and Cronenberg's most complex film. I loved it.",
