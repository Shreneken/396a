Supporting players--Vince Vaughn, Catherine Keener, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, and Hal Holbrook--add class and acting weight to this adventure. By the end, you will be profoundly moved by this extraordinary film. A glorious must-see American epic",

One could also perceive an attitude of a young man who thinks he has everything figured out but really knows nothing of life. Or you could just view him as a nut who decided to throw away wealth and privilege that a lot of people never even have a chance to access. I get wanting to leave society behind but unless you were born and raised in the wilderness, you're not just going to wander out there and survive long-term. It's pretty arrogant to think he could just figure it out as he went. I don't really care for the main character so that made this one kinda meh for me. It's a well done movie but a bit too drawn out. I also think it tries to portray this guy in a much more positive light than he probably deserved. I'm guessing they couldn't show much of a flawed character because the guy died and the family wouldn't like it. If I had seen it as a younger man, I probably would have liked it more. But watching it in my 30s, I just see a very young, naive guy who hasn't really thought this big decision through.",

Ironically, the very things he complains about are the very controls that liberals like him put on things to protect nature and control you. Ironic.\n\nYou don't need to run away from your life to find freedom - just get out of your urban hell holes where you continually vote for a government to control your life and don't put your job before living.

It's funny how people idolize him and his ideas, yet call rural people that live that way today backwards and ignorant.

Whether one agrees with McCandless' philosophy, it's an interesting and emotional story of self-discovery, wisely relying on visual imagery instead of excessive dialogue to impart its message.  Told primarily through flashbacks, the film features a strong script, some sound performances (especially by Emile Hirsch as McCandless and Hal Holbrook as an elderly man who takes McCandless under his wing), a great score and soundtrack, and some effective cinematography.  There are some pretentious directorial decisions by Penn (for example, the needless use of freeze frames during a scene in the Los Angeles segment), but overall the film is an entertaining and insightful look into the quest for meaning in life.",

            "content": "Sean Penn's \"Into the Wild\" is an intimate, heartbreaking and life-affirming biography drama that offers profound insights into the struggles of living in the wilderness. With his fifth feature, writer/director Sean Penn created an astonishing adaptation of Jon Krakauer's best-selling novel about an ill-fated hitchhiking nomad. Using spellbinding cinematography, Penn draws viewers into the journey of a resourceful adventurer that hitchhikes across Alaskan wilderness. Penn's decision to shoot the film using natural lighting is risky, but it works tremendously. Penn deftly uses natural lighting to convey the stark beauty and dangers posed by living in the wilderness in a style reminiscent of Chloe Zhao's \"Nomadland\". Penn showcases immense control over the production design, locations and music, using these elements to create an immersive cinematic experience. Penn's script is also sensational, and expertly utilizes voice-over narration to capture parental resentment experienced by children of dysfunctional families. It's hard to not admire powerful performances from the cast. Emile Hirsch delivers one of the finest performances of his career as Christopher McCandless. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys angst, desperation and lifelong resentment of an adventurer that seeks solace in the wilderness to deal with his traumatic past. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Hal Holbrook, is also exceptional and worthy of recognition. Although \"Into the Wild\" is undeniably an unforgettable biographical drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly two and half hours, it's slightly long and at times as aimless as its main character. Moreover, it builds to an abrupt conclusion that lacks satisfying resolution. Nevertheless, fans of the book will definitely enjoy \"Into the Wild\" and so will movie-goers seeking inspirational entertainment. As a window into an unusual way of living, hopefully it will inspire interest in the journey of an adventurer whose motto of living life to the fullest deserves to be celebrated even if his own came to an unfortunate end.",

Instead, Penn opted for a different approach, making McCandless into a romantically inspired, but also woefully naive and inexperienced, traveler simply trying to live life in the way that they see fit, running across other people that are doing the same in different ways. Viewers can choose to interpret him as enlightened or childish as their own perspective permits (though I lean toward the latter). Not excessively ponderous or pretentious as it could have been, and featuring the most prominent performance of Hirsch's career thus far (supported by solid supporting roles, the other half of the interactions upon which the film is built), the length is a bit unwieldy but the substance is decent; what a turn for Penn on the other side of the camera.

It is the story of a guy that found his parents toxic and he thinks that being alone, in the wild, without comfort is the solution of happiness, but he later discovers that it is different. The message of this is that freedom and loneliness can give you good things, but you need people around you to be happy and that it something you explore by his writings, yes, but by the people he met during his journey. In Alaska, he was dying and suffering because he had no one to relie on and to talk to, but with Ron and the couple ( I don't remember their names) he found a new family that could have give  him this freedom and the company. In terms of cinematography, it was something to look at. The images were so good. You had these beautiful backgrounds, these focus on objects and animals and it was awesome to watch. The format too was original. It was like a book with chapter and the narrator kept changing. There was these flashbacks  of  before Alaska that helped giving some power to the film. There was also great acting by the main actor. Just to say I was as devasted as hims when he realized he had eat non-comestible plants.

The only time McCandless is interesting is when he is actually WORKING (God forbid). The interesting people are all those around him. Hal Holbrook \u2018s bit is fantastic, but it comes so far in, its a long haul getting to him. Its a little maddening when McCandless attempts to get social services, in line with those who really need it, and are not playing at poverty and \u2018finding themselves\u2019.

It sends the wrong message to the viewers especially the teens, to just give up everything they worked for so abruptly without proper planning.

Literally the only reason I even watched this movie was because I heard Kristen Stewart was in it and I love Kristen Stewart, but she unfortunately had very little screen time in it and only showed up in the third act, but at least her acting, fake southern accent, and singing (I think I remember her singing a song while playing a guitar in this movie in one scene out in the country at night) were good, not to mention she played the guitar well too. Who ever would've guessed Kristen Stewart can act AND sing and play the guitar all well? She has such multiple talents!\n\n That aside, I was so disappointed by Into the Wild, it was the most overrated movie of 2007. So after Christopher McCandless graduates from college and earns his degree, he abandons all that he has earned from that and burns his own driver license, his own ID, his own social security card, and gave away all of his money to charity just so he can become a tramp living in the wild. He had over 24 thousand dollars and he gave all of it away to charity. He is not a wise person. He leaves his family behind and never sees them again.\n\nAll of that college education, graduation, hard work, money, potential, shelter, and love from his parents and sister, and he threw them all away in pursuit of his idiotic dream and unrealistic goals of becoming a homeless Gypsy living in the wilderness. He then goes by the name \"Alex\" after he ditched his own family and purposely got rid of his own wealth, identification, and social security. All of what he did was beyond ridiculous. How does this movie expect me to like its protagonist? How am I supposed to like, sympathize with, or relate to this character?\n\nHe meets a lot of random, friendly strangers out on the road and befriends them temporarily and spends a day or a few spending quality time and living with them and then leaves them and travels to Alaska and finds an abandoned tireless tour bus in the middle of nowhere on a grassland out in the wilderness and decides to make that abandoned tireless bus his new home and writes everything that happens in his life after college graduation and his thoughts. His sister and especially his parents really mourn him a lot and desperately want to know where he is and if he is even still alive and safe. The worried parents even call the police to investigate the disappearance of Christopher and to find him. Not once does he ever write a single letter and send it to them. That was very selfish of him to abandon his loved ones like that who love and care so much about him. \n\nThe last stranger Christopher met and temporarily befriended was an old man. He convinced the old man to hike up on top of a mountain with him. The old man offered to let him live with him in his house, but Christopher  turned down the offer, which was a stupid decision that he soon regretted. He then goes back to the grassland where he lives to hunt for wild animals after severely starving from not eating for days, but there were no sign of animals in the area. He was so hungry and desperate to eat food that he when he found wild berries, he ate them without being cautious about the possibility of them being poisonous....which he later found out the berries he ate were poisonous after going back inside the abandoned tireless bus in which he lived in and reading in his book about wild berries and seeing the type of ones he ate earlier on one of the pages stating facts about how deadly they are and how it can affect you and the signs of you being poisoned by them, so he soon ends up slowly dying inside the bus from the poison and just right before he died, he tremendously regretted his departure from home, abandoning his family who deeply loves and mourns him, and his reckless, senseless decisions he made after graduating from college.\n\nThe main character is not someone you should look up to nor be inspired by (unless he inspires you to NEVER become a hitchhiking bum living a suicidal life outside in the wild and ditching your loved ones, giving away and getting rid all of your own money, burning your social security and ID cards, and live outside in the wilderness and travel like a Gipsy meeting random strangers on the road out in the country and temporarily befriending them, and mostly eat wild animals after hunting them to survive). He was nuts and out of his mind and ultimately paid the price for his actions and decisions in the end which cost him his life. He wasn't a bad person, just a young, dumb, overconfident, and naive person who wasn't bright and made very unwise decisions in his post-grad life. I know this movie was based on a true story, but I don't care if it was based on a true story, it doesn't make it good. I would not watch this film again, plus, I was even falling asleep a bunch of times while watching this super slow and boring movie.\n\nHow this god-awful, atrociously paced, silly, forgettable, depressing, and boring snooze-fest got a certified fresh 83% tomatometer and an 89% audience score is beyond me! This movie is criminally overrated! There are countless better movies out there that are FAR better than this, but unfortunately have lower audience scores. \n\nRating: 4/10",

Into the Wild is a beautifully made motion picture and some of the segments (especially those with Hal Holbrook and those that transpire around \"the magic bus\" in Alaska) are powerful. Chris initially comes across as an idealistic jerk - the kind of guy who will thoughtlessly hurt others if they stand in the way of his achieving a goal. Gradually, he is revealed as being more complex. By the end of the movie, I don't know that I liked Chris, but I understood him and sympathized with him, and sometimes that's more important. Into the Wild is a long motion picture, clocking in at nearly 150 minutes. But the strength and breadth of its material earns it the extended running time. It's about many things and makes pointed comments about the ridiculousness of a society where bureaucracy and the rat race have become so cumbersome that they crush the pleasure out of living. ",

I learned about someone who had to force themselves to play a part of American boy under artifice family values and wanted to see beautiful things instead.  Who wouldn't admire this guy?  As the movie progresses, however, McCandless/Supertramp has the gift of meeting all of these beautiful people who let them into their lives but time and time again he walks away from it in pursuit of something more beautiful.  McCandless/Supertramp ends up writing in one of his many books he's reading, \"happiness only real when shared\".

Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life. His journey takes him full on into the wild with a tragic outcome... \n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus read: \"With his sturdy cast and confident direction, Sean Penn has turned a complex work of nonfiction like Into the Wild into an accessible and poignant character study.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and described it as \"spellbinding.\" Ebert wrote that Emile Hirsch gives a \"hypnotic performance,\" commenting: \"It is great acting, and more than acting.\" Ebert added, \"The movie is so good partly because it means so much, I think, to its writer-director, Sean Penn.\" The American Film Institute listed the film as one of ten AFI Movies of the Year for 2007. National Board of Review named it one of the Top Ten Films of the Year. Into the Wild also ranks 473rd in Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.\n\n\"Into The Wild\" is beautifully shot by Eddie Gautier and beautifully directed by Sean Penn, it has an intriguing real and sad story and we get beautiful music from Eddie Vedder. We also get a very nice ensemble cast with Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Hal Holbrook, Kristen Stewart, Vince Vaughn and Zach Galifianakis. But, of course it\u00b4s Emile Hirsch that stands out as Christopher McCandless. The main focus of Christopher\u00b4s journey is to truly live life as it was meant to be with just the basic needs to survive and be completely self-sufficient, which is I reckon a nice life philosophy, but as well a difficult one if you do miss vital knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness. Still there something that doesn\u00b4t blow me away by this movie. And to be honest I can\u00b4t see Christopher McCandless being more than very naive for going into the wild so unprepared. His own fault. Though the book on McCandless' life, and the movie it spawned, were sympathetic to the whole situation, many Alaskans believe that he was foolish to embark on such a lifestyle without the appropriate skills or equipment, such as a map or compass. Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian has said, \"When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament. Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.\" I reckon Christopher McCandless tragic outcome can be debated over and over, but essentially one should be prepared in any sort of journey in life if you ask me.",

So he got rid of all his official documents, donated the rest of his money, and started making his way to Alaska. He created a fake name for himself to go along his persona, Alex Supertramp. On his journey to Alaska he met many amazing and extraordinary people that helped him along the way. There was only one thing he really wanted in life though, the freedom to be alone with only him and his control on nature and his life. In the movie it was shot in such beautiful scenery it made the whole story feel more realistic and authentic. They had a lot of famous actors in this movie that i think were perfect for the roles such as Kristen Stewart and VInce Vaughn. The main actor that played Christopher McCandless isn't really famous but he did an amazing job with this movie and he seemed like the actual Christopher McCandless. The way the actor played him made him seem as deep and young and carefree as the man himself and i think that being able to have that authenticity in a character is just an amazing thing.

Emile does a splendid job in this coming of age drama about a boy who forgoes all of societies benefits to go out on his own and live off the land.  There are beautiful settings from the cold unforgiving Arctic, to the southern seas in the Gulf of Mexico.  It's a sad story, but one that needs to be heard nonetheless.",

He heads, in a round-about-way, for Alaska where he can live alone.\n\nSupertramp's sister provides various narrations throughout the film trying to understand why he disappeared as he did -- and gets it -- after reflecting on their family life together.\n\nNot examined is the parental perspective -- worried and concerned -- at times fearing that Chris is dead, but not wanting to bear the fact that he wanted to disappear and they are or were at least partly to blame.\n\nWhile the film is enjoyable as we follow the adventures of Chris, it is unbearable to see this story from the parent's mindset. Chris is selfish, self-centered, and immature, and never thinks of how his parents may feel not knowing whether Chris is dead or alive, suffering somewhere alone, hungry or sick.\n\nChris makes some mistakes living alone which eventually kills him -- wasting his life, devastating his parents and causing a great deal of sorrow for his sister.",

Into The Wild tells one of the most fascinating stories of the past few decades, charting the journey of a young, gifted individual who shirks all the complications and oppressions of modern life and sets out on a spiritual odyssey to discover himself and his true place in the world. Or something like this. In the hands of a less egotistical director this could have been great, an insight into the inner soul of the modern world's disillusioned young adults, but with Penn at the helm it comes across as a rich, spoiled brat running away from home because he thinks that what the cool people do. It's so full of flashy editing and unnecessarily fancy camera tricks that I started thinking I was watching 25th Hour. It would all have been so much better if we could get a closer look at our hero's true personality and learn much more about him, but with scenes constantly cutting away before they feel like they're finished, it's very difficult to empathise with him. The motivation for his trip is poorly explained and the obtrusive and grating narration is so excessive that it put Terrence Malick to shame. It is well acted and beautifully photographed, but there's only so many times you can look at a single mountain range before it becomes tiresome. I haven't read the book, but I suspect it's far better than this pretentious, long-winded and grotesquely long snooze fest.",

When we see some doors open and close for us, some that don't bother to see us and share in our journey to see how much we could use their help along the way. When we see we are on a mission to change to end what holds us back and begin what propels us forward. When not many people see us out of a crowd but those close to us that enjoy seeing us grow up. When we see that we are young, not full of knowledge, full of emotion and see they are ready for the next step of life naturally what everyone does. When we see we need to see a different life, name, perspective and fresh start. When we see paths we take we learn all to well in school to follow, to cut the side we learned to rebel against. When we see more free spirits along our journey who see us.\n\nWhen we see a time where we chose our path and direction, when we see such places take us to what we font like seeing and other places we do like seeing when it's being young & free to explore the world and into the wild. When we see that we must do somethings to not let others see what we are doing to stop us. When we don't see what our actions do when we venture alone and worry others. When we see our presence is missed, things are not the same and we keep seeing the unknown and the possible what you maybe seeing to know anything we see your capable of when your a free wild spirit. When we like seeing ourselves do an honest days work when we are good with our hands. When our minds race, we see so many perspectives to only see our own way of seeing things. When what we see is into the deep of what is right and wrong when we are far from seeing any part of change or shouldn't be concerned about when we are young. When what we see is why we venture into the wild when civilized world don't see eye to eye with us. When we don't see eye to eye with wildlife when we need to survive. When what we see we see it from others perspectives when they know all too well about the wildlife to offer us tips. \nWhen we have always had a venturous life when this is not the first we seen life on the outside. When we don't see somethings coming to see life cuts some paths short to whisk us back into the wild. When somethings we see we can't get a hold off that we naturally ride it out when turbulent times in our past we see we can't do nothing about but see through the fakeness. When we see reality and have others share thst same sight to see we stuck with eachother through the good and bad times. When we see wildness runs in our family that we naturally share. When we see we can do somethings when it's easier seen then done, we ride turbulent waters when we see no challenge we can't overcome. When we see we sre fast learns, and have little fear of places we are comfortable in when we are in the wild. When we don't know whom we will see when some invite us, guide us, and feed us along the way. When we wish not to see other things when they out a stop to what we see and experience when we are little law breakers.\n\nWhen we like seeing what doors would open for us to see what is on the other side we are curious investigators. When what we see is life so beautiful and free with no restrictions, just a bountiful natural gentle world we embrace that we capture along our journey. When some places we see come and go to go right back and seek help when conditions get bad to go any further. When some signs we don't see we avoid when we must venture further into the wild. When we see we need a boost in getting places we seek other refuge. When we see we lived our perspectives alone for awhile to see we entertain ourselves and sustain our livlihoods another way. When what others see they can't stay long to see when they don't mix well into the wild. \n\n\nWhen what we don't see we are taken into a different journey into life and death when we are on the brink to little about and see some journeys come to an end. When we see that others are more like us then what we can see, when whom we see and meet we wish we were like them but we like it safe to change. When we see that we share loneliness at heart to care about money or material life when life is short.\n\nWhen we don't see whom we open our doors to that could change our lives to offering us life thst keeps us going further and stronger when what we don't see others having to prepare themselves for what's to come we naturally equipped them with. When we see that some journeys we venture into what we don't see could cut our journeys shorter. When we see life is about the next stages in our life that we take, whether we are ready or not, we are at least equipped for what's ahead and bring along a small souvenir on our journey to tell. When we couldn't see the life possibilities we could have had or made if we turned back to filling the other people's souls and need of that attachment and love they desperately wished to seek but we abandon them for what we could see is our only journey into life. When we see ourselves far too late to see we could have never let such people go on these journeys in the first place, when we could be enough to fill them with evetything they needed to know. When we see its too late to see what we couldn't see to die alone\u00c2\u00a0 but without leaving behind everything we wished to say and make others see before we go. When we see life comes to us to late when we are found dead. \n\nWhen what we see is collection of things we were meant to see when it has always been our life's journey to hop the open road after seeing how ways to do it to finally do it. When we see a life we left behind, to see the reason why when we must keep moving on with our wild life while we are young and before it's too late. When we see we naturally mix well with civilized life, but can't stand to see ourselves sell out our beliefs to take the next step in our life. When what we see others see plenty of to see wildlife and civilized world don't mix when we are a pest. When we see we are seen as some unredourceful, incompetent no good kid to see we lived on our own for while, growing into a man this whole time. \n\n\nWhen we see life presents us with countless life stories of growing up that we naturally are filled with plenty of thoughts and words of wisdom that consume our soul that keeps us moving forward into the wild. When we see our unquenchable thirst for words others share when we see they breathe life our journey even further into the wild. When somethings we see we need to kill to survive when we see we don't have much time before things get worse. When we see helpful tips are not easier seen then done when we waste a good life for no reason. When we see not everything in our our journey comes easy when we are faced with challenges we don't see how to deal with. When we see others put good use to life when they are scavengers looking for easy pickings. When we see old faces and new faces to see some places we do well in. When we see that life does get better with time when we are introduced with the right perspectives in people. When we don't see the hurt in some people we leave behind and thst deep yearning for those to stay when we are a open road that cant. When what we see and introduced to we see a different perspective when life out here is not great but people do make a living and see they live well enough without wild and civilized world to settle.\u00c2\u00a0 When what we see are open roads in people whom have settled down when the we see they too have long stories that are filled with thoughts that need to be put into a book. When we see its hard to let go of the past, see a future without some people, and see doing somethings we regret when that's not whom we are or why we are out here for. When we see some people are great company to not steer them into the wrong open road when they can't see when they are young. When we see some words are not needed when what we see we know to get more motivational words thst don't come from past heartache but through great love thst moves us forward in our journey. When what we don't see is how fast we become nature's wildlife when we become less human and don't have the nurturing we need to conquer nature. When we see we must venture into the wild even deeper when we see where we must go. When somethings we see and do are bad ideas when we try go further.\n\nWhen what we see we don't see too often to see that we have a responsibility to see the futures safety and offer advise. When what we see others dont see when others prefer to see the norms quiet, safe, bordered, and what we must do to put a roof over our head to see our complete opposite speak to us. When we see do get to see and feel what it is like to have a fatherly experience we never got to see in our own home. When we have seen a lot to share it with others along the way to make them see what every step we took and everything that we kept within us we slowly ate away as we left everything behind into the wild. When we need to make others see it our way to see that what they see is not what they see when we have alot of wild in us all to explorer and bring out. When we see some of life's journeys are hard to climb but we consumed so much along the way from great advise, nurturing, love, thoughts and a life we never got to experience that we never could see the sign to turn back, when some journeys are complete and ready to go home. When we don't see everything we brought into our journey enough to sustain us and live on we let time eat away at what we never could see the real reason why we are out here. When we don't see is what is left when everything begins to fade away and we become part if nature and introduced back into the wild, desperately seeking for the nurishment once again to strengthen us further into the wild.\n\n\nWhen we see how much father's are for sons, we need not go into the wild. When we see we come from a loving home, wealth, and knowledge to leave it all behind for nothing that nature can't solve from within.",

I found the story of his life interesting, and I thought Emile Hirsch did a great job of portraying his independent spirit. I could see why he was so disillusioned by the world we live in, and I liked the scenes from the early parts of his life because they gave some strong insight into why he became this man. I also appreciated the non-linear structure of the film because it breaks up some of the slower parts of the story. \n\nThe unfortunate reality is that there are a lot of slow parts in Into the Wild. I got the idea of the journey and how he lived his life early but we continue to see it all unfold gradually. There is maybe one piece of information that is revealed that I found interesting, but otherwise there is not much that surprised or deepened the story for me. It was mostly a long road trip movie where he'd meet one group of people after another and then leave them. \n\nThe entire film seemed to center around the ways Alexander affected the lives of others because he changed very little himself. Towards the end it seemed that might change and Alexander was going to experience some growth, maybe even have an arc. Sadly, nothing resolves. There is no satisfying finale, there is no uplifting moment to inspire hope, it just ends. I know this is a symptom of basing a film on a true story, but it left me feeling hollow. \n\nDelving into spoilers for a moment, I must admit Into the Wild also bothered me slightly because it did something I deeply dislike. In movies based on a true story, I hate when they try to reenact what happened as if it was factual when all the concerned parties did not survive. Like the entirety of the movie A Perfect Storm, all these scenes (at least from the Magic Bus on) are just supposition based on a few short notes scrawled in a journal. It's probably a silly pet peeve, but that has always annoyed me. I can't say I actively disliked Into the Wild as a film, because I was invested in the main character's journey, I just didn't love the overall story as it was presented.",

The film does have one giant flaw though ... it's a hopelessly muddle-headed irresponsible film that glorifies a delusional, self-destructive idiot.  That's a pretty big flaw.  What's puzzling about the film is that Penn seems to understand on some level that McCandless is delusional.  McCandless rails against his parents, but as depicted in the film, they seem a bit unhappy and stodgy, but basically good people.  The film repeatedly shows you people happily living lives outside the mainstream, but refuses to acknowledge that this strongly implies that McCandless's self-destructive odyssey is hopelessly wrong-headed.  This is essentially \"Grizzly Man\" made by somebody who refuses to acknowledge that it's protagonist is crazy.",

He tries, but I wasn't buying him.  My favorite part of the movie was the scenes with Hal Holbrook.  There was something special about those few minutes.

He spends the first 2 years moving around the western states, taking various jobs and living off the land for weeks at a time.  He travels down the Colorado River by kayak, and, after wandering for nearly 2 years, decides to travel to Alaska to attempt to live off the land for several months.  The film is very well made, the performances, especially young Emile Hirsch, are very authentic and affecting.  Backed by an incredible soundtrack of original songs by Eddie Vedder, this is a great movie about a somewhat lost soul, but someone most people can relate to at some point in their lives, who is merely searching for what he calls \"truth.\"  This film makes me question my own choices and lifestyle, which must say something about the power of this film.  The end is tragic, but almost necessarily so.  Would we have ever known of McCandless, aka \"Alexander Supertramp,\" had he not perished alone in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wild?  This is a compelling story that is, understandably, quite polarizing.  Opinions vary greatly about Alex and his journey.  One thing is undeniable - he had the courage and principles which few have at age 22 to walk into the world alone and try to discovery who he was.  Sean Penn pays the proper respect to the life of one young man who, right or wrong, chose to live a certain life instead of being told what kind of life to live, particularly by those he no longer trusted or respected.",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT*\n*The following paragraphs spoil both the book and movie, read at your own risk\"\n\nYin-Yang:\n\nYin-Yang, a very basic description opposite sides that have equal amount of each other within it. is Book versus movie is a perfect example of what a yin-yang would be. This is true with the novel and the movie Into the Wild. The movie and the novel had very different approaches on how the story takes place.The opening and ending scenes and the importance of characters are just a few pieces of evidence that separate the two kinds of story. \n\n\"Jim Gallien had driven four miles out of Fairbanks when he spotted the hitchhiker standing in the snow beside the road, thumb raised high, shivering in the gray Alaska dawn.\" The novel begins in a way where they show a man named Jim Gallien providing transportation to Alex who happens to be a hitchhiker in Alaska. The overall opening chapters of the story cover the main criteria of telling the audience, where the story is taken place, and who the story is about. The book has given us more than one way of this by providing us with a map along with telling us where it is in the actual text. Adding on to this they also cover basic facts about the main character such as his name, Alex, which later tells us his full name and his real name. \"He didn't appear to be very old: eighteen, maybe nineteen at most. A rifle protruded from the young man's backpack,\" This text tells readers an estimated age of Alex, what he had on with him and can begin to piece together how he would look like. In following chapters there is a text that says \"F*uck their stupid rules\" while talking indirectly to the government, this piece of evidence shows us that Alex has a strong dislike or some kind of issue as to the entirety of the government. \n\nThe movie begins with a simple song, along with showing us two things. Firstly, a character is presented and a few scenes of a very snowy place with rugged mountains. That tells the audience not who the character is or where he is, it gives us the knowledge of one person, alone, in a very cold place. Two, they give us words on the screen with a very creative idea of using a quote from the book that I believe is shown in chapter 7, \"I know walk... Into the Wild.\" This tells us the title and the other words that follow are just words. With no pre-existing background knowledge, the audience will not know the significance of the quote, the words on the screen or the simple fact that the words are written from Alex himself. These two things have a very distinct change from the actual book itself. \n\t\nAs the ending scene approaches, there are several differences between the novel and the movie. The book begins with a the fact that Alex dies, whereas, in the movie, the audience has events that lead up to his death. The end of the movie is dedicated to Alex dying and how he died. Some differences include the blue sleeping bag where Alex died in, in the movie the sleeping bag was rarely shown or has no significance to the overall story. Another strange scene that was not brought up in the novel was the bear scene. Alex encounters a bear while he was dying and the bear did nothing but stand up, sat back down and walked away. The audience would have no idea what it is about or the importance of the bear. One last difference is the way Alex dies. They both had the obvious facts that Alex ate the wrong plant which is the wild sweet pea, a dangerous, inedible plant that has a side effect of starvation. In the movie it had a very quick scene as to showing us that Alex has made a mistake as to what he ate, the novel goes on for 4 pages about the plant alone. Overall the scenes had very similar outlines.\n\nAnother main evidence that was brought up is the importance of the characters ? the level of necessity. The character that created the largest difference between the movie and the story was Tracy. In the novel, Tracy was mentioned thrice in merely three paragraphs. In the book, Tracy is a seventeen-year-old girl that loved Alex: \"The whole time he was in Niland, she hung around making goo-goo eyes at him, bugging me to convince him to go on walks with her. Alex was nice to her, but she was too young for him.\" This was the most Tracy was talked about, after this Tracy has not even brought up or show any significance. Tracy made no impact on the story, or the protagonist Alex. \n\nMovie Tracy, however, was something else. Tracy, in the movie, is a sixteen-year-old girl who is a country singer, that makes \"goo-goo eyes\" at Alex, inviting him to have sex with her ? which he declines, and they both went on a very little adventure with each other. In the movie, Tracy plays the role of Alex's love interest. There is a possible chance that the director has made Tracy a very big character due to the fact that the audience loves romance and it is almost essential to have some kind or relationship in movies. In all honesty, I felt as if the director could have taken some scenes out and the movie would still be fine. Scenes including, Tracy inviting him for sex or whatever she had in mind, the duet scene, or the adventure trip. To put all three scenes felt unnecessary.  \nIn summary, the status of the characters and how the story begins and finishes had clear impacts on the changes of the movie and the novel. These two subjects ties in together the concept of yin-yang and how the movie and novel Into the Wild represent that.",

            "content": "Zane Amleh\nEnglish 9\nMr.Netzler \n3-10-2016 \n\nInto The Wild-The Drifting Soul Of Chris McCandless\n\n\nIf you're reading this essay then you've probably tried to read the book Into The Wild or even seen the movie. You probably know what the book is about, Alex Supertramp (Chris Mccandless) goes into the wilderness of Alaska and ends up dying, the cause of death is suspected to be poison from a plant that was wrongly digested. \n\tI've seen this movie 1 time and without going through it again i can thoroughly say that the book is much better that the movie as it normally is with book to film adaptation. An example of this in the movie and book is just that the book just approaches you with a much higher level of stimulation that the movie tries so very hard to achieve but just misses. When you read the book you feel immersed in Chris's life as with the movie you feel as a spectator. Don't get me wrong the movie was great but the book was just plain better and it hurts me inside to know that somewhere in this big world there is a individual that has seen the movie but not read the book, while this may not bother them they need to read the masterpiece that is the book.When i first started this book i really didn't have much interest in it, I found myself wishing my little reading sessions would just finish quick or just not come at all. But as I continued this book I found out actually quite quickly that it was genuinely good book and I enjoyed it,I feel that if you want to read this book you just have to persevere through the hard times and eventually there will be a turning point which will result in you not wanting to put this book down. If you want to enjoy this story to its fullest extent you have to know that :happiness is only real when shared\".\n\n\tBoth the book and the movie are full of tons of symbolic choices some of which are a little more obvious than others and some of which are almost impossible to find unless you examine the context around it. A very large symbolic choice in this book and movie that I discovered is Chris's money. This may sound bizarre but as the story progresses Chris is constantly being given money in exchange for good and services that he's provided, he constantly believes that his hitchhiking is too easy with all them money that is given to him and he much rather having to find his next meal. When Chris burns his money I feel that this is a symbol of him leaving his past life and starting a new one from a clean slate. This to me is a very large symbol in the book because it changes everything. Another example of symbolism in the book and movie is the car that Chris drives, his Datsun. This car was seen as reliable and trustworthy to Chris when he was alive and drove it. I feel that when Chris graduated and he was offered a new car and did not take it, he did this because he knew at that time he was going to embark on this life changing journey and he wanted something that he could trust and that was a reminder of his family, this car was a symbol of all he loved in life and all he wanted to love. When I was watching the movie the symbol that really stuck out to me was Chris behavior with other people on his journey.While in both the book and the movie Chris is nice and kind to the strangers he meets, in the movie he gives off a kind of different vibe as he meets more people in the later parts of  the movie his attitude kind of changes but not in a bad way. I feel that his attitude changing is a symbol of him slowly maturing through his life. This affects the whole way he lives his life.\n\n\tThis book is told in third person omniscient, this has a very impacting effect on the book and how the reader reads it. Obviously this book cannot be written in first person because well no one was there and all we have to create this story is Chris journal entries. When reading this book I felt like I was pushed into the journey that Chris took with this choice of point of view. This book was a prime choice of how the perfect choice on how to tell the story can make or break the book. While writing this essay earlier i said that I felt like I was a spectator while watching this movie and I didn't feel immersed in it, that's true but as the movie progresses you get deeper and deeper but not as into it as the book.\n\n\tMy overall opinion of the movie is that it is a really good movie that moves anyone with a heart and feelings that watches i. While watching it you have to be moved inside by the rush of emotions that are perfectly conveyed the the big screen. While it lacks some aspects such as deeper lines and better acting it is honestly an amazing movie and it was transitioned well from the book.While watching the movie was good the real treat was the book. While the book starts off slow and not interesting, it quickly changes into an amazing book, the way the author describes Chris's life it just grabs you in and  you don't want to stop reading.This movie and book were overall an amazing story and I would literally recommend it to anyone who wants a slow and steady yet interesting book.",

But I think he showed his manliness when he turned down sex with a beautiful, besotted young girl not just because of her age, but because he was too responsible to risk leaving behind a fatherless child.  By the time he realized he wanted a family, love, a mate, children, he was trapped by the raging river and his own starvation and weakness.",

            "content": "(Film: Into the Wild)\n\tHave you ever consider abandoning what you possess for now and return the wilderness where you will be able to feel nature at a zero distance? The answer might vary from person to person, but going to the wilderness and feeling nature would definitely be a wise option whenever you are confused. The film named \"Into the Wild\" directed by Sean Penn is just telling us a story about this creative and meaningful idea.\n\tGood movies will never be behind the times! This is what I always keep in my mind. Into the Wild is the movie that induces people to consider the human society and the world that they are living in. It goes really deep in analyzing the relationship between nature humans. As a top student who graduated from Emory University, Christopher McCandles who is the protagonist of the film firmly abandoned all of his possessions and a brilliant career for the sake of going into the Alaskan wilderness. According to what he said in the movie, what drives him to make this incredible decision is the annoying human world and society. In McCandles' point of view, the world is just a place where people are guessing, cheating, quarreling and competing with each other, and the only way to get out of all these annoying facts is to go into the wilderness that has not been interfered by human civilization. What he did in the Alaskan Wilderness is to live on his own and do everything in a primitive way, including making fire and ancient hunting and gathering lifestyle. In this film, the item that support McCandles' spiritual world and belief insisting he live in living in the wilderness is a book about the relationship between the wilderness and human beings, which acts kind of like the religious belief. All of such detailed inner demands are vividly represented in this movie, so this movie is definitely worth your precious 2 hours and 28 minutes to watch. However, the only drawback that I found in this movie is that the plot and conversations between characters are a little bit over-complicated, for words like \"When you forgive, you love. And when you love, God's light shines upon you\" made me extremely confused when I watched it for the first time. Therefore, please never watch this movie with your children.",

It's actually quite genius the way they do it, so an attentive reader of the book will catch what they're doing in the film, which is giving you his first person perspective only .... without the hindsight of the author... As for all the made up dialogue/monologue, no one really knows for certain what he did out there by himself anyway, and they never say \"based on the book\" although they do thank the author for his \"efforts\".

But this film is a little bit too much anti-social for me to stand. I know that a lot of people love this film to death with its purist philosophy of \"live simple, follow your heart, enjoy the nature, be survivalist\", as represented by the protagonist Chris McCandless aka. Alex Supertramp. Strangely enough, \"Mr. Supertramp\" may be among the fiction characters (he was indeed a real person but viewed and depicted through the lens of John Krakauer and Sean Penn) that I ... hated most - superficial, reckless, selfish, and totally out-of-touch. Yes, he had a traumatized childhood, but is that enough for him to blame his parents, who DID care for him, DID pay all the expensive tuition at Emory for him, to eternity, and to even haunt them until (probably) their death with his sudden disappearance? Yes, he wanted to be \"himself\", to follow \"the call of nature\", then why did he recite again and again and again the works of others, who, by all means, DID call for humanism, for people to care for each other, and NOT for individuals to detach themselves from the society without considering the natural bonds between people, the love and care that others give them? It is not that I do not understand his situation or has never \"tried\" to live like him, but watching the film, my experiences and my conscience really call me to deplore his naive recklessness, his shallow philosophy, the way he treated other people who cared for him, who loved him... Yes, thankfully enough, the \"supporting characters\" in the film are very beautiful individuals, who were not at all perfect but all behaved in a very humanist way, and were all perfectly portrayed by talented actors/actresses. It was Hal Holbrook who received an Oscar nomination for his role of \"the old man\", but I was impressed the most with William Hurt's character with a very very touching, and revelation, scene in the end. As a road film, \"Into the Wild\" also has many beautiful slides of American nature, some expansively gritty, some breathtakingly imposing, and all wonderfully filmed with not a shade of sorrow or pessimism. But due to its annoying protagonist, maybe I will not watch this film again, one time is enough.",

            "content": "I recently had the chance to watch the movies \"Into the Wild\" and Werner Herzog's \"Grizzly Man\". Both deal with man's desire to find peace in the wilderness, and both are very worth watching.\n[Warning, the following sections contain spoilers]: I first watched Into the Wild, as it was highly recommended to me. Indeed I found it to be a fantastic film with very few flaws. It centers around Christopher McCandless and follows him on his journey to be at one with nature. McCandless takes on a new persona, and ventures out leaving his loved ones behind, who have no information of where McCandless has gone. Ultimately McCandless arrives in Alaska in the wilderness, where after some misplanning meets his demise. I found the film to be more of a story about growing up and finding one's place in life, than about life in the wilderness as such. In fact, the film is explicitly structured in chapter's that are titled by various stages in life beginning with Birth and ending in Wisdom. McCandless' journey is a journey within his soul, and his search for finding \"something more\". \nThe reason I believe that the viewer identifies with the main character is because it is such a universal feeling to want to leave the complexities of civilization behind and enter the seemingly harmonious world of nature. I think this holds especially true for those who have yet to find their place in our tumultous society, such as that tricky time when we are still finding our way into adulthood. McCandless is one of those searching for something better, and the wilderness - free of all society is the only place he believes he can find it. Along the way he meets with many strangers who become friends and strongly attached to the roaming fellow. When he leaves for his next adventure, those friends stay behind in tears. In fact, wherever McCandless goes, he leaves behind a trail of emptiness and sadness. This starts with his abandonment of his family. It's a price McCandless is willing to pay in his quest to escape the social bounds. When one of his acquaintences reminds McCandless that friends are important, he responds in disagreement, stating that happiness can be found all around us in nature. It is only at the very end, when McCandless reaches his final destination in Alaska and shortly before the tragic conclusion of the film, that he realizes that happiness is nothing if it cannot be shared with others. It is interesting to note, that his spirits take a downturn even before tragedy strikes. After he kills a large moose, McCandless finds that other animals and maggots have already gotten to the meat before he could cook it. This seems like something that he cannot unite with his harmonious vision of peaceful nature. In fact the very title, Into the Wild, suggests that McCandless is not entering a world of peace, but a wilderness where a harsh chaotic reality is there to greet him. \nBut although McCandless' vision of nature is utopian, and he underestimates the dangers of wilderness, we as the viewers can't help but feel for him. The film very well visualizes his disgust with modern society in gritty scenes of L.A. night-life, where finding a place to sleep takes McCandless through the darkest and most dismal facets of the city. This is in sharp contrast to the easy-going lifestyle of camping out in the wild, where one can roam and sleep to the heart's content.\nThis is definitely a movie that both reminds us of our own struggle of coming of age, and our desire to have our own private island where we can be at peace. At the same time the undertones of social criticisms have us questioning in just what kind of world we choose to live in.",

Into the wild is not a movie that I had expected to like. in fact I am a bit skeptic about all drama films because they tend to be boring. What interested me here is the sound direction from Sean Penn, brilliant music and well chosen cast. The central idea of the film did not interest me. My parents have never behaved to me in such manners, so I never felt a need to run of from home and never come back. It's the humane emotions of the film that got me hooked, not the relation between man and nature. Towards the end, the film became haunting and kind of in all ways sensational. I knew how it would end before, that's the only sorrow I have now.",

The two strands never coalesce, in spite of some ham-fisted eulogising shoe-horned in to an overly-sentimental climax, and an arguably more compelling investigation into what this man's motivations might have been is raised by Penn and then completed ignored in favour of propaganda.\n\nThese complaints (and a few others) aside, there is still no denying that Into The Wild is a beautiful and indelible film.

Maybe midway through or later is when it began picking up steam as it transitioned more smoothly between past and present and Eddie Vedder's tunes better complimented the story as it unfolded later in the film.  The ending visually and emotionally was quite powerful, as well as the important message that the main character learned the hard way and a little too late.  So the first half or so of the film was a bit weak, but the second half with it's potent ending was a very different \"story.\"  If nothing else, the film can be a great lesson in the dangers of isolationism by showing partly how egocentric it can actually be and not as romantic as the youthful lone wolf journey may sound.  While making one's way on a ferocious spirit of adventure and communion with nature can be incredibly rewarding, I've learned from a 30-year avid outdoorsman and my own nature ventures, it is best when shared with others, as the adventure itself can be a great connection vehicle.  \n\"HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED\"",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nSean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.\n\nEmile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minutes-with Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no license-and it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.\n\nAll the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.\n\nHirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God.",

He shows such a vast range of emotions in this incredible performance. The performances in this movie are so good that it made me not hate Kristen Stewart.

We see him on a 2 year spiritual journey of self-discovery meeting some wonderful people along the way. That old man really got to me, managed to hold it together up until he mentioned adopting him then i crumbled. I understand why people may think what he did was stupid and arrogant thinking he could survive with so little but what's wrong with believing you can do something, trying and failing miserably, i know in his case it had tragic consequences which is awful. There was just no stopping him, he was determined to get to Alaska and live in solitude no matter how many people tried to put him off and have him stay with them. It's truly inspiring. I for one am a wimp and need to be dragged out of my comfort zone kicking and screaming. It frustrated me a little that he never got in contact with his sister who he seemed so close to in the beginning. Brilliant casting and soundtrack, and gorgeous scenery. Has become one of my all-time favourites. I'll have to read the book at some point. RIP Christopher McCandless.",

            "content": "Into the Wild was originally a novel by Jon Krakauer, a novel that has had a profound impact on my life. It chronicles the true story of a young man named Chris McCandless who leaves his family and former life behind after graduating from college to pursue a life on the road. An adherent of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy, he leaves behind his possessions and lives as close to nature as possible. He even adopts a new name, Alexander Supertramp, to signify how completely he is leaving behind his former life. I've always identified with McCandless, being an idolizer of Thoreau's ideals myself. Seeing a screen adaptation of this novel was a deeply moving experience for me. It is an excellent translation of the novel to the screen.\n       There isn't really much of a story line to this film. McCandless tramps across America, meeting several people who befriend and aid him. Eventually, he reaches Alaska, where the story ends. Its not the events that occur in the film that make this a great movie, it is the ideals set forth in the film that do. McCandless' condemnation of modern, materialistic living, his search for joy in every aspect of life, his deep connection with nature, are what make this film so extraordinary.\n       Emile Hirsch delivers an astonishing performance as Chris. This performance really can't be explained. It must be seen to be truly appreciated. Hirsch becomes Chris. It is mesmerizing.\n       In Walt Whitman's Song of the Open Road he says, \"I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\" That is how I feel writing about this movie. Watch it. Revel in the extraordinary journey of McCanless. Be amazed.\n\n       A note: It would be beneficial for the viewer to read the novel first and I highly encourage you to do so. The novel more fully explores Chris's motives for doing what he does and makes the movie a better experience.",

            "content": "\"The sky was falling and streaked with blood; I heard you calling me, then you disappeared into dust, up the stairs, into the wild!\" I understand it must be offputting enough for me to be referencing \"Into the Fire\" in the first place, considering my disdain for contemporary music and my not being the biggest fan of Bruce Springsteen...'s studio material (Interesting how Springsteen has been awesome live for years, yet it has never really occurred to him to make a studio song that's even close to as good as its live counterpart), but I feel that it fits a discussion about this film, for although that song came out long after the early 1990s, in which this film takes place, so much so that it's about 9/11, but because Sean Penn's directorial \"The Indian Runner\", based on Springsteen's \"Highway Patrolman\", was such an overwhelming commercial failure, and I'm sure Penn was hoping that his first actually successful film would be somehow associated with a Bruce Springsteen song. I could have said that a Springsteen song fits because this film is such a delightful testament to Americana, but Springsteen is as liberal as ever, and in this day and age, liberalism is more of a celebration to anything that isn't American. Oh, Bruce, you poor misguided heartland rocker, now that I think about it, you really should have considered doing the soundtrack for this film, because Eddie Vedder's songs are just kind of ripping off yours a little bit. Speaking of which, with the hair, beard and wardrobe that Emile Hirsch has in this film, he looks like he probably should be playing a '90s alternative hard rocker, though I might just be saying that because I for one am all for Eddie Vedder running away to Alaska, so that I don't have to deal with Pearl Jam for a while. Well, I reckon the songs that he did for this film are alright, though I might just be thinking that because I enjoyed most every other aspect about this film so much. That being said, I'm not exactly going \"while\" for this film, because its getting Eddie Vedder to contribute Americanatastic original songs rather than Bruce Springsteen is not its only questionable aspect.\r\n\r\nEven with all of the big names attached to it, as well as the strong marketing that led to commercial success, this film is a bona fide indie drama, complete with heart, thoughtfulness and, of course, storytelling laziness, at least when it comes to uniqueness, because while the final product is compelling enough for you to embrace going with it on a familiar journey, the overlong road that this film's storytelling follows has been tread upon too often for predictability to not do some damage to your investment, though perhaps not as much as this road's winding all over the place all too often. Another problem with the film is its feeling kind of underdeveloped, though not entirely from a lack of trying, just a lack of fluid structure to the attempts at exposition, which go so far as to deliver backstory information on our lead and his story, not as early as possible, but here and there throughout the body of the final product, either in the form of flashback sequences that break linear consistency rather jarringly, or in the form of a dry narration by Jena Malone, typically behind meandering filler footage which only serves as B-roll that gives the narration time to be dully mumbled out, and if that doesn't sound detrimental to focal consistency enough, the film is not much more than a series of misadventures faced by Christopher \"Alexander Supertramp\" McCandless that are delightful and all, but hardly connect organically enough for the focal structure of this film's narrative to not be tossed every which way with each jarring segment change, whose messiness could have perhaps been settled down a bit if this film didn't bloat itself with so much blasted material. A film like this deserves to be long and thorough, but at two minutes shy of a whopping two-and-a-half hours, this film is way too long, padding itself out with repetitious material and filler until things start to meander with a certain blandness that is potent enough on paper, and exacerbated when atmosphere is applied to the dragging. When I said that this film, as an indie drama, gets to be a bit lazy in its storytelling, I meant that it at least feels lazy under the steady directorial efforts of Sean Penn, whose thoughtfulness is often tenderly endearing, but just as often kind of bland, perhaps even rather dull. There's enough heart and color to this film to keep entertainment value sustained for the most part, but when things slow down, as they often do, they really slow down, leaving the film to wander down an uneven, overlong and familiar path with a heart that, when accompanied by storytelling sharpness, compels thorough, but not without emphasizing the flaws in this promising drama. The film is nothing if not highly ambitious, and it has the strength to fulfill such ambition enough to reward on the whole, but this drama could have been so much more, and Penn's passionate desire for excellence only stresses the areas in which he falls short, to where, before too long, it becomes utterly impossible to ignore the fact that high potential ultimately goes squandered under the weight of conventional, uneven and overlong storytelling, whose shortcomings have a history of being enough to drive potentially excellent films into all-out underwhelmingness. However, in this case, underwhelmingness does not prevail, because as often as this adventure loses its thrills, it rarely, if ever loses enough compellingness to keep you very much invested, as well as a little entertained, thanks in part to the musical aspects, at least up to a certain point.\r\n\r\nThe film's soundtrack is flawed, having its repetitious bits that add to the blandness, as well as some overstylizing that doesn't really gel tonally, yet on the whole, this effort turns in plenty of decent tunes, including original ones, with Michael Brook delivering on a score that, outside of overstylized occasions, boasts a certain charming tastefulness, while Eddie Vedder taints his original alternative folk tunes with his trademark unappealingly overblown, or rather, \"vibratoverblown\" vocal style, but has more heart than he usually, and enough of it to provide some decent music, until the classic archived ditties enter to particularly color things up. Musically, this film is hardly impeccable, but it's moderately impressive, with visual aspects being decidedly more commendable, thanks in part to cinematography by Eric Gautier that, while not stellar, delivers on warm and inviting lighting, as well as on a certain scope that is both broad and intimate enough for you to feel immersed in this film's sense of adventure, or at least in this film's many colorful locations. On a visual level, the film is pretty memorable, not exactly having the sense of sweeping adventure that I was hoping for, but still enough cleverness to its celebrations of dynamic imagery for you to feel the progression in Christopher \"Alexander Supertramp\" McCandless' journey, and also be dazzled along the way, and when it comes to the substance that actually establishes this adventure, just about as much praising is due. Not much is unique about this dramatization of McClandless' story, though there's plenty of excessive material and inconsistency, thus much of the potential to this subject matter is left betrayed, but by no means obscured, as there is never any denying the thematic value, layered dramatic weight and, well, fair degree of fun to this tale about a young man's lively journey to a simpler life, which isn't to say that Sean Penn doesn't still constantly make sure that you don't forget about the compellingness of this story, at least as writer, turning in a script that, while fatty around the edges, boasts plenty of wit, as well as color to characterization which is thoughtfully handled enough to feel accessible. Inspiration is certainly with Penn when he puts his \"penn\" to paper (Get it?), and it's every bit as rich within Penn's direction, which feels a bit too ambitious and steady for its own good, but livens things up to a certain degree with such stylistic touches as snappy plays with Jay Cassidy's sharp editing, as well as clever filming sensibilities that compliment the tonal layers of this environment-driven opus, when its not putting its hearty meditativeness to good use by soaking up the depths of this intimate character study, especially when we come to a powerful ending. The deliberate pacing to Penn's storytelling definitely does not always work, but when it does, it draws you into this very human tale, almost as much as the acting, something that is consistently strong in this star-studded flick, whose supporting cast members deliver on plenty of charisma to help in making their colorful character memorable, while leading man Emile Hirsch carries the film in his thoroughly charismatic and convincing portrayal of a good-hearted, spirited and bright, if a tad misguided young man who will face many changes, both expected and unexpected, on a challenging adventure that will bring him the richest of insight into the depths of both humanity and the world itself. There are plenty of shortcomings to this dramatic adventure which could have been and perhaps should have been more, but for every misstep, there is a strength, some of which offer glimpses into what could have been, and most all of which go into making the final product a generally rewarding experience.\r\n\r\nWhen the adventure is finally done, this promising drama feels limited in originality, and is rich with focal inconsistency, excessive dragging, - made all the more glaring by atmospheric bland spells - and overambition, until it ultimately falls short of what it could have been and almost into underwhelmingness, which is ultimately battled back enough by a decent soundtrack, lovely cinematography and locations, and a worthwhile story - brought to life by clever writing, thoughtful direction and strong acting - for \"Into the Wild\" to stand as an often entertaining, sometimes moving and consistently compelling tribute to Christopher \"Alexander Supertramp\" McCandless, a spirited young man of the world.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Wow! The film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, jumping back and forth between McCandless' time spent in Alaskan wilderness and his two-year travels leading up to his journey to Alaska.  Around May of 1990, Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated with high honors from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly afterwards, McCandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents, donates his life savings and cut ties with his family and friends taking a journey across several states culminating in Alaska. He assumes the name Alexander Supertramp and along his incredible journey he makes friends with different individuals that teach him about life and he teaches them as well in very special ways. I felt so much sympathy and understanding for Alexander but as he learned in his journey nature can be very challenging, even more so than society. Of course a 20 something does not know that, it takes maturity and years of living to understand life. After finding an abandoned bus in Alaska and turning it into his campsite life for McCandless becomes harder and he becomes less discerning. As his supplies begin to run out, he realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring. In the pain of realization Alexander concludes that true happiness can only be found when shared with others and seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED with a great soundtrack and its on Netflix HD.",

            "content": "Into The Wild is a well-acted and well-written drama that, despite some excellent direction from director Sean Penn, could have benefitted from being an hour shorter. It stars Emile Hirsch as Chris McCandless, a recent college grad born to wealthy and fairly snobbish parents. Chris doesn't want to live like his family and friends do, and decides to truly experience the essence of life by literally abandoning all of his possessions and wealth to spend two years living alone in the wilderness. Aside from the occasional group of people he encounters, Chris is on his own to enjoy the beauties of the natural world while also surviving amongst the harsher elements. He dreams of ending up in Alaska by the end of his trip, but to do that he has to overcome countless obstacles. To say the movie is slow-paced would be the understatement of the year, and the movie's two and a half hours feels almost endless. Still, there's a sort of beauty in the cinematography and narration that makes it enjoyable enough and at the very least tolerable in its less eventful stretches. Emile Hirsch also elevates the movie with his lively portrayal of McCandless, who is admirable as a character despite having a bit of a superiority complex and overly idealistic expectations about nature. He believes that what he is doing makes him better than his parents, when in reality his trip could just as easily be the product of extreme naivety. Sean Penn does everything he can to maintain some variety in the movie by interspersing it with narration by McCandless' sister and the occasional montage, but the movie's length is definitely its downfall. If you can tolerate its slow storytelling though, Into The Wild has a lot to offer as a road movie and strong evidence of Emile Hirsch's acting ability, not to mention Sean Penn's surprising talent for directing.",

            "content": "For those of us who ever wondered what it would be like to survive off nothing but the land itself, the film adaptation of the book 'Into the Wild' is a unique look into one man's journey through the wilderness to get more in touch with nature. Based on the true life story of Emory University graduate Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch), the film follows his travels, from hitchhiking to working odds and ends jobs across the country until he reaches the wide open spaces of Alaska. Hirsch, who proves to be an underrated actor, does a credible job portraying a character who wants nothing of the world he grew up in, severing all ties with his family, friends and privileged life for a chance to find freedom. Through his journal writings, McCandless (or \"Alexander Supertramp\" as he goes by after his so-called rebirth) describes the life of a young man who is struggling to find his true identity, and the greatness of Alaska represents a sort of Fountain of Youth, an El Dorado for him to reach. But once he gets there, he is overcome, McCandless starts to unravel into a shadow of his former self. Sean Penn does an excellent job directing the film, which is aided very much by the beautiful, picturesque landscapes of this country's greatest natural wonders. And while it is a little on the long side, 'Wild' never feels like it's overstaying its welcome among the audience. Some of the more interesting moments in 'Wild' come when McCandless forms friendships with people who help him along his journey. This is a bit ironic, as at one point, he makes a remark about life not being about relationships humans have with each other, but instead it is about relationships they have with nature. In the face of all the depressing themes confronted in 'Into the Wild,' it is a remarkable story that is brought to life thanks to solid storyline and top notch acting.",

I know I should just review the movie at hand, but I can't help but also comment on what this guy really did.\nThe movie itself is pretty schizophrenic. I found it confusing, at times, to figure out the order of things. I had to piece it together in my mind after turning the movie off. \nIt's a very quiet film. There's no crazy drama or heart-stopping action scenes. Just a contemplative journey by a young fellow who thought he knew better then everyone around him. I can relate to this. Or at least part of it. People ARE far too reliant on technology. People DO need to get \"back to nature\" and understand this world we live in more. It's just the way he did this goes against all common sense. Especially for such a smart guy. He was so determined to get away from it all, that he threw sense out the window. There's nothing wrong with wanting to go on an Alaskan adventure. Just BE PREPARED. Honestly, He's an idiot for not doing this, and paid the ultimate price.\nEmile Hirsch is the only character that counts here and he does a fantastic job. I still don't think he's the world's greatest actor or anything , but he certainly gained a lot of respect from me with this role. \nEveryone else play their parts just fine. Especially the trippy dippy hippies played by Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker. I tell ya, that life looks like torture to me, though. I just don't get how anyone could live like that. *shivers*\nThen there's the total lack of respect for his family. He couldn't even send them an anonymous postcard letting them know he was ok? It never occurred to him how much worry and stress they would be going through? I get the rough life he had growing up, but come on. That was a dick move right there.\nI did like the movie, and being a very thoughtful, contemplative person myself, I could relate to Christopher in many ways. I just found it to be a bit too long, and a tad disjointed. \n\nafterthought: I've never been a huge Pearl jam/Eddie Vedder fan, and that didn't didn't change after watching this, but I did think his music fit the movie well. The main theme was pretty decent. I'm glad they(Penn?) didn't try and shoehorn some bold and brassy Hollywood type soundtrack on to it. Good call, Penn.",

Call it hero-worship or something or other but let's view this as a film- you can criticise the character in the film all you like and that should be part of the experience but I feel that, since this is based on a real person, many critics have fixated on that and allowed it to skew how they view the film- this doesn't need to be seen as a tribute to anyone. It's a film where a man rightly or wrongly embarks on a tremendously dangerous and exciting journey. This film documents that journey and its impact with great emotional depth and the end result is charming, touching, thought-provoking, and everything else you could ask for in a film. I accept that this one is maybe more for the introverts if I can make such crass generalisations but it has to be said that Penn outdid himself here whether it's your cup of emotional drama or not.  Maybe it's a love or hate thing, Marmite or something, I dunno but I'm certainly on the love side.\n\nIt's not without its faults though- I've already explained why I take issue with many of the criticisms of this film that are based around its treatment of the protagonist but that doesn't mean that I don't think such things could have been avoided. There does seem to be a lack of depth to the events outside of McCandless' life and his own head and, while his experience was a solitary one, the viewer might be left wishing for a little more than they're shown here. It's hard to cover a person's life without the film simply becoming that person though so it's hard to say how much of a fault  that really is. Regardless, it does what it sees on the tin and it does it well.",

And in a small but integral role, Hal Holbrook stuns as Ron, a man willing to give McCandless the structure he needs but does not desire. Sean Penn's direction is flawless, and hearing Eddie Vedder's grown on the soundtrack helps to show that, given the right circumstances, movies still mean something.",

He wants to escape from a greedy, capitalist society as a way of discovering himself. The people he meets are finely developed characters but Chris learns nothing from their interactions; he has a profound effect on them, then somehow is able to abandon their relationship without caring. I saw a character that is too weak to deal with his problems, instead choosing to run away into the wilderness where he has little chance of surviving or finding a purpose. \n\nThe message is clear but to me not inspiring. This film is all about character, it tries to force one opinion on us, Penn desperately wants us to like Chris. We're supposed to think that he is rebellious, intelligent, imaginative and daring. If you step back and think for a second, you see a pointless story about a clueless boy with a dangerous obsession.",

            "content": "Into the wild is the story of Christopher McCandless and his rejection of money, possessions, family and friends to pursue a life of isolation, travel and freedom into the wild.   \n\nThe story is an interesting one.  I find it insightful and inspiring.  I myself have wanted to something very similar on many occasions, just \"down tools\" and take to the road.  The amazing places that McCandless visits are highlighted by the stunning cinematography, thanks to \u00c9ric Gautier.  \nFrom around the middle of the film the audience start to realize that McCandless is quite selfish and he is as much running away from his previous life as he is running towards his new one.  I myself began to lose interest in the character a little at this point.  I found it so ironic that he left in search of happiness in isolation away from all people, but finds that \"happiness is only real when shared\".  He finds out a great deal about forgiveness and relationships with people, but needed to spend 2 months in isolated Alaska and kill a Moose in order to find this out.  \n\nThis revelation is very much at the end of the film and it seems to take a rather long time to get to this point.  Although exciting and fresh the story gets old quickly and just goes on and on.  It also starts to jump backwards and forwards in time which can get pretty confusing.\n\nThe film is carried along by Emile Hish (Milk, Speed Racer, The Girl Next Door) who plays his part well and was a good choice for this role.  Jenna Malone (The Ruins, Suckerpunch) and Kristen Stewart (pre-Twilight saga) are both convincing in their roles and feel that they are both stars of the future with bigger and better things ahead of them. \n\nIt was also nice to see Hal Holbrook (who played Ron Franz) I know he was pretty good in Water For Elephants, which was released 4 years after Into The Wild, but I can't remember the last time I saw him in a film before this.  Wall Street?  The Fog?  Either way, I enjoyed his part in the film and found Mr. Franz to be the most touching character of all.  (If you are interested in Hal Holbrook he has about 4 projects lined up for release over the next 12 months, Lincoln to mention just 1, so watch this space).  \n\nIn conclusion; the story was intriguing and moving in places, the Cinematography was beautiful, the acting wasn't bad either but it was too long, became boring in places and its easy to dislike the main character.  All things considered I think it was pretty average overall.",

To some, \"Into the Wild\" will come off as another pretentious and irksome 'hippie' flick, but to most, it will resonate and strike an inspirational chord. It wholeheartedly captures the desire a lot of people have to just up and take a break from their lives; to ditch the constraints of society and go to a place where there aren't any rules to hold them back from what they want to do. There are moments of self-indulgence in \"Into the Wild,\" which comes as no real surprise, and director Sean Penn employs the tired tactic of 'breaking the fourth wall' one time too many, but it's the film's message that trumps all. To me, it's the definition of a true American film.",

He despises them. He sees the world through  Tyler Durden's lens, he refuses to believe that relationships are the core of life and says that life is everywhere and in everything. True. This is something he later discards and he realise that true happiness is best enjoyed when it is shared.\n\nThe movie has tons of merits, the direction which is sterling, the non linear storyline keeps you working hard to follow and sometimes messes you up a beat. but it is good for such an important film as it makes one want to view the movie again.\n\nAlex throughout the movie and in his life, because of his authenticity and commitment to his cause, touches many lives, of all age groups, gender, socio-economic standing, he is a magnetic force of nature, but he is equally challenged by his new friends to not be tough on life, his parents, to stop thinking too much, and these challenges haunt him towards the end of his life and makes a journal entry to reflect this.\n\nThe music reinforces the major themes of the movie and the casting helps as well in the story, Catherine Keener is quiet a screen stealer and William Hurt although he inhabits less screen but he draws you in and makes you suffer with him. his eyes says it all. In the beginning of the movie he looks quiet arrogant, notice him in the graduation ceremony after his son leaps to the stage, he wants to slap him, and when he speaks of buying his son a new car, he calls his son's car a \"Junker\",  but the unpronounceable hurt, guilt he sustains during the departure of his son reduces him to his knees. I grieved with him.\n\nThere is so much more that can be said about this movie all of it beautiful.\n\nHighly recommended",
