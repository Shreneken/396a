The very sight of Eddie Murphy simultaneously in drag and a fat suit is supposed to cause viewers to explode into paroxysms of laughter, and is topped only by his appearance in yellow-face as old Mr. Wong. Some of the most egregiously awful jokes fail so badly the first time (broken bed sex, Rasputia crammed into her compact car) that they're brought back for encores. In one way, it's surprising that the movie is so consistently unfunny. This is a movie that even Murphy's most die hard fans should avoid, for others a root canal would be a funnier time spent.

Norbit takes the idea behind The Nutty Professor 2 - that Eddie Murphy can play just about every character in the movie - and strips it of all charm and humor. This movie belongs to the much-loved sub-genre of comedies called \"unfunny.\" It's crass, cruel, and borderline offensive, but the laughs that could redeem all of that are missing. Material as bad as the tripe that comprises Norbit can be endured only if there's a payoff. In this case, the point seems to be that some actors will do anything for a buck. Murphy doesn't do any acting in Norbit. This is all shtick - the kind of stuff that might work in a five-minute skit on Saturday Night Live. Norbit is a supersized version of Steve Urkel.  Norbit operates on the principle that vulgarity is automatically funny. Crassness doesn't need a joke attached because it is (in and of itself) the height of hilarity.

I laughed my ass off throughout, the artificial obesity created for Eddie Murphy when pretending to be a fatass woman is quite convincing and much like in Coming to America the filmmakers do a good job of doing the Back to the Future II thing where the same actor plays two characters in the same scene without having to focus the camera on one person at a time and then editing them together. I really believed that a fat woman jumped on her husband to have sex. No sarcasm, there. It doesn't look like awkward green screen. While it is forgettable and occasionally racist, I still think that Norbit will be seen in a more positive light by fans of Eddie Murphy. This may very well be one of the guiltiest pleasures I have had the guilt of being pleasured by...why did that sound a lot funnier in my head than when I actually typed that in?",

Once Kate returns into his life, however, he hopes to make his feelings for her known. He briefly uses some profanity and he is also the main protagonist of the movie. \n\nEddie Murphy also plays Rasputia who is Norbit's mean, self-centered, and extremely obese wife who constantly belittles him and she occasionally gets violent with him. She has an affair with her local aerobics instructor Buster who is played by Marlon Wayans. She uses some profanity and she is also the main antagonist of the movie. \n\nEddie Murphy also plays Mr. Wong who is the racist Asian restaurant owner who also runs an orphanage where he raised Norbit and Kate among others.",

The whole film is basically her eating, harassing him, and acting extremely stupid. Somewhere in here, Norbit and his childhood friend try to save the orphanage they grew up in from Terry Crews and his muscle displaying henchmen.\nNorbit is an awful film, and just by its first word, it's bad, because I noticed Eddie's \"nerdy\" voice and hell was unleashed. His new wife is extremely unfunny, as well as all the jokes. Norbit is also extremely boring because its plotline is practically nothing except a \"We've got to save the ___\" clich√© in a ton of movies.
