Also looking for Moss is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), an aging lawman who reflects on a changing world and a dark secret of his own, as he tries to find and protect Moss.",

Each individual seems to be playing both roles at all times, which felt fresh and it makes one question who's the hunter and who's the hunted. The Coen Brothers are some of the best directors of our time and this 2007 best picture winner proves it. Their use of silence is so deafening and they use the west Texas setting to its fullest extent, capturing both the beauty, and the harshness the desolate landscape holds. Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh has to rank up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter on a bone chilling level, and this is without a doubt Bardem's career defining performance. There is just so much I love about this film. The acting, the script, the suspense, the kills its all just great. Even though personally this isn't my favorite Coen Brothers film, (Fargo, Big Lebowski, Blood Simple), it is still fantastic and must see.",

Tiene una trama excelente, destaco que desde el primer momento, al menos a mi, me mantuvo bien pendiente y sorprendido con cada cosa que iba pasando. La cinta se encarga de inducir al espectador en sensación de peligro, y la actuación de Javier Bardem la hace aun mas disfrutable. Verdaderamente te crees que el personaje de Bardem es un tipo que está loco pero tiene sus principios y los sigue de forma muy recta. En cuanto a las otras actuaciones están bastante bien, como por ejemplo Tommy Lee Jones y Woody Harrelson, pero el que mas se logra destacar entre todos los demás es Josh Brolin. Siento que desperdiciaron un poco al personaje de Woody Harrelson, me gusto lo poco que apareció pero sentía que podía dar mucho mas; y por otro lado no me gusto el ritmo lento que maneja la trama y todas las escenas del personaje de Tommy Lee Jone. En conclusión, es una película que tenes ver si querés ejemplos de una cinta con buenas actuaciones y buenas escenas sin tanto dialogo que pueda mantenerte pegado a la pantalla. Muy recomendada.",

            "content": "I have watched No Country for Old Men three times, and I would like to share my opinion of the film. Directed and written by Joel and Ethan Coen, No Country for Old Men was released back in 2007 with a budget of 25 million dollars. The movie is based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel with the same name. The film itself is a neo-western film that is rich in philosophic concepts. It is more of an experience than a movie. Every watch through left me staring off into the dark in awe. I've always been left with more questions than answers. It is an armchair philosopher's dream. \n\nThe film takes place in Texas; it follows three men whose stories are all connected in some way. The first man is a sheriff named Ed Tom Bell. He feels as if the world around him is much more violent than it was in his father's day. Anton Chigurh strangles a deputy and kills a man on the highway for his car. Meanwhile, a hunter by the name of Llewelen Moss comes across a drug deal gone wrong. There he finds a suitcase filled with money. Down on his luck, he steals the suitcase and becomes entangled within this hunt for the suitcase. The hunter becomes the hunted as Anton Chigurh begins to track him, always hot on his heels.  \n\nThe most surprising feature of the film is the minimal dialogue and lack of soundtrack. After my first watch through, I was surprised to find this out. What takes the place of a soundtrack is the sound of wind. Personally, I never noticed this detail until my second watch. This choice of design adds to the seriousness of the movie almost to the point that an actual soundtrack would take so much away from the movie. It makes the movie feel real, almost as if I've been allowed to be a spectator in the lives of these three men. It allows you to be in the moment; the silence at times makes you feel as though Anton Chigurh is right there with you hunting both you and Llewelen. Furthermore, the minimal dialogue forces the actors to express more with their bodies and facial expressions. Instead of telling us exactly how they are thinking or what they are feeling we are forced to place ourselves in their shoes and pick up on context clues and body language.  \n\nThere is so much to unpack with this movie that there is something for everyone. From the philosophical preaching's of the Sherriff to the cinematography. Every little bit of No Country for Old Men just begs for you to analyze it. I give this movie 5/5 stars. The acting, the writing, and everything about this film exceeds expectations. I could not recommend this movie enough. This isn't a movie you sit down to watch one time. I would suggest you sit down and take the time to soak everything in. This movie isn't something to be devoured like most content in the modern era.  It's a fine wine meant to be savored and enjoyed. Maybe you don't get all the notes and nuances from your first glass, but every glass after, you will find something new and deeper.",

Ultimately, this is a story of the passage of time - the escalating nature of humanity and the difficulty of acceptance. Now, No Country obviously takes this to the nth degree with the pure evil of its antagonist not only to entertain but also to prove its point, but the way it hits its points so squarely makes this movie near universally understandable and watchable. The Coen Brothers make sure to go only a few moments without something that demands your attention for nearly 2 hours and it's a marvel.",

One could easily imagine the Cormac McCarthy novel coming to life in front of them, duly preserving in cinematic form all of the peculiarly haunting qualities of the source's dialogue and tone. McCarthy's novels are darkly poetic and stubbornly ambiguous; willfully omitting easy clarification of potentially important plot points in favor of establishing even more critical emphases on the guiding, underlying themes. The Coen's film is true to each one of these qualities, despite the potential temptation to offer easy accessibility and resolution. They amplify, in their own innovative way, the very elements which make McCarthy's work so absorbing, disturbing and enigmatic. While this is not a film for the faint of heart, it will surely strike any serious aficionado of the Coen's as one of their most stirring and masterful works.",

Listen, that's probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt, but 'No Country for Old Men' is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for me.\n\nI will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever, they are all fantastic. Javier Bardem is awesome, easily the star, and Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are all top value. Kelly Macdonald and Garret Dillahunt are also involved, I like them too. Stephen Root, Mr. 'L for Love' himself, as well. Away from the onscreen bunch, the cinematography is superb.\n\nIt's the story. I didn't get what I wanted from it, at all. All the ingredients are there for a 10/10 film, that's the level I was expecting it to reach based on the opening half or so. The second half though... super disappointing! So many underwhelming choices. Such a waste of a strong cast... 'The Counselor'-esque. Bardem is also in that, sorry my dude!\n\nThe fact I'm still giving this what I consider to be a positive rating shows how much the conclusion frustrated me. This had top tier written all over it but it somehow messed it up as it went by... and I'm not usually one to dig out a film's ending.\n\nIn my defence, even some reviews (many, in fact) from people who love the film mention that the ending isn't perfect so I guess it just comes down to how the final moments sit with you.

I think I would've preferred more music than they had and Chigurh debasing the gas station man via rudeness was perhaps more uncomfortable to watch than intended, but otherwise my only knock is that the awards people didn't recognize Brolin as having a great performance too -- he played the role of mustache-wielder exceptionally well!",

Javier Bardem is flawless in this portrayal of the epitome of someone who might resemble the looks of a male Madusa. I've seen this scene countless times, and always seem to fine something fascinating as this all plays out. What makes this whole scene as mesmerizing as it develops, is the superb attention to detail and the minute and subtle inflections and props, which are all great acting tools that Bardem musters up to project the chilling vibes that evoke fear and trepidation. And yet, we must reciprocally commend Gene Jones - the recipient of Bardem's terrorizing aura - to complete the successful eliciting of every nerve racking moment. And yet, there is even more diversity of emotion packed into this bone chilling experience. Bardem uses so successfully props and quips. A rather gruesome smile, as he states he could come back later. The slipping in a piece of candy that seems to punctuate or emphasize his or Jones comments - making this scene looking like it was a natural, realistic event pulled right out of a time capsule. This isn't an acting scene - one might think - but something that actually happened in a day in the life of a notorious and brutally crime minded individual. Note, that this is not a monolog of verbal intimidation, but also gestures that totally enhance the effect of a hair-raising interaction - as though comprable to meeting the grim reaper himself.",

So why do I call it a flawed masterpiece rather than a masterpiece full stop? Well actually right up to the last twenty minutes, the film was the latter rather than the former. If the last twenty minutes had not felt like a completely different movie, it would've stayed like that. As is the case with all the Coen Brothers' movies, No Country for Old Men is very well made with impressive cinematography, editing and settings. The story is compelling, the direction superb and the script most of the time taut, funny, thrilling and exciting. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent in this film, but if I have to give an award to best performance of the film, it would be Javier Bardem in a villainous role that is menacing and chillingly effective. Overall, a great movie but due to the final twenty minutes it just loses out to that extra something. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The casting choices were on point as every single actor/actress delivers their role to basically perfection. Javier Bardem is spectacular in the role of Anton and his performance is chilling.\n\nThis is a slow film. The pacing is very slow, but who says that's a bad thing? The way this film unfolds in front of your eyes is astonishing and it is so intriguing that you won't want to look away. But once it gets going, it gets GOING. My heart rate was dangerously fast and my mind was working over time and I enjoyed every single second of it. The Coen brothers struck gold with this one because wow I'm absolutely in love (being not a fan of Fargo).\n\nThe cinematography is not the best. It's a little bland and not extremely notable but then again they're basically in a desert where it's only brown and a little bit of green so I understand that there is not much to work with.

            "content": "What can I say about this film? It has to be one the Coen Brothers' most accomplished works even by today's standards, and hear me out: these people did Fargo. How can you top Fargo? With a relentless Javier Bardem and a bolt gun, would be a good answer. What a rollercoaster.\nThe film follows the misadventures of a Southern welder, Llewelyn Moss who comes across the site where a drug deal gone wrong took place. Next to the site itself, a briefcasse filled to the brim with 2 million dollars. Llewelyn wastes no chance and takes the briefcase. He doesn't understand that by doing this, he automatically becomes the target of a relentless psychopathic hitman named Anton Chigurh, who has to retrieve the briefcase no matter what, and that also means Llewelyn's death. Along with them, a sheriff close to retiring, who seems to always be a step behind on his attempt to find out about the cat and mouse hunt happening between the aforementioned characters. \nWhen watching this movie, you cannot help but feel a sense of dread, almost existensial. Something about the run down environment, the tired, dissapointed characters, their cold psychology, it is rather off putting. A great way to introduce the audience to the brutality of the situation. And that kind of narrows down the whole idea and theme of the movie: pessimism, nihilism, the fulitlity of this world, luck, or chance, and even destiny. Anton (masterfully played by Javier Bardem in an unforgetable way, worthy of the Oscar he won) blatantly showcases the theme of chance with the coin flipping scenes. He always seems to be the Angel of Death to the people who even dare to accidentally greet him, he doesn't sympathize with anyone, he's cold hearted, he does not care for nothing but his mission. That doesn't mean that he doesn't have principles though, the murder of his victims is entirely based on a coin flip, on luck, and that is what makes him quite possibly the most chilling and realistic psychopath. He has his own set of rules based on chance, but no remorse at all. Just check out the coin flipping scene at the gas store and you will understand. \nIn the end, we cannot even know the fate of the characters, instead we are given a rather ambiguous ending that also proves the futility of the situation and the nihilism, the idea that nothing has meaning in this world. But i'm gonna stop now because the whole film deserves to be analyzed either by you, the viewer alone, or in a university thesis for a Master's Degree. Let's check out the more interesting parts.\nFirst of all, the film is replete with quotable scenes and dialogue. I could go around and quote the Gas Station scene, The Car Scene, the dialogue between Carla Jean/ Carson Wells and Anton for hours at a time. Let's not forget the tense, terrfying scenes at the motel and the showdown down the road, they sent chills down my spine. Next, the acting, the direction and the screenplay (imma put them all in one category), to say they are immaculate would be an understatement, to say that they are perfect would be an understatement, to say that they are a landmark in the history of cinema would also an understatement. Such careful and tense direction. What an amazing screenplay written with care. The cast, even the smallest role, are doing an amazing job. \nThe editing is wonderful, the cinematography is brilliant, giving the scenery a bleak, brooding feel. The absence of music is also a major trick that enhances the experience and makes it realistic.\nEverything, is wonderful, I have nothing bad to say. Alright, maybe the ending was a touch unsatisfactory, but I can understand that it was a part of the story and could not be changed. Other than that, No Country For Old Men is a breathtaking exploration of themes such as the American Dream, nihilism, chance and pessimism, with a powerhouse of performances, particularly that of Bardem, to whom I give ample praise. Please step out of the car sir...",

At first, the film presents itself as a classic \"cat and mouse\" story, which must have been very well done judging by the film's reputation, but as the facts unfold and the directors' actions it is evident that they are trying to escape than is expected. A great example of this is the scene in which Josh Brolin's character is murdered, omitting the confrontation takes the film out of the hunting stereotype. Some people may not have liked the ending, I'll admit that right after the movie I thought so too, but then you realize that the movie was a metaphor for aging, where the real protagonist is the character of Tommy Lee Jones and the idea is how time is passing, things are changing and he is lagging behind. I admit that the ending is something very important to say how much I liked a movie, but this one, even though it's different than expected, can't replace the entire development, which is excellent, in particular the character of Javier Bardem, who plays a psychopath from bright and realistic way. He manages to make the viewer feel fear and insecurity in a spectacular way, I dare say that he is one of the best and coldest villains in cinema. In short, it's a very good film, with magnificent performances and final that may or may not please the viewer, but that doesn't overwhelm all the previous narrative construction.",

Every time Chigurh is on scene you never know whether he will commit some atrocity, or whether he will spare a potential victim. He also has a ghost-like quality that makes him seem almost otherworldly. Llewelyn's character is also fantastically written as a Vietnam vet who is just trying to survive, using his skills to try and be one step ahead of a cold-blooded killer. \n\nAnd now comes the complaints:\nThis movie, while based on the book, has one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing endings I've ever seen. Yes, that seems like hyperbole, but it really is a deflated and drab ending to an otherwise fantastic movie. At one point in the film Llewelyn says to Chigurh over the phone that he's \"going to make a special project out of you.\" One would expect that this would end with a battle of wits and endurance, but instead fizzles out with no real catharsis on either end. I'm sure this was the point of the story, in order to illustrate some dogma about how greed and vengeance cause downfalls, but cinematically it just makes the movie deflate at a time when it should be ending with a bang. \n\nI really love about 80% of this movie, but the final act is just so disappointing that it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and I feel pretty let down considering how amazing every other aspect of the movie is.

But in the process they produce a film that is deeply affecting. \n\nBrilliant in its cinematography, it's the climatic opposite to Fargo. In No Country for Old Men you see and feel the searing, sapping dry heat of the USA, Mexico desert border, as opposed to the desolate, freezing snowy winter landscapes of Southern Minnesota in Fargo. \n\nIf you're lucky enough not to have already seen it then do so soon.

            "content": "The Coen brothers have always been very special filmmakers. With The Big Lebowski and Fargo, they were already responsible for two films that had already a very strong and positive influence on society. Nothing else applies to No Country For Old Men. The crime thriller, which is very reminiscent of the Western genre, won four Oscars in 2008, including the Coen brothers for their directing and the film itself for Best Picture. The plot is about how a pensioner steals money from a cartel after a massacre in the desert and goes on the run after an attempted murder against him. In the process, he is pursued by a psychopathic hitman who is after much more than the stolen money. A veteran sheriff sets out on a trail parallel to this event.\n\nOne of the many highlights of this film are the acting performances. Josh Brolin plays the fugitive protagonist Llewelyn Moss. He thrills especially in the tense scenes when it is a matter of life or death for his character. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell appears least often throughout the film and seems irrelevant for a long time, until he shows all his class at the end by losing himself in monologues that are unexpectedly profound and meaningful. Javier Bardem, however, absolutely stands out as the serial killer and pursuer of Moss, Anton Chigurh. His character is enormously intriguing despite his one-dimensionality. When he repeats himself several times in dialogues with potential victims and you don't know whether he's going to pull the trigger or not, it gives the film countless unpredictable and teeth-grinding moments.\n\nFor long stretches, No Country for Old Men feels like a thriller that leaves all possible outcomes open. The ending is then a little surprising and even seems inadequate at first. But if you think about it for a while, you realise that the Coen brothers have given the film a very sociocritical background. It is pessimistic, but realistic. How you interpret it is ultimately up to you. But when you become aware of this very subtle message, the bizarre ending suddenly makes much more sense. This realisation, the strong acting, the terrific camera work and much more make No Country for Old Men one of the most important and fascinating films of the 2000s.",

But other than the point of \"old man sheriff sees his world inevitably changing in ways he doesn't like so he decides to disengage with society and finish the rest of his years in peace,\" what are we supposed to take away from this story? Greed got Moss and his wife killed. Moss tried to show compassion to the guy dying in the truck by bringing him water and that's kind of how his unfortunate adventure got started. So is the lesson of Moss's character supposed to be that doing nice things for strangers can be dangerous? Chigurh showed he had no capacity to change who he was. He would kill anyone with no hesitation. Is he supposed to represent evil? Is the lesson that the evil of humanity can't be stopped or fixed?

With their twelfth feature, the Coen Brothers crafted a mesmerizing western that holds up today as a modern classic. Using captivating cinematography, the Coen Brothers draw viewers into a desolate world of violence. From intimate close-ups to gorgeous establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's western setting. The Coen Brothers' decision to work without a traditional musical score is risky, but it works tremendously. The absence of music gives the film a tense and eerie atmosphere that keeps viewers engrossed. As usual, the Coen Brothers draw excellent performances from their cast. Javier Bardem delivers one of the best performances of his career as Anton Chigurh. With frightening expressions, he conveys the cruelty, intelligence and remorseless nature of a psychopathic killer. The supporting cast, which includes the heartbreaking Tommy Lee Jones, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"No Country for Old Men\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from an ambiguous ending. After building nail-biting tension for two hours, the Coen Brothers end the film on an anti-climactic note that leaves viewers with questions. Nevertheless, fans of the Coen Brothers will definitely enjoy \"No Country for Old Men\" and so will movie-goers seeking taut entertainment. At a time when nihilism is rarely depicted in films, it's a cautionary reminder of the dangers posed by psychopathic killers in the modern world.",

In this film, a war veteran in Texas Llewellyn (Josh Brolin) discovers a satchel of money in a heroin exchange gone wrong. Meanwhile, stoic Mexican convict Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) escapes from prison and follows his trails to kill him, leaving no stone unturned. While this happens, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) investigates the scene of the crime and laments about the progressively violent and worsening crime in society. Like most Coen pictures, the premise is about a character who enters the world of crime in suburban America only to have a dark and depressing resolution. Also, the brothers blend together the Sam Peckinpah-style violence with quirky, dry, tongue-and-cheek humor. However, No Country, albeit similar to Fargo, is more visually impressive, showing ugly scuff marks on floors, punctures on walls, scratches on the air ventilation pipes, blood on sand and gunshot wounds on skin to match with the gruesome violence or Roger Deakins's crisp, oily and often natural camerawork to emulate the film's gritty and brutally realistic tone. Also, more striking than their previous work, The Coens choose to disclude Carter Burwell's score, aside from the end credits. The disturbing absence of music, another realistic touch, creates tension and builds up Anton's quiet, calculated presence, resulting in unexpected, jolting sound cues. As far as thrillers are concerned No Country for Old Men is the best Coen Brothers film I've seen, aside from Fargo, True Grit, Barton Fink, Burn After Reading and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. \n\n(5 First Aid Kits from Mike Voss Pharmacy out of 5)",

And as rampant as this carnage is, you can't take your eyes off the screen.  \n\nThe story is an extremely intense one.  Texas local  Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert.  Amid a bevy of dead bodies, he discovers a suitcase with two million dollars in it.  He decides to take the money for himself, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to outrun a psychopathic assassin named Anton Shigurh (Javier Bardem).  Both actors turn in incredible performances.  Bardem's Shigurh is as mesmerizing as he is evil.  He speaks very little, and when he does, you can't help but hang on every word.  He is an intense crazy that you won't soon forget.\n\nAs Shigurh increases his body count during his hunt for Moss and the cash, local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to discover what in the heck is going on in his west Texas town, and what his future in this violent world is going to be.   The film is a magnificent look into lost innocence.  It is as sinister as it is dreary and it's certainly not a movie for everyone, but I found myself spellbound and thinking about it for days after viewing.",

The minimal music and at times dialogue means the sound of foot steps become more terrifying. Bardem assassin starts by killing a cop and he will do anything and kill anyone to get what he wants. We have many gorgeous and slow scenes of the countryside as Josh Brolin find a bloodbath involving drugs and finds money. The way Bardem moves, walking slowly and barely a flicker of emotion is a credit to a great character he has created. A well deserved Oscar win. The violence when it happens is very graphic and some will find this hard to watch. Much of the suspense is with Bardem closing in on Josh Brolin. The hotel scene where Brolin has got another room knowing many people are after him is suspenseful. Another scene as Bardem chases and shoots at Brolin through the streets is very raw. Again the sound of gun fire, footsteps is all we here and for much of it we can't see Bardem, as windows are shot out. Well directed more terrifying if we dont see him. Brolin's naivety taking the money and putting everyone around him in danger even the luckless hotel staff is something that feels is necessary. Tommy Lee Jones sheriff is close to retirement and this case feels like it wears him out including where he find the bloodbath at the hotel. Is he getting too old or has the west become more violent? The film is well directed using locations really well and creating tension throughout knowing Bardem is on our tale. The minimal dialogue shows that money and violence are the only things important. A film that won many well deserved Oscars.",

The ending seemed abrupt and not much was resolved, characters were killed without seeming to have fulfilled their full purpose, and *Spoiler Alert* the bad guy gets away. I was left puzzled by this conclusion and struggled to figure out what sheriff Ed Tom Bell's (Tommy Lee Jones) final lines meant, about the dream and his father. To understand them I had to look back to the very beginning, to the title actually, which describes what the movie's really about— a hostile land where there are no rules, like the old west, where the strongest and cleverest man is the victor. But it's also a real world, one of coincidence where things just happen for no reason at all. Events are not formulated to come out in a certain way to satisfy the viewer and in that the story mirrors real life. So what Bell is saying is that it's tough to live in this world and even tougher when you're weighed down by age. Life just seems to get harder as it goes on for these characters, until it ends, and for many people that's the way life is. You can never see what's coming, it may be the discovery of a bag of money or a car zipping around the corner. The characters in the movie are aware of chance as a driving factor in their lives. Anton Chigurh, played with perfect viciousness by Javier Bardem, flips a coin to let fate decide whether someone is going to live or die and he acts on what fate chooses. Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss is the opposite. He thinks he can take his life into his own hands after he's provided with a way of doing so, money, without acknowledging that it was chance that lead him to the money in the first place. He's wrong, of course, and must run for his life from the relentless Chigurh in one of the tensest chase sequences on film. In the end, Moss is never given a chance to reflect on the promising yet doomed hand he was dealt by fate. He's killed off screen, his body found by Bell in a motel, leaving us to wonder what ran through his mind before he died. We, along with poor Bell, are left with an unsolved case, the murderer still at large and all the loose ends left untied. Just as life is filled with coincidences it is also filled with mysteries, stories that just drop off, people that just disappear. We're left just to return to our own lives, face the problems we can solve, like Bell, and think about what happened. And that's the best thing a movie can do: make you think.",

This only enhances that feeling of helplessness that the characters feel, especially Jones' character Ed Tom Bell. He's living in a world that's moving too fast and he feels left behind. This only makes his ending monologue all the more touching. And Anton Chigurh is easily the most terrifying antagonist of any film I've seen. He's equal parts mythical and real, always on your trail no matter what. His character serves as the unforgiving landscape manifesting itself into something physical, something the protagonists aren't ready for.",

In every sense, this gritty mirroring drama of the western genre set in the 80s is purposefully and profoundly unfathomable. To be fair, most of the time it seems unfathomable, is because you are not revealed to what has happened or happening in that crime scene. And that's your exhibit A. This shocking therapy may not be advised but is evidently one of it's best element, where Coen Brothers are also using the game of thought provoking assumptions along with flabbergasting treats.\n\nExhibit B. The physical sequences. The awe inspiring aspect of the film is not only a challenge for the writer but also the director. Since not only it has to be an engaging but also crisp clean when it maps and runs on that track. There is very little the film expresses verbally and when it does, the monologues are usually whispering the gist of the action or describing the terror or emotional state of these characters. Now, in order to use these actions creatively and deeply resonating they have to use props, behavior and even the actions as an evolving arc.\n\nAnd in order to do so effectively and effortlessly- unlike these thoughts of mine about the film that are annoyingly filled with adjectives- they are using these elements with different perspective which leads to our final exhibit C. The props. Juggling with these three key elements and unearthly- or probably the most earthly- mortality wins, Coen Brothers marks their maturity on filmmaking and storytelling skills, especially in contrast to The Fargo who has more levity in its language then this thrilling horror. No Country For Old Men concerns for a common man tangled in an uncalled war, surviving, breathing and dreaming.",

            "content": "*Major Spoilers*\nI had to look up the hidden meaning behind this movie. The title actually had a correspondence to what happens but it is very subtle. I honestly did not notice it and was very confused by the ending. So first, I'll start with what I noticed in the movie. No Country for Old Men takes the outcomes of certain roles within a general western action movie and completely reverses them. First, there is the psychopathic killer that actually gets away. Even when Chigur runs into a stroke of bad luck, he still gets away. There is the \"hero\" that is merely just a thief and seems to be able to get away from the man hunting him down. He ends up dying by minor drug cartel goons while being caught off guard. Even the wife he wanted to protect in the end is killed by Chigur. In the middle of the movie, there is the appearance of a hitman that knows who Chigur is. He appears as someone that can really change the tide of the movie, but is immediately killed by Chigur. This change in outcomes makes the movie awfully realistic and a different movie from the rest.\nThe most interesting part of the movie is Chigur himself. He works in the same way as natural chaos in the world. His victims honestly have no idea that their last breaths are being taken as Chigur has a casual conversation with them then kills them haphazardly. Especially with Woody Harrelson, who you would assume Chigur would use as leverage is instantly killed by the wince of a shotgun.\nNow outside of the action of the movie, is a senior sheriff that is investigating the aftermath of Chigur. This old man is the sole reason of the title and s the most boring aspect of the film. Essentially, the sheriff is still used to the simple crimes of back in the day, where problems were between just two people and you could basically just talk through it. Nowadays, there are brutal crime scenes of a complete massacre and random destruction strewed about with little direction to where anything is going. The sheriff is perplexed by the fact that someone has even been using a compressed air cylinder to break into homes and even kill people. \"No Country for Old Men\" is as simple as that. The sheriff cannot keep up with the situation and is merely overwhelmed by the complexity and lethality of the people involved.",

            "content": "I don't usually like the Coen Brothers and I would consider Western films to be one of my least favorite genres but in between The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) and The Life of Emile Zola (1937) this was a welcome refresher. No, I don't think it should have won Best Picture, I prefer Atonement (2007), however I will admit it is an extremely enjoyable, tense film that features a great Javier Bardem performance and some wonderful Roger Deakins cinematography. This is not a film for everybody because it does contain graphic violence and you will have to have tolerance for the Coens' self satisfied dialogue.\n\nSociopathic hit man Anton Chigurh, Javier Bardem, is chasing Llewellyn Moss, Josh Brolin, who has stolen a briefcase of money from drug dealers he found in the desert. It quickly emerges that Chigurh simply enjoys murdering people and we see a myriad of victims be murdered in creative ways as he pursues the crafty Moss. Moss's wife Carla Jean, Kelly McDonald, has been sent to stay with her mother but her concern for her husband increases the longer he is gone and she reaches out to Sherriff Bell, Tommy Lee Jones, who she believes can protect Moss. \n\nNever let it be said that the Coens don't know how to blend comedy with graphic violence and you get a lot of that here. The whole film is essentially one long chase and the directors and the screenwriter know how to keep the story engaging and interesting even as the characters would be thoroughly dislikable in a flatter film. When we witness Moss desperately trying to pull the briefcase of money out of an air duct as the unstoppable force that is Chigurh approaches it was a nail-biting moment as well as being one that elicits nervous laughter. Even the dark penultimate scene of the film has an undertone of humor to it and although I was horrified I was also tittering to myself. This blend makes the film a really fun romp but is deceptively well constructed as it is incredibly difficult to make such dark material entertaining and keep audiences engrossed.\n\nAll of the characters were very simple and they don't exactly experience arcs but I still felt myself rooting for Moss even as I was entertained by Chigurh's antics. The overacting present in all of the Coens' movies is something I have never been quite on board with and the presence of the usually wonderful McDonald giving a performance I didn't like irked me. Some humor was mined from this approach but I always find myself being more annoyed with how smug and self satisfied this seems instead of finding it funny or disturbing. Bardem is of course great as he convinces as a very creepy sociopath with his sunken face and precise delivery. If this was a foreign film maybe I would be more accepting and I do admit that what it does is very impressive because I have seen so many films fail spectacularly in trying to imitate the style of the Coen brothers.\n\nI suppose the meaning of the film was that evil will always prevail. We see the evil figure of Chigurh triumph over all of the characters who attempt to make moral decisions in the film and it doesn't appear that his reign of terror will end any time soon. No, Moss is not perfect but he does try to be a good husband and is not as unnecessarily violent as Chigurh. It's hard to relate to the nihilistic outlook that the Coens seem to have taken here but if they are to commit to that ideology they have certainly written an ode to it in film form.\n\nThis is probably one of the most fun Best Picture winners that you could watch and at just over two hours it's fairly short. Because of that I like it a lot more than some of the epics that have earned the top prize but that don't contain enough meaning to support their lengthy run times. If you like the Coens I'm sure you'll love this and if you're like me I assure you it's still a really enjoyable viewing experience.",

Played impeccably by Spanish actor Javier Bardem, Chigurh's haircut and weapon of choice (an air-compressed cattle gun) draw equal reactions of fear. The fact that audiences receive no background to Chigurh's madness or fate only adds to his mystique. Simply put - Anton Chigurh is the \"ultimate badass,\" friend-o.",

Even in that respect, it is fantastic. The performances and the cinematography alone would make this film incredible.\n\nBut there is more.\n\nNo Country for Old Men depicts a changing world. A world where violence, unmitigated and mindless, is everywhere. People die for no reason at all. The Coen brothers - and Cormack McCarthy before them - saw where the world was headed, and they saw that there was no way to stop the insanity. They were right.\n\nThe three central characters of the film represent many different things. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is nostalgia. He is a remnant of the past, a vestige of an older age where people treated others with kindness. His beliefs and worldview simply cannot coexist with what the world is becoming.\n\nLlewelyn (Josh Brolin) is everyone. He is moral ambiguity - neither evil nor good. Llewelyn represents humanity in the grand scheme of the universe. He never seems to have control over the situation, the outcome always dictated by someone or something else. He is adrift, pushed around by waves at war with each other.\n\nAnton Chigurh is chaos. Unbridled, unrelenting, unstoppable chaos. A veritable force of nature. Fate itself. Chigurh has no conscience and no morality. Chigurh is the driving power that changes the world, and uses brutal violence to do so.\n\nThe plot of No Country for Old Men is very much about a changing world, but it is also about death. Much of the carnage is witnessed on screen, but the death of Llewelyn is not. It is quick, unexpected, and hardly noted at all. I believe that this is an example of how death comes for everyone, and you never expect it, and your death is not more meaningful or impactful than that of anyone else.\n\nContrary to the beliefs of Sheriff Bell, the film is quick to point out that senseless violence has always existed. Human beings have been killing each other since the dawn of time, and we will continue to do so until the planet is rid of us.\n\nNo Country for Old Men is a film that will make you think. It will make you consider the state of the world and the state of the human race. It will make you long for older days and better times.",

            "content": "My introduction to the Coen Brothers was through Fargo. That film made an extremely strong impression on me - it displaced The Empire Strikes Back as my favorite film with its skillful mix of comedy and drama and helped kindle my interest in the medium. I was hoping for something similar when I rented No Country for Old Men for the first time. This expectation was quickly squashed. Fargo has substantial comedic element, while No Country for Old Men, despite its occasional moments of dark comedy, is primarily a serious, rather philosophical thriller. Despite this, No Country for Old Men quickly enthralled me, albeit in a different way than Fargo, living up to its reputation as one of the best films of its decade.\n\nNo Country for Old Men, based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy is set in the deserts and towns of southwestern Texas, a setting which would perfect for a Western (a genre from which the movie clearly takes influence) if not for the fact that the film is set 100 years too late. Changing times have turned the region into a hotbed for drug smuggling and drug-related violence. Llewelyn Moss, a welder and Vietnam veteran, finds 2 million dollars at the site of a botched drug deal in the west Texas desert. This sets Anton Chigurh, a merciless hitman with a set of seemingly alien principles and a Two-Face-like penchant for deciding whether to kill people based on a coin flip, on his tail. Local sheriff Ed Tom Bell realizes the danger Moss faces and attempts to protect him, but in the process is forced to confront societal changes, more than a little depravity, and his own perceptions that America is becoming a less hospitable and more violent place.\n\nThe entire cast gives fantastic performances. Javier Bardem's performance as Anton Chigurh is probably the most celebrated, having earned the actor an Academy Award, and this acclaim is largely deserved – Bardem's performance gives the character such an intimidating air that he looks like he could beat up Darth Vader and steal his lunch money, and the exchange between his character and the proprietor of a remote gas station is positively inspired. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin, while less critically celebrated for their roles in the film, also give fantastic performances. Sheriff Bell is inseparable in my mind from Tommy Lee Jones' soft-spoken, Texas accented voice, and Josh Brolin's carefree, cavalier portrayal of Llewelyn Moss sells his extreme overconfidence in his ability to win his game of cat-and-mouse against Chigurh.\n\nOne of No Country for Old Men's central themes is fate. Anton Chigurh believes strongly in fate; in his eyes, he has no control over the deaths of people who fail his iconic coin toss despite pulling the trigger – fate decided that they wouldn't live, not him. Llewelyn Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, believe strongly in free will. Llewelyn Moss' cavalier attitude stems from his conviction that he can change the fate Chigurh has presented. The eventual triumph of one party reveals the positions of the Coen Brothers and McCarthy on the debate between determinism and free will. Sheriff Bell is isolated from the fate versus free will debate but serves to demonstrate another important theme – he is the old man mentioned in the title. Bell repeatedly reminisces over how times have changed, and America has become a country he doesn't understand. Unlike the movie's commentary on fate, the movie leaves it ambiguous as to whether Bell's statements regarding the collapse of American society since the Vietnam War are true or whether Bell's perspective has simply changed as he has gotten older.\n\nMy reviews generally focus more heavily on the concrete aspects of a film – story, acting, plot, cinematography – rather than more nebulous aspects such as symbolism and themes, but I quite enjoyed analyzing and reading interpretations of No Country for Old Men. The film seems to be written to make audiences to think more deeply about the subtext, with an ending which is more focused on resolving the themes than the fates of the surviving characters. This ending might upset some people, but I rather liked it despite being unable to conclusively state its meaning. Having not read the novel, I'm unsure how much of the ideology of the film originated in Cormac McCarthy's novel and how much originated in the Coen Brothers' screenplay, but even if the subtext was copied entirely from the novel, the Coen Brothers and their collaborators deserve high praise for creating what is likely one of the best adaptations of all time.\n",

            "content": "Bleakness in the sands of Texas.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's direct a modern Western film for adults with their neo-noir Western thriller No Country for Old Men (2007). I am happy it won Best Picture at The Oscars as The Coen Brothers deliver a hard hitting serious film similar to their early neo-noir crime dramas Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coen Brothers find the beauty in the grisly with their strikingly quiet direction. They draw out each gunfight with skillful suspense and heavy atmosphere. \n\nCormac McCarthy's story is fascinating and Joel and Ethan reinvent the wheel by taking a simple narrative and adding shadows and color with their warm direction. Every moment is tense as suspense builds into a hail of bullets and air blasts. No Country for Old Men is a cool Western that grips you from the brutal opening to the endless chase of a sociopath seeking out a man running away with 2 million dollars. I found myself practically holding my breath whenever Llewelyn encountered Anton.\n\nRoger Deakins' iconic cinematography looks gorgeous and haunting with dark night and bright lights everywhere. His angles and framing for each gun barrel, man running, to locks getting blown out by air are breathtaking. I love Deakin's wide shot of Josh Brolin running over the sand dune away from the truck with blaring headlights at midnight. Joel and Ethan Coen's editing sharps cuts from ultra wide outdoors shots to indoor guns blasting with shocking efficiency. Their smart cuts and beguiling editing enthralled me for all 122 minutes of No Country for Old Men.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's reflective writing and patience for the elderly feeling overwhelmed in a desolate wasteland with morality. Cormac McCarthy's nihilistic writing style is fully on display as Joel and Ethan adapt McCarthy's novel No Country for Old Men. McCarthy writes killers with no conscience, who wear down the police trying to capture them with their senseless killing. \n\nNo Country for Old Men depicts the brutal realism of random people dying for no good reason and how depressing that looks. From a fearsome assassination, who relentlessly guns down all witnesses in his path, to a man desiring the wealth he's stumbled onto, to the sheriff out of his depth despite his years of experience. Tommy Lee Jones is amazing as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell with his shred observations and quick wit. Jones feels like he understands Bell's devastation at realizing old men cannot compete with the neverending hordes of evil that plague America with bloody crimes. Age and wisdom account for only so much when fighting against monsters.\n\nJoel Coen's direction for his neo-noir Western No Country for Old Men (2007) is enthralling in every second. The Coen Brothers have achieved the remarkable in directing a fun and violent Western for contemporary audiences that does not feel old fashioned. Joel and Ethan Coen's writing is pithy and revealing, while the characters are unique types all their own. It is a slow burn like all Westerns, so you are going to have a good time watching No Country for Old Men.\n\nI must mention the stellar acting from Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones in particular. You will really feel like you have an understanding of who these men are at heart. They are memorable and complex characters that are a pleasure to watch perform. Josh Brolin is gripping with a nuanced lead role as welder and Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss, with his nervous face awaiting his pursuers with his sawed off shotgun. \n\nWhereas the impeccable performance from Javier Bardem is terrifying as he delivers one of the greatest villains in cinema as his stoic sociopath Anton Chigurh on the loose. His every moment feels intentional and compassionless. His cruel killings make No Country for Old Men a visceral experience. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Carson Wells, who seems smarter than he really is as you can never see your fate coming.\n\nTommy Lee Jones is entertaining as the hardened Sheriff Ed Tom Bell searching for these men. Garrett Dillahunt is funny as the stupid and simple minded deputy Wendell. Tess Harper is thoughtful and attentive as Ed Tom Bell's wife Loretta Bell. Barry Corbin gives a fantastic and poignant monologue about the pointlessness of fighting for justice in a cruel world with violent men. Stephen Root is fun as the tough businessman hired by the Cartel to hire Anton Chigurh and Carson Wells. Beth Grant's complaints as Carla Jean's elderly mother, who cannot stand the way things are is perfectly in line with No Country for Old Men's themes. Ana Reeder's cameo as the flirty girl by the pool is funny.\n\nI adored seeing the ethereal Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald as her Southern drawl accent is flawless. I felt so bad for her innocent Carla Jean Moss. She's wonderful alongside Josh Brolin as they have realistic chemistry on screen. Her phenomenal natural acting makes for a delightful viewing until her sorrowful final scene with Javier Bardem. No Country for Old Men is certainly perfectly cast. You can even see a young Caleb Landry Jones before Get Out as the boy on his bike at the end astonished by Anton's bone.\n\nFurthermore, I feel like in addition to No Country for Old Men's steady pace, the complete lack of music gives a sparse and empty feeling. Sound designers Skip Lievsay, Craig Berkey, Peter F. Kurland, and Greg Orloff hit you with each gunshot and gentle footstep. Alongside No Country for Old Men's steady pace, the subtle sound editing gives a sparse feeling. You are stunned with the minimalism of silence as you are witnessing quiet homicide with Anton's air gun over and over again. Carter Burwell is credited as composer, but only has a nice end credits song as the quiet in No Country for Old Men is very unsettling and builds atmosphere with an ever growing disquiet. There's no upfront score to be sure.\n\nMary Zophres came up with all these cool cowboy costumes alongside her fellow costume designers Lori DeLapp and Lisanne Scafine. Jean Ann Black's make-up gives everyone a natural, sweaty look, except for Javier Bardem in a ghastly wig that makes him all the more uncanny to gaze upon in horror. Jess Gonchor's production design and Nancy Haigh's set decoration ensures Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico look as impoverished and gritty as possible. John P. Goldsmith's art direction is lovely with dogs swimming down river to headlights shining through the darkest nights in No Country for Old Men.\n\nOverall, No Country for Old Men is worth watching over and over again. It is the best neo-noir style neo-Western movie to come out in the 2,000's really. I would also recommend The Big Lebowski and Fargo from The Coen Brothers if you end up liking No Country for Old Men. For more modern Western movies, check out Hell or High Water, The Revenant, or Wind River.",

Heroes are never really heroes, its more that some people are just less bad than others. This isn't about a heroic character prevailing over the hand of evil. This is a cold film with no soundtrack, layered with dark humour and brutal violence. Javier Bardem's gives one of the most chilling performances we've seen on our screens",

There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could: you can't even look into his eyes without wincing, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what profession... who can say?). Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally \"emote\". Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.",

No Country is a pretty special movie, as it manages to make you afraid to go to sleep without putting anything supernatural in it. It reminds you how we as humans can do evil that the most disquieting horror movie can't even come close to portraying. Part of its ability to unnerve, too, is that all of this could really happen. The Cohens successfully threw together a western and a horror movie at the same time, the plot of which being completely plausible in real life. It has a sort of godlike figure as the villain, and it is supposed reminds us that the world works in mysterious ways, I think. Watching this movie, I couldn't help but think of the ancient myths in which gods visited regular people, disguised as humans. That must be how Tom Bell and Lewellyn Moss felt as their lives began to revolve around this man, Anton Chigurh, coming after them. This movie is very manipulative.

Full of great archetypal performances and with an ultra-realistic POV that combines the best elements of independent filmmaking with mainstream gravitas.\n\n\nJavier Bardem brought all of his international passion and channeled it in the worst way possible: as a transcendent serial killer one step ahead of every righteous man on the planet. Anton Chigurh one-ups Mickey (and Mallory) Knox from Natural Born Killers (protagonists all the way) because this villain was an invincible antagonistic presence to not one but two heroes in Sheriff Bell and Llewelyn Moss. It's an incredible challenge to play such an evil and believable character, with such an absurd haircut.",

She is the only innocent character in the film, and she refuses make any compromises either. She remains true to what she believes. The scene of Bardem leaving her house is key and very understated.

All powerhouse performances which work their lane and know their lines. All could've been Oscar award worthy as well as deserving. Whether NCFOM received any nods or not matters little. \n\nHowever, easily the film's most brilliant character is played by Javier Bardem, who's take on the persona of a next level of evil serial killer and stone cold criminal manipulator/and naturally, an insatiably torturous psychopath, is spellbinding as well as most haunting. Evil such as this needs a stronger method for condemnation than what the English language can summon for us using mere words. \n\nYou end up feeling Bardem's character's demons all personified in this role as Anton Chigurh. A man who's face and voice and word choices in the film will long follow you years from now and they'll probably echo in your head with a still chilling effect. \n\nThe small town near elderly sheriffs are clearly not prepared for what type of mercilessness can exist in the minds of the modern day madmen such as Anton. \n\nThe mayhem far exceeds the merely macabre. The darkest evil being conducted and committed by a hellbound maestro intent on taking every man to hell with him when his time comes. \n\nAll of this insanely curated chemistry pops in a harmony for quite the cinematic tour-de-force.

            "content": "\"What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?\"\n\nNow, I haven't seen 'It Follows' yet....but I'm pretty sure the title would fit this film adequately.\n\nNo Country for Old Men is directed by the Coen Brothers (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) and stars Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, a deadly and stalking killer hunting down Josh Brolin's character Llewelyn Moss who has stolen $2,000,000 in drug money.\n\nThe good? This is my favourite Coen Brothers film (so far), which isn't saying much as I haven't liked any of their picture's so far, keep in mind I've only seen a few. That is not a diversion from a recommendation however, No Country for Old Men is a successfully thrilling movie. Let's start with Javier Bardem, his performance is uncanny now in modern movie villainy and I fully understand why. His looming, eerie, intimidating presence caused major laps of full heart-in-chest moments by yours truly. A character delved with such mysterious creativity, who makes an oxygen tank of all things look like a AK-47 assault rifle. Josh Brolin acts well as Llewelyn Moss, you enjoy watching the predator, Anton, stalk his quick prey. No Country for Old Men may as well be silent, because the more intriguing and uncomfortable parts are set with no dialogue, just visual shock and skill. The Coen Brothers know how to set out a starting atmosphere in which nothing seems to be surviving, like a zombie apocalypse has just broken out. The key substance to the film is a bit iffy, but from what i could delve, it seems to try and push a hint that death is inescapable when living in a land of crime, drugs and money.\n\nThe bad? No Country for Old Men may be my favourite (so far) but it isn't an amazing movie. I found Tommy Lee Jone's character, Ed Tom Bell, to be unnecessary to the main man vs man survival situation. Adding no essence to what is otherwise a densely packed, realistically set thriller. In addition, the dialogue is droll for the most part. With the exception of Bardem's 'coin toss' exchange, a lot of scenes seemed to be set out just to falsely trick the audience into having some sort of relevance to anything that was happening. Oh, and please don't intrude Woody Harrelson into the movie halfway through, what a waste of a character and an actor. He seems to be a last minute icing on the cake to join two disjointed plots. Sad. Finally, the conclusion is left half-assed and stranded at it's peak of interest. Like they gave up or something.\n\nAll in all, I still recommend No Country for Old Men because it's moments of terror are worth watching just to feel your blood rushing through your skin, and an award worthy performance from Javier Bardem, seriously understandable praise of the highest order. Have your 'pee-breaks' whenever the movie switches to something you feel isn't fundamental, dangerous or putting you to sleep. You'll notice when it comes....Friendo.\n\nB+\n\n72/100",

Add to this, the brilliant Coen brothers who are welcome in any country, regardless of their age (I never regret a pun, not even this one). \n\nIt's a truly memorable piece and it's beautifully shot- it's violent and cerebral and completely authentic. I will say though that the book is fairly subtle in many ways and the film is the same. Ultimately, that denies the viewer from any big pay off and somewhat leads to the film fizzling out. It's hard to fault the Coen brothers for sticking to the source material but this may have been an example where a bit of bravery may have paid off ten-fold.\n\nAnyway, it's a heck of a lot better than your average film, that's for sure.",

Moss is then on the run from a hitman (Javier Bardem) hired to take him down. Tommy Lee Jones plays Sheriff Bell, the sheriff of the country where this all takes place.\n\nThis movie was very captivating right off the bat. Javier Bardem delivered an Academy Award-winning performance, and it shows; his creepy villainous ways are captivating to watch. Tommy Lee Jones also delivers a solid turn as the only true \"good guy\" of the movie, despite the terrible acting of his partner. The Coen Brothers always deliver from a cinematic standpoint, and this movie is no exception. Also, the ending, while probably frustrating to most, really stood out as the strong point of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, this is just not an entertaining film. The dragging pace, absence of film score, and long periods of dialogue only made the movie feel longer than its two-hour run time. Josh Brolin's character is also one that is hard to cheer for. He is very cold and calculating for a non-criminal, making it hard to want him to escape from the hitman.\n\nWhile I didn't love this movie (and don't understand how it won Best Picture), I appreciate enough about it to say it's worth watching if you have the patience. While Westerns aren't really my thing, No Country for Old Men is fine.\n\nFinal grade: B-",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Cone Brothers - No Country For Old Men. Der Western eröfnnet mit der vertrauensvollen Stimme von Tommy Lee Jones. Er beschreibt einen Teenager Killer, der seine 14jährige Freundin ermordete. In den Akten wurde die Tat als Verbrechen aus Leidenschaft eingestuft. In Wahrheit hatte der Mord nichts passioniertes. Der Killer hatte lange geplant, jemanden umzubringen. In dem Moment, da er draussen sei, würde er es wieder tun. Der Monolog entspricht wortwörtlich dem Roman von Cormac McCarthy. Tommy Lee Jones gibt ihm dennoch eine neue Note. Es ist das Fragende in seiner Stimme, die den ganzen Film beschreibt: No Country For Old Men ist vor allem ein Western über einen abgrundtief bösen Mann. Diese Kreatur ist so durch und durch schlecht, dass wir uns über ihre schlichte Existenz wundern müssen. Der Mann heisst Anton Chigurh (wie auch immer man das ausspricht, jedoch sieht bereits das Schriftbild furchteinflössend aus). Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ist ein grosser Mann mit herunter hängenden Schultern. Er hat strähnige schwarze Haare und ein diabolisches Grinsen. Mit einer Stuntgun für Rinder reist er durch Texas, um zu töten. Chigurh stellt einen Erzählstrang dar in einem Plot mit Twist. Ed Tom Bell, der Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) stellt einen weiteren dar und Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), ein armer Mann, der mit seiner Frau in einem Trailer lebt, einen dritten. Moss stösst eines Tages in der Wüste auf einen gescheiterten Drogen Deal. Die Fahrzeuge stehen im Kreis (wie im klassischen Western) - alle Beteiligten wurden erschossen, sogar der Hund. Das Ged aber fehlt. Moss findet es in der Brieftasche eines Toten. Moss nimmt nun die zwei Millionen Dollar an sich, Chigurh will sie ihm wegnehmen und der Sheriff versucht, Chigurh aufzuhalten beim Morden. Ausserdem treten auf: Moss kindliche Ehefrau Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald), der grossspurige Jäger Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) und der Geschäftsmann (Stephen Root), der wiederum Carson anheuert, das Geld zu finden. No Country For Old Men ist einer der besten Filme, den die Coen Brüder je machten. Er enthält Thriller Elemente und das Motiv der Jagd, vor allem aber ist es eine Charakterstudie. Wie reagieren Menschen, wenn sie auf das reine Böse treffen? Chigurh ist so abgründig, dass er manchmal sogar komisch wirkt und es keine Möglichkeit gibt, ihn zu begreifen. Carson gesteht ihm immerhin zu, er hätte Prinzipien. No Country For Old Men bietet phantastische Dialoge; man erinnere sich an den in der Tankstelle zwischen Chigurh und dem Tankwart: Fraglos hat Chigurh vor, den alten Mann zu töten und darum gehts in dem Wortspiel, dass er ihm anbietet. Und die zwei Millionen Dollar? Es scheint so, als wäre es einfacher, sie zu finden, denn zu behalten. Moss versteckt sich in schäbigen Hotel Zimmern, er flieht, doch Chigurh folgt ihm wie ein Schatten. No Contry For Old Men beschwört die Zeit, den Ort, die Charaktere sowie die moralischen Möglichkeiten des Handelns. No Country For Old Men handelt von der menschlichen Natur und vom Schicksal. Die Bilder von Roger Deakins und der Soundtrack von Carter Burwell vermitteln ein Gefühl von Schönheit, aber auch der Einsamkeit. Wie erbärmlich erscheinen menschliche Gefühle im Angesicht unerbittlichem Unrechts? Der Film zeigt viel Mitleid für seine erbarmungswürdigen Charaktere. Viele Szenen sind so perfekt konstruiert, dass sich ein regelrechter emotionaler Sog einstellt. No Country For Old Men - ein Mysterium, wie ein solches Meisterwerk überhaupt entstehen kann?  mehr auf cinegeek.de",

Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin are amazing in this, and Javier Bardem in his first acting career that's American is one of the best parts of the film. The film doesn't have music until the post credits which was a bold and risky move, but it fits in with the emptiness and dark of the tone. The writing is really great and they created some subtle humor into it that's really funny. The characters are very three-dimensional in this, and the villain is very memorable and terrifying in this. It's very interesting, and the gunfire action is exciting to watch. The plot is really great, and it shows about how much of a chain reaction it leads to. No Country for Old Men is just as masterfully well done as the directors's other films that shows that they can do other genres.",

Una volta raggiunto il giusto livello di consapevolezza, si riesce ad apprezzare il film per quello che è, un capolavoro inestimabile, tra i migliori film del decennio. Questa volta i Coen non solo ci hanno trascinato dentro la sconvolgente realtà del confine messicano durante gli anni '80, ci hanno anche trascinato dentro la mente folle e criminale di uno dei migliori personaggi che io abbia mai visto, sorretto da un'interpretazione semplicemente ai limiti del possibile. La pellicola viene sorretta anche da effetti sonori estremamente accurati e precisi, che sostituiscono una colonna sonora che in questo caso è totalmente assente, rendendo l'esperienza più pragmatica e vicina dal punto di vista emotivo. Non a caso il film è una costante in tutte le liste dei migliori film del post 2000, semplicemente un capolavoro senza tempo che conferma il posto dei Coen nell'Olimpo del registi.",

No Country for Old Men quite possibly have the best dialogue in any movie I have ever seen.  The Coen Brothers follow Cormac McCarthy's book pretty much to a tee.  Javier Bardem gives one of the best performances of the last 20 years without showing any emotion at all.  His character is so calm and matter of fact that its scary.  Obviously underneath the calm stoic exterior he is a violent sociopathic murderer who enjoys killing people in different ways, this is one guy you do not want hunting you down.  Tommy Lee Jones gives one of the best performances of his career playing the town Sheriff who is closely following the situation at hand.

The Coen Brothers follow Cormac McCarthy's book pretty much to a tee. Javier Bardem gives one of the best performances of the last 20 years without showing any emotion at all. His character is so calm and matter of fact that its scary. Obviously underneath the calm stoic exterior he is a violent sociopathic murderer who enjoys killing people in different ways, this is one guy you do not want hunting you down. Tommy Lee Jones gives one of the best performances of his career playing the town Sheriff who is closely following the situation at hand. Yes this movie has a slow and deliberate place but it is highly entertaining. It took home a bunch of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Bardem.",

So its been a nice while since my last attempt and boyfriend wanted to watch it, so might as well.\n\nAgain...the acting was fabulous. The baddie was scary and of course I loved Tommy Lee Jones. \n\nHowever, there were so many slow parts that seemed too slow for an action movie. I wish there had been fight scenes between the baddie and the guy who found the money. There were many intense moments and even though I knew what was going to happen, I was still worried for the main guy, the cop, and the main guy's wife. I get that the money belonged to the baddie, but what a psycho. Honestly, its only 2 million dollars...I would've left it after I knew the crazy, murderer was after me. But what do I know, I guess.\n\nOooh the ending. The biggest flaw to me. I still am unsure of what happened. There were so many loose ends and it was kinda cliffhanger-ish. Not a fan. Maybe if they made a second one then I'd be content, but its been YEARS since it came out. \n\nIn the end, this was an okay movie. Maybe more of a guy movie honestly. There were a lot of slow parts and I excepted more action or dialogue. The ending had lots of loose ends and I'm still not sure what happened to a couple of the characters. The acting on all ends, though, was fantastic. \n\nI shall stamp this with...mmmmm....2 stars. Nearly a 3, but the ending forces me to take away .5 stars. \n\nRe-watch?: mmmm prolly not.",

It's not afraid to graphically show what happens when you get into bad territory with an insane psychopath played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. What's really intriguing about this film is that I couldn't figure out who the main character or main focus character was in the film. It was a mesh of 3 different lifestyles that were forced to come together. The plot follows the story of Llewelyn Moss who takes a bag full of money from a gang of drug dealers who've been massacred. Although things may seem good for Llewelyn now, he doesn't expect Anton to come after him to collect the money and will stop at nothing to get it. This film has outstanding acting from Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and an especially dark Javier Bardem. The whole cast is memorable and fantastic choices because these actors played characters that seemed real and acted how real people would in the situation given. There's no demonstration of unnecessary action or gore to be found, everything that Anton does is totally effective in every way and NEEDS to be in this film. Every character has a different problem that they are trying to solve in their own lives besides the main one that they are involved in and it gives the characters depth. Ed wants to retire the police force, Llewelyn wants to help him and his wife with the money, and Anton wants to feel wealthy and dangerous in his own psychopathic way. What really reaches the standard for a great movie in my perspective is when I feel compassion for the characters and how they feel and how they create memorable scenes to show to other people. I got to the point in the very end of No Country For Old Men where I cared for Anton who was extremely intimidating and evil! This film is very much like Silence of the Lambs in the way where the characters have back and forths with the antagonist and it's just really compelling. Hannibal and Anton are two totally different characters but they both made super memorable characters. This film has so much to offer to an audience. It's dramatic, its suspenseful, it's thrill packed, it's whimsical at times, it's interesting, it's emotional, and above all super entertaining. No Country For Old Men has an amazing story to tell that has great characters and a really interesting thought provoking moral it asks at the end. A",

Javier Bardem takes the prize for one of the most evil and sinister characters in recent history! An excellent casting choice, Bardem is the fearful constant in the calculating and suspenseful pace of the film. Seemingly unstoppable, he tracks down Moss relentlessly. Tommy Lee Jones is so admirable as the sheriff trying to help Moss, that he kind of represents the sanity that still exists in other parts of the world. A sentimental figure, he know that his time is coming both in leaving the police dept. and perhaps life itself. A slower yet powerful pace is how the movie unfolds, but it is totally effective. The Coen brothers really got this one right and is a much missed effort given their work in the following years. I have found that people get thrown by the movie title.

He loves his wife and is too human to cut people in trouble coldly. \nThe three actors never projected on one screen together. It's amazing that the whole story is full of feelings of tension and thrilling though their view points changes in turn. \n'No Country for Old Men' was nominated for Oscar in 8 categories and won awards for Best Picture, Best Direction, Best Supporting Actor(Javier Bardem) and Writing Adapted Screenplay.?\nThe title comes from a poem by an Irish poet Yeats.

Each scene is woven perfectly together and there is no unneeded information. There also isn't a score, or soundtrack. Being a tense movie with action, not having any sound effects or music makes the movie feel natural and even more intense. In a movie with a score, you are able to tell when some good or bad is about to happen, the music builds to it. Without a score, you are unable to tell what is coming next, allowing the viewer to be surprised with a rush of fear or whatever emotion the Coen brothers intended you to feel.\n\nThe actors in this movie are really, really good. Javier, who plays the psychotic serial killer, does an impeccable job acting as if he is psycho. Each scene that involves him is very serious and takes a lot of composure to act. There are no slight movements or jerky eye looks with Chigurh (the psycho). He stays very smooth and calm through each scene as if he was actually psychotic and didn't care about all of the people he just killed.\n\nOverall, this movie deserves 5 stars for its incredible acting and its ability to play with your heart rate.",

Or doesn't even really stop, because it leaves questions unanswered. Our main character's death is completely off-screen, the main villain just walks away, where's the money, what happened to the wife, and what is Tommy Lee Jones talking about are all questions when the credits roll. Still, with all those huge complaints, I cannot deny that the reason I'm so bummed with the ending is because up until then was such an incredible film. A definite must-see. (87%)",

Josh Brolin is just an important part of the cast that here works, but the most compelling and memorable performance of this thriller was made by Javier Bardem, personally I think it is one of the more deranged killers that I've seen, at any time shows weakness or compassion.\n\nRoger Deakins is a regular contributor to the Coen brothers, and for obvious reasons, all the films in which he participates are visually beautiful. Here the cinematography is perfect in every moment.\n\nIt's definitely a bloody and twisted picture, but with a brilliant rhythm that is compelling.

Moss doesn't know that his naïve action makes him the primarily target of a psychotic hitman that will stop at nothing in order to reclaim the money. This series of events draws the attention of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who will try to find Moss whereabouts before the psychotic hitman gets to him.\nWhen you make an adaptation of a book/novel, there are two directions that you could go with: Modifying some segments of the source material in order to fulfill a 2-3hr runtime or you could try to make an adaptation as faithful to the source material as possible, the Coen brothers decided to take their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy´s novel into the second type of direction.  \"No Country for Old Men\" is an extremely well made film filled with greatness: The performances are solid with Javier Bardem stealing the film in a unforgettable performance as a creepy, calculating and bloodthirsty hitman; the story is extremely simple but is executed perfectly, a spot on pacing, memorable sequences, a surprising mixture of various genres (drama, action, thriller and even western), the Coen´s trademark black humor and over the top violence is here in little doses, Joel and Ethan´s directing is focused on the details, the narrative just throws you into this world and connects the lives of our three main characters in a credible way, a perfect amount of ambiguity, beautiful cinematography that perfectly creates a western style, a fantastic use of multiple themes, an impeccable use of dialog when it is absolutely needed, and the whole film feels not only as a feature movie but also like poetry as the conclusion comes closer. My only big problem with this film is the conclusion itself, it may be the same that the novel had and it concludes Moss quest of trying to literally outrun the devil in an appropriate way but it is also somewhat disappointing and lackluster for a film that had built up to its conclusion with such precision.\n\"No Country for Old Men\" is an intense and unforgettable film that maybe the Coen´s finest work, but with the resume they have is extremely hard to pick, my runner-up film of 2007.",

Some may find the story a little preachy, but I found it to be for the most part powerful. Nobody can make an old southern film like the Cohens. The performances are all great especially Javier Bardem as the insanely creepy Anton Chigurh. Now my problems come later in the story. I'll start off by saying saying this movie should have been about 20 minutes longer. I feel some parts of the story where rushed, particularly when Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn Moss, dies later in the movie. It didn't even show the confrontation. It just dropped it on us; I really didn't know what was going on at first when the police arrived, and on top of that it felt like all his stress and running had led up to nothing. Now if I where to pick my top 10 favorite movie endings, this would definitely be on there. The ending is, let's say, perfection. It's not a flawless film, but it's a damn good one.",

            "content": "Filming on the bleak, seemingly infinite deserts of Texas and New Mexico, the Coen brothers accomplished the impossible: the filming of a Cormac McCarthy novel. The movie opens with our protagonist, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), stumbling upon the striking wreckage of a drug deal done gone awry, and finding a briefcase containing 2 million dollars. Attempting to make this money his own, Llewelyn takes the briefcase and unknowingly sets off an unstoppable chain of violence, as he is tracked down by the ruthless Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem.\n\nThe performances in No Country for Old Men are spectacular, especially that of Bardem. Anton Chigurh embodies pure, brutal evil so convincingly, that at times it is hard to remember that Bardem is just acting.  The film offers amazing visuals and elements of a heart-pounding thriller, while also feeling like a character study of Moss and Chigurh. The film is also incredibly focused, with almost every sentence uttered by the characters feeling intriguing and important to the progression of the story.\n\nOne of the most interesting and effective tools used by the Coen brothers throughout the movie is the usage of silence. The film completely lacks any cinematic music or soundtrack, allowing the dead, yet piercing silence to take over some of the most suspenseful moments, making them more spine-tingling than any music ever could. \n\nUltimately, No Country is an incredibly suspenseful, thought-provoking, and thrilling ride with incredible direction by Joel and Ethan Coen to bring the novel to life.",

Chance and destiny are invoked in the most resonant, least pretentious way in the sinister form of Anton the hit man who coldly and relentlessly hunts our...anti-hero. The Coens, long revered for their intermittently manic and macabre storylines, do a 180 and take a more dangerous tack with some morbid themes. A coin toss, a drug deal gone wrong and an unstoppable force with a bowl-cut collide in the Coens' violent, tormenting and pitilessly bleak film. Honestly, how many other directors could make an assassin in a Delia Smith wig terrifying?",

Anyway, first one I don't remember too well but it was about meeting him in town somewhere, he's gonna give me some money. I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. Goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin' goin' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up...\n\n\nHoly shit! I got it. I finally got it. At least I think I do. I think I finally figured out Tommy Lee Jones's dream at the end of the movie with his father. Remember before when he goes up to see his brother with all the cats and he talks to him about how he always figured that when he got older that God would come into his life some how, but he didn't. Well, after doing some heavy thinking after I watched the movie two nights ago I think the dream means that God did come into his life in those two dreams that Jones talks to his wife about at the end of the movie at the kitchen table after he retires from being sheriff of his Texas town. Just by the way he tells her that his father is the young man and Tommy Lee is older than his father ever was and that it was cold on there was snow on the ground it almost feels like they are both heading into hell, but once TLJ talks about his father going on a head of him and he has a blanket wrapped around him and he was carrying fire in some sort of thing that they carried fire with back in the old days and he could tell by the light in it and that's what captured my attention right away, the light that he saw in the fire and that he knew when his father went on a head in the dream on the horses that they are both riding that he knew when ever he would catch up to his father he would be there....and then he woke up. I really believe and who knows I could be wrong, but I truly believe the dream means that his father will be waiting for him in heaven when he dies and that to me is enough to put the dream to rest. This is such a masterful film by the Coen Brothers and most definitely their best since Fargo, which definitely granted both Joel and Ethan Coen every Oscar they won that year when No Country for Old Men was released into theaters. But lets not for get the true star of this movie and that is Javier Bardem as the psycho killer Anton Chigurh who is the scene stealer in this movie and most definitely deserved the best supporting actor Oscar that year he won for he truly was the most creepiest, scariest and deadliest villains to come along in a long time. His character will definitely go down as one of the best characters ever created, but it's all thanks to the genius behind it all and that is the author Cormac McCarthy, who really without him there would be no book and there would definitely be no movie and that we have to acknowledge. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin also give very good performances as well and it was even nice to see Woody Harrelson make a small appearance as the other bounty hunter assigned to stop Javier Bardem's character. This is a very compelling and in some way suspenseful movie that should not be missed as the Coen Brothers have given us something for a generation of movie goers to watch forever and that is why the Coen Brothers are without a doubt the best film makers alive in the movie business today. They have given us so many great movies over the years that to not acknowledge them would be a sin as they gave us movies like Fargo, Raising Arizona, O Brother Where Art Thou, Burn After Reading, and the remake of True Grit. But we also cannot forget their all time cult classic The Big Lebowski, which made Jeff Bridges in my eyes a superstar even though the movie was not well recieved when it first came out, but now, now it is probably the biggest cult classic of all time and that is because the movie just is that damn good and so are The Coen Brothers.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nBoy, how wrong I was about this film, claiming before that this was one of the Coen brothers' weaker films. It was almost a year ago since I have first viewed No Country For Old Men and since then I have learned so much about the directors and cinema as a whole, and through this growth I was able to gain a better appreciation of this film. I previously watched this at a time where it was late at night, expecting something great but nothing difficult; I found myself dozing off frequently during this film, finding it to be uneventful and lacking of drama. It is only now that I have watched this film at a time where I am more alert and a stage in my life where I could appreciate darker and more thought provoking films.\n\nNo Country For Old Men opens up with a Texas desert that feels empty and grim, supported by a narration that fleshes out the backdrops and its characters without becoming too specific, whilst listening we are treated to a visual introduction of the antagonist, committing a brutal and relentless murder that would then shape the silent menacing tone of the film. The film speaks about its themes of violence, greed and morality in such a way that looks slightly exaggerated but feels harrowingly honest. Its central protagonist, Llewelyn, stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and allowed him to struck gold, finding a suitcase full of cash, and decides to keep it for himself. This gave us a glimpse of what humanity has become, linking it to the aftermath of the Vietnam war with constant references on it spoken here and there, losing a sense of virtue and relying on their armoury to protect themselves from those that are greedier than their own; this idea of greed seems to be a recurring theme for the brothers with it being prominent in their earlier films including Fargo and The Big Lebowski. The film also explores upon the idea of morality, showing that goodness has slowly faded in the souls of the people, with only those that are passionately violent and strong-willed will survive, and this tragedy of the human soul is enriched upon the perspective of lawman Ed Tom Bell, who states at the start of the film this at the start of the film. The Coen brothers emphasise this through the minimisation of using extras to fill the environment, allowing it to create that sense of emptiness that connects effectively with the film's themes. It is only at the end, where Bell shares two dreams he had about his father where I felt lost, unable to make the connection with the film's themes due to its ambiguity.\n\nThe Coen brothers have shifted their playful quality into something that is much dire and serious, and I think the decision to do this allowed the film's themes and ideas to create more impact to the viewers; creating that sense of unpredictability that leaves viewers feel tense and fearful. What is more frightening is that the directors do not hold back in showing gruesome images, letting the camera be right there as it is happening. The film may follow three different characters, but each one is given a generous amount of time to be followed, with Javier Bardem's character as the deadly and arbitrary Anton Chigurh. In his travels, we see him encounter individuals, sometimes random, and for the bulk of it he tortures them psychologically, giving them a feeling of danger without actually showing it or making it plainly obvious, and it is through this foreplay that the audience could easily feel uneasy and when he does pounce and strike, it is then when we feel terror. The film however, does not over-exaggerate the character, especially when it comes to its physical appearance; there is something darkly comical about his notable and peculiar haircut and the usage of a high-pressure oxygen tank to murder his victims; practical but no doubt unorthodox. The rest of the central characters look and feel much more grounded but in saying they never at all came across as dull or generic.\n\nIn my initial experience with the film, I was bugged by the fact that it lacked musical score, as it allowed the more mundane moments feel more tedious than they already are. It is only now that I am able to appreciate the effect that this silence was able to create in regards to its story, ideas, characters, and atmosphere. It is this lack of sonic activity do we feel uneasy when watching threatening events unfold, aiding the feeling of unpredictability that no doubt runs throughout the film. No Country For Old Men never aimed to be a dramatic piece or a crime-driven film; it attempts to capture something real, something that we could see or feel in our own reality and future. The thought of it frightens me but I guess there is nothing much that we could do about it.\n\nNo Country For Old Men has taken its time to grow on me, but that was only because then I lacked the required awareness and understanding to appreciate something that is as dark and painfully honest as this. No Country For Old Men is an example of cinema at its finest.",

            "content": "Dark, grim, bleak, hopeless and strangely comic, yep, it's a Cormac McCarthy story. Perfectly brought to the screen by The Coen Brothers, No Country for Old Men is a very cold thriller that features top-notch performances from Brolin, Bardem and Jones.\n\nI haven't read the book, which is something I've said I wouldn't do anymore, but this film, at least from what I've read others say, does follow the book almost perfectly and considering the themes of the story and how everything unfolds, I'm inclined to believe what I've read, which is a huge positive but also somewhat of a negative but I'll save that for later. \n\nSo much happens in this film that I'm still surprised that it was only 2 hours but it is welcome, so many films released around Oscar season tend to go far too long. The Coens are perfect directors, they know how to create the perfect sense of dread and tension, at any moment I felt like something was about to go wrong, they know how to set everything up perfectly and it is brilliant to watch. The film flew by so fast because I was so invested in what was going on in a quite simple story that has many layers to it. It's crazy how honestly simple the story is but wonders are done with it, with the talents of McCarthy's novel and the Coen's direction it wasn't hard to expect great things. \n\nThe acting in this is outstanding, Brolin, Bardem and Jones are at the top of their respective games here and I wish that they all walked away with Oscar nominations. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and everything just looks very crisp and raw, it's beautiful to look at and once again Roger Deakins is ignored. Surprisingly, the film has a sense of humor, albeit a very dark sense of humor but it fit unbelievably well. It's a neo-western story and it very much feels like one, the whole thing is a Wild West story taking place in a modern-ish age. \n\nIt isn't perfect though, something happens about 30 minutes before the end that was quite questionable. While it didn't annoy me as I appreciated a smarter, more philosophical approach, I'm just surprised that it isn't in the critics consensus or that more critics haven't commented on it (but it wouldn't be a cinematic masterpiece, then, would it?). This ending that we got is probably more welcome than if it went the conventional action route, which probably would have gotten a mention in the critics consensus, it's just that some things that work in one type of media don't translate well to film, especially when you disregard a main character, who has had a massive scenario building up this whole time, right at the last minute. Credit to the Coens for sticking to the source all the way to the end but sometimes changes need to happen. After that part happened, it felt like someone else came in and did the last 30 minutes or they wanted to make the last 30 minutes completely different to the rest of the film, it's very strange as is the fade out transition right before the last 30 minutes. What would the overall experience have been like if, at that moment, it just faded to black and ended? Again, it didn't bother me, it's just something to comment on because I've seen very few people do so and it's strange, at least in terms of filmmaking, anyway, or maybe it's just me. But, hey, I haven't won 4 Oscars so what am I talking about, huh? \n\nOverall, it's a twisted, sordid affair that racks up the body count and is drenched in blood. It's great, but I don't think it's winner-of-4-Oscars great. I think the honor of Best Picture belongs to There Will Be Blood but here we are. However, with great attention to detail, assured direction by The Coen Brothers and a trio of powerful performances, how can you go wrong and what more could you ask for?",

Of course, Bardem's Chigurh is a new definition of menace, social rejection and the arbitrary, a chaotic figure who makes his own rules with the same ruthless logic of a sudden bolt of lightning or an earthquake. The Jones and Brolin characters are both his prey and his embodiment; where does one end and the other begin? The final act will disappoint those filmgoers accustomed to the linear \"justice\" that exists only in American fantasies. But Jones' soliloquy frames his dreams with his reality.

The other is Anton, a pycho killer, a complex, hard to understand character who kills because he can, because he's told too, and because he's good at it.  He's the perfect bad guy of a realistic movie, and is a scary and feared character.  He has no good side, and has the constant face of death and no emotion.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a sherif, one who can't help the situation at all, and seems to not care about his job.  The movie is great: it's fast paced, thrilling, gets to the point, and is full of suspense.  It has action, shootouts, and chaotic chases.  There's some cool guns and nice trucks, but the sound of the silenced shotgun Anton is not at all how a silenced gun sounds. How the police or anyone dosent do anything about the dead people who are ending up everywhere I have no idea, because wherever Anton goes a trail of dead folks lay behined.  The ending has an obvious twist, that is not at all what was expected, and leaves us with something different but kinda without a great ending.  The cast is great, and they preform very well.  The sqript is pretty good, some scenes make us laugh, simply because they're joking or because Anton speaks in a confusing way and he says what he wants to without caring or changing his expression.

Naturally no one will let that kind of money go, so he is pursued by a murderous psychopath. Javier Bardem is totally creepy, and can really make your skin crawl. There are moments where he says very little, but you can tell he is a moment from snapping and killing someone. It's great that he can make this clear without verbal threats, it adds a lot of intrigue to his portrayal. While this chase is going on between the assassin and his prey I was very entertained. No Country for Old Men is also beautifully shot. There are so few spoken lines in this movie that a lot of the storytelling falls on the cinematography, and I don't think they let you down. And as long as I'm praising the movie I should mention that I felt all the cast was solid, and did their best to keep up with Bardem who was constantly stealing the show.\n\nWhere I struggled with this film was the over-arching theme. It seemed to all center around a small-town sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones. The problem is he is so isolated from the plot that he might as well be watching the film sitting next to me in the theater and commenting on it occasionally. I was more connected to the events of this film than he was! I get that the point wasn't to make an action movie or something, it was more about a world that had grown too dark and violent for the titular \"old man,\" but he felt so insulated from the events because he kept showing up after the fact. As a result, I just wasn't impacted by the deeper story they were trying to tell. Now you can call me a typical, moronic, popcorn-eating movie-goer but in all honesty the hunt was the more engaging story of the film, and when they went for something bigger and more transcendent they lost me. Sadly, the resolution of the story we followed for more than half the film is not even shown on screen. The ending we're left with is devastatingly unsatisfying after they had me on the edge of my seat for so long. That being said it is still a perfectly constructed film. Everything works just right, I just happen to feel slightly let down by the story they chose to tell.",

            "content": "Movie Review: No Country for Old Men by Charles Firth\n\nNo Country for Old Men is not about drug dealing or cowboys or deserts or hit men. These are the trappings in which a grand story is set -- a story that deals with archetypes, questions of morality, meaning and destiny.\n\nThe Cohen brothers have created a cinematic masterpiece interpreting the same-named novel written by Cormac McCarthy, the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winning author. The brothers bring the story to film true-to-spirit, albeit with some editing for length and one noticeable character deviation which seems to be the result of their own philosophical prejudice (see Carla Jean's coin toss below).\n\nIn his book, McCarthy creates a paradoxical reality in which murderers are the only self-examined and morally consistent inhabitants. The seemingly innocent are doomed by virtue of their own philosophical and moral inconsistency.\n\nIn the book, and less so in the film, each chapter is prefaced with a narrative that, at first glance, appears to encapsulate the story's philosophical premise - that the world is going to hell in a hand basket. Yet in the end, this narrative amounts to nothing more than a kind of pervasive exasperation with the events that unfold and the world at large. The narrator, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, defies the typical role of narrator. Narrators generally provide direction, context, even omniscience. But here, Sheriff Tom (Tommy Lee Jones) offers only bewilderment, expressed in between Texas colloquialisms that hint at a deep, yet unfulfilled, search for the truth.\n\nMcCarthy and the Cohens immediately throw us off the track, setting up a gruff cowboy, Llewellyn Moss, as the likely protagonist. Moss, as it turns out, is not our classic protagonist. He is simply a pawn, a failed man, doomed to suffer the consequence of his own moral corruption. He chooses to hoard manna over compassion for another human being -- even over the safety of his nubile and unquestioning wife Carla Jean (played to a \"T\" by Kelly Macdonald). But like the biblical manna, which also appeared in the desert, hoarding it again corrupts.\n\nMoss is given more than one chance to redeem himself. When confronted by the film's guardian angel Carson Wells, complete with white hat and played with Texan precision by Woody Harrelson (think: a drawling Clarence from \"It's a Wonderful Life\"), he scoffs, insults and refuses what would appear to be divine intervention to save his doe-eyed Carla Jean. \n\nBut the film is bounded by a universal law of justice, as doled out by our arch antagonist turned protagonist, Anton Chigurh. He is the character who continues to push the action forward. But is he the angel of death? Is he fate? No, it turns out he is simply a force of nature -- a probability become absolute certainty in the quantum-collapsed-wave now moment. Once you have seen Anton, there is no going back. And only those who violate Anton's internally consistent sense of justice need see him. \n\nChigurh, or \"Sugar\" as Moss blasphemously refers to him, is the final curtain for those who cross him. And those who cross him always seem to underestimate him to the same degree that they under-examine their own lives. But seeing Chigurh is not a guaranteed ticket to the beyond. Some get a second chance by way of a coin toss, others are simply innocents passed over for another day. Yet others only have to run into Chigurh with their car to make the journey into the beyond.\n\nWhat is it that McCormick is trying to tell us? A message that the Cohens so deftly bring to the silver screen... Is it Nihilism? Existentialism? Predestination? Or is he simply telling us that unless we examine our own lives and live with moral consistency we will never be able to make sense of the outer world? A world that appears to Sherrif Tom as full of ever escalating violence, corruption and chaos? \n\nWhat remains consistent throughout the story is Chiguhr's sense of justice and his sense of connection to what he believes is universal law. Everyone else is compromised. In the book we learn that Ed Tom abandoned his post and his men in WWII and is forever attempting to compensate for this primary moral failing. Llewellyn abandons a dying man and his wife when he could have saved both. \n\nEven Ed Tom's wife abandons the outside world by never reading the news or watching TV. Carla Jean abandons reality via blind, unexamined faith. In the film, she refuses Chigurh's offer of a coin toss. In the book she accepts, leaving her fate seemingly to fate. But the toss changes nothing. As Chigurh explains, he is there for a reason. He arrived, \"the same way the coin did.\"\n\nChigurh reminds us, it is our decisions, made each day, one after another which bring us to this place we are in, in the present moment. And God help us if that place is sitting across from Anton Chigurh and his pressure-driven cattle gun -- just another dumb animal ready for the slaughter.",

The movie stars Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harleson. I'd been wanting to see this film for a while and well I finally saw it and it blew my mind. No County for Old Men is probably one of the best thrillers of the past decade. When Josh Brolin's character Llewelyn Moss stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and finds a case full of money he decides to take it. However after this hitman Anton Chigurh (played outstandingly by Javier Bardem) is sent after Llewelyn Moss to get back the money and kill him. Meanwhile Tommy Lee Jones plays the town sherif who's investigating the crime left behind by Anton. The acting is incredible and the violence is so brutal and gory I'm really suprised it didn't get an 18 rating here in the uk. My only problem with the film is the ending is a bit of an anticlimax, but it doesn't ruin the film at all. A+",

So well that I neglect the relative mediocrity of plot and character development. There is money at stake, and many people are after this, including a sociopathic hitman named Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Local sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), in awe upon how unconditionally brutal Chigurh is, aims to protect money holder Moss (Josh Brolin), as best as he can stomach. The film succeeds as a two-hour testament as to how unforgiving and dangerous the world can be, as well as a lack of justice when most needed. The Coen Brothers and Cormac McCarthy may not have much else to say, but for your attention, they need not say much else. If anything, it may be better to interpret No Country for Old Men as a horror-thriller, than as a neo-Western drama. Most horror movies fail to send me into a pit of despair, or to get the following out of my mouth: \"Yikes! ____ is one scary son of a bitch.\" And believe me, Chigurh consistently scared me, walking firmly on the edge between reality and urban legend.",

Cormac is not an author known for writing about sunshine and rainbows.  He writes about what he knows; bleak barren landscapes scarred by the elements of nature.  The people in the film are also scarred by the elements of life; and as such, makes them very fascinating people to watch.\n\nAll this makes it easy for a bounty hunter by the name of Anton Chigurh to exploit the people in this story to his own end; as they are too beaten down to offer much resistance.\n\nThe only weak part is the ending, which merits reducing my rating by half a star.

Yet another film created by a brotherly duo who it is safe to say are some of the best around in the film industry Directing and Writing wise and never seem to make films that are not at the very least good films. I personally felt that this film was firmly an excellent film and here below is why.\n\nThe story is as I say slow but with it's plot slowly seeping through to us the viewer, we are left with a thrilling film that can put us on the edge of our seats but at the same time leave us feeling something different for each and every character. With this movie you also get the scary personality of the basic villain but with no main character either it leaves us thinking who in the end won the game in this movie, and who lost, I think to be fair, that is for you to decide because no clear indications are ever given.\n\nThe real star of this is of course Javier Bardem who's hauntingly brilliant portrayal of hit man Chigurgh is both well acted and well written in, and with even his hair style making him seem more evil, Bardem controls all aspects of this film. Josh Brolin as the character we could possibly consider the main character does a good job and seems courageous but slightly scared in this dark role Brolin takes on. The rest of the follow up cast such as Tommy Lee Jones do a good job and Jones in particular although I would have like to have seen more of him, he manages to create a man who just understands all to well about human nature.\n\nThe Coen Brothers are of the course the main men behind this excellent production and direct and write this as well if the best they have ever done in there movie career. With a script that delves right into the heart of the characters, I felt that was one of the biggest positivity's in this film and created a film you couldn't not listen too. Even when the film gets slow the Brothers somehow manage to make this entertaining and bring to the party all there skills they have learnt previously in film, with a dabble of even comedy in certain parts which make the films characters almost insane.\n\nI felt although very little criticism should be aimed at this, the film never reaches the heights of being superb or anywhere near sublime as the story is a good one but I did feel it wasn't that smart and the Coen Brothers can make stories much more complex than this. The film is at parts very slow and with so much dialogue used at certain times, I would forgive people who disliked this because of that point, the film also lacks a climatic kind of feel and it ends with you thinking possibly, just possibly \"is that it\".\n\nThose who love the brothers work should love this too as although it may lack the smart angle I was saying about, it still boats magnificent acting and a thrilling plot which is also very good drama too. People who like basic dramas should also like this but the same goes for those looking for big loud film, stay away, people in this aren't killed just to entertain you they are part of the intricate plot and no one is deemed safe at all. I would also say if any people like watching films that did well at the Oscars this is one and it is a good mix of what all Oscar movies seem to have in them.\n\nOverall I give it a high 8/10, a Firmly Great movie which although doesn't warrant a moving up in rating, can I feel from you the audience be loved even more so than my rating and review. With the Coen Brothers they have made film that are brilliant, and after watching this I just thought \"keep making more exquisite films guys\" and so should you as I really do believe there are so many films they have made, it would be impossible for everyone to at least like one of them.",

Something akin to a thriller with the contours of a western and everything it inherently brings as thematic substance and plot machinery, all wrapped in a cinematic style marked by sophisticated laconism of expression. Money, opportunism and maniac whim propel men in this theater of events, the old-timers can nothing but critically contemplate the past, present and future state of a land that is still inhabited and has the stamp of the outlaws, gunfighters and bounty hunters particular ways of living and business affairs. We contemplate, as well, how the amoral and nihilistic mindset of these men relates to their actions and has consequences in the world around them and in their fates. Some of the themes essayed in No Contry For Old Men with great aesthetical artistry and sensibility, soberness with delicious moments of dark humor typical of the Coen duo, technically excellent. Based on a novel from Cormac McCarthy, NCFOM doesn't reach the lengths of Haneke's Caché in expressive austerity, but nonetheless this is one of the most accomplished and interesting works of contemporary cinema I've seen from the last years... just like Caché despite both being quite different outputs.

With that sociopathic tendency established, any suspense between Bardem and others is erased because I have already seen him kill innocent bystanders and the characters he is holding before him are so minor that I don't care either way. \n\nTommy Lee Jones' character is the most tedious part of this film, and I was forced to rewind the final scene three times to try and stay focused through his rumbling final monologue. Each time, I tuned out and was only snapped back into attention by the credits rolling. Not only was he boring, he ultimately played no part in the film's plot, which would have been far more entertaining if he was completely removed. \n\nOverall, No Country for Old Men is a rumbling, grumbling, dark and completely tedious tale that I do not wish upon anyone who values their time.",

The humor was off putting, the heightened style is an acquired taste to be sure & it's more philosophical questions are out of my scope of understanding. The film's energy is high, despite being a rather slow paced affair, but this is due to the very precise direction. The acting is really good, as all of the principals seem like they were born into these characters. The writing is definitely not to my liking in terms of dialogue, but the structure of the film flows well and the story is constructed in a way that aids contemplation. The motif of blood is wonderfully introduced and carried throughout, some of the character work plays fast and loose, but given the stylized nature of the film, I guess it's outside of the complaint zone. It's a simple enough film with complex implications, which are not shown in a satisfying way, at least for me. If you're in search of something different, give it a try.",

But this is a Coen Bros movie. It doesn't work that way. Our villain isn't just a villain. He's a ghost, a phantom, a representation of evil. He doesn't conform to villain plots. Our hero thinks he is on top of things, but he does not understand exactly what he is doing. Our supporting hero is old and broken. Even our damsel in distress is no damsel, but distress is certainly at hand. \nIf you like a film to build up plots and then have pay offs in a big, interlocking ending, then this film is not for you.

What I found really odd is why Brolin's character decided to return hours later with water for the dying drug dealer after he found a satchel full of money??  UMMM for 1 ... the dude was prolly dead already and 2 ... why the hell would u return after u stumbled on a drug deal gone bad, and he at this time had no idea that this money was being tracked??  That's just plain dumb.\n\nEnter the main antagonist of this pretty boring flick ... he was kinda cool, and I like his methodical way of making the victims choose their own fate, but seriously there was no back story on this \"HITMAN\" ... y was he going thru all this trouble ... he certainly wasnt in it for the money.  I get that he is pretty much nuts, but most times there has to be some point to wanton violence.  Guess there just wasnt one.\n\nAnd let me see ... Woody Harelson's and TL Jones role was kinda pointless and really had nothing to do with this lame story.  Oh ya ... Woody was yet another HITMAN that lasted oh what 20 mins and gets blown away and let me see ...  Jones was a sherriff that basically didnt nothing this entire movie.  Isnt he supposed to \"catch the bad guy\" or at least try??  He basically told old man stories the entire flick, and even with that he made no sense!\n\nI get that this movie is about moral choices ... and I believe that unless u make a poor decision ... do not waste 2 hours on this snoozefest ... or u HAVE chosen unwisely!\n\nI got it!!

Big kudos for director because every cast can show all out performances in this movie. i must write about the ending to give you all the expanation of the ending and prevent you dissapointed with the ending which  take big time for me to visited several famous critics site. everything i write below,  contained spoiler or something like that but if you read my review first, i assure it can be better if you understand the meaning before you watch it. first of all this movie has a deep meaning and focus on that meaning rather than give us a lot action scene or cat and mouse game. the meaning has expained in the ending through dreams which Sheriff Ed tell. there is two dreams which Sheriff Ed tell his wife. the meaning of first dream is the value which all people have forgotten in live. the value which we get since we born and we get from family or everbody around us but we failed keep that. the second is the right way how people should live in this world. This is the hope that the country - that country and every country - could eventually find out the right way to a place with a warm fire and much more light. but the question is why Sheriff Ed still alive? because if he choose justice he will be death and finally he choose not to choose it. that`s the prove final justice is not a part of this world. this movie prefer give us the reality than another movie which always give us the happy ending and show true justice must be the winner. and the meaning of  \"No country of Old men\" is back on story who the man died in 1909 because his heroic action but this man nephew (Sheriff Ed) choose not to seeking that justice because he know for now on, that`s no country for old men again. the world has been lost its value and justice can`t guarantee everybody life again.",

            "content": "People complain about endings way too often. I sat down and watched No Country for Old Men tonight and the entire movie blew me away but the ending is something I will not touch upon in this review but something I am willing to discuss. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones star in a fight for two million dollars. The Coen Brothers directed this masterpiece and it was all over the Oscars. Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin, stumbles on a drug deal gone badly in the middle of the desert in west Texas. He also stumbles upon two million dollars. Anton, Javier Bardem, is on a rampage as he wants to find the money. Ed Tom Bell, Tommy Lee Jones, is following the two of them in a battle for the cash.\n\tMovie making is an art form and any good director does everything on purpose. The Coen brothers did everything right in this movie. All three main characters are never seen on screen but are so much alike and connected.  If you dig deep into the details in this movie you will notice so many similarities between the three. The directing the two of the brothers do is one of the best I have ever seen in any movie. They choose to have very little music in their movie. That is a very bold and risky move in my opinion, but one that worked out beautifully. Most of the time you hear wind of the desert of a train in the distance. Dogs and children are constantly heard. Its music that makes the movie but also the little things.\n\tJavier Bardem scared me. There I said it and I don't regret it. He is straight up evil in this movie. He is evil but he also has a code of ethics or morals. He is the antagonist, the killer, the bad guy, but he is \"fair\". There are a few scenes where he confronts people. Sometimes he kills them and sometimes he does not. The idea of the coin flip and the person gets to make the call and if he/she is right, they get to live. That idea is terrifying and you can see it on the face of a gas station owner. I was on the edge of my seat as he was on the edge of his life. \n\tJosh Brolin does a great job in this movie but I hated Llewelyn. First of all I can't spell or say his name and I know that's not a good reason not to like somebody, but hey, it's my opinion. Llewelyn is supposed to be the protagonist but the actions he takes and how he acts I didn't really care if he lived or died. Not because his character was boring or unimportant, but because I knew I was supposed to cheer him on but he was a scumbag. His greed got to him as he became a nutcase with the money. He mistreated his wife, in my opinion, and just wasn't that great a guy to begin with. I hated his character but I loved the role he played in the movie. His end result in the movie wasn't disappointing, meaning I was happy with it, but I would have liked to see a little bit more out of it. There was a scene I needed to see with him in it, but it wasn't there.\n\tTommy Lee Jones is one of those actors who rarely flops and this is not one of them. Ed Tom is the cop trailing behind the two madmen fighting over the money. He has to put the pieces together. His role isn't too major and he kind of pops in and out of the movie, but he is magnificent. I lived his character; he was the real only pure character. This movie needed a guy like Ed Tom. He brought wit and charm to the character and as dark and exciting this movie was, it was also funny. \n\tThere is a scene I need to talk about. Llewelyn is at the Mexico border, covered in blood, and he runs into three guys. He tells the guy he will give him $500 for his shirt. The guy asks to see the money first. The other guy asks if he had been in a car accident, twice. Llewelyn gives him the money and then asks the other guy for his beer. The third guy asks how much for the beer. Now earlier I said how the three characters are connected. I mentioned this scene in particular; I'll let you figure out the rest. Think about it. It is the pure brilliance in this movie. \n\tIf I want to talk a flaw in this movie I would say its Woody Harrelson's character. I don't understand why he was there, I didn't find him important and he was a petty minor character. I probably didn't understand his importance because I couldn't understand a word he said. When I watch any movie I throw on subtitles but I watched this for a film class and there were no subtitles. The Texan accent annoyed me to pieces and parts of the movie were hard to understand. I give a pass to Tommy Lee Jones because he is like that and every movie. \n\tOverall, No Country for Old Men is an amazing movie. If you are a fan of movies and like a high detailed story than this is for you. If you like good acting and relatable characters than this is for you. If you like wild goose chases tan this is the movie for you. If you like Oscar worthy movies than this is for you. If you like movies that get the WillyT Seal of Approval, than this is the movie for you.",

The dialogue is beautiful and endlessly witty, and the actors, even if not perfect at their accents (I don't know what Bardem was trying to do, and I just accept it because his performance excels on all other levels), become so invested in their own persona that we laugh at them as if they were our best friends. No Country For Old Men is more thriller than comedy and more drama than thriller, but it embodies all three of these genres at the utmost level. It is wild and colorful and produced to excellent precision. The Coen Brothers prove their mastery over film and over philosophy.",

Later, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell played by Tommy Lee Jones struggles to contain the rapidly escalating violence that seems to be consuming his once-peaceful Lone Star State town. The Coen Brothers have pitched this movie well in all places and our three main actors do a finely great job especially from Javier Bardem who will later play another villain as Raoul Silva in Skyfall. Now I understand why people like this movie so much and therefore, it deserves to be praised. No Country For Old Men gets a solid 8.25/10.",

Couldn't abide by it. Plus my momma's in love with Tommy Lee and she's in love with Daddy. So there's that.\n\nI reckon Westerns deal mostly with physics. You got your forces and your stationary objects. Your forces are the good guys, and they have to move the objects, which are the bad guys, and then the movie's ended well. The question No Country for Old Men raises is, what if your object is equal to your force?\n\nJavier Bardem supplies the object, a hitman who operates on a code that is always merciless and often sadistic, and is terrifying in the role. Josh Brolin is a cowboy that defies the object. If he can simply move it, he stands to profit immensely. If he can't, he loses everything. And so he'll do whatever it takes to move it. Woody Harrelson is a bounty hunter opposing the object. He moves it because that's his job. Kelly MacDonald is Brolin's wife, who refuses to play by the object's rules. If she doesn't accept it, maybe it doesn't exist. And Tommy Lee (playing a man instead of a cartoon, as he is so often cast in his age), well, he's the sheriff, who says this at the outset:\n\n\"There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville here awhile back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a 14 year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it.... Said that if they turned him out, he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell: 'Be there in about fifteen minutes.' I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't.\"\n\nWhat if your object is equal to your force?

I would say that this was the way to go for the producers and directors since it creates a sort of eeriness about it as it should. I've heard people complain that this makes the movie very slow, as well as the movie not having enough or any \"Gung-ho\" action sequences. Then again, this movie was made after a book that was about the reality of what's going on in the border towns of the United States, and throughout Mexico in terms of drugs, and the cartels.

Javier Bardem is truly a genius and the scenes he's involved in are what I looked forward to while I watched this film.\n\nHowever, much of what I mentioned can also easily be seen as negatives. There really wasn't any climax, which is a fault of storytelling; the reason why Bardem was so powerful was because you really don't care about any of the other characters; and if this film's climax is a long dialogue with a character that doesn't have too much importance to the plot of the film (Jones), then that's another fault for the screenplay. Not to mention the cheap editing tricks like cross dissolve and fade to black are used constantly in the film and they put you out of it.\n\nAll in all, some good performances, interesting dialog and exciting sequences, but the audience wants more.",

But Bardem steals the show every scene he's in. He is dark, yet calm and he'll fuck you up without remorse. Harrelson comes in second as he is a great actor. Jones is fourth. Brolin is last. Not to diss Brolin, but he is up against a well rounded cast. \n\nThe dialogue in this film is outstanding. It's as if Tarantino wrote a script that was darker than his films (which are comedies).

            "content": "No Country For Old Men follows the same footsteps as the Coen Brothers previous just as dark and witty drama Fargo. But that is where the a likenesses stop because unlike Fargo, No Country For Old Men manages to thrill the audience on an even higher scale. It sees a small town sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempting to prevent the likely demise of a hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than two million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande. Which happily leads to Javier Bardem. A ruthless, psychopathic hitman that wants Moss in the palms of his hands. So does this film seem simple enough to you. I mean, it is a cat and mouse chase film, that in small places reminds us of the Terminator but how simple this film may appear it certainly does one thing. It stands out from the crowd, with its exceptional writing and directing, this film is a flawless adaption of Cormac McCarthy's Novel. I don't think there is another screenwriter or director that can touch what the Coen Brothers have achieved here, however saying that we do have Quentin Tarantino for Pulp Fiction, but you get the picture. In No Country For Old Men, it is very much like a battle between Heaven and Hell, with one man caught in the middle. That man being Moss. With the four Oscars this film managed to achieve Javier held his Oscar up high with his supporting role as Anton Chigurh. Which maybe I wouldn't go as far to say it is deserved but it was certainly earned. \n\nTo say that Chigurh isn't a character is faulty. It's like saying the film is beautiful except that, that and that. Just because Chigurh doesn't act with the same motivations of other movie killers, doesn't mean he isn't a character. As one great man said just because you are a character, doesn't mean you have character. Chigurh represents something more. You could even say he is the Hannibal Lector of the crowd with his random questions and subjects of conversations, not to mention his strong psychopathic nature. Chigurh is often referred by peers (not friends) as 'crazy', which is accurate but surly there is more to him than that, isn't there? He has a very easy mind but remains strong and firm against the moving world surrounding him. He clearly works solo and it doesn't feel that he works for anyone (Well I don't think he does anyway). He doesn't get angry when his life is in serious danger but more annoyed and frustrated when Moss' wife won't call heads or tails or when a receptionist won't tell him where Moss works. We see him toying and having fun with people, like the clerk at a gas station who married a wife who was into the gas station business. The interesting thing about this confrontation is you see that Chigurh isn't only just a killer, but he's not afraid to tell it like it is. \n\nI can genuinely say No Country For Old Men is one of my favourite films of this decade if not of all time and a clear Oscar grabber as its great writing, great acting and superb directing ensures that. However to fully appreciate this film it needs to be viewed several times but that's okay because it deserves to be seen more than once. Verdict: Films don't get much better and sophisticated as this and even though it is a cat and mouse chase film it certainly isn't predicable and has surprises around every corner. This film of course gets an A+.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men is one of the best films they have ever made, and Cormac McCarthy's novel gives them the perfect setting for their stories of chaos in this seemingly normal world. The story involves 3 different men in search of the same thing, but for different reasons, which is a plot that resembles Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. However, this is more of a western fable that deals with the moral decadence of society. Anton, Llewellyn, and Tom are the main characters searching for the money that was left behind at a drug deal gone bad. Anton is evil, he's played by Javier Bardem, who gives an amazing performance, Anton is searching for the money not so much because he's greedy, but because he thinks it belongs to him. And he will kill almost anyone who gets in the way of that, but he has what you can call principles, which really just means he kills only when it seems to have value for him. Llewellyn wants the money basically because he found it, and it's money, so he's not gonna give it up. And Tom is the only one searching for the money with honest reasons, he is the sheriff trying to put an end to Anton's blood trail, and the best way to end it is to get what is the cause of it. All these characters perfectly demonstrate where our ambitions have gone, how far our vanity has gone, and where our morals used to reside. This really is one of the most well written, directed, acted, and photographed of all the Coens' films. It is paced like a thriller, photographed like a western, and written like the Coens' brand of noir, which makes for a super entertaining film with much more depth than the average film. No Country for Old Men is a film that no one should miss, and every film buff should have multiple viewings of.",

            "content": "I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.\r\n\r\nWhat are Anton Chigurh's true motives? Does he have a philosophical doctrine that we the audience are unaware of or are just unable to comprehend? What Anton does is create alot of questions that arise from his actions and his interactions with the other characters. To watch a character as odd as him is fascinating and I cannot give enough credit to Javier Bardem in portraying such a character that is so enigmatic and just his presence alone is able to evoke so much mystery. Even though Anton is very incomprehensive, it is all made up for by being able to be somehow captivated by him.\r\n\r\nHow every character deals with Anton is interesting, to say the least and as the film progresses, the feeling of despondency increases gradually. The lack of heroes is what gives this film its sense of hopelessness and that feeling of hopelessness is basically set in stone from the first few shots coupled with Tommy Lee Jone's epic voiceover narration in introducing the story. It is the perfect introduction to what we will witness in the story and what it all means for a sheriff like him in comprehending these events. As the events occur, we the audience reflect on these situations just as much as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this role is impressive and is injected with a great sense of humanity. I commend his portrayal as Bell, in that he is the character who carries the weight of the story.\r\n\r\nThe acting is a huge fragment in bringing this film to life, but what also does that is how the visuals are executed and it is definitely utilized to a great effect. From its majestic shots to its beautiful lighting and color tones, the Coen brothers set a mood that permeates the whole film. Its barren settings really add a feeling of desolation that is at the same time hypnotic and surreal. While the film can be suspenseful and its suspense is definitely executed perfectly, the film still somehow manages to maintain an air of mystique. The non-existence of a soundtrack really gives the film a feeling of loneliness, all the while adding an even greater sense of sterility to its already barren wasteland.\r\n\r\nI can go on and on about the great acting, its memorable shots and its great script, but what makes 'No Country' a great film is that it manages to be truly idiosyncratic in its execution just like how the Coen Brothers' other great films are. Even if a film like this leaves me more questions than answers, if it still manages to captivate me to a point that I'm willing to return to it, then that shows that it doesn't matter if I don't have any answers to my questions. There are only a few films that are able to pull this off naturally and 'No Country for Old Men' is definitely one of those special films that can do just that.",

And they do it very well, maybe better than they ever have before. First of all, the screenplay conveys the main message of this film implicitly, but also clearly if you pay very close attention, which by the way, is necessary for viewing this film. But the main message that I get from this, is that our aspirations and ambitions have all fell to the wayside, and the only thing we care about anymore is ourselves and money. And I have to agree with that, which also contributes to my love of this film. Second of all, i have to commend Javier Bardem's performamce as the psychopathic, yet somewhat principled Anton, and also the rest of the cast does very well, giving this masterpiece another level of ingenuity.

I don't think that Javier Bardem deserved Best Supporting Actor because that part wouldn't have been that hard to play, to me a character really has to have depth so I think that Casey Affleck sould have won for The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford. No Country for Old Men is full of such detailed drama, that in the end it really doesn't pay off, the film really is a 3 1/2 star film, because it is such an unlikely film for the Coen Brothers to take on.

Although the bone chilling Bardem will kill anyone standing in his way, he is after the treasure in which Brolin has stumbled upon after what seems to have been a Mexican standoff. Sherriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is a very peaceful, yet protective man. He won't stop until he finds Bardem and stops him in his plan to hunt down Brolin. He is kind but realizes his time may be up for he is an old timer. A short appearance from Woody Harrelson is always pleasant and he shows that again in this film. The nitty gritty, the chase, the drama, the anxiety, is lurking through every corner of this movie.

The Coen brothers were really loyal to the work of Cormac McCarthy, as both the wild landscape that builds the film and its incredible characters.\nThe story begins with Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a former Vietnam veteran, finds a briefcase with 2 million dollars at a crime scene. Suddenly sees himself being hunted by pure evil that is the character Anton Chigurh (Javier Barden), a violent persecution ranging from Texas to the Mexican border. And just behind them, the sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in the hunt for Anton and somehow protect Llewelyn. Most intriguing in this persecution is that the three characters never interact, just the chase between them that increases every second.\nThe cast is perfect, both Tommy and Josh are perfect, but Javier is FANTASTIC in every detail, her character is so evil and cruel and at the same time very intriguing. He is the wild cat that wants the fatness-the money from Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee of old dog that wants to do \"justice\".\nThe Coen brothers are overcome by delivering a film written and performed in a fantastic way, a story that delivers a chase full of insane terror, thriller and a modern Western.",

He is tracked down by Anton Chigurh, a psychotic hired killer across Texas as the chain reaction escalates.\n\nAdapted from a Cormac McCarthy novel, fast becoming a Coen favourite, the brother directors take on a classic crime style story but add their own fantastical style.\n\nJavier Bardem is almost perfect in the film, playing opposite the brilliant Brolin, whilst Tommy Lee Jones strange part in the story is carefully and gently crafted by an excellent performance from Jones.\n\nBut every component of the film is mastered to a particular thriller style, in a very Coen way. The normalities of any Coen piece are there, with the memorable storyline, complicated twists and turns and well above average cinematography. However the enticing poetic nature of the film is what makes it stand above the rest and pull you ever deeper into the character's lives, both normal and abnormal.\n\nAnd what to say of the action sequences themselves? Superb, as well as never losing sight of the basic plot and using wonderful characterisation.\n\nThe plot itself is complicated and the end of the film, whilst panned by some, is actually devilishly clever and a fantastic ending. Its supposed ambiguity may frustrate some, although when you watch for a second time the majority of the ambiguity washes away.\n\nThe Coen's brother collection of films make it hard to point definitely to just one as their unchallenged masterpiece, but in the ranks of their greatest films, as well as some of the finest cinema to come out of America in years, 'No Country For Old Men' ranks at the top.",

Este argumento, por si só, já é batido demais. Porém, os Irmãos Coen colocaram uma pitada de \"os tempos mudaram\" em sua narrativa, sob o ponto de vista de um velho (e incompetente) Xerife, para tentar fugir do clichê. Isso seria bem interessante se fosse melhor explorado, uma vez que só se evidencia no começo e no final da trama.\n\n\nPara piorar, o desenvolvimento do filme é carregado de falhas. Chega a ser patético o fato do bandido Chigurh (Javier Bardem) encontrar Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), o portador da maleta, em qualquer lugar. No início, tal fato é justificável devido a maleta ter um localizador escondido, mas e depois que o mesmo é descoberto e retirado dela? Sem falar que estou até agora sem entender a parte em que Moss esconde a maleta no duto ventilação de um hotel e depois pega outro quarto, fazendo uma tremenda gambiarra para retirá-la. Lembrando que até essa cena ele não sabia da existência do localizador. Outra interrogação que ficou em minha cabeça foi: por que diabos uns assassinatos são mostrados e outros não? Se o objetivo foi o de tornar a trama mais complexa, não funcionou. E a maneira pela qual o veterano Xerife Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) é inserida na história, leva o espectador a questionar sua competência, chegando atrasado nas cenas dos crimes e sem falar que, em certo momento, ele vê os bandidos fugindo e prefere parar para ver o que aconteceu do que persegui-los.\n\n\nMas há também muitos pontos positivos na obra dos Coen. O mais destacável é a magistral atuação de Javier Bardem, que dá um tom assustador ao seu mitológico personagem, e faz muitos estragos apenas com um tubo de pressão para matar gado. A interpretação de Bardem e a caracterização de seu personagem faz o mesmo entrar na lista dos melhores vilões da história do cinema. O Oscar de melhor ator coadjuvante foi merecidissimo ao contrário dos outros 3 que o longa foi premiado. Falando em atuações, é sempre muito bom ter Tommy Lee Jones no elenco. Aqui, apesar de achar que o mesmo foi mal aproveitado, sua presença dá um charme a mais. Josh Brolin dá para o gasto, em uma atuação que não exige muito. O filme também contém alguns, digo alguns, diálogos interessantes e reflexivos. E quando existe o nome de Roger Deakins envolvido numa produção é certeza que temos uma fotografia magnífica e aqui, colabora para aumentar o tom sombrio e de suspense em algumas cenas. A mais memorável delas é a que Moss está em um hotel, percebe que Chigurh está lá, apaga a luz e fica com a arma apontada para a porta, observando os vultos do corredor pela soleira. Esses pontos salvam a produção do pior.\n\n\nQuando o filme acaba (e por sinal o final é muito fraco), ficamos com a sensação de que \"Onde Os Fracos Não tem Vez\" poderia ter sido bem melhor. O rascunho é excelente, apesar da historinha clichê, mas contém furos gritantes de desenvolvimento. Existem detalhes no cinema que podem ser ignorados com facilidade e infelizmente isso não acontece aqui.\nTalvez, o mais decepcionante foi ver este ganhar de \"Sangue Negro\" na disputa pelo Oscar de melhor filme. Definitivamente, a principal premiação de cinema do mundo não serve mais como referência de qualidade.",

The title, \"No Country for Old Men\", speaks volumes to the characters and even the directors themselves.  These are filmmakers that have a deep perspective on film that has been influenced by so many classics.  They've reached back through that perspective to create a movie so thought provoking and elaborate that it will probably pass the general publics minds and be left behind by this generation.  Most will see a film about a fugitive and his two pursuers but so much more is being said and asked, and I could easily watch this movie two or three more times to get an even firmer grasp on its deep truths.

Coen Brothers does a good task with directing this film,building up tension and fear in the minds of people watching this. One of the most interesting characters in this film is that of Javier Bardem's who acts really well in this film. He could have been one of the best villains in the Hollywood history, but improper treatment ruins the climax of this film and reduces your likeliness to this character. Bardem carries his own special weapon, a weapon which consists of an air filled cylinder and a trigger that can emit the air at high velocities that can kill people. Also he carries this shotgun of his fitted to a large silver coloured silencer which emits raining bullets. Bardem is a better and scarier villain in this than he is in Skyfall(2012) which is the only film other than this that I have seen him.\r\n\r\n\r\n              I really liked Josh Brolin a lot in this film, and that is also a reason why I didn't like this film. I would tell frankly, the film is good till 1hr and 36 minutes. After this Josh Brolin dies, here is the first problem, Coen brothers doesn't show you how he died. Also after this the film looses it's momentum and becomes utterly dramatic with more of dialogues and less of the film' characteristic violence. For the violence part, this film isn't that violent. Tommy Lee Jones was good, but he didn't make an expression on me. Kelly Macdonald keeps up that old american accent of 1980s through the entire duration of the film while both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones forget it somewhere along the cinema. \r\n\r\n\r\n           I disliked the Coen Brothers' style of not showing you the entire picture of a situation. There is a scene in the climax where Bardem confronts Kelly Macdonald and he comes to her place for what he is fit for. Then after some tense dialogues, Bardem walks out of her house. Here, they didn't show you whether she was killed or not, another thing that I didn't like. As an optimist I believe that she was not killed. Also on his way back, Bardem's car collides with a car that came by violating the traffic signals, isn't that a poor coincidence. There this film ends here. So this film doesn't have a usual ending. This doesn't mean that I was craving for more action or something, but I was demanding something that surprised or shocked me, rather than winding up with an art house ending.\r\n\r\nThe film becomes bad after the absence of Josh Brolin and I really expected a pure western movie, but Coen brothers ultimately ruin the party. But however, Javier Bardem's and Brolin's performances are never to be ignored. But what does the title of the film have to do with the idea of the film?\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/image-tfb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KvTI5VxERHY/UO3ouQip2L/AAAAAAAACkk/atGqIV3nORg/s1600/NO+Country+for+Old+Men.jpeg[/IMG]",

It's only unsatisfying if you believe there is only one way to end a film; by tying up all the loose story ends in a nice little Hollywood bow. It aint real life so get over it and appreciate the subtleties the Coen brothers have mastered in this incredible film. \n\nI admit when we started watching this I was bored. I was in the mood for something fast paced, action packed, something to appeal to my sleepy mind. Once you get into the pace of this film and embrace the lingering landscapes, you may find yourself falling in love with this  'modern western'. \n\nThis was a film for me, that the longer I thought about it afterwards the more I could see how much of a masterpiece it really is. True there is little character development, but there doesn't need to be; it's a chase plot between good and evil. Humans will inevitably side with the good character, especially when he's being shot at with a massive gun and I mean massive! So we don't really need to see his development over the course of the film. He is poor, he finds 2 million dollars, he takes the money and must pay the consequences. \n\nAs for the character of Anton; the emotionless killer, all we know of him is that he was hired to track down the missing drug money and instead turns upon those who hired him and decides to go after the money for himself. When a character executes such an amount of random and senseless killing we need no more motive or background to feel satisfied about this character's actions, simply put he is evil. \n\nThis film keeps you on the edge most of the time. As far as tense dramas/ thrillers go, it's one of the best I've seen in a long time. With brilliant direction and such an enigmatic character as Anton blasting people away you can't help but feel the heart begin beating a little bit faster.\n\nAnyway, this definitely tops the list of best movies for '07. I can't wait for the DVD to hear more commentary from the Coen brothers about how they made this remarkable film. In an interview they were talking about the discussion whether or not to show the hallway when Llewelyn enters his room and how it was decided to show it so that the audience had that image in their minds for when Anton is standing on the other side of the door. Details like this fascinate me and show how the creative minds of these brothers work. Amazing film.",

The story is relatively straight forward for the most part and isn't entirely unique, save that the hitman chasing Josh Brolin's character is a psychopath, played superbly by Javier Bardem, who is certifiably creepy but you can't help but root for in a sense, starting with a fantastic series of dialogue with a gas station attendant and the fact that he uses an air shotgun (no, there really isn't any other way to put it) that allows him to shoot locks out of their doors, and kill with the efficiency of a gun without ever needing to use a bullet. There are thrilling moments, and a plot twist towards the end is completely surprising for someone who hadn't read the book. I didn't like this movie as much as most seem to, but my issues are with the main character. The whole movie you are convinced the main character is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), and during this time you are never really given a reason to care about what happens to him because Brolin gives a relatively sterile and emotionless performance that is nowhere near as riveting as Bardem. But a plot twist occurs and Tommy Lee Jones becomes the main character with a decent performance, but he doesn't get enough screen time as this portion doesn't really last that long and the ending is, well, nonexistant. I ended up wishing Jones had a larger role and Brolin had a smaller role. Still a movie I would recommend, but not quite as good as I thought it would be.\n\n3.5 stars: Good, not great",

He's basically being Woody, but he does it so well.  Give Kelly MacDonald some credit too, as she is actually Scottish, and being a Texan (convincingly most of the time).

It certainly speaks to the skill of the Coen brothers when they can keep a film simple, yet nuanced.  The Coen brothers also bring out excellent performances in whoever they cast.  There are a lot of stellar actors in this film but the clear standout is Javier Bardem.  He is simply fantastic.  Every time he is on screen, the film peaks in suspense and intensity.  You just know that something bad is going to happen or someone is going to die.  Bardem has that ill-at-ease, yet calm creepiness that makes your hair stand on end.

            "content": "No Country for Old Men\n\nEvil comes in different shapes and forms â\" Along the way it tags with its deadliest counterpart âfearâ?. As long as we have fear encapsulating us everything seems big and glorified. Any living being that conquers fear hits an impenetrable wall called âcourageâ? eventually leading to absolute power. There are not many standing examples (alive or dead) for the analogy above because fear tramps and trumps almost all the time. When such a compelling feeling falls in to the lap of Coen Brothers through an enticing hand write from one of the most gripping authors, Cormac McCarthy, then the same fear runs amok with blood soaked feet. Outcome is no less gritty then âNo Country for Old Menâ?.\n\nPlot:\n\nJust when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is having a bad hunting day in the wild desert lands of goodâ(TM)ol Texas, he comes across a blood bathed Mexican drug deal gone awry. Pretty soon heâ(TM)s packing a bag full of cash and is ready to whistle away for the rest of his life. He has no iota of an idea about the two monsters he has beckoned on to himself â\" one a tiny little tracking device sitting in his back and two a humanly monster of a hitman, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), trying to track him down to the bones. Central portion of the story circles around this wildly gripping chase pulling along other commendable characters only when they are needed. What happens to Moss â\" What happens to Chigurh can only be answered after you feel enough of hot blood under your boots.\n\nThe movie starts off with an epic soliloquy of an introduction from Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones in one of his finest performances) about Wild West Texas, increased degree of violence and heinous crimes around the area. \nâThe crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. A man would have to put his soul at hazardâ?\nCited above is one of the best quotes from the movie and thatâ(TM)s what sets the pace to viewer expectations. Right from the word go the film has everything to do with being gritty, gory, insane, melancholic, violent and menacing. \n\nAnalysis:\nThough we have the main characters Moss and Tom Bell â\" the movie is all about Chigurh (so nearly rhyming with Sugar but no hell of a sweetener). Javier Bardem as the cold blooded hitman is downright scary and wrought iron tough. He makes everyone fall in love with âBADâ? and true movie lovers would want to see more of him as the movie culminates to a so called bizarre ending in the minds of many. But from a pure cinematic bliss, you donâ(TM)t want the character to end and Coenâ(TM)s deliver that in their unique style. All through the film Javier underplays his expressions to such ridiculous extent that at one point of time all you can visualize is violence. In a way it doesnâ(TM)t look like violence inflicted by a person but it transcends down to violence itself dancing in front of us.\n\nJosh Brolin is effective as a huntsman and bizarrely caring husband at the same time. Heâ(TM)s extremely natural in the scenes leading to fighting for his life and against his sugary foe â\" Chigurh. Tommy lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell delivers one of the finest performances of his career. He is extremely empathetic over the course of film as he uncovers the truth of being âno matchâ? to an evil. Kelly McDonald as Mrs. Moss draws in the sentimental quotient needed for the film. If there is one character thatâ(TM)s absolutely wasted in the film then itâ(TM)s â\" Woody Harrelson as hired operative Carson Wells. He is introduced with so much of infused confidence and rigor but ends up dying cheaply like a bird shot.\n\nComing to the creators â\" Coen brothers never disappoint you with their eccentricity and thanks to the scripts and stories they choose â\" long live craziness. Just like all their movies, the film is filled with everything that can be evil and how it can outbeat things like good, law, order, faith etc. Itâ(TM)s simply an outstanding mockery of everything a society or a community believes, in terms of their rules and operatives. There is no modus operandi but being zany.\n\nMemorable scenes:\n\n--> Chigurh unleashing his cylinder weapon for the first time\n--> Chigurh shooting at a bird while driving over it just for the absolute psychotic pleasure of it â\" You cannot help but fall in love with this scene\n--> Chigurh simply raising his foot from the floor and placing them over the bed as Carsonâ(TM)s blood acts as an interruption to his phone call\n--> Josh Brolin trying to escape from the vehicle hunting him and eventually killing the dog on his tail\n--> Chigurh silently pulling the strings on a gas station owner showing his violent and not so negligible demonic side\n\nThe list just goes on as the whole movie is nothing but a culmination of 122 minutes of memorabilia. If there was no Joker then Chigurh would have been the best anti-hero Hollywood wouldâ(TM)ve ever seen and we should thank Coen brothers down to their cheeks for giving us something so wonderful (on screen).\n\nMemorable dialogs from the movie:\nCouldnâ(TM)t resist but quote some of the best dialogs ever penned\n\nLlewelyn Moss: If I don't come back, tell mother I love her. \nCarla Jean Moss: Your mother's dead, Llewelyn. \nLlewelyn Moss: Well then I'll tell her myself.\n\nLlewelyn Moss: How would you describe him? \nCarson Wells: I guess I would say he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh. \nLlewelyn Moss: Sugar? \nCarson Wells: Chigurh, Anton Chigurh. Do you know how he found you?\n\nMan who hires Wells: [about Chigurh] Just how dangerous is he? \nCarson Wells: Compared to what? The bubonic plague?\n\nNervous Accountant: Are you going to shoot me? \nAnton Chigurh: That depends. Do you see me?\n\nTail Piece:\n\nThe movie is supposed to be hated by all women folk and it scored 1000% when my wife hated it like the best thing she ever hated ;)",
