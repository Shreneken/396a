    "summary": "Nick (Ice Cube) and Suzanne (Nia Long) decide to move to the suburbs to create a better life for children Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden). The contractor (John C. McGinley) they hire to renovate their home has a rather odd way of doing business, complicating the family's move. Matters spiral further out of control when the contractor clashes with Nick but bonds with Suzanne and the children.",

            "content": "This makes the first one look like Airplane! There is basically no story in this besides they buy a house and stuff happens. I don't know why the kids returned for this because they are barely in it and play no part in this like the first. The jokes are HORRENDOUSLY bad...its just stupid slapstick and ridiculous shenanigans that don't have any bit of cleverness to them or relate to telling a story. The music is not good either being generic and not really fitting anything. The acting is terrible with horrible dialogue half the time. It's a shame because the actor who plays Chuck I could see him being a good actor if given something to work with that is not ridiculous. His wife dying makes no sense with explaining how he has so many roles. The editing overall is just bad as well even though the camerawork is actually good. There is no visual story to tell at all and no scenes are memorable. Stay away like the plague.",

Cute family movie I thought that it was not as bad as people have rated it. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea but I have seen worse movies then this one, alright movie in my opinion. I have seen this movie a few times but I have not seen it in a while but I would maybe watch this movie again.",
