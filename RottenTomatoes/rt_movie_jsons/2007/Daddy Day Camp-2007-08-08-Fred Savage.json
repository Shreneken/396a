The men face a near impossible task; not only must they renovate the place, but they face stiff competition from nearby Camp Canola, which is run by Charlie's arch-rival, Lance (Lochlyn Munro). Charlie asks his estranged father for help in restoring Driftwood's former glory.",

The acting is bad, the grandfather colonel is out of place, Phil & Charlie give lazy performances with terrible slapstick and juvenile gross out gags. The kids lack any charm at all and no one has any chemistry. The villian is just as stupid as the first. The cinematography is bad as well. The camerawork is basic and uninspired, every other shot is filled with gross out humor or toilet jokes and the location is boring as well. The music isn't that good even for just being generic overall, it feels like its just the same as the first but it doesn't fit as \"well\" (use that term very loosely). The editing isn't good and the pacing is terrible. Things just happen and half this movie is montages. The kids half the time don't even have arks outside of the bed wetter, Ben I guess learning to climb and the stupid love story. Skip this completely even if you somehow \"Liked\" the first one.",

It would've been better with Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin (who probably weren't going to be paid enough with this movie's budget) and I actually liked Daddy Daycare much more. The other thing is that in the final act, this movie basically sends the message that cheating is okay to do in revenge (even though the grandfather says that you have to out-smart cheaters, but all they do is cheat in some of the competitions right back with their unique kids/characteristics)! Lazy writing.",

You may enjoy this- if your idea of a fun hour and a half is screaming, vomiting children with plenty of cheap, disgusting toilet humour. This movie gave me literal nightmares, but don't give it that much credit- for anyone who's scared of vomit, the three exaggerated, unnecessary vomiting scenes will really hit hard. If I had to put it shortly: a gross, boring, movie that is a sequel to a series that was destined to fail. Dull plot. Words of advice: DON'T GO NEAR THIS NIGHTMARE ON CAMERA. You'll thank me later.",

Esta era una película que siempre veía de mas chico y me gustaba mucho por lo que decidí volver a verla y fue una sorpresa ver que a casi nadie le gusto. Tampoco estaba enterado que es una secuela de \"La guardería de papa\" y resulta que en esta hay un cambio de actores por lo que eso quizás influye mas en las malas criticas. A mi parecer no es una mala película, es disfrutable y creo que para los mas chicos funciona, así como me gustaba a mi. Tiene una trama entretenida con un mensaje bastante bueno, eso es lo que mas destaco. Los chistes son bastante tontos y no me causaron gracia en la mayoría. Por ultimo, las actuaciones no son nada de otro mundo, los que mas se destacan son Cuba Gooding Jr., Lochlyn Munro y Richard Gant. En conclusión, una película bastante regular pero que creo que funciona para los mas chicos, siendo disfrutable y con un mensaje muy bueno. La recomiendo.",

It dropped from the ceiling. You clearly see the kid face down puking his brains out how'd it get up there. Only one thing for Cuba to puked on again. Sort a. Then at the end the kid pukes all over another (revealing that his vomit is white like a babies) kid at the competing camp during Tug of War. In the end the a fat kid urinates in a balloon and throws it at another kid. Did I mention the acting is fucking shit. Too over the top and not in a good way. A very bad way. So much fart jokes and 3 vomiting jokes on other people by the same little fucker jack. Hate that fucking kid. Never have anyone be puked on ever. It's not funny seeing someone puke on to other people. Especially all over girls BREAST. It ruins there chances for guys wanting to touch them cause they know they've been puked on.

Ten years ago, having a former Academy Award winner starring in this dreck would have been shocking. But now, considering the downward spiral Gooding's career has become, this is merely par for the course. As for the other past members, there's the generic fat guy and a young mop-haired actor apparently subbing for Steve Zahn. None of the child actors have any charisma at all, and most of them only appear to be reading lines without any idea of what the words mean. \r\nThey each have their \"thing\" (uncontrollable vomiting, unreasonable intelligence, etc.) and that's what passes as being a \"character\". The one positive here is the mercifully short running time that could have been shortened even more if the writers cut out all of the jokes about bodily functions. And stuck in the middle of it all is Mr. \"Show me the money\", wondering how it all went wrong.\r\n\"Daddy Day Camp\" was made for kids, and they'll probably eat it up.

            "content": "Daddy Day Camp is a cinematic achievement, worthy to be mentioned along side other great childrenâs films such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Wizard of Oz, and Toy Story. It is a sincere, magical tale that all generations can enjoy. By now I hope you realize that Iâm full of shit. Daddy Day Camp is the cinematic equivalent of horse manure. Wait a minute- I canât even say that because at least with horse crap you can grow something useful. The only thing that Daddy Day Camp grows is a reputation of being one of the worst films ever made.\n\n\nThe film is a sequel to 2005âs Daddy Day Care, which wasnât a very good movie itself, and has the distinction of having absolutely no one from the original film in its cast (the fact that Iâve said that means that someone will correct me. Iâm going to be honest, I didnât waste the time checking because whatâs the point). This time around Charlie (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Phil (Paul Rae) end up running a day camp due to Charlieâs childhood nightmare of blowing a triathlon at Camp Driftwood thirty years earlier. From here it goes into a crappy version of Meatballs/Bad News Bears as the campers compete against the rival Camp Canola. Farting and belching ensues.\n\n\nWe could address the problems with Daddy Day Camp one by one, but I have to eat sometime and, letâs be honest, most of you out there know that this movie sucks. I knew it sucked, but I had a 2 for 1 rental and my son wanted to see it because of the first one. He liked it, but a good fart joke is like Richard Pryor to him, too. Iâve gone over the story, which is pretty much every other underdog camp story known to man. Only this time itâs executed very poorly. Itâs cringe worthy. The acting also fails on all levels. Iâm not going to blame the kids because theyâre kids, but letâs look at the guy that won an Oscar. The idea that Cuba Gooding, Jr. won an Academy Award leaves a little bit of green on poor old Oskieâs head. Heâs the Pat Quinn of the Academy, being in the right place at the right time. I know I can say the same thing about Marisa Tomei, but at least she had a good turn in The Wrestler and not because she was topless. The tell tale sign was when Eddie Murphy didnât do this movie. When Eddie Murphy wonât even be in your movie then you know itâs going to be garbage. Eddie and bad movies is like Mikey and Life cereal- he just canât get enough. Enter Cuba.\n\n\nKids will like Daddy Day Camp. So save it for a long car ride and give them some head phones. Let the 90 minutes of joy engulf them as they watch. Ten years from now theyâll see it on cable, watch five minutes and realize âThis movie sucks, letâs watch Night Patrolâ. You know itâs comingâ¦",

I love Cuba and think he is a great actor so it pains me to see him melting away in front of us on the screen. Had it been a Sandlot, or Big Green, or Little Giants, or Bad New Bears, or Heavyweights, or Mighty Ducks, than it wouldn't have been so bad. But, as it stands Daddy Day Camp had no intelligent jokes, no originality, and nothing at all worthy of redeeming a failing career. Please Cuba find your Men of Honor/Jerry Maguire form again, it is sorely needed.",

Incidentally this cake reads \"Daddy Day Care, Class of 2007\" so I am lead to believe there have been several \"classes\" in this Day Care scheme and I am left to wonder why this monstrous experiment has been allowed to continue for this long. We see a montage of kids acting \"precious\" (read: fucking shit up), there is paint splashing everywhere, urinating into plant pots. It's the sacking of Rome, writ small.\n\nCuba Gooding Jnr continues his self-destructive downward spiral into fiery oblivion, it doesn't even appear that he's trying to do an Eddie Murphy impresson. He merely looks like he's doing an impression of a man who isn't imploding in on himself into a black hole of irrelevance, and he isn't doing a very good job of that.\n\nCuba and some fat guy who is playing Jeff Garlin's character but not actually bothering to be the same kind of character that Jeff Garlin tends to play (which is always the sign of a good sequel), not only do they not look like the right characters but they don't even act like them!\n\nLochlyn Munro plays some rich asshole who bullied Cuba as a child and wants to buy out Cuba and not-Jeff Garlin's old childhood summer camp, in an act of petty vengeance Cuba and not-Jeff Garlin buy a share in the camp and are left to run it when the former owner, the always reliable Brian Doyle-Murray, hauls ass out of the camp and out of the movie like the wise man he is.\n\nNow, Munro was a damn legend in Dead Man on Campus, so I give him a free pass for being here, and that's more than he deserves. Nobody else gets a free pass here.\n\nPredictably the camp needs a little work, there is a methane problem in the bathoom, and apparently that manifests itself with mysterious farting noises coming out of the pipes. Does methane actually do that? I'm not a scientist, so I wasn't aware that farts could just happen without any biological function to facilitate them. These phantom farts are probably the most fascinating concept in the entire film, but all it serves to do is set up a predictable toilet explosion scene later on, so the mystical ghost flatulence is squandered with an easy joke. I expected so much more from thi- OK, I can't finish that. Sarcasm only stretches so far before it snaps back in your face and lacerates the surface of your eyeballs.\n\nAfter some haphazard maintenance is carried out on the camp, they are ready for business, and out roll the children. Aww, look how sweet and smart they all are, right? Full of personality and spunk! What little treasures...\n\nLittle fucking bastards, they are!\n\nThere is nothing that makes me want to wield a shotgun in a public place more than kids trying to talk like adults, or in this films case; retarded adults.\n\nLines such as \"Watch the merchandise, dude!\" and \"Call me Mullet, business up front, party at the back, baby!\" make me desperately yearn for new technological advance that allows me to physically slap the characters on screen.\n\nThere is also a ginger fat kid with an overly aggressive attitude, ginger kids usually turn out to be dicks in films and TV shows (we all remember Ferguson from Clarissa Explains It All, right? Right? Hello?), I'm sure that is some kind of racism but who cares? They're just gingers.\n\nAnd they are ugly, ugly children. I have never seen so many hideous children in all my life. Their parents should be ashamed of themselves for spawning these little shits. Especially the parents of that ginger ogre and the mulleted hillbilly rodent. The parents of these creatures need to have their tubes tied, which links back to my calls for a government controlled breeding program.\n\nCuba bathes his child in tomato juice, for some reason, during one scene. Was that established in the first film? Seems a little unwholesome to bathe your child in orange shit in the yard.\n\nMunro's evil rival camp challenges them to a sports contest, as evil rival camps tend to do, but Cuba declines at first, incurring some attacks in the form of paintball ambushes from the bitter rivals camp. That really isn't safe at all, where is the health inspector while all this is going on? So Cuba calls on his dad (a Colonel in the army or something) to help \"motivate the troops\", and instead he employs said troops in a retaliatory gunk bomb attacks using water balloons filled with what I can only imagine is a mixture of vomit and menstrual fluid. It's probably something more clean and family friendly but I'm at a loss to figure out what it is or where they found it.\n\nEventually Cuba accepts the rival camps challenge. You can probably imagine how it all plays out from there, fair play, the importance of teamwork, father/son relations, unspectacular children exceeding their expectations, montages, inspirational swelling music, etc...\n\nAround the halfway point I decided to begin rhythmically punching myself in the balls to make the experience more enjoyable. I threw up once as a result but that did provide me a moments respite from the film before resuming viewing. Vomit and bruised balls go hand in hand with Daddy Day Camp, put that on the DVD cover, please.\n\nIf this film has achieved nothing else, and I'm fairly sure it hasn't, it's finally offered that moment where Cuba Gooding Jnr has hit rock bottom. That look in his eye at numerous points in this film is clear that the last glimmers of hope have finally died. I can only hope he receives the help he needs and make amends for all that he has done.\n\nUntil they offer him a role in another Daddy Day Blank movie, that is.\n\nPerhaps Daddy Day Cruise, where he and a man replacing not-Jeff Garlin buy a boat and take kids out into international waters where they are free to urinate and vomit on whatever they want, and also encounter Somalian pirates! Oh boy!\n\nOr Daddy Day Kart, where Cuba and not-not-Jeff Garlin buy a go-kart track and are challenged to a racing tournament by a rival go-kart track and the winner gets the loser's go-kart track and the evil rivals cheats by employing the skills of whatever NASCAR pro has outstanding gambling debts that need paying off, and so agrees to star in this movie.\n\nOr Daddy Day Court, where Cuba and not-not-not-Jeff Garlin (not-not Jeff Garlin quit due to a pay dispute) are put up in court before a judge after one of the kids from his Day Care/Camp/Cruise/Kart venture accuses Cuba of putting his fingers up the boy's butt. In a farcical twist the defendants are represented by a smart talking 7 year old in a suit and the jury are populated by an evil rival jury that want to see Cuba and not-not-not-not-Jeff Garlin (not-not-not-Jeff Garlin quit halfway through production) go to prison.\n\nOk, I'd probably want to see that one.\n\nYou can see after watching this, that there's no real surprise Eddie Murphy walked away from this and Cuba Gooding Jnr walking right into it; Cuba Gooding Jnr isn't even on Eddie Murphy's level. He doesn't have the range necessary to play five people in one movie, he lacks the options open to Eddie Murphy, which may only currently extend to racist stereotypes and people in fat-suits but it is more than Cuba Gooding Jnr has right now.",
