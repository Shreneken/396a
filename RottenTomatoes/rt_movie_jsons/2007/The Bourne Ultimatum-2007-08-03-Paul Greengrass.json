            "content": "The third entry in the 'Bourne' spy series is the best installment yet. The filmmakers have crafted a delicious, neck-snapping, dazzling blur of a chase film, a state-of-the-art actioner complete with shootouts, chases, brawls, and dry wit. It is crammed with great actors, with Matt Damon leading the pack again in his definitive action role. At this point in the series we know what Bourne is capable of and we've become engrossed in his mission, and Damon is so convincing at pulling off the physicality of the role that he's a riveting presence at the center of this. Joan Allen and Julia Stiles are also back, providing solid supporting work. David Strathairn reminds us of that old Hitchcock saying \"Good villains make good thrillers.\" Director Paul Greengrass pulls off these amazingly complex set-pieces--a nerve-wracking getaway at London's Waterloo Station, a motorcycle and rooftop chase in the housing clutter of Tangiers, a whip-lash car chase in New York, and a visceral fight to the death with an enemy assassin. Each is meticulously plotted and choreographed to perfection. He and cinematographer Oliver Wood, editor Christopher Rouse, and composer John Powell are geniuses at capturing the time-running-out speed of this tale. Extreme close-ups of people, locales, and incidents, rapidly cut into a seizure-inducing blur, all set to a throbbing Hitchcockian score--this is how you mount an effective action thriller. Everything is so breathless that you may not notice the minor plot hole now and again. Still, here is arguably the best action picture of the decade, a film that ultimately redefines the action genre",

The camerawork is great and not as overbearing or headache-inducing as \"The Bourne Supremacy\" was, especially in the beginning of the film.  This time we have a more restrained style of editing that is still able to keep up with the action and provide multiple points of view and angles and editing together in a cohesive and exciting way.  The film features another strong performance, as does the rest of the trilogy, from leading man Matt Damon in the title role and a decent cast that round out the film's other characters.  The film is action packed, even more so then the previous efforts but also manages to make it poignant and relevant enough to stack on the suspense and tension for the viewer.  Jason Bourne comes back home and is there to bring the house down and he does!  I would highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen the Bourne Trilogy to strap on their seat belts and give it a ride!",

            "content": "Finally getting round to seeing the original Bourne film trilogy, after hearing nothing but good things, there hasn't been any regret watching them. Wasn't sure initially as to whether they'd be my cup of tea or not, hence why it took so long to see them, but that was not the case.\n\n'The Bourne Identity' was a very pleasant surprise, giving a fairly well-worn genre a much needed freshness. It had its imperfections, but was a very solid and even very good film with much to recommend and introduced a cast-against-type Matt Damon in one of his best roles. 'The Bourne Supremacy' was an example of a sequel that was every bit as good as its predecessor, maybe lacking its freshness but also made a few improvements along the way. The original Bourne trilogy ends with 'The Bourne Ultimatum', which has been regarded often as the best of the three, cannot disagree.\n\nSome of the hand-held shaky cam is used a little too excessively (epileptics be warned!) and the ending could have been a little less frenetic and confused and had more careful tying things together and explanation.\n\nVisually, on the other hand, a vast majority of the time 'The Bourne Ultimatum' like its predecessors looks slick and stylish with even more breath-taking locations. There were many instances when the hand-held shaky cam did intensify the tense claustrophobia of the atmosphere and intensity to very good effect, never making things incomprehensible.\n\nLike 'The Bourne Supremacy', the music score is even more dynamic, atmosphere enhancing and more layered this time round, while Paul Greengrass' drama-documentary style and background to his directing is used to full advantage. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' has the sharpest, most intelligent and subtle script of the three films, in a way that is just dazzling.\n\nThe story never lets go of its grip and never strains credibility or reality. It is a tense adrenaline rush throughout, with the best mix of exciting action, the best of it is absolutely thrilling, and meaty story-telling, with lots of emotion and characterisation meat, that develops Bourne the best of all three films. Paul Greengrass' directing style and his experience in drama-documentary is once again used to full advantage.\n\nMatt Damon has really made the character of Bourne his own, at the time of 'The Bourne Identity' it was very much a cast-against-type role but now it is one of his best. Julia Stiles and particularly Joan Allen are marvellous, as is a suitably malevolent David Strathairn, and while the supporting cast are a little underused they all do uniformly sterling work (one would be very hard pressed to get a bad performance out of Albert Finney for example).\n\nIn conclusion, what a conclusion to the Bourne trilogy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

This third entry, however, is just sorta....there.  The story doesn't contain much inside of it and the plot elements are almost identical to those of the first two, making it a rehash but without the depth.  Additionally, while the action scenes are ever-so-slightly better than in the second one, they're still not exactly very good.  The editing is slow, the stunts are slow and the enemies are just faceless baddies.  The Director's obsession with accentuating hand-held camerawork is even more annoying here, and without much in the way of a story or engaging central conflict, it has nothing to fall back upon.  I can't say the movie is bad by any means, but it's easily the least interesting of the trilogy, features easily the most boring villains (whom were never the greatest to begin with) and doesn't actually offer any closure, despite this being one of the selling points of the movie upon release.",

Paul Greengrass' astonishing use of shaky-hand camera lends the film a truly edge of your seat experience, and the three main set pieces in The Bourne Ultimatum are nothing short of God-like film making. The earliest of these, a labyrinthine manhunt through London Waterloo station is one of the most impressive scenes I have ever seen in a thriller, and Greengrass doesn't stop there, he follows it up with a bone crunching sequence in Tangier, and a insanely violent car chase in New York City. It's a perfect end to a near perfect trilogy (The Bourne Identity misses Greengrass' direction) and although they then made a 4th which is solid, it doesn't hit the heights of Supremacy and Ultimatum. Brilliant, brilliant film making. Matt Damon is also superb.",

Jason Bourne is in constant turmoil and Matt Damon is able to portray all of his feelings through his eyes that you are constantly intrigued with what he is thinking. I think this movie has some of the best stunt work yet. There is a fight scene about half way through the movie that was so real you couldn't look away. The only thing is the constant shaky cam does get disorienting, especially during those fight and chase scenes. It's hard for your brain to keep up the pace.

Overall, the combination of Damon's acting and Greengrass' filmaking makes this a truly great action movie.",

            "content": "A visceral rush of energy and assassination!\n\nPaul Greengrass' espionage thriller The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) is a blitz of action assaulting your senses. 115 minutes flash by in a moment like one of Jason Bourne's faded memories. I think The Bourne Ultimatum may honestly be the best action movie ever as the hand to hand combat is so brutal and intense that you are gripped by every punch thrown, while the gunshots are loud and shocking. \n\nI cannot overstate how influential the Bourne series' choreography has been on the action genre as every film after it has tried and failed to replicate the awe inspiring hand to hand combat captured here. I would say only Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes and Chad Stahelski's John Wick films are closest we've ever gotten to such pinpoint accurate choreography and brutal fight sequences. You'd have to go back and watch a Jet Li, Jackie Chan, or Bruce Lee movie to get that feeling again. The Bourne Ultimatum is nonstop action and thoroughly entertaining as a movie. How can you not love carefully planned out choreography, fast paced car chases, and stunning emotional clarity?\n\nAs a film, it is brilliantly written by Tony Gilroy from Robert Ludlum's spy novels. I think the plot is intricately plotted and creatively told as an amnesia suffering assassination named Jason Bourne finally gets closure as to his origins, training, and purpose in the world. The writing is so pithy and mature. The Bourne Ultimatum effectively critiques the extreme methodology that the American government is capable of, while telling the personal story of this killer who grew a conscious.\n\nGreengrass' direction is still experimental and exciting as he and Oliver Wood's shaky cinematography craft a  blur of motion to enthrall audiences. Christopher Rouse's editing is so rapid fire, but precise with each cut that you always know what is happening. That is rare indeed within the action genre. You never get a moment of rest, but in all the swift momentum, you are carried along a fascinating tale of government overextension of authority and excessive use of lethal violence. \n\nI love The Bourne Ultimatum for its ambitious arthouse take on action sequences and espionage narratives. John Powell's score pounds at your heart matching the film's energy like a crashing car or a gun being fired. By the end credits with Moby's killer \"Extreme Ways\" theme song for The Bourne Trilogy playing, I have this movie franchise burned happily into my fondest film memories.\n\nMatt Damon is brilliant as the genius professional assassin Jason Bourne, who must protect contacts so that he must uncover who is at the head of Treadstone and Blackbriar's assassination corporation as well as the key to the locked doors of his memories. Damon flies through breakneck speed action with effortless precise and devastating accuracy. His emotional moments are perhaps the most clear and affecting within the Bourne series. Matt Damon was simply born to play Bourne.\n\nJulia Stiles is really neat and likable as Nicky Parsons as the sidekick and love interest for Damon's Jason Bourne. She is a reliable asset and intriguing supporting actress. Her face and eyes are so expressive whether she is scared or upset. I wish Stiles had gotten more acting roles after The Bourne Trilogy, but alas she did not.\n\nDavid Strathairn is vile as the head operational chief of the CIA named Noah Vosen. His underhanded dealings and resorting to violence is shocking and entertaining akin to Chris Cooper's villain in The Bourne Identity. Albert Finney makes an unforgettable cameo as Dr. Albert Hirsch as he reveals Treadstone's cruel training methods in a performance as nuanced and reprehensible as Brian Cox in The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. Likewise, Scott Glenn is excellent as the head of the CIA named Ezra Kramer, who rules from the shadows.\n\nJoan Allen delivers an emotional performance as the lady in charge of finding Bourne called Pamela Landy. Edgar Ramirez plays Paz in an early career role with a cold ruthlessness about him. Paddy Considine gives reporter Simon Ross a sweaty realism that I like. Would you believe that Daniel Bruhl even gets a cameo as Franka Potente's brother in an emotionally devastating scene of quiet composure. I forgot what a stacked cast The Bourne Ultimatum had, but then again, this was a gigantic film when it first released in theaters.\n\nIn all, Paul Greengrass outdid his phenomenal direction for The Bourne Supremacy with the focused storytelling and artistic flourishes of dreams and memories brought to life with a resounding gunshot.",

Wait a minute. How come you think SUPREMACY isn't that good but that ULTIMATUM is the best? It's made by the same director, ain't it?\". And yes, it is. But that's beside the point.\nThe reason this movie trumps all the other movies is just because it is SO....FAST....PACED! I mean, seriously. This film immediately begins with action, and then constantly hits you with rapid-fire fight sequences and amazing chase scenes in quick succession! It's breath-taking. No, literally. It just doesn't let you breath because it's so fast-paced.\nI also love Paul's signature quick-cut editing for the action scenes. He really perfected it in the movie, and some fight scenes are so much better than in SUPREMACY. For example, my favourite fight sequence of the entire franchise, the one with Bourne and Desh, was just so rough and violent and brutal, courtesy of Paul Greengrass's shaky cam/cuts. I also thought that this movie had new ideas. The rooftop scene in Tangier is just....a masterpiece.\nI mentioned THE BOURNE SUPREMACY had an unsatisfactory story arc (in my opinion), and that I had one or two issues in the direction it was going (mainly because it wasn't faithful AT ALL to the novels). But THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM serves us a riveting ending, and I'm so glad for that too.\nULTIMATUM delivers all the thrills you need. Watch this now!",

            "content": "'THE_BOURNE_ULTIMATUM' was_directed_by_Paul_Greengrass_and_stars Matt_Damon, ?David_Strathairn_and_Julia_Stiles. ?Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues his international quest to uncover his true identity. From Russia to Europe to northern Africa to the United States, he must stay one step ahead of those who would capture or kill him before he has a chance to discover the truth.\n\nI didn't like Identity. I liked Supremacy. I adored every second of Ultimaum. This is easily the peak of the trilogy(and allegedly franchise as a whole). It encapsulates the good from both movies and improves drastically on the flaws I had with them films. No Marie Kreutz from Identity. Easily the Bourne franchise's best villain and no contest the best action. Greengrass is the only current director who can use hand held cam effectively and he perfected that craft with Ultimatum. He was working there with Supremacy but ironed out all the chinks with Ultimatum. This is easily the best movie in the trilogy and maybe even one of the best action movies in recent memory. \n\nWhere do I begin in complimenting this movie. I guess the story would be a great place to start, and what a brilliant story it is. Gilroy, Nofil and Burns have made a spectacular story that is gripping and enthralling from beginning to end. It is interesting and I would argue the best story of the three, even though Supremacy is technically the better thriller(for me). I've heard many people refer to this franchise as the 'Smart Bond' but I've never believed them until now. One small sequence in this movie(and a ridiculously clever way to intertwine Supremacy and Ultimatum) changed my entire outlook on this nickname and made me believe it. It is the thinking man's Bond. Not that I don't love Bond, it's just Mert Dermon is smarter than it. I defy anyone to tell me that the ending of this movie is not perfect. It is exhilarating, it ends on a cliffhanger but also complete finish, it's smart, it's engaging; it's the perfect way to end this trilogy.\n\nMert Dermon is spectacular in his role as Jason Bourne. The arc he experiences over the course of the trilogy is brilliant character development and Damon sells every single scene of it. It is probably his best performance, purely because of what he managed to do to the character.\n\nDavid Strathairn was great as Noah Vosen and provided a great mental foil for Bond. On the subject of Vosen, the villains in this movie are by far the best out of any Bourne film. They are smart, interesting and most importantly have a purpose. As much as I enjoyed Supremacy, Yuri Gretkov had little to no relation to Bourne and that made his character so much weaker. The villains in this movie, however, make sense and that instantly gives them an edge over the 'competition'.\n\nJulia Stiles plays a much larger role in this movie than the previous one and does it very well. She is filling in for Marie Kreutz and I actually prefer her to Kreutz. I also love how they don't try to force some love story between the her and Bourne. This is the maturity and evolution we need in film. Not every woman should be treated as merely a sex object or as a relationship starter for the masculine lead character. They can be interesting without the need for forced romance. Take notes Hollywood, take notes.\n\nJoan Allen plays a much smaller role in this movie for me but I still admired her performance just as much as in Supremacy. She holds her own against other character and provides a useful ally for Bourne.\n\nI have said it once, I've said it twice, I'll say it again; Paul Greengrass is the only man alive who should be allowed to use hand held camera. He uses it to add realism to the sequences and make them arguably more intense. He doesn't use it to obscure an actor's face and their movements so we can paint a picture of what is happening in our minds. It's truly admirable that he is the only living human that can do something that should be so simple.\n\nLeading on from the action, this movie is full of it. Two sequences stick out for me and both are excellent. The police chase sequence is probably one of the best action set pieces of the 2000s, and I don't say that lightly. Greengrass' use of hand held cam(I refuse to refer to it as shaky cam in this instance) helps sell the realism and urgency of the action. It doesn't feel well rehearsed(even though it is) and that makes it seem so much more grounded and real. Greengrass cleaned up his act with action and hand held cam and perfected the craft of it since Supremacy. Very, very impressive. Very enjoyable to behold.\n\nI love the score of this movie. It is utterly fantastic and spectacular and I adore it.\n\nMy main and only issue with this movie was that I never felt Bourne was in any immediate danger. I never doubted he'd escape or survive. They basically make him a god and that made the film lose stakes. Not that it takes away from the action, when the action gets going; you don't pay attention to this, but if you take a step back, you realise that there was 0% chance he'd lose any fight. I know that losing would be out of character but I would prefer to see some sort of weakness that he had to overcome.\n\nIn conclusion, Ultimatum is a very enjoyable and widely accessible action/thriller. I don't think seeing the first two films is required to like this movie but it is recommended. I definitely recommend you watch Ultimatum, and specifically recommend you watch the trilogy back-to-back. I'll rate The Bourne Ultimatum 9 'COME ALONEs' out of 10. Please see it; it is awesome!",

The action sequences are every bit as thrilling as you might expect with my favourite action scene being when he fights against the \"asset\" -what's his name again? Oh right, Desh - with Bourne doing some amazing rooftop jumping. Probably the most memorable scene in this film. An amazing way to conclude the original trilogy. *sarcasm* I can't wait to finally watch and review that Bourne movie with Hawkeye in it rather than skip it and go straight to the 2016 sequel to the trilogy, Jason Bourne for the sake of reviewing these films in a chronological order.

Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) kills it again, this movie is more about his character than the other ones in my opinion, and as we are taken through the flashbacks to get a glimpse of what Jason Bourne used to be like, the stellar acting from Damon adds to the mystery and suspense as he slowly starts to remember things from his past, which I found to be really well done. The actions scenes are carried out very well, the chases were executed in a way that kept them exhilarating, and some of the things that Jason Bourne does in this movie is just so damn clever, and each line that he says once again seems like it was worked on for weeks by writers, they're that good. The only thing that made me like this movie less than the other two, however (yes, I know this is most people's favourite Bourne movie), was the sub-decent side characters. The only character besides Jason Bourne that I didn't mind was Joan Allen's character (Pamela Landy), where everyone else I felt was just put in just for the sake of having enemies/allies for Bourne to use throughout the movie. Although I probably wouldn't have cared much about the side characters anyways, the addition of Marie and others in the first two made me enjoy those more than this one. Nonetheless, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" is a great time, filled with heavy and entertaining action sequences, and continues the hot streak of the Jason Bourne franchise, it is definitely worth the watch.",

The Bourne half is definitely where this one excels most though, as the character is finally given a little more drive in his arc, and thus more room for development. This makes the action all the more exciting too, particularly towards the brilliant final act where everything comes to a head very nicely indeed. On that note, 'Ultimatum' undoubtably contains the best action in the franchise so far, which is a very big achievement indeed.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Unfortunately the espionage side that worked so well in the second installment is slightly less engaging here, and we instead resort to a slightly duller and drawn-out plot with far fewer interesting twists and turns - even it is great to see the lines between good and bad blur even further.\nVERDICT: This works because the Bourne-isms are upped and the focus is put back on Jason himself. Imbetween though, there's arguably less excitement than before.",

We pick up weeks after the events of its predecessor, and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still trying to figure out his forgotten past. The secret CIA program which was once called Operation Treadstone is essentially the same, except operating under the name of Blackbriar.\n\nDipping and dodging different assassins, Bourne is one step closer to finding out how he became an important piece in all this. But this time, there's more desperation. More urgency. He knows he could be dead at any moment and possibly should have been dead already. But he's not and he doesn't know how much longer he can cheat death. We feel it too. We want him to find everything out before he gets killed.\n\nIt's this energy that runs all through The Bourne Ultimatum that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.\n\nBourne's character depth doesn't really progress anywhere from the last film, but we don't really feel like it needs to. He doesn't say much, but we can read his thoughts much of the time.\n\nIn the end, we're relieved, but not necessarily satisfied. There is still more to be found out. Although in the moment, we aren't aware that there will be more sequels to come. We just hope that there are.\n\nTwizard Rating: 95",

One giant chase to find Jason Bourne. Again, it is so cool seeing how Jason Bourne can out smart the CIA with all his unorthodox tactics. The action scenes are bigger and the intensity is as high as its ever been. The only gripe I can say about it is that there is a chase scene that happens in the middle of this film that basically ushered in the \"shaky-cam\" era of action films. I'm not the biggest fan of it. During the fist-fights (which are amazing by the way), it works for the most part, the chase which led up to it... not so much. The final car chanse though is one that feels super heavy and gritty and it feels like it hurts. That probably was a bad way of explaining it but just watch this film to see what I'm talking about. In fact, watch the whole series. It's a good one!",

            "content": "All three of the original films work extremely well as one cohesive watch, as I've found out after watching them back to back to back, but 'Ultimatum' is the biggest and most explosive of the series.\n\nPaul Greengrass returned to direct the conclusion of the originally planned trilogy, as does Matt Damon in the title role.  Greengrass added a much more human aspect to Bourne in 'Supremacy' all while adding just the right amount of action.  I feel like there was a bit more of an imbalance in 'Ultimatum'.  Certainly, the car chases and the breathtaking rooftop chase are great, but there are a few too many leaps of faith the audience has to take in terms of logic.  Especially considering how grounded the first two films are.\n\nEven with the logic issues, The Bourne Ultimatum may be the most entertaining and heart stopping film of the entire series, with one thrilling scene after another.  The aforementioned rooftop sequence in Tangier is one thing, but one of the opening scenes takes place in a London terminal, and it may be my favorite scene of the film altogether.  It's usually not the high octane chases or visceral gun battles that get me, but the scenes in which Bourne is using his slick wit and experience to one-up those against him.\n\nAmong the cast returning is Joan Allen as Pamela Landy.  Although you can make the case her story ended with Bourne in 'Supremacy', the direction they take her arc in helping Bourne tear through his past made sense here.  Opposing Landy is Deputy Director Noah Vosen, played by David Straithairn.  Straithairn is very good at playing characters that get under your skin with frustrating decisions and Vosen is exactly that.  So although I preferred Chris Cooper and Brian Cox in those roles, Straithairn is a solid counterpart to Damon.  It's all the more impressive considering the very little screen time, if any, that the antagonists end up having with Bourne.\n\nThough it is now 2016 and there's a new Jason Bourne film coming out, watching The Bourne Ultimatum made me realize that there really never needed to be another entry in the series.  The film comes full circle and Bourne's search for answers got to the point I hoped for.  The end really feels like the end, so I sure hope the new film reinvents itself and doesn't retread the same story beats because Ultimatum certainly does.\n\n'Ultimatum' has its detractors and I can see a few of the complaints being warranted, but there's no denying the epic scope and thrill ride the film takes you on.  It's the most cinematic of the bunch and the characters don't really take a backseat to action.  I only hope there aren't as many leaps of logic next time around.\n\n+Scope\n\n+Rooftop and terminal sequence\n\n+Feels like the end\n\n+Landy & Bourne\n\n-Leaps of faith in logic\n\n9.3/10",

This movie has everything you can want from a Bourne film and executed all of it amazingly. It has fantastic action, amazing performances, great drama, and at the same time it ties up any loose ends introduced in earlier films and also provides some more revelations about the origins of the man known as Jason Bourne. This movie has a lot going on and as a result the movie moves at a very very fast pace providing us with scene after scene after scene of thrilling action set pieces including hand to hand fights, foot chases, and crazy car chases. All of these scenes are backed up by great performances from all the main cast including the riveting performance by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, Joan Allen's great performance as Pamela Landy, and David Strathairn's captivating performance as the newly introduced Noah Vosen. \n\n\n\nJust when you thought the action set pieces in a Bourne film could not get any more intense and exciting, 'Ultimatum' comes along to show how it's really done. You have a lot of the shaky-cam, close quarters action you saw introduced in 'Supremacy' which is just as awesome and just as entertaining as before. This film also does a fantastic job with its multiple chase sequences as they keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time wondering how on earth Bourne is going to get himself out of every situation. The great thing about the action in this film especially, is that each set piece is connected in a way that it is hard to outright distinguish when each fight or chase ends and another begins because of how fast this film moves along. So you don't get moments to chill and take in the last awesome sequence because by the time you take your second breath Bourne is reversing a car off the top of a multi level carpark. It is done in a way where despite it being almost continuous action, it never feels like too much and every scene is just as exciting as the last. \n\n\n\nThe performances in this film as i mentioned are what really add to the intensity and thrilling or dramatic aspects of every scene and the determination by the actors to deliver real characters allows you to connect to the characters. Matt Damon is phenomenal once again as Jason Bourne and i believe after seeing this film was the moment everyone switched to thinking of Jason Bourne first over Matt Damon. He embodies the character so well that you no longer see Matt Damon, he has been completely consumed by Jason Bourne. The way he commands every scene and always looks like the one in control adds so much to where his character is during this film. David Strathairn was a fantastic addition to the franchise as the way he went toe to to with Bourne's character on an intellectual level made for plenty of very exhilarating and entertaining cat and mouse sequences always leaving you with one question... Who is the mouse? Returning characters such as Pamela Landy and Julia Siles' Nicky Parsons are developed further in this film in ways that add a lot more personality and moral clarity to these characters who played relatively straightforward characters previously. \n\n\nBeing the final film in the franchise it had that job of wrapping up the entire story in a way that did a service to every character and the fans of the franchise. And i gotta say, the way the story unfolds in this film was crucial to providing a fitting end (for now) for the Jason Bourne character. The way it incorporates the use of flashbacks is genius, because rather than just having random flashbacks to explain the beginnings of Jason Bourne here and there, the film ties each one together with the current events in the film. The way it closes everything off once again acts as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy and the character Jason Bourne whose development has progressed over all three films. So now that we're done with revisiting the original Bourne Trilogy we only have to wait 5 more days for the release of 'Jason Bourne', the return of master assassin...\n\n9.1/10",

It was just what I was expecting from this franchise. The plot/story has improved as well. We learnt more abt Bourne in the finale and there was stuff that's interesting to watch.\n\nJust a little scene I wanna talk abt. Remember the very end of the film where Bourne was abt jump over the roof when an agent pointed his gun at him point blank. Instead of shooting instantly he asked Bourne why didn't he shoot him earlier that day. Bourne followed up with some meaningful monologue. That was very brilliant. It should be made longer to bring a film into another lvl, like adding a memorable quote will do. Also I find it odd for Bourne to consider murdering a random agent who was injured and harmless after a car crash. I know it is meant to built up for the scene I am talking about but, it shouldn't have worked this way right? Anyways.\n\nGreat Jason Bourne stuff here",

They always provide excellent action sequences, a great performance from Matt Damon, and (unfortunately) a plot that doesn't live up to its potential.  This is true more than ever in Bourne's third outing, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\".\n\nLike \"The Bourne Supremacy\", \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" fails to capture the spark that \"The Bourne Identity\" had.  The action is what saves the movie.  \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" features some really kinetic action - some of the best of the franchise - especially a suspenseful scene at a London train station and an incredibly intense chase in Tangier.  However, while this action is spectacular, the plot is more aimless than ever; I spent half the movie wondering why Bourne was doing what he was doing?  On top of that, we FINALLY get the answers about Bourne's past that we've waited three whole films for, and the payoff is disappointing and predictable; it's something we've seen a million times before.\n\nAt this point, I think it's safe to say that if you've seen one Bourne film, you've seen them all.  Just like the previous entries, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" is a decent action film, though hardly satisfying for those seeking an intricate plot.",

However, the first half, especially the opening half an hour of the movie is really awesome.

Not your typical spy soldier as he is very clever and physically intense in every way. The story evolves around when he found out that his real name is David Webb and trying to connect the dots where he was belong. Secret service operations still look like dumb as they are trying to put down Jason Bourne every single time. Jason Bourne to me is like the Batman of spy action films. And Bourne Ultimatum is like The Dark Knight of the whole Bourne series. It was that good. Shaky cam shots, and with awesome chasing scenes. The action in its authenticity is just perfect and pretty intense. The most intense in the series as it ended very well with a statement. Should we see Bourne again in the future? Quite possibly yes. Should I care for another Bourne installment? I don't think so as this is the last Robert Ludlum novel in the Bourne series, which is very notable from the past years.

Almost everything I said about Supremacy holds true for Ultimatum. The shaky camera work is so frustrating I just can't stand most of the action scenes or even some of the scenes where a character is merely walking and we have to bounce up and down like we're on board a boat. There are moments where the action holds up and things aren't too chaotic, and I quite enjoy them, but they seem rare. I also still have issues with Matt Damon in the lead role. He is very flat and uninteresting, and I just find myself mentally ticking off a list of actors that would be better in the lead role. The one redeeming factor in this film is that the plot is much stronger than it was in Supremacy. I still feel Identity is the best story, but this one ties up a lot of loose ends and even makes connections to both the previous films. I particularly enjoy those moments when Bourne is out-smarting the CIA bigwigs. Also the final confrontation on the roof is simply amazing and I love the direct reference to Identity. I do wish that Julia Stiles could have stuck around for longer. While I don't need a romantic relationship in this style of action film, I still enjoyed her character and the interactions she had with Bourne. Despite the things I did like in the plot of this movie it wasn't quite enough to overcome the annoying queasy cam. In the future I'll probably only watch the first movie of the trilogy and leave these sequels for others with stronger stomachs.",

Thankfully it is a masterpiece, even underappreciated by me originally, will watch again to see if it is a perfect movie. All I can say is WOW, because not realizing that this movie is a masterpiece has got to be the most offensive thing one can do in 2008. But times change and thankfully I realize that now. Because really, how lazy and spoiled can a person be???? It's unreal. I just can't believe it. Scary. I've lost my mind. BUT not respecting an epic movie like this is so wrong and not realizing how much work was put in to entertain me, is unreal because it was the perfect movie and a lot better than steak and potato dinner so as much as I want to give this a 8/10, It gets a 10/10 because it's flawless and the perfect movie, full or heart action zip and wonderful cinematography, with some killer scenes and some stunning chases and some great violence and passion and smart direction, so it's more a 9.5/10 than a 9. 10/10 for me underappreciating it over many years.",

The Bourne Ultimatum sees director Paul Greengrass at his best as well as Matt Damon giving his best performance as the title character Jason Bourne. In Ultimatum, Bourne attempts to unravel his past whilst fleeing the very people who hired him. That's the main point of the plot but the best part involves newspaper columnist Simon Ross, played by Paddy Considine, who is looking into Treadstone and because of that he draws attention from the wrong people, Bourne sets out to protect him and gain information and in one long gripping sequence Bourne directs Ross through London evading members of the organization. The camerawork captures every characters perspective from the hitmen, the organization members and even the public who watch in fear as Ross is eventually gunned down, by the end of this spectacular scene your heart will be pumping. Globetrotting from London to New York and eventually to Madrid, this film spans several locations with a fast paced and engrossing storytelling, the Madrid scenes are the fiercest with punch-ups, daring escapes and bombings. It all feels realistic, there's no CGI overload, the plots are plausible and there's not a single line of awry dialogue, a near faultless action thriller.",

The acting reaches a new emotional nirvana as well, portraying every distinct, subtle emotion and expression to a detailed point, and leads to the most realistic and believable performances in the series thus far, not to mention some of the darkest places the films have ever gone, period.\n\nThis is the movie that convinced me that Jason Bourne is not only a more interesting character than any and all other \"covert-operatives\" in cinema, including James Bond, but he is one of the most universally lovable characters in ANY genre of film. The breathtaking locations are abundant, the revelations are staggering, and the absolutely masterful way that this third installment ties off the trilogy leaves me to see this as nothing other than an action-thriller masterpiece.

            "content": "The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)\nDirected by Paul Greengrass and produced by Universal Pictures, The Bourne Ultimatum is the third part of the Bourne series, as a sequel to The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. The Trilogy is a novel adaptation, written by Robert Ludlum. In 2008, the action-thriller movie won three Oscar awards. IMDB's rating is 8.1 and Rotten Tomatoes, 8 out of 10.\nRobert Ludlum was an ex-marine and a theatrical actor before becoming an author, who sold more than 210 million books worldwide. He typically portrays a one-man story, who is faced with mysterious and scheming conspiracies from powerful organizations and governments. His style of writing is suspenseful and detail-oriented. \nJason Bourne is America's version of James Bond, who takes espionage to the next level by being highly-resourceful, tactical, and blending in with any part of the world like a 'chameleon'. Paul Greengrass attempts to bring the best out of the novel, however no movie can match a book that covers all details and stays in the original story line. The movie does not include \"Carlos\" a global terrorist who is one of the main characters in the novel series.\nIn The Bourne Ultimatum, the CIA red flags a conversation by an English reporter, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) who talks about operation \"Blackbriar\" and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Ross publishes his investigations in The Guardian, which is read by Bourne after his trip to Paris. \nIn Paris, Bourne meets the brother of his girlfriend, Maria Kreutz (Franka Potente) to inform him of her death in India. Bourne says \"someone started all this, and I'm going to find out who\". \nBourne calls up Ross's office and sets up a meeting with him in London's Waterloo station. Here, Bourne realizes Ross is being tracked and slips him a cell phone. Bourne guides Ross to evade the crack teams and the cameras. After some brilliant action sequences, Ross panics and runs out into the open. A CIA \"asset\", Paz (Edgar Ramirez) is waiting to take out both Ross and Bourne at the busy train station. When Ross comes out, Paz shoots him with a sniper but is unable to get Bourne, who by now is running after the assassin. Paz eventually escapes in a train.\nBourne and the CIA (director Noah Vosen and deputy director, Pamela Landy) are after Ross' source, who is Neal Daniels, the station chief in Madrid. Daniels was involved with Treadstone as well as Blackbriar, who Bourne vaguely recollects during his first day of the Treadstone program. Bourne goes to Daniels' office which is empty but a CIA squad team reaches there as well. After another mind-numbing action scene, he meets Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who is willing to help him.\nBoth of them reach Tangier, where Daniels is waiting to withdraw his escape money (which is held by the CIA, so they can assassinate him). They intercept the \"asset\" but are unable to save Daniels. The \"asset\" is now after Nicky, and the audience is treated to some roof-top Parkour action from Bourne. The \"asset\" is killed and Nicky is sent into hiding.\nBourne returns to New York City and lures Noah Vosen away to break in to his office. The climax of the movie takes place in NY, and the audience will not be disappointed with the car chases and the thrilling action sequences. This is a must-watch movie, and is at its best if watched in the original Trilogy order, starting from \"The Bourne Identity\". The 2013 movie, \"The Bourne Legacy\" stars Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton, which was directed by Tony Gilroy.",

The action in this movie is second to none in the franchise, and with a significantly better story than Supremacy, is the most entertaining. The plot and direction may not be up to par with Identity, and the ending may be a little phoned in, but overall, Ultimatum is a great ending to one of the more entertaining trilogies ever made. The acting is solid, maybe even a step up from the others, but the cinematography, specifically during the fight sequences, is unnecessarily shaky. There's really no purpose for the style in which many of the action scenes are filmed other than a lack of compelling choreography. Despite these flaws, this is an incredible popcorn flick. Bottom line, I'd recommend this to everyone, but you really should watch this trilogy in order.",

It also has intelligence, making some acrid statements about the morality and methods of the C.I.A. The cast is flawless as well; Matt Damon continues his terrific work, and David Strathairn, Joan Allen and Albert Finney are equally fantastic. The only noticeable flaw is the same as in the two previous films; the soundtrack wouldn't have to play all the time, even if it sounds good.

The film starts in the middle and ends shortly after the end of \"Supremacy\", that's where the screenplay by Tony Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns impresses, being written with the greatest possible mastery and deepening the character of Bourne deeper than had ever been. Taking it to a new and dangerous journey to discover the origin of the memories that haunt his past and finally its origins. A journey that will take him to more epics dangers like never before faced. And the direction of Paul Greengrass with elements of action over the story is simply SUPERB!\nThe action sequences of the film can be epic and electrifying at every passing minute, Paul can put them very realistic and puts the audience in the place of Bourne, as if we were there in the midst of all the rush breaking windows, knocking three men at the same time, falling from buildings inside a car and get out alive .... it's just AWESOME as hell!\nThe old cast is still fantastic as ever, as Matt Damon who gives an EXELENT performance of Bourne as never before.\nOne of the best endings to a saga, being faithful to the predecessors, deepening the character more, the levels of performance, technical history as the movie is just FANTASTIC from start to finish. \"Ultimatum\" manages to be not only the best film of the franchise, as well as one of the best Action-Thrillers ever made!",

            "content": "THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM brings Jason Bourne's story to its inevitable conclusion, and does so in the best way possible. This time around, Paul Greengrass and company outdo everything they did in the previous two entries. Matt Damon and the rest of the cast give outstanding performances, and the attention to story and character this time has been fine-tuned to perfection. In this third entry, Jason Bourne finally comes home to take on the agency and find out once and for all who he is and how he got that way. The cast has been expanded slightly yet again, this time adding David Straithairn as a ruthless CIA chief who runs a black ops unit. Scott Glenn and Albert Finney also have smaller roles as the CIA Director and the doctor who introduced Bourne into the program, respectively. What ensues is a globe-hopping adventure that gives the audience some amazing on-location shooting and enthralling action setpieces. My personal favorite, and the centerpiece of the movie is an intense chase through the streets and back alleys of Morocco, culminating in one of, if not the best hand-to-hand fights in the series. And this time, despite the chaotic nature of the cinematography, all of it was immensely more comprehensible than in the last entry, even the car chases. I also thought that they did a better job this time of balancing the different story elements and cutting between a variety of locations in a way that always kept the story moving. They also succeeded in bringing things full circle, as well as teasing some new developments which could be used in future sequels (and were, in THE BOURNE LEGACY). While bringing closure to Bourne's story, they didn't end things such a final way, which I thought was great. After all of the great storytelling of these first three, I'm definitely in the mood for more of it. Overall, I think that this is the pinnacle of the Bourne series, which was already very good to begin with. It's the American answer to Bond, as well as being an anti-Bond. It keeps you immersed in a believable world with real characters and human drama, as well as showcasing the best action that Hollywood has to offer. Seeing the previous two is kind of a prerequisite for understanding this one, but once you do, you shouldn't miss this one.",

This movie reveals the biggest mystery in the series and it certainly is rewarding when you reach that point in the movie. This is one of the best action movies out there and it is a ton of fun. There are few movies in the espionage action thriller genre like it. It's a must see.",

In the world of cinema where computer effects and super humans at every turn, Jason Bourne reminds us that when you as an audience can connect with a character at an emotional level, it's the story that makes the movie. With all the action I felt, the movie glided along just fine. Ultimatum was a wonderful film but I felt it was the weakest of the series. But I find myself becoming critical in the way that Harry Potter fans are of their final installment, the ending wasn't up to par of what I desired. None the less Matt Damon has proven himself to be on par with the greatest action hero's of our time; grossing more than Cruise's Mission Impossible series, also being able to outright restructure the Bond films. Robert Ludlum created a character that was meant to change, not only Bourne?s own life, but the way audiences look at the \"action hero\". Go remind yourself of why you watch movies; Bourne will help bring back your memory of that first time you got introduced into this genre.",

Damon is brilliant in this role, and fitted the character to perfection and this really is a 'thrill-a-minute' ride.  Pam Landy (Joan Allen) sides with Bourne again as he seeks the answers, while Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) tries every means, fair and foul, to silence Bourne and thus keep the dark secret at the core of the plot under wraps.  It is difficult to judge which way Bourne will finally turn as he closes in on the answers that have haunted him for so long, which is a sign of a good plot, and all three films provided brilliant viewing ~ in short, a great trilogy.",
