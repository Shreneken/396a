    "summary": "Long-buried missives from the island reveal the stories of the Japanese troops who fought and died there during World War II. Among them are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a baker; Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), an Olympic champion; and Shimizu (Ryô Kase), an idealistic soldier. Though Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) knows he and his men have virtually no chance of survival, he uses his extraordinary military skills to hold off American troops as long as possible.",

Watanabe is fantastic as always, though Ninomiya and Kase also did fairly well. The entire atmosphere of the film is very grim, and it's pretty easy to notice through the colors the lens emphasizes on. The action was also done pretty entertainingly, though it could have been improved on in some areas. The film does tend to get a bit predictable at parts, however, and it tends to fall into many clichés that other war movies bring with them. Still, though, I ended up really liking this film and thought that it stood as one of Eastwood's better films to this day.",

Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya and Ryo Kase all give excellent performances, I enjoyed that trio throughout 'Letters from Iwo Jima'.\n\nIt's really cool to see the Japanese point of view of the Battle of Iwo Jima, having previously seen the American view last time out. It's also pleasing that the film portrays this side of the story correctly and tells the tale in Japanese, despite being an all-American production. The film reportedly did well in Japan, which I guess confirms that it did a respectable job.",

Vedere gli eventi dall'altra prospettiva è un concetto assolutamente vincente, anche se non sfruttato al cento per cento. Troppo poche le interazioni tra le due fazioni di guerra e tra tutti i personaggi principali di entrambe le trame: entrambi i film hanno tanti punti di contatto quanto quelli di separazione. Sicuramente la differenza qualitativa tra le due opere cinematografiche è evidente, non negli aspetti tecnici, ma in tutti quelli narrativi.",

            "content": "Letters from Iwo Jima is a well-made film that does an effective job of showing the horrors of war. It is one of the rare WWII movies that focuses on the fight between the US and Japan rather than the European part of the war that we typically see. It also takes the unique route of telling the story from the side of the opposition, rather than making it a tale of US victory, which gives some different perspective. Japanese soldiers certainly have a different code of ethics from our own, even if the movie acts as though a more American sensibility is preferable in war rather than the way of “honor” that typifies Japan. I think the intent was to focus the film on a couple of soldiers who were writing a lot of letters home to their families, but the story takes a fairly broad scope and often strays away from these two “protagonists.” While I can respect the film-making, I’m sorry to say that I was rather bored with Letters from Iwo Jima. I’ve reached my tipping point with movies about World War II, and now I struggle to even get emotionally invested. Yes, there are a few unique aspects to this story, but the tone and content of the plot still feel the same as what I’ve seen hundreds of times before. I find the depressing mood of films like this to be hard to endure. Also, most of them end in a relatively similar fashion, so I could predict everything that was coming. You can tell who’s going to die and when, and if you can’t foresee who will survive to the end, then you’ve never watched a movie before. Despite a good director and some excellent actors in the cast, I simply couldn’t get excited about Letters from Iwo Jima. At this point a war movie needs something truly special and unique to make me even think twice about it.",

            "content": "Visually, it's a victim of the trend of war films that started in the late '90s, reached its height in the mid-'00s, and can still be seen today - the washed-out, desolate color pallette that tries to signal to the audience, \"there is war going on here, be sad\". Narratively, it is far more compelling, telling the often overlooked perspective of the Japanese in a proracted final stand, remarking on not only familiar themes like the brutal nature of the war but the shared humanity between combatants on each side, the potential both for empathy and cruelty, and the irony in tens of thousands of fatalities suffered on each side for a spit of land that most had little to no personal connection with. Most prominently, the condemnation of the particularly fervent nationalism of Imprial Japan, coupled with its peculiar takes on honor and morality, is done in a clear yet careful way that holds back from condemning the individuals rather than the circumstances, often celebrating their heroism while noting that the circumstances could have been avoided. A well above average take on the Pacific Theatre that benefits from its production alongside a companion film from the opposing perspective. (4/5)",

            "content": "Profoundly empathetic and truly riveting filmmaking.\n\nClint Eastwood's empathetic war drama Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) remains one of Clint's most compassionate films, which is surprising considering his conservative political beliefs. Eastwood puts aside his own hate and vitriol to allow audiences to experience the Japanese soldier's perspective of World War II on the Pacific front. Eastwood demonstrates how some Americans invading Iwo Jima killed surrendered soldiers without any arms, while others followed their code of conduct and saved prisoners' lives over the course of the battle. \n\nThe main focus is placed entirely on the Japanese side that includes sympathetic generals, brutal generals, nationalistic soldiers, and fatigued soldiers that just want to go home. Letters from Iwo Jima is so powerful because Eastwood displays all manner of military men on the Japanese side for a comprehensive depiction of their ranks' inner workings. So, it's respectable that Clint Eastwood, a noted republican and American nationalist, would go to great lengths to fairly depict the Japanese side of WWII.\n\nEastwood's direction is really interesting with a slow pace allows for smaller character interactions and development. I love all the scenes of people just talking about their hopes, dreams, fears, plans, beliefs, creeds, families, friends, and duty. Eastwood shines with intimate spaces and genuine drama from his heartfelt cast's captivating performances. \n\nHowever, he suddenly forgets how to direct the action sequences and opts for the laziest possible way by using shaky camera work to feign interesting combat. The battles in Letters from Iwo Jima are already fascinating due to their high stakes, scores of soldiers, and intense gunfights; however, many of these aspects are distracted by awful camera movement that doesn't allow you to follow what is happening. I also should mention how I don't care for the green filter Eastwood slapped on the entire film that just tints all the colors slightly more green. It's an odd effect that distracted me from certain moments much like the terrible CGI blood throughout Letters from Iwo Jima.\n\nI adore Ken Watanabe as the kind and thoughtful general desperately trying to win an impossible battle against innumerable American troops. Watanabe captures your attention every second he is on screen. I appreciate how seriously he takes this role and it stands out as one of his finest acting performances. He is gentle and serene, yet tough and blunt as needed to convey his frustrations and orders. Watanabe is at his most compelling when he's just talking to his young soldiers.\n\nAll of the supporting cast is great with the other standouts being Kazunari Ninomiya, Tsuyoshi Ihara, and Ryo Kase among the general's soldiers on Iwo Jima. Nae Yuuki gets a poignant cameo as Hanako Saigo in flashbacks to Japan.\n\nOverall, I think most viewers will be captivated by Clint Eastwood's direction and Letters from Iwo Jima's unbelievable story. Yet, I know most audiences will leave Letters from Iwo Jima remarking how empathetic and compassionate it is for the Japanese side.",

American directors dont have a great reputation when it comes to historical films. Especially in more recent years. But this is really well done. The acting here is pretty good. Ken W as General  Kuribayashi. And all the other main Japanese actors do very well. It's a pretty historically accurate film. In the battle for Iwo Jima, American loses surpassed that of the Japanese. This movie treats its audience like adults. It says \"this is what happened and how it happened.\" It just shows it to you. The truth. The film treats you like a thinking adult not an emotionally  sensitive child who cant handle it. It doesnt take advantage of your emotions unfairly. This movie feels authentic. It's all in Japanese, using actual Japanese actors. Which is great. Some effects do look a little dated but other then that it's fine. The film shows respect to the Japanese side by not making out like all Japanese are fanatical maniacs. It doesn't give into to racial stereotypes or anything like that. It shows that war is not black and white. It reminds us that Iwo Jima was a Japanese island. For them, it was protecting their country and a way of life. For better or for worse. This film is a must see for anyone who is interested in the Japanese side of the war. A criticism is that this picture does require some patience as it is abit long in places. When I rewatch it. I like it more and more. \n\nThis picture reminds us that most people who die in war are young men, with little knowledge of politics, who go forward when called and make the ultimate sacrifice. ...\n\n\nGeneral Kuribayashi: \"A good officer uses his head, not his whip.\"",

General Kuribayashi, played by Ken Watanabe, makes for one of the most interesting characters in all of war films. A man who used to be close friends with the Americans is now using their weapon gifted to him right back on their own soldiers. It provides serious perspective and gives you a newfound understanding that war isn't always good vs. evil. There are good and bad people on both sides, but the treacheries of war don't discriminate.",

Letters from Iwo Jima, similar to its predecessor Flags of our Fathers, are war drama films, both of which are directed by Clint Eastwood, act as an insight of the thoughts and actions of soldiers during the battle of Iwo Jima. Letters from Iwo Jima focuses in on this aspect of the Japanese soldiers in battle of Iwo Jima during World War II. At first, the movie begins with scenes of modern Iwo Jima with wrecked pill boxes and caves constructed by the Japanese soldiers, giving a feeling of somber mixed in with a despairing piano arrangement playing in the background . We then see a group of Japanese archaeologists and historians enter one of the many cave systems on island. Here, they make a discovery: a buried bag of letters of the soldiers stationed there which provides the main backbone of the story line.\n\tAs the story progress, Eastwood provides the audience with a subtle question: Is it more honorable to die by suicide to maintain one's honor than face defeat or for one to fight and survive another day not for one's country but family as well. From preparation of the islands defenses to the actual battle, this question appears quite a bit, even so when one of our main central figures, a soldier named Saigo fights to return to his wife and daughter where as his companions fight for the emperor and country, where the question shows the internal conflicts present among the Japanese troops. As the movie progresses, we see the internal conflicts eventually branch out with two conflicting ideals in the midst of a battle with a formidable enemy. General Kuribayashi, played by Ken Watanabe, along with several other soldiers like Saigo refuse to what they consider useless dying by committing suicide in order to \"Fight another day\".    \n\tLetters from Iwo Jima manages by the end to provide the audience with the idea that humanity is always present, even in times of war. Although we may perceive one to be 'evil', Eastwood manages to present this idea very well throughout the film, especially in the middle of film when the soldiers make peace with a dying American soldier named Sam when they figure out he is just like them. With its washed out color cinematography, bleakness of hope, and what it means to be honorable and brave, this movie presents many ideas to its audience to grab their attention. The film in itself is a good interpretation of the letters found on Iwo Jima and even more so throughout the film where the actors speak Japanese with English subtitles present in order to give the audience a better sense of what each soldier was feeling and how they communicated with one another. Even towards the end of the film, Eastwood gives the audience something to think about: war is war and regardless of how you feel, people in the battlefield will die but their is a humane side to all of this which should always be accounted for. In my own personal opinion, this film does bring up several key points that anybody should take and think about it. Although it may not provide enough action like Saving Private Ryan, this film with its in-depth characterizations of the soldiers present, as well as an appreciation for human life as a whole, allows this film to be enjoyable and worthwhile as something to think about.",

Not only is it a very different language, but the conditions of the soldiers are far different.  It's a claustrophobic feel, often confined to small networks of caves, on a remote island, surrounded by the US marines.  Anyone who knows of the Japanese during WWII knows that at one time or another they will commit suicide, banzai charge (suicide)  or fight to the death. It's a sad and gloomy story, and it's portrayed very well.  The story is great, the acting and script are both good, and the action is good.  Sometimes explosions can look a little too CGI, or just not big enough.  But these are minor setbacks to action with gret sounds and violence.  It's large scale, hectic and futile for the Japanese, and ends with many dead.  It does feel a little rushed however, from the brief capture of the beach to the flag on Iwo, takes no time at all, and could have used more attention.  However these are the events commonly used with the battle, so it's great to see the futile battle of the rest of the island strongly covered as well, something Flags of our Fathers only does marginally.  However it covers the horror well, and has a very dark and hopeless feel.  We do feel for the Japanese, and although their ideas about honor and suicide may be crazy to us, it shows it well and we gain sympathy for them, much like how Downfall makes us feel for the German high command in the last days in Berlin.  Similar idea, but this one has far more action, and what's not to love about that.  Great movie, nice to see the other side of the war, extremely well done, and only gets better as it goes along",

I watched \"Letters\" first because always interested me see the vision of the Japanese, and thought it was well done, it was more than well done, almost perfect! The film simply arrested me for two hours and a half, and shouldn't be one minute shorter. The screenplay is fantastic, even this story very well told, and when I say the vision is that we can even put ourselves in the place of the Japanese soldiers in the film. And the whole movie is in Japanese, only the Americans speak English.\nThe entire cast is phenomenal, everyone does their job perfectly, Ken Watanabe as always perfect!\nThe story is very well told, the battle scenes are spectacular and \"real\", I simply prefer \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" over \"Flags of our fathers\", mainly because it was very confusing, an hour was in the battle, the other was with the 3 survivors the battle, another was the son of one of those survivors to tell the story from the interviews he get from the soldiers. The movie is not bad at all attention, I just think Letters is much more structured and more exciting.\nOne of the best war movies ever made, and one of the best films of Clint Eatswood too!",

They compliment each other (with only the timeline and island of Iwo Jima connecting the two, from a story point of view), without treading on each other.  Both paint the other side as evil, but Letters does it one better with some of the Japanese feeling that maybe the Americans were no different than them, and it was simply 2 countries a war, more so than humans VS humans.
