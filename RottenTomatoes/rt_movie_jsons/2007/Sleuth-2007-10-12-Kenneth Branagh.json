Milo Tindle (Jude Law) is an unsuccessful actor with decidedly less to show for his professional exploits. The lives of these two men cross paths when Andrew's wife leaves him for the younger Milo. Hoping to carry out a cleverly constructed revenge plot, Andrew invites Milo to his estate, where elaborate mind games ensue.",

It's so much fun watching  both just to see Michael Caine playing the younger character and then the older character.  This is a fascinating psychological thriller.  But, the wit and playful humor is also extremely powerful.  I have never enjoyed seeing 2 versions of a movie as much as SLEUTH.  I will say I did prefer the super sleek set of the second version over the opposite ( very cluttered  earlier version.  I felt that it really let the dialogue shine even brighter in that setting.  And Jude Law is amazing in this Kenneth Branagh version.  I thought the chemistry of Caine and Law playing off each other really cracked and sizzled.  Don't miss this film !!",

Although this pic was good, the original was slightly better with more twists and turns. One factor to that was the shortened length, of  course. The homosexual element in the original was implied, but not clearly stated as here, but then it was 1972, after all. Even though not quite as good, in the world of remakes, where new is usually horribly inferior, this is a stellar one.",

Perhaps it was the environment, I find \"modern\" house architecture total nonsense so watching an entire film set in this kind of environment very difficult.\nAlso I have very fond memories of the 1975 version that was set in a castle I believe and had far more atmosphere than this film. The film was also very predictable hardly straying from the original in story so there were no real surprises when it all came down to it. Who ever decided to set this in a modern \"artsy\" house should be boxed behind the ears, it ruined the entire film.   1 Star  12-19-13",

Secondly, the lack of chemistry between Caine and Law is annoyingly baffling - usually, both actors could read out the phonebook and have me riveted, but for some reason there's just no zing here. Third and lastly, the writing is appalling, and comes off like Pinter writing a deliberately Pinter-esque script and sending himself up.

Two: I love Jude Law and I think he is one of the most brilliant actors of our time.\nThe movie is extremely witty, story-wise, script-wise and even performance-wise. The story of the film is an adaptation of a 1970 play by Anthony Shaffer. That is why throughout the movie, I kept imagining Law and Caine as if they were on stage in this man-to-man show. However, Kenneth Branagh, whom I consider as a phenomenal actor (not sure about him being a director), did a good job, not entirely perfect I have to say, in bringing this play to the silver screen.\nAs I said, the script is extremely witty, thanks to Harold Pinter of course, beautifully crystallizing the mind games between the two characters. Nevertheless, I found some scenes quite bizarre and over-dramatized, but they did not stop me from enjoying the movie though, and enjoying the outstanding chemistry between Michael Caine and Jude Law. Not only are they brilliant actors, but also they have managed to establish this special bond from scene one.\nYou might not love the movie as I did, but it is certainly one you don't want to miss.",
