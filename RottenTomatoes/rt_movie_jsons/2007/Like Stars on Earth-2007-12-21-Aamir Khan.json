            "content": "A educação é uma das coisas mais importantes para o ser humano se desenvolver e adquirir as competências para se autorrealizar e ser autônomo no mundo. Dessa maneira, ser inclusivo se torna essencial e é esse aspecto que a obra brilhantemente irá abordar. Nesse sentido, ela toca em questões fundamentais do ensino de crianças, onde nos apresenta um protagonista neurodivergente (Ishaan), possuindo dislexia e transtorno de déficit de atenção (TDAH) que passa muita dificuldade, por estar em um ambiente despreparado e preconceituoso, resultando em sofrimento, dor e angústia por sua falta de encaixe a dita normalidade.\n\tNo desenvolver do enredo observamos como Ishaan está tendo seu eu psicológico degradado por ser forçado a conviver com uma inadequada educação conservadora que reflete em constantes repreensões familiares, por suas notas baixas e seu mau comportamento, como se tudo fosse apenas uma falta de \"vontade\" ou de disciplina. Em vista disso, toda a sua autoestima, criatividade e até sua essência é destruída, ocasionando uma espécie de depressão que o transforma em um ser maquinal sem um sentido para existir.\nNo entanto, tudo muda quando ele encontra um novo professor (Ram), esse não apenas entende as dificuldades de Ishaan, mas se ver no próprio garoto, alguém não compreendido e isolado por ser diferente. Contudo, ele tem o problema de reacender a vitalidade do menino que agora está totalmente desolada. Felizmente com muito esforço e persistência ele consegue trazê-lo de volta, porém, não só isso, com metodologias mais adequadas, torna-o o protagonista do seu próprio conhecimento, fazendo com que ele aprenda o que tinha dificuldade e reviva seu ânimo e sua criatividade.\nDesse modo, o filme nos traz a todo momento uma reflexão sobre a importância da inclusão, mas não o faz meramente através de um professor \"milagroso\", pois esse tem que remodelar e incentivar todos os que estão a sua volta, tanto os demais professores e a estrutura escolar, quanto os pais de Ishaan, declarando que essa missão é coletiva. Portanto, a obra lembra que cada ser humano é único, onde, não existe um mesmo método para todos e que a diversidade é essencial. \n\tToda a narrativa é feita de maneira excepcional, temos uma boa produção, trilha sonora interessante e apesar de estranharmos algumas cenas, por parecerem, no primeiro momento, infantis, elas são muito bem colocadas quando a olhamos em sua totalidade, já que nos mostram a perspectiva da criança que está vivendo esses fatos. Por fim, é uma história emocionante que é recomendada para todos, principalmente para futuros docentes.",

            "content": "(a \"Dear special child:\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\n\"Dear special child:\"\n\nThere are some films that just \"change the game.\" They get us to look at the world in an entirely different and unique way. Such is this film from India, LIKE STARS ON EARTH. In fact, looking at the world in an entirely different and unique way is EXACTLY what this film is all about. It's about a \"Dear special child:\" who was led by a wonderfully special teacher to see how truly miraculous and special he was, is, and always will be. I would have loved to have seen this special film as a \"Dear special child:\" myself, as it would have \"changed my game\" and allowed me to embrace me as special as I was, is, and always will be.\n\nDarsheel Safary plays the special child, Ishaan Awasthi, and it's a marvelous performance of absolute and complete originality. Any exceptionally gifted, young actor would have found it difficult to carry a nearly 3-hour film, but Safary is not just any exceptionally gifted, young actor. He is TRULY special, just as Ishaan is. With the young eyes of an old soul and those big buck teeth, Safary wins us over the minute he shows up in the film and he has our heart in every scene that follows until the triumphant end. Aamir Khan plays the wonderfully special teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, and Khan, most definitely an inner child as an outer adult, wins us over, as well, with his creative and unique teaching style. The other teachers in the school don't know what to make of Nikumbh but when they try to make him over into the stringent and regimented teacher they are, Nikumbh faces them all and gives them the Nazi salute of, \"Heil Hitler!\" Priceless and very apropos! It's not the least that Ishaam is lazy and rebellious; it's simply the most that Ishaam has undiagnosed dyslexia. Words confuse him and cause him to have poor motor skills, as well. Catching a ball is impossible for Ishaam, because he can't understand the concept of the ball being thrown to him, unable to clock the actual distance from the ball, thus completely unable to catch the ball. Words hold this same concept of confusion for him. When Nikumbh figures out why Ishaam can't read and write, he sets out to address his dyslexia but Nikumbh does something even more remarkable than that: Nikumbh addresses Ishaam's creativity in painting where words cannot possibly fail him. Ishaam's parents are clueless about his dyslexia, as many parents unfortunately are, and Ishaam's father is hell bent on his children succeeding and winning. Ishaam succeeds and wins in ways his father cannot understand, and that is through Ishaam's creativity.\n\nI'm not kidding you, \"Dear special child:\" Every single teacher and parent with a child and/or children should be mandated to watch this film. Teachers and parents need to understand that their child does not have to succeed or win because a certain teacher and parent didn't succeed or win in their own lives. Teachers and parents need to address each special child individually, uniquely, refreshingly accommodating to each special child's unique gifts and talents. The child might become the quarterback of a football team but the child also might become the painter who paints like no one else can possibly paint. The child might be the smartest kid in the class but the child also might be the most artistic kid in the class. This film inspires me to want to teach because I want kids to \"get this.\" I want kids to \"get\" that they don't have to be who their teacher or parent thinks they need to be. They need ONLY be who they NEED to be. My parents wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer for the rich career warranted. I wanted to be the artist I am now for the \"rich career\" of being enriched as the creative person God enriched me to be, monetarily rich or poor. It's these creative types like Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, all with learning disabilities, who \"changed the game\" and thus changed the world. It's these creative types who do God, The Original Creator, justice by creating from adversity to sheer originality.\n\nI'm not going to let you, \"Dear special child:,\" get away without saying this:\n\n\"Dear special child:\" YOU ARE SPECIAL! You always were, are, and always will be. There is not one single thing you need to \"change about your game.\" If your teachers want you to be who they want you to be, be YOU! If your parents want you to be who they want you to be, be YOU! There is no one else like you and there is no one else who will ever be like you. You are one-of-a-kind, unique, special, endearing, remarkable, marvelous….do you need me to go on? If you do, I will! I'm so grateful to God that He brought this absolute gem of a film to me at just the absolute right time, because I can often feel VERY \"unspecial.\" This film reminds me and all of us just how special we were, are, and always will be. \"Like stars on earth\" indeed am I….and YOU!!!!\n\nUnique and original blessings ALWAYS, \"Dear special child:,\"\n\nTimothy J. Verret (a \"Dear special child:\")",

Some of it does feel as though Aamir Khan really, really, really wants you to know how much this story means to him, but I can't blame him. The subject matter at hand is undoubtedly important, with numerous scenes throughout the film either shattering or warming your heart. Things fall short for me, however, when the film is forced to tick the boxes of a traditional Bollywood film. A dance sequence here, a montage there, add in a Beastie Boys-esque rap song about Dyslexia and then rinse and repeat until you have a 150-minute running time. I realize I'm still new to the style, but of the three Bollywood film's I've seen (the others being \"PK\" and \"Rang De Basanti\") this is definitely the one where the singing and dancing really got in the way of the narrative the most glaringly. That being said, Aamir Khan is still charismatic as hell. Plus, the thematic content will be sure to make you feel good when all's said and done. In the end, I'd say it was mostly worth the watch.",

            "content": "Taare Zameen Par is a movie produced by Hindi Cinema that absolutely tugs on the heart strings of the audience. As a fan of Bollywood films, I have to say that this particularly movie has many qualities not often seen in Bollywood films. Taare Zameen Par, roughly translated to 'Like Stars on Earth\", is a heartwarming film produced and directed by Aamir Khan that depicts the struggles of a 8 year old boy that struggles academically.  I am not ashamed to say I shed tears of both sadness and happiness watching Ishaan, played by Darsheel Safary, struggle and overcome his learning disability. I believe this film allows for open conversations about learning disabilities such as dyslexia and shows the range of emotions that those who are affected experience. Another Bollywood film that I think had similar goals is \"My Name is Khan\" directed by directed by Karan Johar that stars Shah Rukh Khan playing a muslim man that has Asperger's Syndrome. My Name is Khan quickly became a worldwide phenomenon for the message that it is telling. One of the biggest similarities I saw between the two films is the internal struggle both the main characters face. Neither want to be discriminated by their peers because they are different, and neither realize that their differences allow for their special abilities to shine. \n\nAs I mentioned early, I believe Taare Zameen Par is a Bollywood movie that is easily differentiable from the typical Bollywood film. Taare Zameen Par can fall under the category of a Multiplex film. Rachel Dwyer says in her article Somewhat Different that multiplex films are more realistic than your typical Bollywood film and are significantly less melodramatic. Another point she makes is that multiplex films have a more clear narrative that most Bollywood films. In Taare Zameen Par, there are not multiple storylines that merge into one, but rather the whole film follows Ishaan on his emotional educational journey. Taare Zameen Par is an unbelievably realistic film and Aamir Khan is able to phenomenally depict the emotions that a child with a learning disability feels. Another way Taare Zameen Par sets itself apart from the typical Bollywood film is seen in the songs in the movie. Unlike many Bollywood films, the songs are not accompanied by outrageous dance scenes or non diegetic scenes.",

            "content": "This movie, although not fantastical, is one of the most magical Bollywood movies I have seen. I loved that Aamir Khan and Amole Gupte (screenwriter) used the typical storyline of Bollywood films to break down and start a conversation about education and dyslexia in India. It reminds me to how I view Groundhog Day and even Amar Akbar Anthony. The audience knowing that everything will be righted and in tune with the moral universe at the end makes them pay more attention to how the movie gets them there. Also, the timbre of Bollywood itself gives the audience a sense of comfortability to truly let down their guard and be more open to the deeper meaning the film wants to portray. In Groundhog Day the romantic comedy structure is used to relay the deeper meaning of the impossibility of repetition. In Amar Akbar Anthony, Bollywood tropes are used to show the importance of secularism. In Taare Zameen Par, it is the treatment of children with learning disabilities and the importance of nurturing creativity in children's education. \n\nAlthough Taare Zameen Par falls under the category of a Bollywood movie, it uses many of the 'traditional' structural elements of Bollywood in a more modern way. The songs, which I loved, were not dance numbers, but made clear the unsayable emotions that the young Ishaan feels as Ishaan does not have access to the same language adults have.  The range was also impressive from the jarring \"Jame Raho\" to the heartbreaking \"Maa\" and the charming and ridiculous \"Bum Bum Bole.\" Rosie Thomas suggests that the moral universe lies within the mother in Melodrama and the Negotiation of Morality, and I agree and would argue that in this film it is Aamir Khan's Ram Shankar Nikumbh that acts as the mother figure. He takes in every child as his own, making him mother India, which I find endlessly fascinating. \n\nThis is not to say that the movie does not come without its faults. For the time it was made, I think that the emphasis and impact it has had on the attitude towards learning disabilities is astounding, but if you are watching this movie now I would recommend watching it with a keen eye and keep in mind modern developments on our understanding of dyslexia and dyscalculia (which seems to be what Ishaan more closely would be identifying with if diagnosed today). One of my least favorite aspects of the film was the absolute uselessness of the father. I really think more could have been done with that character to show depth and growth. This film is quite simple and that is where it both shines and falters. The plot is pared down, but that lets the emotions pour through unadulterated and quite enchantingly, especially as more time could be put into the beautiful cinematography, quirky animations, wonderful acting and the very strong messages this movie promotes. This has been one of my favorite Bollywood movies and I hope you find it just as magical and full of great heart as I did!",

            "content": "I'm not always a fan of the Bollywood style of filmmaking: overrun with musical montages and exaggerated dialogue and acting. But 'Like Stars on Earth' is a magical film about the magnificent abilities that children have, even when all the odds are against them. With a story as powerful as this one, it doesn't matter where or how the story is told.\n\nLuckily, most of the Bollywood clichés actually enhance the film experience. Being such an integral part of the story, the soundtrack and score complement the film wonderfully. Each song aligning nicely with the film's dramatic but hopeful tone. Admittedly, having a rap song play over Ishaan's family getting dressed and ready for the day is a bit jarring, but the songs that play after Aamir Khan appear are nothing short of enchanting.\n\nThis film is about a dyslexic child who has basically given up on school as no one seems to think he's worth anything. His father beats him for goofing off and all of his teachers scold him for not being able to do the simplest of tasks. So, Ishaan finds his way to a boarding school where he meets Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) who may change his life forever. Everybody had that teacher who changed the way you approached school and perhaps even life itself, which is why I thought this movie was so effective. There's nothing more gratifying than watching someone struggling to find their way, only to have one uniquely suited person put them back on track.\n\nIt seems so simple but coming from a teaching background, I'll be the first person to say that it can be nearly impossible to connect with someone who doesn't want any help. However, when and if that connection is made, it's possibly the most fulfilling thing a person can do. Aamir Khan captures these emotions perfectly near the end of Like Stars on Earth. I don't think I'll ever get the image of Ishaan's father breaking down into tears out of my head. There's some really powerful stuff here.\n\n8.6/10",

Nurture them and employ patience with a nuclear passion, and they'll burn bright forever. Every child deserves infinite opportunities, for they have infinite possibilities.\n\nNo human is the same, and no one learns the same. Education should be personal, and its systems evolved to incorporate more than goals to meet generalized testing standards. The price of time and money shouldn't exist in regards to cognitive, creative, and spiritual evolution.",

Also the film continues while these songs play out, so they relate to what's happening as much as the pictures do. I'm not sure if the title in English is 'Every Child Is Special' or ' Like Stars On Earth' - It doesn't really matter. What matters is this is one of those 'experience' films.....the type that goes far beyond your average entertaining movie. This has heart and emotion.....and the message is a strong one. There's a lot of invention and imagination - shown through animation and painting....and of course, there's always hope and understanding. And Aamir's first time as Director as well as his usual Producer/ Star roles. After seeing this a few times i'm still wet with emotion....going to bump this up to 4 stars (Great).....because of the last hour.",

Here's a rare and magical Bollywood movie with no dance numbers, funky costume designs and over-dramatic melodrama. It doesn't feature a hero trying to save a heroine. Neither does it have over-the-top action sequences that kill your brain cells. Instead, it is none of the above: a heartbreaking, insightful and deeply courageous film that explores the affect that a mental disease can have on a young child. What's surprising is that Aamir Khan, a Bollywood star known for starring in commercial films, has made a movie unlike any he has ever starred in. The performances are phenomenal, the writing a joyous sight to bold and the direction superb. This is one of those rare Bollywood movies with a powerful message, meaning and surprisingly enough, a reason to exist! And what an emotional rollercoaster it is. In newcomer star Darsheel Safary, Aamir Khan has founded the birth of a movie star. The birth of an actor that can carry an entire film just through the expressions on his face, communicating visually what may not have worked if he spoke. Despite almost little to no dialogue near the end of the film, Safary is an actor that makes you feel every single emotion there is in your body. The same is the case with the film itself. It challenges you to discover, to think outside of the box, to recognize the beauty of a great story rather than jazzy musical numbers. Aamir Khan has  without a doubt created a masterpiece, a film that despite running three hours, flies by in seconds due to Safary's magnificent performance. It's a movie that reminds me why I love movies in the first place...",

Es un film que exuda humildad y nobleza... Me enamorÃ (C) del papel de Ishaan muy fÃ¡cilmente, no pude contenerme, pues a eso me llevÃ³ esta pelÃ­cula tan bien dirigida y guiada... El papel que del padre  se hace insoportable y odiado, el mundo fantasioso del pequeÃ±o Ishaan es mostrado con audacia y comprensiÃ³n... Este largometraje nos muestra que la especialidad no solo debe referirse a la falta de alguna aptitud cognitiva, Sino tambiÃ (C)n al a la posesiÃ³n de habilidades notorias como la del pequeÃ±o protagonista hacia el arte... la manera en la que se encierra al niÃ±o en un mundo carcelario, limitado por las reglas impuestas y por el asesinato de la ilusiÃ³n es tan frustrante para el espectador como para el personaje... Da rabia como se puede sumergir a un niÃ±o en la depresiÃ³n y en la desidia por culpa de conceptos errados, terquedades e ignorancias.
