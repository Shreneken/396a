The beginning was a little slow and felt like it had some unnecessary scenes, however it really started to pick up and it was amazing to see Denzel Washington act with his talent in a movie once again (I'm really glad that they did not underutilize him). It was also great at the end seeing him opposite from Russell Crowe, another awesome actor who has good characterization with his role too. Ridley Scott's movies always have a good dark look and feel to them and looking back at how this was a portrayal of a real story was also noteworthy!",

For all I know is that it's directed by Ridley Scott and it's based on the true story about a career criminal, Frank Lucas and detective Richie Roberts. When frank Lucas' boss, Bumpy dies he takes over as boss and entering the heroin trade, buying directly from producers in Thailand and smuggling it into the U.S. through returning Vietnam War servicemen. Richie Roberts is going through a divorce with his ex-wife while tracking Frank Lucas and his band of men. Whenever I thought about this I was thinking that both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe both starred in the movie that I've never seen before but I heard about it is Virtuosity. Much like many gangster flicks like Casino, Scarface and Carlito's Day, this one is one of the most essential ones from Ridley Scott. This is what it's about, this movie has great acting by far even from Denzel Washington, the production value is phenomenal, the set designs are great, everything about is done great. This is what biography is all about, setting the story faithful to the original biography. Very essential indeed, anything what I've seen that this movie has to offer, amazing.",

The two leads are Russel Crowe as Detective Richie Roberts and Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas. The two leads do not meet until the end but both give stellar performances. Russel Crowe as a cop on the brink of divorce and Denzel as a ganster with tremendous charisma who can turn violent and vicious in a second. Two strong males trying to accomplish what they most desire and it leads to a cat and mouse game as detective Roberts attempts to bring Lucas down. With great action, stellar direction from Scott, and a towering performance by Denzel, this movie is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "American Gangster, a cop and crime thriller, takes place from the late 60s to the early 70s. Evoking the cop thrillers at the time which had cornered cinema, like Sidney Lumet's Serpico or William Friedkin's Oscar-winning The French Connection. Those films detail the undercurrent themes between the side of the law and the side of the criminal underworld. How reactionary either side can be when obtaining their ultimate goals of beating each other. \n\nThe story of American Gangster takes place in Harlem where gangster Bumpy Johnson, passes away; Leaving his protege, Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington to take control of Harlem once again. Attempting to make a name for himself, he successfully sets up a system where he imports pure uncut heroin, from top producers in Vietnam, through secret military contacts. Lucas soon becomes the celebrity and crime kingpin of Harlem City. Meanwhile, maverick cop Richie Roberts played by Russell Crowe is facing a divorce and a potential separation from his child.\n\nTo make things worse, trust becomes an issue for his partners and superiors for booking in unmarked cash that was found in the boot of a car. Dealing with the loss of his corrupt partner, Roberts is assigned to lead up a drug case that potentially leads back to Frank Lucas himself. What develops is a cat and mouse game of Roberts and crew taking down the charismatic but dangerous Frank Lucas, while also uncovering a field of corruption and power that could potentially endanger them and their careers in the process.\n\nThis is probably Ridley Scott's most entertaining films to watch: from the casting; to the locations; to the thrills; to the pacing and the brilliantly written structure of both characters on either side of the fence. Denzel Washington is well cast here. Ranging from suave, smug and threatening in all the same features, which brilliantly contrasts with Crowe who is frustrating and even tough to deal with as a character.\n\n We know that Frank has effectively built his empire and took care of his family. So, while famous, he has to fight to keep himself at the top while Roberts has to fight to earn respect and become the decorated cop he wants to be by taking him down. As it is, it makes for an exciting narrative, made effective through the script of Steven Zaillian. The film is shot in the style of those movies as mentioned earlier. Drab and dark lighting with an old-fashioned aesthetic that makes the film raw and gives the film an edge to be aligned with those classic cop thrillers. The film is roughly two and a half hours long, but it does move at such a brisk pace. Which makes use of every minute on screen.\n\nWhile Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe don't share as much screen time together, there is plenty of stand out performances in the background that are memorable. Such as, Idris Elba's gangster rival character and Josh Brolin's shady detective character that significantly make up the reigns of the plot. The film is nothing less than thrilling and tense. There are high stakes to be had here. While the film follows a predictable path, there's a great sense of the period in time, that you become invested almost immediately.\n\nOn top of that, with a cast that is committed to the storylines on-screen. Uniquely, Washington and Crowe who do battle with each without any confrontation whatsoever, this makes for a very engaging; smooth; stylish and rough around the edges thriller. That effectively creates a stark portrayal of the rise and fall of power and corruption on screen. Miles ahead of what Ridley Scott has made around that period, this is a compelling thriller in the best sense of the word.",
