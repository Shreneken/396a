His portrayal of Idi Amin is incredible and he commands the screen every scene he is in and elevates everyone else around him. The cinematography is excellent with the African setting be very memorable and very well done camerawork. They nailed the 70's international setting as well. The music is also excellent as well with a great mixture of African music and modern music that never feels out of place. The editing and pacing are very good overall however the first 15-20 minutes felt kind of rushed and disjointed but after Idi Amin arrives on screen things just go to the next level and the film never lets up. It still waws good but not on the same level as the rest of the film. The best part is Nicholas & Idi Amin whenever they interact on screen which (Good News) is a lot of the film. They have amazing chemistry. I was also appreciative of how the film had graphic moments but didn't overload it like a Saw film. Most of the time the violence is suggestive in terms of letting you imagine like Nicholas has too what kind of violence is happening throughout the country. This is a film anyone should give a watch.",

While his role is factually based in respectfully representing the story for further awareness over the territorial draught and inner harshness, the haunted turnout via a fictional/composited account eventually gets surrounded hopelessly by gruesome fates as depicted over the results of mad power's reflectively echoed hate.

Set in 1971 in Uganda, it shows the Idi Amin's coup and subsequent takeover of the government, and shows that not all that glitters is gold. McAvoy is fascinated by the dictator but soon learns of the true violent nature behind the scenes that everyone is too afraid to expose because they fear for their safety. This movie was wonderful, and what made it was the actors. Whitaker is able to perfectly encapsulate the unnerving transition from charismatic to manipulative in a way that is unnerving and frightening but one that you can't really put your finger on. McAvoy is able to show his innocence in the beginning when he believes in Amin and the terror when he realizes what's going on and can't get out. This is an overall great movie and I would recommend it to most people.",

            "content": "Kevin MacDonald's political thriller looks at what happened in Uganda under the leadership of the notorious dictator Idi Amin in the 1970s. The Last King of Scotland is based on the 1998 book of the same name by Giles Foden. Recently turned doctor Nicholas Garrigan from Scotland seeks a challenge outside his home country and ends up in Uganda, where he wants to help people in need in a bush hospital. In the course of this, Idi Amin becomes the new president and meets Garrigan in a roundabout way. The two promptly establish a friendship and Amin orders him to be his personal physician. Garrigan later realises the gravity of the situation and devises an escape plan.\n\nThe film is ultimately carried by its two leads, who have delivered the performances of their careers to date. Forest Whitaker is endearing as Idi Amin in many moments, and before you know it, even much more terrifying. Especially when it comes to suggesting Amin's eccentricity and mood swings, Whitaker leaves you in awe. He embodies the character as if it was meant for him alone. James McAvoy is also excellent as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, even if he is downright paraded by Whitaker in dialogues. But that doesn't matter, as he flashes his full potential in vulnerable moments. The transformation from na\u00efve neo-doctor to determined avenger and man on the run is the main plotline of the film, which makes McAvoy the movie's real protagonist. But Whitaker's explosive performance leaves no one in any doubt that the story is really all about him. Kerry Washington still needs to be singled out from the otherwise manageable cast. As Amin's wife Kay, she suffers the most from his madness and acts very authentically in her emotional scenes.  \n\nThe Last King of Scotland is very reminiscent of Hotel Rwanda: a tragic event in an African country that plays out over the mass murder of a particular party. Except that here it is the person Idi Amin rather than an entire group. Through Whitaker's performance one gets a very good impression of what kind of person Idi Amin really was and how much terror this man caused through his almost bipolar appearance. The fact that the story around his relationship with Garrigan is fictional makes the film a little less approachable than, for example, Hotel Rwanda. In general, The Last King of Scotland depends too much on its performances, which leaves the plot a little short. You are definitely invested, but the big rousing and emotional moments are largely absent. Still, the film is interesting and exciting to watch until the very end. Especially when Whitaker brings Idi Amin to life.",

But the primary reason why it works is that it isn't based upon one's textbook formula of depicting the bonding from the scratch. \n\nThese pragmatic characters bonds instantly with mature mutual objectives or ideology and the makers have somehow managed to keep it on the edge of the storyline that leaves the audience uncertain and unaware of the repercussions that it is breeding or where the track is leading to. \n\nThe writing is mature, adaptive and layered if not gripping, but is certainly worth the work it offers. The background score isn't impressive but few songs are up beating along with metaphorical cinematography and fine editing. \n\nThe camera work with unusual theme draws the attention which is then celebrated by the cultural references and the knack for projecting inherent rituals that is well detailed. McDonald's world is bolder and much smarter but as much as work it has invested on the semantics, it fails to foliate the subjective procedure of it. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, Whittaker has never been so convincing and so confident and on the other hand, McAvoy shows some promising range on portraying vulnerability and slick persona. The ruggedness among the three dimensional characters, its perpetual ideology and panache on methodology and, stellar performance that fuels this drama are the high points of the feature.\n\nArmed with a fascinating and creative structure, The Last King Of Scotland is an art that demands to be explored upon and its the writing that demands it and the execution that satisfies it.",

            "content": "The two films that I would like to review are \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \" Catch a Fire,\" both based on true story that took place in Africa. The Last King of Scotland was a very touching film, which starred Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin. Forest really played his part in this movie, me as the audience felt the emotional aspect this movie set. I touched base with some of the characters; Kay Amin ( played by Kerry Washington) who was one of the last wives of Idi Amin. Her love affair with Dr.Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy) seemed to be very genuine, but it was a love affair that caused Kay to get murdered. That's after a boarding the baby Kay and Dr.Garrigan conceived. Dr.Nicholas Garrigan was a Scottish doctor on a mission to help, he became Idi Amin's personal physician and confidante. \n\t Catch a Fire was a movie based out of South Africa, which was basically about terrorist. The movie was good, there were a some parts I could connect with. A hard working black man just trying to make a honest living for his family; Patrick Chamusso who was played by Derek Luke. Patrick got falsely accused of bombing the se factory that he works in. Patrick Chamusso was husband, father, son, and coach for a local soccer team. The bombing at the factory placed Chamusso as a terrorist (falsely accused). Nic Vos who is a very high ranked colonel; played by Tim Robbins spent weeks of beating and torturing Patrick trying to get answers.\n\tIn the Last King of Scotland Nicholas put all his trust into Idi Amin thinking he was a good President of Uganda, without even realizing that he was mentally being tortured. Just as in the film Catch a Fire, but instead Patrick was being tortured physically and forced join the AFC. The AFC is a outlawed activist organization, which stands for African National Congress. Nic Vos considered them terrorist. Idi Amin was no different from Nic Vos, they both did lots of killings. Nicholas started to see certain people that surrounded President Amin disappear. As in Catch a Fire Patrick closed friends were being tortured and killed by Vos.\n\tWhen Idi Amin find out about Kay (his wife) and Dr.Nicholas affair, as well as the baby, he had her murdered. He had her body cut into pieces; arms, legs, head, ears etc. all cut in pieces. Took me to when Nic Vos took Patricks wife Precious (played by Bonnie Henna) and had raped and tortured by his Lieutenants, all just to get a false confession out of Chamusso. \t\"They take you to a tree and hang you by your skin. Each time you scream the evil comes out of you. Sometimes, it can take three days for your evil to be spent. Pull him up\" quoted by President Idi Amin. He took thick fish hooks and pierced Dr.Garrigan by his chest (nipples) and hung him. Dr.Garrigan ended up escaping back to Scotland to tell the truth about Uganda. Patrick did the same thing when he had to leave his family to join the AFC, once he was released from Nic Vos. Vos drove Patrick to join the AFC, Patrick was not about politics by any means.  Once he joined the AFC his name then became \"Hotstuff.\"\n\tBoth the Last King of Scotland and Catch a Fire were great movies. However, in Catch a  Fire I find Derek Luke acting to be a little on the normal side. It was not his best movie. I found myself more connected to the movie \"Antwone Fisher\" then Catch a Fire. In Catch a Fire after he as let go, he was always on the run. His wife told Nic Vos where to find Patrick, because they (the Lieutenants) told her he was cheating with one of the woman in the AFC. Although, I will say that Derek Luke evolution from pillar of the community to terrorist was brilliant. I actually find it more interesting to watch Tim Robbins play Nic Vos. Nic Vos was a monster in this movie. The Last King of Scotland gave some real insight into the terrifying Idi Amin. He was not painted as a sympathetic way and does not cover up the troubles of Ugandan government. Forest Whitaker really out did himself in this film. I did not like him at all, he was so hateful. I've felt that one way in one other movie from his, which is \"Jason's Lyric.\" When you can step into character where the audience feels you mentally, emotionally and physically means they executed they're acting just right. There was a quote that stuck out to me in Catch a Fire when Nic Vos finally caught Patrick, that I would like to end with, and I quote \"my children, when they speak of their father, they will say he was a man who stood up for what was right, a man who said he must do something now. What will your children say about you?\"",

I didn't even see Forest Whitaker after 30 seconds of his performance. Not only did he completely transform, but you actually like his character to begin with. Along with a great script and superb performances from both Whitaker and James McAvoy, I was invested the entire way through. I was also suprised how intriguing and intense the film became in the second and third acts. It's the kind of intrigue where you sit there thinking, \"Okay, this whole situation seems too good to be true. Something's not right here.\" With that thought in your mind, you get sucked into the story all the way to an ending that really reminded me of 'Argo'. No spoilers, but there are some similarities. Overall, this is a film to watch for the performances. Sure the story is a good story and the location and setting is a unique one, but the performances really elevate this movie. Give it a watch.",

While I'm sure many other actors could do the part justice, although none could match his intensity, the film is simply underwhelming in every other aspect. The mixing of fact and fiction is never really a good idea but surprisingly it did work here, even if McAvoys character was unbelievably unrealistic, I feel that it worked anyway, although I'm sure someone who knows all the history about this person might notice some things that don't make sense.  it's just the script is very weak and the pace never really garnered any suspense or tension until the last half an hour or so. I never really got a vibe that Amin turned from people pleaser into dictator. In the movie, just by camera angles and long shots, the movie portrayed him as a man with something to hide but putting on a persona of a gentle person, or maybe that was the point?\n\nIn the same year another film about power and corruption was released but as this one was garnered with lots of praise, that movie was not and I feel that, that movie did it better. 'All The Kings Men' directed by Steven Zallian is one of my favourite movies of all time and even though the film was over directed I still feel that the story of corruption was told better even with its story that you need to 100% give your in divided attention to.\n \nThis movie was hard to rate, I only watched it because Forrest is one of my favourite actors and of course I'm going to watch his Oscar winning performance and all the movie is pretty much him so that gets high marks but on the other hand the film is very weak in every other aspect but we saw some of Scully so that's cool. \n\nAll someone needs to do is get an acting reel of Whitaker in the film and I'll be happy.

After taking the job as the personal doctor to Idi Amin, Nicholas soon realises that he is trapped in this position after witnessing the horrors that take place at the hands of the evil dictator.\n\nThe Last King of Scotland gives us an immensely violent and vivid portrayal of Uganda under the rule of Idi Amin. The film uses fictional protagonist Nicholas Garrigan and places him into the history books to tell the story of one of the most vicious tyrants of all time. James McAvoy's portrayal of a young Scottish doctor, looking to help with African poverty is a tragic one. Nicholas' transformation from naivety to fear is one that is extremely well performed by McAvoy. However, the stand out performance is that of Forest Whitaker. He delivers a flamboyancy that manipulates not only Nicholas but also the audience, as at no point can you detract your eyes from Whitaker's Amin. As the film progresses, and especially throughout the last quarter, Whitaker's showman-like personality solidifies into complete terror and rage. It is this seemingly effortless transformation that gave Forest Whitaker the Oscar. An electric performance.\n\nThe Last King of Scotland impresses throughout, definitely one of the top films of 2006, successfully crafting a mixture between a biopic and thriller.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n7.5/10.",

After taking the job as the personal doctor to Idi Amin, Nicholas soon realises that he is trapped in this position after witnessing the horrors that take place at the hands of the evil dictator.\n\nThe Last King of Scotland gives us an immensely violent and vivid portrayal of Uganda under the rule of Idi Amin. The film uses fictional protagonist Nicholas Garrigan and places him into the history books to tell the story of one of the most vicious tyrants of all time. James McAvoy's portrayal of a young Scottish doctor, looking to help with African poverty is a tragic one. Nicholas' transformation from naivety to fear is one that is extremely well performed by McAvoy. However, the stand out performance is that of Forest Whitaker. He delivers a flamboyancy that manipulates not only Nicholas but also the audience, as at no point can you detract your eyes from Whitaker's Amin. As the film progresses, and especially throughout the last quarter, Whitaker's showman-like personality solidifies into complete terror and rage. It is this seemingly effortless transformation that gave Forest Whitaker the Oscar. An electric performance.\n\nThe Last King of Scotland impresses throughout, definitely one of the top films of 2006, successfully crafting a mixture between a biopic and thriller. \n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n7.5/10.",

It displays a realistic portrayal of their people without being full of propaganda and bias, despite realistic portrayal of the savage events that went on.\nThe second thing you'll notice which is the reason The Last King of Scotland is so memorable, is Forest Whitaker's performance\nForest Whitaker's performance is the best of 2006. Again, the audience get's to witness his flawless skill at accent changing in his vocal abilities, his greatest since The Crying Game in 1992. His portrayal of Idi Amin is excellent not only because of the amazing Ugandan accent, but because of his ability to portray a humourous everyman as well as an intimidating savage dictator which strongly characterises him as an absolute madman. Whitaker's performance is nothing short of Oscar-worthy and the international breakthrough he has long deserved. He gave one of the best performances of the 2000's.\nJames McAvoy also provided a good lead in his breakthrough as an ambitious young Scottish doctor with a performance second to Whitaker's, but still definitely memorable. His character development and line delivery was strong, and the positive\nlight of his character added light to the story.\n\nIn some of the scenes in The Last King of Scotland, you find yourself enjoying the events, while later on you find yourself on the edge of the seat with the absolute intensity of the story, mainly thanks to the intense atmosphere, the fearful musical score and Whitaker's performance.\nThe Last King of Scotland really tells it's story well and draws a strong premise with constant changing moods and a powerful script. The brutality of the power in The Last King of Scotland is so strong that it is difficult for viewers to deal with, and it follows no cliches so the audience never knows what to expect.\nWhat audiences can expect from The Last King of Scotland is an unpredictable and shocking story that turns into an excellent film that deserved more Academy Awards than just the one, including a Best Picture nomination. The Last King of Scotland is unforgettable, as is Forest Whitaker's performance which leaves the audience fearful of him.",

The movie has a special tone that isn't too obvious depicting a time when 300'000 people were killed. Because this is a portrait of Idi Amin and how Garrigan is entangled by this man, how he can be kept as his advisor without noticing everything going on and it's effective.\n\nThe film is predicable towards the end when it turns into more of a thriller with a more gritty approach. But the predicability is part of the message, a part of most dictators and other people with too much power. It's very well shown from beginning to end how both Amin and Garrigan change.\n\nThe ending is spot on with enough of an opening but no untied threads.\n\nWhat little I can say what wasn't perhaps on par with the other stuff in the movie is this: there are some brutal moments in the movie but they feel so detached from the rest of the story that is all about rock'n'roll - and so little time is spent building it up - that I didn't feel the punch in the stomach that I had expected.\n\nI could have perhaps taken in a little more facts about the time without ruining the experience. I \"wanted\"/expected to feel worse and more like after watching \"Hotel Rwanda\" - how could the world let this happen? But this movie, in trying to show the detachment from the rest of the world and for Garrigan from the rest of the country.\n\nBut these things I have to think to come up with and that I'd like to know more about the couple of doctors also in Uganda and he has NO contact with his parents?\n\nWhat makes me like it so much is the same thing that make it impossible to give it five stars in a sense - I actually enjoy watching it!
