The shot composition and fast editing give Hot Fuzz a thrillingly fast pace and the many clever jokes per minute work very well with this. I also love the movie's central mystery - it's super well-handled. The cast is fun in general and the comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are perfect in the leading roles. I think the ending is a little weaker than the rest of the movie but it hardly matters.",

Of the trilogy this is the best one with belly laughs every few sentences. If comedy is this easy, why are there so many duds released? This film has a constant flow of action, humour and great chemistry between Pegg and Frost. Hugely quotable and can be watched over and over without wearing you out.",

As well, even though Hot Fuzz is an action comedy genre , there are lot of moments of other genres, for example, drama - scene, where Danny shot in Nick and fell down like he was murdered, but it was just a help from Butterman to Angel for not to be killed by the union(to simulate this situation). I should separately bout emotions in this film as you watch this masterpiece in one breath. So, this one will not only worth you time of watching, but also a king ransom's.

It's silly and tired to do a cop farce now. It's such well trodden ground it's bound to come up extremely lacking and this script falls short in laughs and excitement.

Simon Pegg believably sheds the 'Shaun' slacker pose to play a ramrod-straight do-gooder cop. He's a great reactor, a generous straight man with his castmates and scores laughs in slow-burn mode. Nick Frost is always funny and has effortless chemistry with Pegg. There's great supporting turns by former Bond Timothy Dalton and Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent. Look for fun cameos sprinkled throughout, including Billy Nighy, Peter Jackson, and Cate Blanchett. The action beats are convincing enough to pass muster in a real action film, and juiced by great running gags. It goes on too long, but that may be by design, emulating how most action films wander past their climax. But director Edgar Wright, Pegg and Frost have scored another riotous hit and are worth keeping an eye on for their next funny project",

But Hot Fuzz is a hugely enjoyable, original and daring comedy. It is fast-paced fun from start to finish. And all this is helped by a sharply observed screenplay, next to flawless comic timing and a wonderful performance from Simon Pegg playing it straight as the over zealous cop. The supporting actors do just as brilliantly with Nick Frost the standout and Jim Broadbent brilliant as always. Paddy Cosidine and Rafe Spall are hilarious as the two Andys, and Timothy Dalton is a pleasant surprise as Simon Skinner, and steals every scene he's in.\n\nThe camera-work is very dark and brooding, and there are some clever homages to other movies of the genre. At a little over two hours, the film is perhaps a little too long, but the film constantly goes at a break neck pace so it doesn't matter. The plot is rather original and daring, about Nick Angel getting promoted and being relocated to the hamlet of Sandford. The direction from Edgar Wright is solid throughout and has this appropriately offbeat style. Overall, a very affectionate, daring and enjoyable film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",

Even though I enjoyed the comedy, some jokes definitely didn't land for me either, but that's okay. As I mentioned, the characters in this are all brilliant and distinct, which enables the audience to come to know each character, which makes the end much better. The acting is okay, but that's to be expected in this kind of film. All of that said, the movie is an absolute blast, even if the jokes won't land for everyone, the action and pacing allows anyone to at least have a good time watching it, which is always a bonus. This movie truly shows Edgar Wright's biggest strength, being able to make a scene that is usually incredibly boring one of the most exciting scenes ever. He does this through fast cuts, but allowing enough time for the audience to comprehend what's happening. Ultimately, Hot Fuzz is probably one of my favorite Edgar Wright films, however, I would be wrong not to say that there were quite a few bits that didn't land for me, personally.",

With a budget busting send up of all things action, with a positive skew to our good old boys in blue, and all the silliness of a small village Agatha Christie, Hot Fuzz is easily the most quotable, most detailed and most flat out fun of the Cornetto Trilogy. Is it my favourite? Not by a long shot, but it's hard not to admire a send up of Bad Boys 2 that also manages to be completely its own beast.\nHot Fuzz is so densely packed that it's hard not to appreciate a new gag each time; and although it doesn't quite have the timing and pacing and quality of gags and lines and character that Shaun did, its reverence of the en vogue action films of the time is enough to allow it to shine.\nAlso very much timeless and a product of its time. It seems Edgar Wright is a talent in this department.\nThe film that put Simon Pegg on the map as a real credible action/comedy/dramatic star. A film that sometimes buckles under its own bloated complex and layered plot, and its myriad of influences not least of all Wicker-Man horror, Broadchurch style provincial Brit crime mystery, Man on Fire acid action flicks and Michael Bay excess.\nIt's got broad, British gags, some absolutely blinding acting and line readings, perfect parody/homage, and tight jokes that make up for the fact that Wright struggles against the budget and his still-youthful directing style and forms a choppy and overlong but still robust and entirely entertaining film of silliness.",

            "content": "The comedy that just keeps giving.\n\nEdgar Wright's crime comedy Hot Fuzz (2007) is a brilliantly layered movie of repeating jokes, escalating violence, ridiculous situations, and delightful atmosphere. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's writing is pithy and genius as he cleverly parodies the buddy cop genre rife with references to actions thrillers and crime dramas. Wright's frenetic direction and signature rapid fire cuts are almost as explosive as Hot Fuzz's gunfire laden finale. \n\nHot Fuzz is shot like a serious police investigation drama, so that the audience is gripped by the crime story being told through Wright's dazzling writing. Yet, Wright's dry British sense of humor cuts through all the tension with a deliriously fun pacing and non-stop jokes. Hot Fuzz is the most rewarding comedy in decades as it gets funnier every time you revisit it due to Wright's complex structure and storytelling. You will constantly find new details, references, setups, and payoffs around every charming corner.\n\nHot Fuzz twists the small English rural town into a horror setting of brutal murder and pleasant afternoons. Everything is so quaint that you will not mind the murders in Hot Fuzz. The loud rock music befits Hot Fuzz perfectly for a blaring score that will have you thinking of police sirens forever. With a pretty backdrop of the English countryside for a setting the naturalistic production design all looks like Hot Fuzz could take place in a real English village. Hot Fuzz takes on police ethics, citizen's morals, and the importance of relaxing from time to time. Much like Wright's previous film in his Cornetto Trilogy called Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz finds a chill vibe that feels like you are hanging out with your best friend for his crime comedy.\n\nSimon Pegg is seriously compelling as a hard edge police officer named Sergeant Nicholas Angel. His straight man performance is gets the perfect foil Nick Frost's sincere and stupid fool PC Danny Butterman. Together, Pegg and Frost make the ideal movie duo of constant good-natured laughter and good times. They deliver remarkable chemistry and endless chuckles with steadfast timing and earnest portrayals that endear you to their aloof and often astute officers.\n\nTimothy Dalton steals the show with his scenery chewing scoundrel character Simon Skinner. Jim Broadbent is hilarious as the accommodating Police Inspector Frank Butterman. Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are so funny as belligerent DS's Andy Wainwright and Andy Cartwright, respectively. Olivia Colman gets an early comedic spotlight before The Favourite as the cheery and cheeky PC Doris Thatcher. Kevin Eldon is a riot as the nearly completely incompetant Sergeant Tony Fisher. Karl Johnson's almost entirely incoherent thick English countryside accent is hilarious with every incomprehensible line and all the sweeter alongside his cute police K9 Saxon! Bill Bailey's front desk police officer Sergeant Turner is too funny with his lackadaisical nonchalant attitude.\n\nMartin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy, Cate Blanchett, Peter Jackson, and Stephen Merchant all get wonderful cameos that are sure to put a smile on your face. Rory McCann and David Bradley both have funny supporting roles long before their casting in Game of Thrones. Hot Fuzz features numerous hilarious elderly performances that I will not spoil.\n\nOverall, Hot Fuzz' eccentric premise, suspenseful tone, witty writing, firebrand editing, and killer cast ensure that this film will remain a comedy classic. Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are not to be missed!",

Maybe it's because I'm just waiting for the classic moments to happen and not appreciating the parts in between like I was able to the first time, where I wasn't really expecting anything in particular. The little visual details are great, of course, and there are some truly mindblowing details that I didn't catch the first time that just make the film so much smarter. I will say, however, that some jokes simply weren't as funny when I rewatched them; what once made me laugh at loud now just elicits a slight chuckle out of me, but don't let that turn you off from this movie. It's a smart, fast-paced and of course funny parody and homage to cop films, cult films and murder mysteries that is truly surprising, and also serves as a great character study for its main lead.

Iniziano una serie di omicidi che vengono ritenuti da tutti degli incidenti, fatta eccezione per Angel, che scavando sempre pi√π a fondo scopre una \"lobby\" che comanda il paese e il tutto termina con un mare di azione, di sparatorie e inseguimenti. Fantastica la scena in cui il prete dice una parolaccia e poi bestemmia, la pellicola √® geniale, divertente e non annoia mai; lo stile registico di Wright qui √® ancora pi√π evidente, con cambi di inquadratura velocissimi e scene girate benissimo.

Police constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) always gets his man, but these days his impeccable record seems to be more indicative of his fellow officers' shortcomings than his own formidable skills as a keeper of the peace. Loathe to stand idly by as their once respectable track record is steadily soiled by the hyper-competent actions of one lone overachiever, Sergeant Angel's superiors at the Met soon determine to remedy their problem by relocating the decorated constable to the West Country village of Sanford -- where tranquil garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings stand in stark contrast to the violent crime and heated gunplay of the city.\n\nOkay, to be completely honest, I thought this was a zombie movie going into it. I don't know where I got that notion from but I just thought it was. So this whole movie, I'm waiting for the zombies to show up and I'm wondering...\"Where are they? It's gettin' a bit late to add them to the movie\". It didn't hinder my experience, it just showed my stupidity...\n\n\"Hot Fuzz\" is a fun film and that's the best word I can use to describe it. It's filled with fast, rapid cuts, weird humor, different characters, and more. It's a smart movie with a lot to its characters and even though I wasn't in love with it, I still appreciate a lot of different things about it. \n\nOne thing I also really liked was the duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Obviously the two work so well together, as they've stared in more than one film together. But their chemistry on screen makes for some really funny moments and it constantly kept me entertained. I think even if they were in a bad film together, they could still salvage some pieces from it. \n\nIn the end, \"Hot Fuzz\" is an entertaining, non-zombie film with plenty of rapid cuts and wit.",

All building up to an action-packed climax in which you might notice something when the action comes to a close. I'm not going to spoil it here, though.

Not as laugh-out-loud funny as the other two Cornetto Trilogy films, but it's still very clever. However, the mysteries within this story go through so many twists and turns, and they're all so brilliantly set up and executed that I have no trouble believing \"Hot Fuzz\" could appeal and be completely loved by people who aren't in the slightest bit interested in this style of comedy. I think it works best as a satirical comedy, but the drama and action are great all on their own. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are excellent as always, and the supporting cast is filled with standouts as well. And Edgar Wright's signature flare is as appreciated here as ever. I thought there were moments where the cutting got too frantic and the stylized transitions became distracting, but it didn't tarnish my overall experience with the film, and I can't imagine any of it working anywhere near as well as it did if Wright wasn't at the helm. On paper, \"Hot Fuzz\" might seem like a much less zany film than the other two Cornetto Trilogy instalments, but I'm happy to report how much so that isn't the case. It's a difficult film to adequately describe without spoiling, so I'll just ask that I'm trusted when I say that fans of Wright, Pegg, Frost and either cop dramas or witty comedies will have plenty to love here, and I doubt anyone will be disappointed.",

If you hate parodies, you'll despise this movie. It beats off every clich√© like the holy ghost. It couldn't be any less serious if Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were dressed as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck while riding a rainbow pony on Mars while simultaneously being chased by both the cast(not characters) of Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Coronation Street. It's a completely bonkers movie that owes all of its praise to Edgar Wright's stellar direction, the incredible writing(courtesy of Wright and Pegg) and a series of brilliant performances that elevate this movie into greatness. Please, I made the mistake of putting off watching this movie until now and I regret my decision. I watched it on Netflix and then bought it on blu ray mere hours later. It's a great comedy and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nNeed more convincing? Fine. This movie could have provided some completely pointless story just to usher along a series of unfortunate events for the main cast. It does not. While it is a tad bit predictable at points, the writers provided a solid mystery story that supports the humour and cast. The ending is perfect and may be one of the best parody movie moments in movie HISTORY. That awesome action sequence is pure genius and I cannot flaw it. \n\nNeed more. Jeez, you're difficult to convince. Simon Pegg is excellent as Nicholas Angel(who is also the name of one of the cast by the way!) and his personality is a perfect contrast against his partner(Danny Butterman(played excellently by Nick Frost))'s joking and comical persona. Jim Broadbent was great as Inspector Butterman as was Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner. The villains were incredibly fun and predictable and they genuinely keep you guessing who it is, even though you probably guessed it before the half way mark. Each and every character is memorable, if not by personality not by name. That is pretty damn impressive considering how many there actually are in the movie.\n\n*sigh* I've started now so I'll finish, even though my persuasive skills have undoubtedly convinced you already. Wright directed this movie flawlessly and I adore how he uses the cinematography to provide humour. The costume design is literally flawless. I dare you to poke a flaw in Wright's costume design because you just cannot.\n\nThis movie is first and foremost, a comedy. And it perfected that art. I've not laughed as much in a very long time. The mystery is genuinely intriguing and the action is also awesome. If you don't like this movie, I don't like you. It is a hilarious movie and probably one of the funniest I've seen in a long, long, long time. Please, do yourself a favour and watch this movie. I'll rate it a near perfect 9 out of 10 swans.",

Nicoll once memorably said that the English language \"has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.\" This lack of an original culture - since the Norman conquest, at any rate - tends to produce one of three responses: extreme resentment and xenophobia, invention of a new culture to fill the void (as J. R. R. Tolkien attempted for English mythology with The Lord of the Rings), or the most common route: assimilation of multiple other sources to create something unexpected and unique.\n\nWhen Edgar Wright came to make Hot Fuzz, he spoke about the fact that Britain lacked a cop movie genre to rival that of the United States. Where Hollywood had given the world Lethal Weapon, Point Break, the Police Academy series and the Naked Gun trilogy, Britain's cinematic relationship with the police has been largely confined to piecemeal efforts like Carry On Sergeant. Britain has always been more in love with the procedural drama or detectives beating the police at their own game, both of which have always made for gripping television. Hot Fuzz redresses this balance quite beautifully, being a fantastic film which succeeds as both a rip-roaring pastiche and a genuine thriller on its own.\n\nOne of the issues with classing Hot Fuzz as a parody - as opposed to a pastiche or homage - is the affectionate relationship it has towards its main characters. Simon Pegg himself has claimed that the film is not a spoof, arguing in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that iy \"lacks the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it.\". Where something like Heathers deliberately and consciously tore into what had gone before it, and the Naked Gun films used its premise as a springboard into all manner of goofy shenanigans, Hot Fuzz is a love letter to the genre with a distinctly British twist, simultaneously displaying affection for something and taking the piss out of both the genre and itself.\n\nThe film builds on everything that made Shaun of the Dead such an enjoyable watch and refines it, thanks in no small part to the excellent chemistry of Pegg and Nick Frost. In particular, it takes the suburban drudgery and small social landscape of Shaun of the Dead (where zombies serve as the perfect interruption to our lead's repetitive social life) and expands it to lovingly skewer an entire way of life in the West Country. Wright chose to shoot the bulk of the film in his home city of Wells, quipping: \"I love it but I also want to trash it.\" The county has taken the film to heart, holding public screenings in Wells to mark its 10th anniversary last year and voting it the winner of the 'World Cup of Somerset' on Twitter.\n\nOne of the greatest tricks that Hot Fuzz manages to pull off lies in its use of rapid editing. Specifically, it manages to employ the language of fast cuts and frenetic action that is part and parcel of modern Hollywood without losing either its unique identity or sight of its subject matter. Where Michael Bay and his derivatives use needlessly rapid editing to hide their lack of substance or attention spans, Wright uses rapid editing to send up the relentless, often idiotic pace of action movies. It's not just that the guns are being trained on pensioners and farmers rather than cowboys or gangsters - it's that the film pokes fun at this shooting style to create a spectacle all of its own.\n\nThe film is able to get away with this section towards the end, sending up Lethal Weapon and countless westerns, because of how quintessentially British its set-up and opening section is. Not only is the introduction of Nicholas Angel so wonderfully English - being sent to a rural patch so his colleagues won't be embarrassed by how brilliant he is - but the whole mystery plot is essentially a modern-day riff on The Wicker Man. You could even describe the film as The Wicker Man with jokes - a comparison supported by the presence of Edward Woodward in a delightful supporting role.\n\nLike Robin Hardy's cult classic, Hot Fuzz centres around a lone individual with extremely high standards of right and wrong coming into an isolated(ish) rural community with a dark secret. 'The Greater Good' stands in for the harvest, and the murders of the village folk to secure the Best Village status doubles for the 'pagan' need for a human sacrifice to make the crops grow.  Simon Skinner is on one level a riper, more knowingly gleeful version of Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle, holding the various local groups in his thrall and leaving our heroes shuddering in his wake. Timothy Dalton is really enjoying himself, sending up his period as James Bond with wanton abandon.\n\nUsing Hardy's film as a base, Wright proceeds to create a fantastic satire of the sleepiness of English rural life. He looks back to the classic Will Hay comedies of the 1930s, like Oh Mr Porter! and Ask A Policeman, which revolved around extraordinary things happening in the middle of nowhere, and brings them screaming into the 21st century with his own astute observations. Only someone who has grown up in the British countryside could so accurately replicate the often desperate tactics of local journalists (said with a mirror to my own face), the prying, gossipy eyes of the Neighbourhood Watch, the pettiness of the local business community or the unknowingly hammy display by the amateur dramatics society (another mirror to my own face).\n\nEven if the comedy of Hot Fuzz doesn't quite gel with you, it still works perfectly well as a straight thriller. The means of the deaths may be a lot more elaborate than the average episode of Midsomer Murders, but the plot unspools beautifully with Wright leaving subtle clues and punctuating what little exposition is needed with cracking physical gags and the development of the central relationship. By the time the final act comes, in all its explosive and indulgent glory, we are so taken in by the skill that Wright has displayed that we feel he has earned the right to blaze through to the end. The film escalates breathtakingly, giving us glimpses of what is to come (say, in the sea mine sequence) and then rewarding our patience with a climax that doesn't disappoint.\n\nThis brings us on to the violence of the film, which picks up where Shaun of the Dead left off in both its prevalence and its philosophy. Both films take after Sam Raimi in their approach to violence, ramping it up to such demented and absurd levels that you can't help but laugh, and paying off a great set-up with something shocking. Seeing Dalton's character impaled on a model church, with the spire going right through his jaw, is not merely a step up from the pool cue sequence from Shaun of the Dead, where a zombie is beaten to death in time to Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now'. It is up there with anything in Evil Dead 2, taking something really shocking and making it shockingly hilarious.\n\nIf we were applying Mark Kermode's patented 'five laughs' test here (under which any film which produces five or more laughs is a successful comedy), Hot Fuzz would shoot over the bar within the first half hour. Wright's love of nerd culture and knowledge of the genres he is ribbing means that there is huge attention to detail, with every scene containing multiple gags that reward repeat viewing. The visual touches are every bit as meticulous as those in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and are as English as Aardman at its finest. But the verbal humour is just as good, being built around the eccentricity of the characters, whether it's Bill Bailey's ongoing cameo or David Bradley's incomprehensible, shotgun-wielding farmer.\n\nBut what really lifts Hot Fuzz from being a great comedy into a truly brilliant one is the affection we have for the characters. For all their goofing around and ripping off scenes from their favourite films, there is genuine heart in the relationship between Pegg and Frost's characters; you come to understand their frustrations and the shortcomings very naturally. The same goes for Jim Broadbent's character: his villainy is convincing because he's well-written as someone carrying a heavy burden and afraid to let go of the past. By allowing this to unfold in a relatable way, the film avoids either putting the brakes on the comedy to make a point or falling apart in a mawkish way at the end.\n\nHot Fuzz is a truly terrific British comedy and easily one of the best films of the 2000s. It remains arguably the high watermark of Edgar Wright's career to date, building on everything he achieved in Spaced and Shaun of the Dead through an excellent, original script, a barnstorming ensemble cast and some stylish yet painstaking direction. Eleven years on from its first release, there are few British comedies which can rival it in its perfect balance of heart and massive belly laughs.",

            "content": "Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright get together to continue the work they started with 2004's Shaun of the Dead, this time dropping a parody of cheesy police action flicks. Like its predecessor, it works on a satirical level, but also as a standalone - albeit one with far less heart than we saw in Shaun. Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a straight-laced London constable who's so fanatical about his job, the top brass worry they'll look bad by comparison and ship him off to the minor leagues. There he partners with Frost, a slobbish underachiever, and swiftly uncovers a vast criminal conspiracy. Fuzz relies heavily on one-liners and sight gags, which are generally pretty effective, but lacks a real emotional hook. That makes for an entertaining two hours, if not for endless re-screenings. The best work comes from the supporting cast, with Timothy Dalton leading the pack as the town's squinting, scheming, mustachioed mastermind grocer. And, of course, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are downright show-stealing as the two Andys, resident detectives more concerned with needling newbies than cracking cases. I could've done with a lot more of those guys. A good film, with some big laughs, but no more than that. It's tough to avoid constant comparisons to the team's preceding effort, which isn't a fair match.",

He's also often cast in top quality films that are really funny (not like the majority of comedies that are just rehashes of cliche slap stick, crotch, and gross out humor), like Paul, Shaun of the Dead, and The World's End. Some of his best work can be found in movies that are not blockbusters, even those he does a smash up job there as well.\n\nYou've just got to love a film in which there is no single killer (how cliche and boring would that be?) but rather an entire town of killers, most middle aged and elderly. You've just got to love a scene in which a grandma is about to blow away Pegg's character but he puts her down with a decisive kick to the face. Or how about a ozzie firing octogenarian who's hell bent on taking you out? Epic\n\nWhen Sgt. Angel (Pegg) discovers that the \"accidents\" that are happening are murders perpetrated by a secret society that kills, well, it kills just because maybe you're annoying. That's good enough reason, isn't it?  And to top it off is PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Sgt. Angel's childish side kick who completes the film. \n\nSure, there are great belly laughs, but greater than that is the absurdity of the murderers, simple country folk gone bad ass. It's a great script with wonderful acting that culminates in PC Butterman firing into the air just like Keau Reeves from Butterman's favortie film.",

SMALL TOWN. MODERATE VIOLENCE.\nThis is about to go off. I mean I'm sitting throughout this film laughing and I'm like why is that then I remember it's a freaking part of the cornetto trilogy. With a unique spin on the sub-genre of buddy cop films(which I haven't watched a lot of). It's so much fun you'll need some ice cream.\nThe film revolves around Nicholas Angel(Simon Pegg) who is a big city cop who can't be stopped-but he's making everyone else on the force look bad. When he is reassigned to a small quite town called Sanford,he struggles with his new seemingly idyllic world and his bumbling partner(Nick Frost). Their dull existence is interrupted by several grisly and suspicious accidents,and the crime-fighting duo turn up the heat and hand out high-octane,car-crashing,gun-fighting,big city justice.\nI gotta admit it felt kind of slow but when the murders started and the jokes,fences and ice cream kept coming I kept laughing and putting a smile on my face. This would actually make sense,what the murders do in this film,that could happen it brings a situation you would probably see this happen in a small town or village where everyone knew each other.\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost come packing with the same hilarious chemistry they had in Shaun of the dead,when there together on screen your going to die of laughter.\nThis satire of american action movie is one of the greatest films conceived by man,even if it's only issue I feel is that it does move pretty slow. It's fast with it's action and clever so I'm giving Hot Fuzz a four and a half out of five.",

Sie schenken uns ein neues Genre, im Grunde sogar zwei! Das tun sie mit unb√§ndigem Spass und einem kultiviertem Sinn f√ºr die Unterschiede britischen und amerikanischen Verbrechens. Nicht zuletzt: Es gibt einige wirklich grosse Lacher! Pegg spielt den Polizisten Nicholas Angel, einen heftig motivierten und √ºberaus erfolgreichen Londoner Cop. Die Verbrechensrate sinkt in seinem Einsatzgebiet, doch damit stellt er auch die weniger bem√ºhten Kollegen bloss. Deshalb wird Angel nach Sandford versetzt - in ein verschlafenes Provinz-Kaff. Sein neuer Partner, Danny Butterman (Frost), ein √ºbergewichtiger und nachsichtiger \"Bobby\" mit Kulleraugen, kennt ihn bereits aus den Medien. Butterman ist begeistert von der Londoner Macho-Welt des Verbrechens. Er will von Angel alles erfahren: Ob ein Sch√§del platzt, wenn man das Gehirn zerschiesst? Ob er einen Schuss abfeuern kann, w√§hrend er seitlich in die Luft springt? Jeder in dieser manik√ºrten kleinen Gemeinde scheint seinen Nachbarn zu kennen und zu lieben. Vom Supermarkt Mogul (Timothy Dalton), zum Rechtsanwalt (David Threlfall) bis hin zum Dorfpolizisten. Die beiden Cops sind hier selbstverst√§ndlich √ºberfl√ºssig, das Recht spielt nur eine untergeordnete Rolle. Jeder Dorfbewohner ist manisch davon besessen, den Preis des sch√∂nsten Dorfes zu erringen. Wir lernen, dass die Folgen eines Misserfolges im Vorjahr einen Unfall nach sich zogen und eine Frau durchdrehte: \"She drove her Datsun Cherry into a ravine\". Doch gibt es wom√∂glich ein dunkles Geheimnis in dieser Vorzeige-Gemeinde? Beide Polizisten teilen miteinander eine tiefe, fast homoerotische Verbindung in Abwesenheit des weiblichen Geschlechts. Sie folgen den simplen Buddy Movies amerikanischen Vorbilds - ohne es zu ahnen, befinden sie sich aber in einem britischen Albtraum, ganz so als seien sie einem der englischen Horror Filme aus den 70ern entsprungen... W√§hrend in den amerikanischen Vorbildern das m√§nnliche Duo √ºber das B√∂se triumphiert, breitet sich hier eine satirische, pessimistische Kraft langsam aus. Die Kr√§fte des Guten erodieren... Der amerikanisch bewaffnete Einsatz wird vom gr√ºnen englischen Dorf erwiedert mit einer fremdenfeindlichen Verschw√∂rung. noch mehr britische Kom√∂dien in unserer Film list auf cinegeek.de",

            "content": "Hot Fuzz is a rare gem that is surprisingly better than its critical acclaim. It is a film that can easily be enjoyed as long as you don't mind its gratuitous violence at parts, but it is not the type of film that would garnish nominations for awards since it is more about entertainment than dramatic intent. It's sad that this is the case because it proves to be a solid movie through and through, breaking various conventions to make it stand out as well as implementing humor that is well beyond the likes of many comedies which come out in this day and age.\n\nFrom the start, the film has a recognizable distinct style involving high intensity editing and excellent cinematography. The opening sequence features a monologue by Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) highlighting his amazing credentials as a police officer in London over a montage of his work in the field which supports those credentials. The visual style that is established in this sequence engages the viewer and proves to never be a bore as it is used throughout the film.\n\nOnce again, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are at the core of the movie, and their relationship in this film is much more interesting than their relationship in the predecessor of this film in the Cornetto trilogy: Shaun of the Dead. Whereas in Shaun of the Dead the two were great friends and the core problem was that Frost's character somewhat held Pegg back, in this film Pegg and Frost develop an unlikely friendship after Pegg mentors Frost throughout the film on how to improve as a police officer. On the other hand, Pegg learns from Frost that there is excitement in being a police officer (as seen through action movies which Frost's character is captivated by) and that Pegg should not take the job (and life for that matter) too seriously.\n\nThe solution to the \"mystery\" in the film seems too obvious as it is heavily implied in the first half of the film, but the truth and motivation is so unexpected it actually produces laughs with its shock factor. After this reveal, Hot Fuzz takes a turn to be more dramatic and features an action-packed third act which proves to be great fun.\n\nSmart, well-made, and hilarious, Hot Fuzz is the type of film that would simply be a shame to miss out on.\n\n4.0/4.0",

Edgar Wright directs another beauty of film in Hot Fuzz. This is the kind of comedy that's good. An amusing plot that is entertaining with likable characters that engages with the audience. The films dialogue is quite fun once again with Frost and Pegg. The two are perfect in this film and will have you laughing the entire movie. The action in the movie is very well choreographed as well and is very entertaining. My only flaw with Hot Fuzz is the run time. I feel the last 20 minutes stretched on for a bit too long and they could have just wrapped up the movie a bit sooner. But aside from that I loved Hot Fuzz. Suspense, uncertainty, and an interesting twist make the film fun to watch. It brings energy, action, and many laughs for you to enjoy one fun movie.",

That's because 'Hot fuzz' parodies by off-the-wall exaggeration, and thus brings in high levels of excitement, tension and improved action that Edgar Wright directs impecably.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: This more over-the-top approach to satire is entertaining, but it looses the subtle intellegence of its predeccessor, and feels more self-contained and over-reliant on the madness as a result.\nVERDICT: It may not be as good as 'Shaun of the Dead,' but 'Hot Fuzz' is without a doubt an entertaining comedy with plenty of great action and off-the-wall moments.",

For the second chapter of the Three Flavor Cornetto Trilogy (this time the color being blue representing the police service) they would instead of make a buddy cop parody in the form of \"Hot Fuzz\".\nNicholas Angel is an extremely serious and efficient police officer that has a big passion and dedication to his job that he makes his agency look bad in comparison. To get rid of this problem, his superiors send Angel to a countryside village called Sandford, but Angel will soon discover that there is more to this peaceful little town that meets the eye.\nAfter a clever and hilarious satire of the overblow zombie genre, it seem like a good choice to focus on a buddy cop film now and the result was as fantastic as the last film. \"Hot Fuzz\" counts with fun performances, the chemistry between Peg and Frost continues to improve the acting and the enjoyment of the film, Wright¬¥s energetic direction continues to surprise as he shows to be a talented director who can handle different genres, the writing has improved, the jokes continue to be hilarious without exceptions, it has subtle callbacks to \"Shaun of the Dead\", a bigger cast of peculiar and fun to watch characters, the atmosphere is executed marvelously, there are numerous references/gags of various films of this category-as in \"Shaun of the Dead\"-, well shot action sequences, an excessive use of gore that has a Verhoeven kind of vibe, a mystery which resolution is so hilarious that its an appropriate punchline for this joke of a film, the dialog is hilarious, the number of gags is increased but surprisingly it doesn't feel forced or oversaturated, lots of memorable scenes, it uses clich√©s in a fun/inventive way, a pacing that knows when it is required to be fast or to take its time, a humongous entertaining value and it shows respect to the genre they are making fun of. My big problem is that the film could have been more creative, it feels like an incomplete parody as it could have offered more. \n\"Hot Fuzz\" is, as its predecessor, a well-made hilarious satire. It takes the gags to a new level and it perfectly works. A more than worthy addition to this hilarious/memorable trilogy and another comedy that I love. Edgar Wright proves that he is more than a promising director/screenwriter and the trio shows that when they¬¥re together the result will defiantly be hilarious.",

It's incredibly funny, action packed, and it's got zombies. \"Hot Fuzz\" is a sort of sequel to this film. It's directed by Edgar Wright. The cast is lead by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Also, the film stars Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Dalton.\n\nNicholas Angel (Pegg) is a police officer serving in London. He is well respected and highly talented. One day, he is deemed unfit to work there do to how good he is at the job. So, he is shipped off to a little village called, Sandford. Oddly, the little village is seemingly void of crime. Nicholas is surprised by this, and having nothing better to do, goes to a pub. Within the pub, Angel meets Danny Butterman, the son of the police chief. The two soon become besties, and partners on the force. A curious murder occurs one night after a play. Angel and Butterman team up to find the culprits.\n\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost make one of the greatest team ups in comedy history. These guys are absolutely fantastic together. I first saw them in Shaun of the Dead, and it's great watching them together again. Usually, their friendship is built over the course of the films they are in. It's a bit repetitive, but once their together it's glorious. Simon Pegg is a really great actor, and he is really funny. The comedy-for the most part-was really great in this one. Some of the jokes didn't hit home, others were flat out hysterical. Edgar Wright is a brilliant director and writer. He reminds me very much of Quinton Tarantino, while also having his own unique style. \n\n\"Hot Fuzz\" is a really fresh comedy movie. Allot of buddy comedies nowadays don't work. However, when it comes to Edgar Wright, I know I can count on him. The film makes fun of allot of generic buddy comedy tropes. Perhaps that's why I loved it so much. Despite it's length-which is in my opinion too long-this was great fun. Brilliant acting, great cast, great script, and wonderful chemistry between Pegg and Frost. Also, lots of stylish bloody action.",

The chemistry between the two leads is one of the funniest I have seen in a long time and might be one of my favorite chemistries. The jokes are non-stop and just throw them at you, but in a surprise way, all of the jokes are really funny, and it even can get a bit parody here but still be its own movie. It has a smart script, and when you realize who the suspect is, you would be shocked and never guess it. The climax is exhilarating to watch that it gets you adrenaline-pumping and feel like you are in it too. The soundtrack is really good, and the camerawork is just nicely shotted. Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest movies I have ever see. And it is for me, the British version of 21 Jump Street in a sense of how much I laughed in those films.",

            "content": "Being Edgar Wright's follow up to the awesome horror-comedy Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz sounded hilarious.\n\nI'm going to be blunt: Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest films ever made in history. After directing an awesome horror-comedy hybrid on Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright manages to one up himself by taking on a mix of action and comedy, particularly the buddy cop genre. With an utmost passion for the genre which matches my own, Edgar Wright manages to direct Hot Fuzz to extents that are beyond imagination. Not only is Hot Fuzz a hilarious parody of the action genre, but it is also legitimately one of the greatest action films of the 2000's decade. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's screenplay continuously points towards the influence over this film by referencing such over the top action films as Point Break and Bad Boys II in the screenplay and then even mimicking certain scenes from those films. With intricate plotting, Hot Fuzz cleverly implements one of the key plot points from Point Break into its narrative in a way which is smart without being derivative while it borrows an iconic cinematography technique from Bad Boys II. The film is so proud of this that it clearly showcases both the films it borrows the elements from in the exact scenes and the way that it puts them into the narrative. It is brilliant, and all the action choreography does the same. Hot Fuzz succeeds as a parody of itself and a legitimate action film of its own right, a balance which Edgar Wright fearlessly reaches without even the slightest flinch. His directorial work is some of the most refreshing to ever come across the genre, so he proves without a doubt on Hot Fuzz that he is one of the greatest directors of modern day.\nThe screenplay in Hot Fuzz is just brilliant. With a lot of legitimately realistic language at the base of the film, the serious nature of Hot Fuzz is not hard to see. But the humour in the film is incredibly more impressive. Tackling a police thriller concept, Hot Fuzz follows its story with tenacious dedication before making twists and turns which are unlike any other viewers will have ever had the pleasure of experiencing before. Only Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg would be able to plot such a ridiculous the story with the brilliance and detail to make it come off as being legitimate, and to add to it the dialogue in the film is of Academy Award calibre humour. While much of the language in the film is crude and uses swearing to instigate laughs, it is never excessive. It is moderated flawlessly over the course of the film to the point that it only comes in when laughs are a certainty. The script in Hot Fuzz is hilarious from start to finish, giving the film great characters and dialogue to match with the absurd nature of the story which flawlessly lines up with the cast. I cannot fully describe just how perfect the screenplay is, how versatile the use of crude language is and how it sets up plenty of humourous moments built strictly on the basis of the visual imagery in Hot Fuzz. But the highlight of the screenplay comes into play towards the end of the film during its action climax. With essentially every enemy that is taken down, Simon Pegg or Nick Frost deliver a hilarious one-liner iconic of action films from the 1980's. The nostalgia in this almost made me cry for joy and piss my pants with laughter at the same time, and every time I watch Hot Fuzz it just manages to get funnier. In my opinion, the best one-liner comes into play when Nicholas \"Nick\" Angel and Danny Butterman disable Dr. Robin Hatcher, only for Nicholas Angel to say \"You're a doctor! Deal with it\" which Danny Butterman follows up with \"Yeah mother*cker\". It is just brilliant.\nWhen it comes to being an action film, the choreography is the kind that modern filmmaking has forgotten about. Against the backdrop of a tense and atmospheric musical score, Hot Fuzz unfolds all kinds of impressive action scenes which use blood and gore in a cleverly satirical manner. But the action itself is strong mainly because of the creative chorography and clever stunts performed, as well as a collection of hilariously different ways the heroes of the story disable the enemies. Hot Fuzz makes use of car chases, debris and police officers jumping through the air and shooting two guns at once as a source of the versatility in the action, and there is never a moment when it doesn't pay off. And for potentially the first time in action film history, nearly none of the enemies are killed. In a more realistic path, the antagonists in Hot Fuzz are mostly just given severe wounds which disable them before they are arrested and the police officers have to incur the abundance of paperwork that comes with the arrests. Hot Fuzz just keeps on dolling out the humour.\nAnd the cast of Hot Fuzz are an absolutely flawless collection of cast members.\nSimon Pegg is beyond belief in Hot Fuzz. I say this because of how seriously he takes the role alongside how much he succeeds at making viewers laugh. In terms of tackling the role of Nicholas \"Nick\" Angel, Simon Pegg absolutely spearheads the role by going for it with a flawless sense of aggression. He balances his heroic anger with a sense of professionalism so the role he plays is essentially the ideal police officer archetype, and he cleverly uses that to deliver every one liner he has in the film with rich tension in the character. He plays both a legitimate action hero and a parody of one, spearheading the comedy and drama in Hot Fuzz with flawless effort. And when the action scenes weigh down on him, Simon Pegg is able to capture the energy for the part with expertise. He performs his stunts very well and grips his weapons with incredible confidence. Simon Pegg gets himselfin on the stunts very well in Hot Fuzz, and his blend of legitimate character focus and comedy is like a mix of Leslie Nielsen and Chuck Norris. Simon Pegg gives a career-best performance in Hot Fuzz, and his chemistry with the surrounding cast is flawless.\nNick Frost is the funniest aspect of the film though. Serving as the central source of comic relief in the story, Nick Frost fits the role of his archetype very easily. With a heavyset frame and a British accent, he fits the profile easily on the surface. But more impressively, he actually manages to do a lot with the role. Of course, the highlight of his role in the film comes from the fact that he really plays Danny Butterman as a buffoon paired up with a genius, proudly using the idiocy of the role to act like an idiot in all kinds of situations. As the story goes on and the chemistry between him and Simon Pegg develops, Hot Fuzz gets more touching because the bond they share is touching without being overly melodramatic or sentimental. He develops the character really well and takes the drama of the story on very well while never stepping out of the buffoonish nature of his character. He is likable, he is ridiculously funny and as the film would later go on to prove, he is effective as an action hero. Nick Frost once again makes a hilarious duo with Simon Pegg, giving Hot Fuzz the perfect leading duo.\nTimothy Dalton also delivers a memorable effort. In one of his finest performances in years, Timothy Dalton makes a really suspicious character out of Simon Skinner. He has a really shifty smile to him and a tone of voice which is sophisticated but suspect, giving him a good edge for the role. Jim Broadbent also takes a nice turn in Hot Fuzz. He manages to make himself a likable character for much of the film only to turn it all around.\nTony Fisher and Rafe Spall make a funny duo, Olivia Colman has some good moments and Karl Johnson's few scenes in the film are subtle but really funny.\nThe cameos of Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Stephen Merchant, Bill Nighy, Bill Bailey, Peter Jackson and Cate Blanchett are also a nice touch.\n\nSo thanks to a perfect pair of leading performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost coupled with an incredibly original screenplay and expert direction from Edgar Wright, Hot Fuzz is a perfect combination of action and comedy which is one of the funniest films ever made.",

The film knows how absurd it is which is what makes it such a fun film to watch. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost remain a great duo on screen together and it's a lot of fun watching the two interact with one another with their differing personalities, another feature of the buddy cop films that this satires. The film lacks some of the effect that Shaun of the Dead had and feels less like a character piece than that film which is why I consider it to be slightly weaker as a film.

Soon after his arrival, a series of mysterious deaths get the sergeant curious, and with little help available from his apathetic colleagues, save for his eager action movie fanatic partner, PC* Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Officer Angel starts his own investigation, and uncovers a deadly plot!\n\nFollowing Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz**, the second film in the 'Cornetto trilogy', is a great parody of the buddy cop genre. Death and mayhem with a quaint English country village as the bloody backdrop, and the results are hysterical. But after watching this movie twice, I still find I'm in two minds about the slow first and second acts. On the one hand the long buildup, and having Simon Pegg play the straight guy for so long, does make the film drag a bit. On the other hand, I'm not sure the last twenty minutes of this movie would be as entertaining, if we weren't so ready for Pegg to finally cut loose and bring the noise.\n\nThat's not to say the first ninety minutes of Hot Fuzz are completely worthless however. Nick Frost is great as Angel's partner in crime-fighting, and I loved Timothy Dalton in this film as the homage to the classic English villain we often see in Hollywood films. Some of the supporting characters, like the two village detectives played by Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall were a miss for me, but I did enjoy every incomprehensible sound that came out of Karl Johnson's mouth as PC Bob Walker. Especially on the few occasions you could actually understand him, and he translates PC Doris Thatcher's (Olivia Colman) latest sexual innuendo.\n\n* Police Constable\n\n** Fuzz - synonym for, police.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThe only connection between this film and Shaun of the Dead, other than the director, actors, writers, and probably most of the crew, is the ice-cream treat known as the Cornetto! Story wise, these are completely different, but if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, you'll likely find this entertaining. The movie earns its R rating through some pretty graphic bits if violence.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe little village of Stanford looks very nice, but this film can be enjoyed on any device you care to watch it on. However, the action would have more impact on a larger screen.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nThe last twenty minutes of this film are amazing, starting with Simon Peg riding his horse into the village center, armed to the teeth!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/hot-fuzz-2007/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Most of the good jokes hit less like Michael Jordan and more like Lebron James. In fact, that's what this movie is like. Lebron James. Overrated and only putting enough effort in to give the illusion of quality. The intro's incredible, and I love Simon Pegg's character. This is where my praise for the movie ends. Everybody else is obnoxious, grotesque, annoying, conventional, cliche, stale, among other things. But wait, you tell me it's supposed to be bad? It's predecessor, Shaun of the Dead, was great because all of it's seeming faults were either reflective of zombie movies or British 21st century culture - two things it was obviously spoofing. Is this reflective of cop movies or British culture? No. It'll make you think so with how they watch Point Break and Bad Boyz II, throw in some Eastwood and Norris movies. That'd be like if in Shaun of the Dead, there were no zombie oriented jokes, but they watched White Zombie, Re-Animator, and a bunch of George Romero and Lucio Fulci movies. Instead of resembling bad action movies, it resembles other bad comedies. Like a British (and by default a tad bit smarter) version of Let's Be Cops or 21 Jump Street.  The sad thing is that there are good jokes here, like I said before. And a lot of the funny stuff in the end is ruined by how bad it is. Or is it? I seem to be in the minority, so either you guys are better people than I and accepted the diamonds in the ruff, or you liked the cheap and unclever fan-service that is the nerdy equivalent of a panty shot.

As a result he is shunted off to a small village in hopes that he will find much less crime and therefore relax a little more. But when you're as devoted and determined as Nick Angel you can find lawbreakers anywhere. Hot Fuzz seems to dial back the parody feel that was captured in Shaun of the Dead. There is slightly less humor and more of a straight homage to classic buddy cop films. Many of the laughs the movie provides come simply from recreating things exactly as they would occur in a film like Bad Boys 2 and then letting the viewer realize \"Oh yeah, that is pretty ridiculous.\" One of the more audacious choices they made is to actually reference some of the films they would later imitate in this movie. It's like having a bibliography right in the middle of a book to tell you, \"That reference we're going to make in chapter 10, it came from Moby Dick.\" But it seems to work because a passion for these older action films is one of the key character traits of Danny Butterman (Angel's partner,) and is the catalyst for the characters' actions in the climax. The story here is just great. I love the entire setup, which feels like it has been drawn straight from a Die Hard movie or something, and then when the things shift to Sandford it is fun to watch the fish-out-of-water adjustment that the protagonist goes through.\n\nI think they really nailed the popular tropes of most action films. You can tell that everyone involved in the production of Hot Fuzz is passionate about the genre because they don't miss a beat. If the hero hides behind any object in the movie, you better believe it's going to be bulletproof. If someone agrees to meet at a later time to share information, there is no doubt they will die before the meeting time arrives. It's that kind of devotion to the genre that not only provides a familiar feel to this movie but, as I mentioned, it boosts the comedy tremendously. It certainly helps that I am emotionally connected to the American-style action film (they are some of my favorite movies.) As a result, I found myself totally engaged and involved in the murder mystery and the shootout action sequences. That's what Hot Fuzz absolutely nails. It manages to carry a quality story on top of all the laughs. Finally, before I close I have to note how much I love all the acting performances. Everyone is great, in particular Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent who I kept wishing would get more and more scenes. In summary, I think Hot Fuzz is a funny comedy that surprisingly is able to pull off a good mystery at the same time, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

I ended up watching the film, despite the strongly positive reviews, I was surprised that somehow this one did not really work for me. Sure, I had a few laughs at the beginning of the film, but after watching it entirely, I just think this one was a bit overrated. The cast is wonderful, and there were some really interesting characters. I'm glad to have witnessed a great comeback from Timothy Dalton, who plays one of the villains. But overall, the story seemed oddly familiar. Maybe I was able to recall watching its trailer a few years back, and it was one of those trailers that give the mistake of revealing a little too much of what the film is all about. I suggest you watch the film first if you're not familiar with it or its trailer. That could possibly give you the alternative experience I could have had if the producers hired better editors.",

A movie that manages to pointlessly reference everything from Straw Dogs to Goodfellas to Sergio Leone westerns to Life Is Sweet (?!). Movies like this really wear on me because (1) I hate having to feel like a grumpy curmudgeon for sitting through a lauded comedy without laughing once, and (2) I hate to see legitimate potential wasted. A great cast is underutilized, and any potential the concept had was squandered by the black hole that is Edgar Wright. I still stand in the minority on this matter, but flat direction compensated for by flashy (but usually inept) editing does not elevate material to comedic gold. Most of this film's pacing is so woefully disjointed and awkward that it makes me want to get behind an AVID system so bad just to fix it.\n\nWatch Jackie Chan's marvelously thrilling and funny Police Story instead. Heck, even the unintentional parody of The Wicker Man (this being the Nic Cage fronted remake) brings more laughs to the table.\n\nSorry, folks.",

It is presented as what it is satirizing, but rather than incorporating meticulous twists on the genre, the movie just builds a comedic premise around the presentation. Pegg is a top police officer, not policeman, from London who is forced to change his location to the countryside of England. There, with the assistance of the not-so-graceful Nick Frost, he uncovers a conspiracy to explain the many murders, or accidents as the chief inspector (Jim Broadbent) insists on labeling them. The climax is a village-wide shooting spree, and it excited and amused me at once. There is not much else to Hot Fuzz, which disappoints me only a little bit. I may have wanted a real resolution to Pegg's problems with his ex-wife, but I can also see how his ongoing love for his job resolved the problems in their own way. If you liked Shaun of the Dead and are not strictly a horror movie buff, I believe Hot Fuzz will entertian you.",

Simon Pegg (with his trademark quirkiness), has that rare talent and the imagination, to turn any mundane situation into something ridiculously extraordinary. I also love the fact that, like director Kevin Smith, he likes working/casting the same pool of actors in his films, namely Bill Nighy, who only had a bit part in the film but is always a treat watching that his appearance alone made this movie worth watching. Aside from Pegg usual cast of misfits, like always hilarious Nick Frost and ubber talented Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent (whom I adore from Bridgette Jones and the Harry Potter series) was an inspired choice. He's an understated character actor but has such a wonderful presence that he can only make a movie better because he's just that brilliant.

How to do it, well having the exact same creative team was a good way to do it. Hot Fuzz is definitely my favorite movie of the cornetto trilogy. One of the things I love about this movie is how clever it is. Shaun of the Dead was fairly clever but this movie is downright genius. There are so many things in this movie that you won't notice the first or the second time you watch it, it's so brilliant. This film has an amazing British ensemble cast. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine, Ralph Spall, Olivia Coleman, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and many many more. This film also has some fantastic humour, it's pretty much non stop laughs. I also love how we actually see that whenever they make an arrest we see them all doing a lot of paper work which is what actually happens. Simon Pegg is great as Nicholas Angel, he's a little bit hard to relate to but he's a great character. However Nick Frost as Danny is fantastic, he's really funny and like able he also has a lot of conflict and a sad backstory. Just about everything in this movie works, the pacing is phenomenal, the music and sound editing is flawless it just all works. I also love the character played by Rory McCann or the Hound from Game of Thrones. The final half an hour is one fantastic end action sequence. I love how we get plenty of violent injuries but no actual deaths. It's a great mix of Nicolas type of good cop who tries not to kill and follows the rules and Danny who wants to fire guns while jumping through the air and get in car chases and fire loads of guns. This is nearly a perfect film, it's one of the best comedies ever and it's really rewatchable. A+",

There's absolutely nothing bad to say about it. In additional roles we see Jim Broadband (Cloud Atlas) and Timothy Dalton (James Bond). Get ready to have your ass busted... \n\n London police officer Nicolas Angel (Pegg) is very dedicated to his work. Too dedicated, because he makes his colleagues look bad. Against his will he gets transferred to the small town of Sandford, a place where nothing much goes on. At the local police station he meets the na√Øve Danny Butterman (Frost), who 's going to be his new partner and is the son of police inspector Frank Butterman (Broadband). When a series of suspicious and deadly accidents happen in Sandford, Angel believes that there is a killer at work. His crime suspect is the local supermarket owner Simon Skinner (Dalton).

Hot Fuzz takes on the buddy cop genre as they easily make fun of how insane the genre has been getting. We get a super cop being transported into a small quiet town where nothing, but \"accidents\" occur. The beginning of film takes jabs at the perfect cop character or the badass action hero as Simon Pegg plays as an officer is always ready to fight for the law. Being transported into a little quiet town doesn't go that well for the officer has his strictness does not fit along with the town's happy attitude. There is murder afoot though, but everyone is assuming they're just accidents since there hasn't been a recorded murder for two decades. The plot of this movie is surprisingly great and usually parodies just keep things simple. Hot Fuzz can catch a viewer completely off guard as there is a lot of intentional foreshadowing, but also some that cannot be caught. Along with that style of foreshadowing there is a great build up of humor with nice running gags and great follow ups. I have watched this movie around five times and I am never bored with it, the humor is strong and this film still has my all time favorite climatic battle. Hot Fuzz overall is a strong build up film and when everything starts to hit and connect the real humor can begin. It is easily the best example of dark humor I have seen in a film since I usually don't laugh when murder happens.",

I especially liked the mystery side of the plot, although the end result was a little bit of a letdown. Regardless, the movie made me laugh more than anything else in the past couple months, and I can see myself revisiting this in the future, so Hot Fuzz is most definitely another worthy entry in Edgar Wright's Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy.",

Edgar Wright really knows how to direct action scenes that is in your face and hardcore. Simon Pegg is a total badass in this and never breaks character. The story takes a while to get going since it takes the time to set up all the town's characters. Pegg's character spends most of the film playing detective, which is fine, only if it wasn't a spoof of action films. It isn't until the crazy final act that we get our money's worth. Once again, the script is witty and clever with a great supporting cast of British actors. Any fan of buddy cop films would appreciate this.\n\nGrade: B+",

            "content": "I already watched Hot Fuzz in a cinema but never had a chance to write the review. Now I had another chance to see this 2007 British action comedy directed by Edgar Wright, who had co-written this screenplay with the star Simon Pegg who is perfectly matched by Nick Frost. Story is pretty simple following two police officers attempting to solve a series of mysterious deaths in a small English village - but slowly develops in an amazing medley of over a hundred action films which were used as inspiration for developing the action in the script! Filming took place over eleven weeks in early 2006, and the total international box office gross reached $80,573,774 before its home media release. The film is the second in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy and was preceded by 2004's Shaun of the Dead and followed by 2013's The World's End; each of them featuring a different flavour of Cornetto ice cream. I love all three of them!\r\n\r\n[img]http://ultimatereviews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hot-Fuzz-2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nEdgar Wright is again showing us how surprisingly capable he is - I could not stop for  minute watching Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), an extremely dedicated police officer of the London Metropolitan Police Service, performing his duties so well that he is accused of making his colleagues look bad. The result is that his superiors transfer him to \"crime-free\" Sandford, a town in rural Gloucestershire. Angel is informed by the Inspector of the Sandford Police Service over the phone that his cottage is not ready yet and that he has to rent a hotel room until such time as it is. While at the local pub, Angel immediately arrests a large group of under-age drinkers, and a drunk driver who turns out to be his partner, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the son of local police inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny, well-meaning but naive, is in awe of his new partner. Angel struggles to adjust to the slow, uneventful pace of the village... which is not what appears to be!\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/images/2007/01/26/3_440x330.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWright stated that he wanted to write and direct a cop film because \"there isn't really any tradition of cop films in the UK... We felt that every other country in the world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none.\" And they did it: Wright and Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script, and I have to admit that this was one of my favourite cop action comedies of all times! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, after almost a decade working together, were comfortable and terrific company for two hours. After mocking horror movies with Shaun of the Dead the director didn't miss the target aiming at over-the-top action movies. If you haven't seen it - please, do it NOW!",

At the midpoint we are treated to an actual Whodunnit style storyline, with faster paced action scenes, and a stream of amusing one liners and stupidity. I could even compare it to a spoof midsomer murders what with all the activity taking place within the small arena of a local village. Like this classic series, there is plenty of variety within the characters personalities and this is explored the longer the film goes on, and topped off with some visually rib tickling scenes of gore.  With a whole host of familiar faces, there is a typically british feel about this movie which contributes well towards the jokes. Thankfully it is never at risk of becoming completely Americanised and turning into a poor annoying cheese fest! There is a limit to how long this type of childish and immature concept can continue to entertain, and I would have thought it would now have just about reached its peak. Despite the fact that this did pick up somewhat, the opening scenes, plus the majority of the first film (Shaun of the Dead) remained a bog standard average. I can't say I'm rushing to see the next instalment of Pegg and Frost which recently hit our cinemas a couple of months ago, as I Imagine that once you've seen one, you've basically seen them all, with this episode likely to be the best of a mediocre bunch.",

            "content": "I'll start out by saying I bought this in a combo pack with Shaun of the Dead without having seen it so this is a first viewing review. After watching this movie I have come to a definitive conclusion: Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are absolute comedic geniuses. I don't include Nick Frost in this because he wasn't one of the writers, but he is hysterical as well. Most comedies today are full of just really low brow humor; I'm not saying that can't be funny but sometimes I get dick joke fatigue. What I love about Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and hopefully the upcoming The World's End is that they don't need all the raunch to be funny they're just super clever. Now let me move on to Hot Fuzz specifically. At first glance one might think this film is simply a typical buddy cop movie, but it is far from typical. The plot follows Nicholas Angel, an over enthusiastic cop who is transferred to a seemingly sleepy town where everything is not as idyllic as it seems. Through this typical action movie plot the script takes every action movie trope and turns it on its head, needless to say hilarity ensues. As with Shaun of the Dead before it this film has struck gold with the comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Their chemistry is possibly the best out there and you can see the two truly enjoy working with each other. The jokes between the two pop off one another extremely well and they fit their character archetypes to a T. Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton are also excellent additions to the supporting cast along with countless others. Another thing I absolutely love about this movie is the editing. The cuts are super quick which keeps the pace up. This is used particularly well with the inclusion of all the paperwork that is usually glossed over in movies and TV, the cuts keep you interesting while still acknowledging that this is a real part of the job. However one of the most impressive feats of editing is the scene where Nick and Danny are sharing a beer and it is intercut with a scene of a crime being committed. I won't go into details but the graphic matches and editing in general are just amazing. I am truly pleased that I bought this movie and watching it makes me even more excited for The World's End.",

Taking the stereotyped buddy cop movie, it not only satirizes it but also rises above that as its own form of comedy. Providing a legitimate story of a highly efficient, yet social withdrawn, city cop who is plunged into a supposedly sleepy village, this film follows how he struggles with whether or not the high accident rate of the village is just that or due to secret crime. The Comedy centers around how he has to deal with a sleepy police team, mundane civil duties, and the quantities of small town life. Also, the comedy itself is witty and does not rely on simple slapstick jokes to sustain it. Importantly, the comedy is built around the story, rather than the story facilitating jokes that had been thought up without context. The story, while it is being presented bit-by-bit and viewed as a whole from the end is well thought out and fulfilling.  The characters in this film, unlike many other shallow comedies being put out today, have their own personalities and motives, some of which presenting the audience with moments that rise above the comedy just enough to not kill the comedic tone yet still elicit concern and other emotions from the audience. Finally, the film's action packed finale will please without fail. I cannot find a single issue with this film and it is not lacking in any way. I find that its only limitation from greatness on the stage of film history is that its scope is kept small and due to being a comedy does not possess the serious issues or drama that other films can field. Overall, I give this film a 10/10 in the comedy genre and a 9/10 amongst films across all genres.",

Especially if you're one of those who think that people who are into movies in the way that I am only like serious ones. \n\nIt's part of a common misconception - that comedy is lower than drama, that pain is harder to portray than it is to make the audience laugh; so serious drama is the superior form. It's nonsense, not least from the perspective of the performer. From the very little acting I've enjoyed doing myself, it's the comedy that's most stretched me and been much harder work. You pretty much know in rehearsal that if a drama or tragedy is going to work; a comedy you only really know about once you get the finished work in front of a live audience who've paid to be there. Real comedy is hard work; performers sweat blood over making people laugh, often at immense emotional cost to themselves. Really good comedy that's just plain funny, or is both funny and about something is one of the hardest artistic disciplines you could fine. \n\nThat's especially the case, I think, when it comes to the kind of comedy which is using something familiar but 'serious' and turn it into comedy. The worst versions of these often make serious money but are scarce remembered. Take for example, the Scary Movie series or pretty much any of the Police Academy movies after the first one (or maybe two). Poking fun at something familiar, using the format of the target for laughs ... you may even have laughed when you first saw it. Especially if you saw it in a group at home or in a crowded cinema - people are statistically much more likely to laugh if surrounded by others. Even if you did laugh the first time ... can you remember any of the jokes more than a week later? Have you every felt a desire to revisit these? Do you know anyone who actually owns these films or loves them? Exactly. \nThe key is love. If you don't love the object of your comedy, then you're just being a bit cruel. Cruelty can be funny, of course; but if you don't love the genre you're laughing at, then you don't understand what makes it appealing to people, and if you don't understand that then you won't get soul-deep laughter. \n\nWhich brings me to Shaun Of The Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007), prime examples of movies which love the object of their laughs and which still, on repeated viewings by myself make me ache and cry with laughter. Both are British films, written and directed by the same people, starring many of the same actors. Both films mainly feature actors successful in some of the more left-field British television comedies of the last few years. Shaun Of The Dead takes the format of a zombie movie, twins it with a romantic comedy, sets it all somewhere in England. Hot Fuzz goes for action movies and British television detective shows (with a little hint at few horror films thrown in) for a story of murder and fear in market town England.  The third in this 'three flavours cornetto' trilogy arrives on these shores at the end of the year so these two must keep me going for now.\nIn both these formats there's much to make fun of and laugh at. It would be easy - and lazy - to go for cheap and quick laughs of the Scary Movie type. No such get out here; instead it's clear that Edgar Wright (director, co-writer), Simon Pegg (co-writer, star) and Nick Frost (star) love the originals they're laughing at. It's in the perfectly played flat-mate interactions or the scene with the records or the way the rolling news coverage is used in Shaun. It's only when I stopped seeing Hot Fuzz in the light of Shaun that it made the jump from liking it very much to loving it in my estimation; the love there is in the swift cutting from scene to scene, the supermarket shoot-out, the re-contexualised repeated gags from Shaun. \nCircumstances conspired against me seeing Shaun in the cinema, so I finally saw it for the first time in the worst possible circumstances: on a plane, in the middle of the night. I couldn't laugh out loud of course, for fear of waking up the others. Which only made it harder not to laugh. By the time the fight in the pub with that Queen song playing on the juke-box I was crying with laughter, doubled over in the kind of ecstatic pain only good comedy can provide. At that stage I had a nodding acquaintance with zombie films, not enough to really get the genre. Which made it no less funny. Now I'm more of a fan of this type of film, there's even more to enjoy. I've since seen it 7 or 8 times, and each time I get new pleasures from it. \n\nHot Fuzz I recently re-watched for the about the tenth time. Again I ached the morning after. In the case of both films there's a warmth to them, even when they're violent (Hot Fuzz) or also a little frightening (Shaun). Both have a story to tell and tell them well; both have characters you warm to and want to spend time with; both have good hearts beating at the centre of them. Both take a little bit of the viewer and reflect it back at you, asking you to see yourself as just as funny as the people you're laughing at. You laugh at characters whom you see yourself in, who show you something of who you are in the sight of others. \n\nIf a film moves us, then it's affected our emotions. Joy is an emotion, laughing a symptom of emotional life. So comedy belongs here; and in these two films that it's better demonstrated than almost anywhere else.",

Parodying blow 'em up action films, \"Hot Fuzz\" relies once again on Simon Pegg and Nick Frost to deliver hilarious scene after hilarious scene and eventually falls into its very own action sequences, but for the most part, with a lot of British humor lost on me, I question the ability of this film to stand on its own, without Wright's original success. With much more of an ensemble cast and a mystery-slasher film plot structure, the film is by and by entertaining throughout but does not quite hold the same comedic pacing as \"Shaun of the Dead\". Had the dialogue spread out and not been so repetitive and had Pegg's character been a bit more dynamic, the film would not feel as flat and would have reached a much wider audience. Carrying many of the same basic ideas that Wright originally introduced and continuing his comedic editing, \"Hot Fuzz\" will still land as a success in my book, but will leave the door wide open for Wright to produce something even better.",

What makes Hot Fuzz a great film is that not only is the film an awesome comedy its also great because the film spoofs so many other cop films, I also love how though the film is a comedy it gets to the point were it becomes an action film. Although Hot Fuzz is almost a perfect film the film is very violent and though half of the violence in the film is comedic its still very graphic and may not be for everyone. However Hot Fuzz is by far one of the funniest action comedies ever, and if you are a fan of British cinema especially films such as Shaun of the Dead, The Worlds End, and Kingsman: The Secret Service than I totally suggest you watch this film as soon as possible because I promise you won't be disappointed.",

While there, he stumbles on a conspiracy and sets out to stop it by any means necessary. One thing this movie definitely had going in its favor was that I enjoy action movies a lot more than horror movies. That's not to say I disliked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but I like the action genre more. Like its predecessor, HOT FUZZ deals with genre cliches in a fun way while never exclusively relying on them to mine laughs. There was also a lot of references to other action movies that I thought were hilarious. And speaking of humor, I felt that this film was a significant improvement in terms of comedic writing from SHAUN OF THE DEAD. There was the more subtle British humor, which I am warming up to, and the more up-front genre-derived humor. Both work extremely well, and all of the actors deliver it perfectly. The only quibble I have with this film, though, is that it's about 10-15 minutes too long. This is mostly due to the ending, which feels like it could have ended at a couple spots, but then kept on going. What was there was funny enough, but in my opinion it could have been shortened a bit. Overall, HOT FUZZ is an improvement over SHAUN OF THE DEAD and delivers a hilarious action movie parody that genre fans will enjoy.",

            "content": "Most people enjoy buddy cop films but a buddy cop film with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright at the helm; we get the best buddy cop film ever made. Sargent Nicholas Angel is forced to move out to the country where he has been promoted to Sargent of a village. He is not too thrilled but he soon finds himself engulfed in a murder case that the town is doing their best to ignore. The deep story is backed up by many laughs and moments this trio puts on the big screen so well.\n\tThis movie plays the stereotypical buddy cop movie down to the last detail. Angel is the tough cop who is incredible at his job who is forced to pair up with an almost useless Nick Frost. These two bring their chemistry from Shaun of the Dead and bring it into this movie. Nick Frost is not as funny as he was in his previous role but he does a much better job. He is a much improved actor and shows great range in this role. Pegg on the other hand is funnier than ever. At first I hated Angel as a character, as I think I was supposed to, but he grew on me and Pegg nails it. \n\tHot Fuzz ties absolutely everything together even better than Shaun of the Dead did. Things people say one time come back and play into the mystery. The first time you watch it you want to know who the killer is and solve the mystery. Great, but the second and third time you go back and pay attention to all the details. The details are revealed to the audience at the climax but going back and watching it again it is very satisfying. \n\tThe writing is better than ever in Hot Fuzz. This movie had the laughs but the strongest aspect was the story. For a while the story wasn't really going anywhere but introducing all the characters and getting to know the village. That all changes with the shot of the guy in the black robe, face hidden, and holding an axe. I remember the first time I saw that, my jaw dropped. That was the moment the movie got real and it wasn't like Shaun of the Dead at all. The twists and turns this story take is awesome. The reveal of the murders is so satisfying. I won't spoil but Angel comes up with this whole conspiracy as to why the people got murdered but he was wrong. When the real reason is revealed it was a \"Wait, really? That's so dumb but awesome\" moment. Its brilliant but at the same time it's a little lame. For the type of movie it is I love it but I can see people being annoyed by it. \n\tThe gore behind the murders is terrific. The axe and the staged car accident was creative. The explosion was awesome, the shears was disturbing, but nothing was better than the church scene. Hands down, the coolest death I have ever seen. There could have been one at the end involving the model of the church, but he didn't die, which made it ten times better. Let's just say the scene is suspenseful and it got a bit messy. I went back and watched how he died in slow motion and I don't regret it a bit. \n\tThere are some jokes in this movie that are hit or miss. Aaron A. Aaronson is a subtle laugh. When Andrew has the foam mustache on his real one brings out a smile every time. The laughs were not as consistent but it wasn't needed. The backbone of the movie is the story, not the comedy. In my Shaun of the Dead review I said that Shaun if the Dead was straight up better. I still stand by that statement but Hot Fuzz had the better stories, better characters, and it got close to better gore. Shaun of the Dead had a special impact on me that left a better taste in my mouth than Hot Fuzz did, but it really isn't right to compare movies it's just a popular topic. \n\tIf I had to choose some flaws I will have to call shenanigans on a lot in this movie. This is a segment I will call Reality Check. First of all, I'm pretty sure Angel could have denied the promotion if he really wanted to. I understand it is England and it may be different but the guy should have rights and be able to turn down a promotion if he wanted to. Secondly, after Angel discovers the truth behind the town I was thinking to myself that it wasn't possible. I can't say why without spoiling the entire movie but I can say that somebody would have to notice if people randomly disappeared. Before the murders Angel and Danny walk right by the guy in the black robe. The first time he is in an alley so I figured it was possible. The second time he was standing in front of a white garage door, under a light. Come on, I know Angel and Danny were drunk but they walked right by them. At the church there was no possible way for the murderer to escape due to the fact that he didn't have enough time. Finally, I think the lady would have noticed a guy in black trying to kill her. She takes it like a champ before he bleeds out. It's frustrating.\n\tOverall, Hot Fuzz is a good time. I can watch this movie anytime anywhere and it has everything I loved from Shaun of the Dead. The cinematography was very much the same along with the humor. The ending was an action packed shootout I always wanted. Hot Fuzz is awesome and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval even with the parts I don't find possible.",

What makes the 'Cornetto Trilogy' so excellent is that each film feels unique in both the acting & filmmaking, while still retaining a distinct charm.  Simon Pegg shows his chops as Sgt. Nicolas Angel, completely believable as an action star while also pulling superb double-duty with writing with director Edgar Wright.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, particularly veteran's like Broadbent & Dalton, who have the time of their lives in this movie.  Wright's direction is equally superb, making fun of action movies in the first hour before delivering one of the finest & most hilarious action sequences in the last hour.   A must for action fans and still my personal favorite of Wright's films.",

        {
            "content": "Hot Fuzz may just be the best comedy film of the 2000's. Not only is it gut-bustingly funny, but it manages to tell a great story, and flesh out it's characters to be more than the stereotypes we often get in comedy today. Films like Tropic Thunder and Superbad are among my favourite comedies of the last decade, but the relentlessly paced gags, and exceptionally well thought-out storyline pushes Hot Fuzz just ahead of those, and into the territory of my favourite comedy of all time: Airplane. The film has literally anything one could ask for in a comedy: Great writing (Pegg and Wright are a formidable duo)? Check. Fantastic acting (Pegg and Frost play off each other with aplomb)? Check. More superb direction (Co-Writer Wright has all sorts of fun behind the camera)? Check. Without a doubt, Hot Fuzz raises the bar for not just British comedy, but comedy of any form, on the small screen or big, British, American (Or even Irish), whatever nationality you pick. Hot Fuzz is more than worthy of taking it's place right alongside the greatest comedies of all time.\n\nConstable Nicholas Angel (The impeccable Pegg) is the absolute gold standard of the London Police Force (Well, official vocab guidelines state that Force is too aggressive), and we learn in a humorously over-the-top opening montage that his arrest rate is 400% above the average of his peers, and that he excelled in every facet of police-work, both physical and mental. He has received four injuries in his career, the last one being at the hands of a man dressed as Father Christmas (An unnoticeable cameo by, of all people, Peter Jackson). This is something that should be held up as a shining example of how incorruptible spirit is the backbone of British peacekeeping. Not so, according to his superiors. In a bit of gleeful madness, Nicholas is told that his C.V. makes the other officers a little uncomfortable, and head office feels it would be best if he were to relocate in the sleepy rural village of Sandford. All this is communicated to him through three hilarious guest appearances (I couldn't spoil it for you).\n\nAgainst his wishes, and believing that he has so much more to give, Nicholas packs up, and informs his girlfriend (Another surprising cameo) that he must leave. In a bit of (perhaps clunky) exposition, she informs his that she knows this is the end of their relationship, and that he will never be truly able to settle down until he finds someone that he cares about more than his job. While it may be clunky exposition, upon a rewatch, I realised that it also doubles as some hilarious foreshadowing. Nicholas ups sticks, now with no burdens in London, and transfers to Sandford. He learns that the adjustment will be uncomfortable, as all around him, he sees crime running rampant (Though, perhaps not on the level an ordinary citizen would see it). Nicholas is unable to comfortably make the transition to small-town cop, much to the amusement of those around him: His superior, Inspector Frank Butterman (The great Jim Broadbent), wisecracking female PC Doris Thatcher (Olivia Colman, now a highly-regarded dramatic actress), and two police equivalents of playground bullies (The ineffable Rafe Spall and Paddy Considine). The only person who Nicholas can see even remotely eye-to-eye with is his bumbling partner Danny (The ever-hilarious Nick Frost), and Danny only has a job because Frank is his father. Just as Nicholas seems fit to give up, however, the just over-the-top-enough-to-be-menacing  Simon Skinner (The astoundingly funny Timothy Dalton), and his nefarious musings reaffirm Nicholas' suspicions that not is all as it seems in Sandford.\n\nWow, if you though Shaun of The Dead was good, you ain't seen nothing yet. Hot Fuzz fires on all cylinders, simply refusing to let up. The jokes come thick and fast (Though never so much that we lose sight of the characters and what makes them important to the extremely well-realised plot. Once again, Wright and Pegg (With co-conspirator Frost) have crafted a brilliant comedy, that blends a human touch, a parody of action stereotypes, and a loving homage to the same with little to no effort. It's astonishing really, that the trio could so effortlessly give us a fantastic, highly original plot, while stuffing it to the gills with references, both parody and homage, and never bloat the film, or descend into mean-spiritedness. And that's what truly great comedy should be. Whether it's an original tale, or a take off a genre, comedy should strive to be satiric, but never haughty, and that's exactly what Wright and co. have achieved.\n\nLet's start with the script, shall we? Hot Fuzz is a true original, with a plot that both recalls Bond in it's absurd amount of twists and false finishes, while simultaneously shaking off these inspirations, and coming into it's own as a brilliantly barmy tale of corruption, and friendship. The characters are all well-fleshed out (Well, the ones that need to/should be fleshed out are), and most resolve their stories in fitting, oft-hilarious ways. Nicholas' character development is extremely satisfying, as is his relationship with Danny, one that grows and matures as they learn to trust and rely on each other. The scenarios, villains, and plotting are brilliantly-conceived, proving how adept Pegg and Wright are at building their universe, and the characters therein organically. The dialogue (Often the most important trait in a comedy) is, much like Shaun of The Dead, comparable to Tarantino or P.T. Anderson in it's effortlessly natural flow, and easily human nature. The characters are at once real, and highly fictional, finding themselves in absurd situations, but always retaining that essential human quality.\n\nThen there's Wright, and his way with the camera. Edgar Wright has made a name for himself with his wonderful way of telling a story through subtle camerawork (In Shaun of The Dead, the camera thrust us into the action, making us like a slightly more in-the-know part of the story). Here, subtlety is thrown out the window, disregarded in favour of balls-to-the-walls insanity, worthy of Michael Bay himself. And that's precisely where the inspiration comes from: Wright is taking off the classically despised style of action film-making whereby directors use an overabundance of cuts, sickness-inducing mobility, and a highly-desaturated colour palette to convey the gravity of the action. The final shootout in the film (Which had me aching with laughter, I might add), is all of the above, but executed with such aplomb that one would never make the connection between Bay's ridiculous camera-angles, and Wright's inspired action choreography. If there's anything to be gleaned from Wright's action directing (He often let's the sloppy guard fall, unmasking himself as a pretty talented actioner), it's that 2015's Ant Man is in good hands.\n\nOf course, who could forget about the acting? Pegg and Frost deliver all the bromantic vibes we could ask for, never letting their easy chemistry fall in the rush of punchlines and payoffs. Both are such hugely-skilled comedians that there is never a moment where a joke falls flat, never a moment where one fails the other on-screen, and that is an enormous part of their appeal: The brilliance of their pairing lies in how perfectly comfortable they are in each other's company (And on front of Wright's camera). The supporting cast is similarly fantastic. Jim Broadbent proves why he is one of Britain's premiere actors, but surprisingly adds little to the comedic proceeding, in favour of the dramatic scenes (This will all be explained by the end, though). Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall steal all their scenes with ease, thanks to their surprising chemistry (It rivals that of Pegg and Frost, who spend much more of the film's running time on screen). Olivia Colman, though in a small role, has a number of memorable lines (Mostly the blunt, humorous innuendo). The real show-stealer though, is Dalton. His performance just oozes menace, and he might as well be wearing a top hat, and twirling his moustache. He radiates an aura of confident, villainous charm, making him a magnetic presence on the screen, and the script perfectly integrates his character into the proceedings. A brief appearance from David Threlfall (Shameless' Frank Gallagher, and all-round magnificent actor) is also note-worthy in it's hilarity.\n\nIf I were to criticise anything in Hot Fuzz, I suppose it would be the above-mentioned directorial work. While in my eyes it was a clever take-off of notoriously bad action choreography, to anyone else it may come off simply as Wright being unable to properly execute action correctly. The previously touched-upon colour palette and shaky camera-work could certainly be a turn-off for those unable to stick it (Or at least, appreciate the attempted parody). If I were to really take a stab at the film, i could accuse it of being a bit taped together, and surmise that the set-pieces, and moments do not flow together very well, giving the film a sense of shoddy construction. The defense of that, however, is simply the film's relentless comedy, (And satisfying pace), which allows one to overlook any inconsistencies (And trust me, Airplane had 'em), and rate Hot Fuzz a deserved five stars.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Hot Fuzz is: A comedy masterpiece, akin to Airplane, and The Naked Gun is it's nonstop hilarity, and Tropic Thunder or Walk Hard in it's clever references and callbacks. I feel it would do this film a disservice to rate it anything less than five stars, as Hot Fuzz may just be the finest, funniest, and perhaps defining comedy of the 2000's.\n\nFinal Grade: A+",

            "content": "\"Morning\".\n\nThat was awesome, not only the line, but the film itself. Hot Fuzz is the second Wright-Pegg collaboration, the second film in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy. And much like in Shaun of the Dead, the work presented is excellent, not only that, but one of the best comedies ever made in history. Actually, it won't be a surprise if some years later it enters in the National Film Registry list of culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films. Hot Fuzz is a great parody of the action films, taking every clich√© but in the correct way, and ultimately becomes a parody of itself, which in this case, is part of the joke. Genius!\n\nBeing a British comedy, it's not only smart, but also fast-paced, fun and with a lot of little details that you might miss, but that's more than a reason to come back and enjoy the film once more. There's a bunch of cameo appearances, like Peter Jackson and...Well, you figure out the rest. Also, the story completes itself by correctly and smartly connecting and re-connecting all of what it tells, leaving no loose ends practically, which, for a comedy, is a lot of effort. Some guy named Adam Sandler should take some notes for advice...\n\nIf there's something I didn't like was that the film had a perfect pace until that scene at the end where the whole station blows up because of the underwater-mine. What was that all about? It felt rushed and forced just to tie loose ends. I know I said that's what the film does, but here it was sporadic and all of the sudden, almost without rhyme or reason. While that affected, Hot Fuzz was still excellent work of comedy and action.\n\nEdgar Wright delivers an actually great comedy, one of the best I've seen for all times. It's a film that knows what it has to do and excels and exceeds on everything, resulting in a highly satisfactory film which I can comeback over and over again to enjoy it each time. The best of the Cornetto trilogy is here.",

The plot pulls you in with interesting characters and an intriguing mystery that is later joked at and comically simplified. It keeps the movie funny with there isn't much action, and funny even when there is a bit of action. \n\nActing/Script: Simon Pegg plays the straight-man, while Nick Frost is the bumbling fool, and they both go through a bit of dynamic character change to some hilarious ends. Everybody's lines are well delivered with great comedic timing and wonderful expressions. Even the cameo actors have great lines, with Martin Freeman mumbling some of his lines to lead Simon Pegg's character on. \n\nSound/SFX: A fitting soundtrack, with action movie-esque songs juxtaposed against more upbeat, cheery songs fitting to the village's rustic atheistic. As for the SFX, the sounds are fittingly explosive when they need to be, disgusting when they need to be, and simple when they need to be. Nothing standing out as being terrible. \n\nVisuals: The movie is shot in two different styles, that fit the style their trying to parody. The first type is the action movie style. With different camera filters, dramatic angles, and quick cutting. The second style is that of more of a comedic drama, which is used for the scenes that are supposed to be purely comedic or set up character. They're always used to extenuate the feel the movie is going for, never hamper it. Though, for the weak stomached, this movie does have a bit of gore.\n\nOverall: A brilliantly done parody, with a mix of  simple and intelligent humor. There are funnier movies, and there are movies with better action, but there are very few that have as good a blend of the two as this one. If you're looking for a good laugh, and a bit of action, I highly recommend Hot Fuzz.. 4.5/5",

My only major gripes are that some spoofs, while not out of place, feel like they were shoehorned in, and while funny, could have been left out. This leads to my other minor gripe, it does feel like it goes on a little too long (shaving off a few minutes would have kept the pacing at prime tightness). Despite those minor gripes, it's an extremely strong and well thought out movie that delivers great jokes that usually meld quite organically with the action it delivers.",

Pegg and Frost are hilarious in their roles and I swear at least once every other cast member had me laughing. The whole idea starts off as so innocent but what makes the film so brilliant is how absurd and the levels at which it escalates to leave you laughing for a long while. (Also watch out for the Peter Jackson as Santa cameo). One of the few films I can watch nearly every day and still be entertained thoroughly with because the jokes never seem to get old. A lot of people prefer Shaun of the Dead to Hot Fuzz but in my eyes the two are both similar and different and if The Worlds End is to be anything like this then the bloody ice cream trilogy may just become one of the greatest in history.",

Compared to \"Shaun of the Dead\" though, \"Hot Fuzz\" is an interesting oddity in that its a cop-action film virtually devoid of action-- instead, the most rapid-fire, action-style punctuations consist almost solely of Nicholas Angel processing paperwork (which is just one example of the hilarious genius on display). \n\nThe majority of the running time rather consists of a wonderfully crafted mystery (with some shockingly gory slasher elements as well), and as Wright has proven time and again, no line, no shot, no cut, no moment goes unnoticed or unconsidered, and it makes for another example in his canon of a movie that rewards repeat viewings like few do.\n\nOne of the reasons Wright's movies succeed where other parodies fail is due to the clear love and lack of cynicism for what is being parodied. This becomes a bit of a problem though, when the two clearest points of reference are \"Point Break\" and \"Bad Boys II\" because 1) neither of them is very good, and 2) in the latter's case, its one of the most despicable, morally offensive movies of the last several decades. Now, I'm not much of a zombie fan, but I can still admire a loving homage to a trailblazing genius like George Romeo, but I simply can't muster the same enthusiasm for Michael Bay. So when the film's final epic action sequence arrives and it deliberately recreates the ugly, jerky, jump-cutting music-video style of Tony Scott, it is tremendously satisfying on a script and character level, but in terms of pure filmmaking, its a bit of a dud.\n\nStill, \"Hot Fuzz\" is just too well put-together in every other way--from performances to editing to preposterously funny comedy-- to slouch it too much. This is another truly great film from Wright.",

            "content": "GENRE REVIEWS - FAVE ACTION/COMEDY FILM \n\n\"Have you ever fired your gun in the air and gone Ahh?\" asks Danny, an over weight, clumsy police officer. The man being asked the question is Constable Nicolas Angel; a former London police officer, now working in the tiny village-town of Sandford. He is immensely frustrated by this question, as his new partner thinks police work is meant to be like 'Lethal Weapon'. \n\n'Hot Fuzz' was more or less the follow up to 'Shaun of the Dead'; the very clever British comedy that took the zombie genre and flipped it upside down. Many zombie elements remained, but our hero in that story was a pathetic, loser of a man called Shaun, whose idea of a romantic evening was to take his girlfriend to the local pub - the Winchester. During the zombie plague he is joined by his mate Ed, an even more pathetic loser who Shaun is always standing up for. Needless to say, Shaun comes out triumphant and defeats the zombies. \n\nIn Hot Fuzz, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return, and both play police officers, worlds apart. After being transferred from the London Police for being too good at his job and making the rest of the force look bad, Angel (Pegg) has no say and ends up in the sleepy town of Sandford. He tries to make a go of it, but with nothing to police and a partner who just asks endless questions to satisfy his belief that Angel is an amazing police man, he quickly gets down in the dumps. \n\nHowever, this small town has a few dark secrets, and when a murderer shows up to pick off some of the towns citizens, and in violent fashion, Angel steps up and plays detective - as the towns two actual detectives couldn't give a rats arse. As Angel discovers the victims are linked in an intricate way, his suspicions take him to the heart of a mystery involving most of the town's citizens.  \n\nBritish humour really is in a league of its own, and Hot Fuzz pays respect to that while also adding some new elements to the formula. If you loved Shaun of the Dead you will want to see Hot Fuzz (if you haven't already). It was a great progression from the zombie outing to this tale, which will please fans of the team behind Shaun. \n\nThere are many great characters on display here. The actor's chosen to play them were the perfect choices; each of them embodies their characters, including all their unusual quirks and flaws, with creativity and charm. Just as in Shaun of the Dead, Pegg and Frost have great chemistry together, although their characters and the dynamics between them are much different this time around. Pegg has taken it up a notch to be a responsible, serious officer of the law, where as Frost is still the bumbling, hapless idiot he was in Shaun. \n\nMovie buffs will love Hot Fuzz, as it references several poplar action movies, the two main ones being \"Point Break\" and \"Bad Boys 2\"; both of them extremely over-the-top, adrenaline charged action spectacles which go against everything police officers should do in the real world. At first, the references to these movies come in the form of Danny asking whether or not Angel has seen the movies. When he reveals that he hasn't, the two of the have a movie marathon and watch both films back to back. Towards the end of the film, as the two cops take on the villain(s), the references come thick and fast as certain camera angles and recognisable shots are entirely replicated. This was a clever touch to show just how deep into the case these cops get and their only way to survive the carnage is to imagine it's all just a movie. \n\nWhen watching Hot Fuzz, sit back and be prepared for a hilarious and visually entertaining film, which combines great music, sharp writing and over the top action scenes to deliver what is definitely one of the best Action-Comedy films ever made. Well, in my opinion anyway!",

            "content": "Excelente filme que combina acci√≥n, comedia y misterio. Impecable colaboraci√≥n de Edgar Wright dirigiendo y Simon Pegg actuando, y donde entre los dos escribieron el gui√≥n. Nick Frost hace un gran papel a la par de Pegg. Gran elenco con nombres como Timothy Dalton y Jim Broadbent. As√≠ como cameos de Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy y Steve Coogan muy reconocibles, pero adem√°s cameos m√°s complicados de pescar de pesos como Peter Jackson y Cate Blanchet. Este es un filme muy entretenido, donde Wright y Pegg se dieron a la tarea de leer un libro del famoso cr√≠tico Roger Ebert sobre los clich√©s de las cintas de acci√≥n, para intencionalmente incluir todos los clich√©s mencionados! No tiene precio! Un detalle que las audiencias de habla inglesa no habr√°n pescado es que el n√∫mero de placa del personaje de Pegg es 777, igual que el Patrullero 777 de Mario Moreno \"Cantinflas\" que no creo que fuera una casualidad y no encuentro imposible que Pegg y/o Wright hayan visto alguna de las pel√≠culas en donde Cantinflas encarn√≥ igualmente a un polic√≠a. Regresando al filme, el formato es genial, ya que en lugar de usar el t√≠pico elemento en donde el personaje principal es torpe y los dem√°s no, aqu√≠ lo hicieron al rev√©s, creando un fresco rev√©s en la trama. Adem√°s la cinta logra mezclar en los dosis correctas los elementos de acci√≥n, comedia y misterio para no debilitar ninguna de las tendencias sino que al contrario, todas se complementan creando un formidable filme que recomiendo altamente.",

But the √¢creepy-as-hell√¢? hooded figure takes centre stage in what is a strange yet action-packed action comedy.  Or is it a horror mystery thriller?  Or a cop film parody?  \n\n       You see, screenwriters Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg seem to take a fair share of the various film genres and throw them all into the blender, resulting in a liquidy mesh of action, horror, comedy etc.  But yet the film√¢(TM)s lack of identity is the first and last of my worries about this film. \n\n        Hot Fuzz pays homage to the smart and strangely mind-bending whodunit situation, in which Nicholas Angel (Pegg), because he made the Metropolitan Police Service look bad, is reassigned to the sleepy village of Sandford, where √¢accidents√¢? are happening left right and centre.  As you can expect, they√¢(TM)re not really so called accidents, but a series of killings that Angel (or Angle as the local paper foolishly calls him), with the reluctant help from the tubby son (Nick Frost) of the Inspector (Jim Broadbent), must figure out if he wants to restore peace to the village. \n\n        But Hot Fuzz isn√¢(TM)t a one trick pony, it boasts a bag full of laugh-out-loud moments including this cracker: √¢When√¢(TM)s your birthday? 22nd Feb.  What year?  Every year.√¢?  Whether it√¢(TM)s mocking cop films or just classic old slapstick, Hot Fuzz has got it.  But not only that, but Hot Fuzz will make you giddy with its action!  Bullets are flying around the village square, sea mines are blowing up, nannies are kicking ass avec shotguns.  The final half an hour is exhilarating and heart-pounding yet it somehow manages to keep a smile on your face.  Wright and Pegg don√¢(TM)t muck around here!\n\n        Ultimately, this film is one great big hoot.  Laughs and action galore, this action/comedy/horror/thriller/parody film will tickle your excitement gland with its epic action vibe.",
