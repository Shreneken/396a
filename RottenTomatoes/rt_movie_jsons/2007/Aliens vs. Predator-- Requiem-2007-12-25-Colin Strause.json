On the one side, nearly indestructible Aliens; on the other, a lone Predator whose mission is to wipe out all traces of the Alien infestation from Earth, no matter who gets in the way.",

            "content": "Where do you even start with this one....the acting is unremarkably ok. It's just \"As Good\" as the first which means it has all the same problems and then some. The Aliens & Predators were no where as good as in this one mainly because they didn't get as much screentime and the battle scenes were anywhere as good. The cinematography was atrociously bad. It is not hyperbole to say you can't fully see 90% of this film because it is so dark. Even the battle scenes you can't see most of the time. I know the first didn't have much color and was lifeless in terms of background but at least you could fully see it. Add on a bunch of pointless scenes with human characters and it becomes a terrible slog to watch. The music is as boring and generic as the first. The editing and the pacing is Horrifically bad. At least in the first I could tell you that 2 main characters emerged by the end. I seriously can't tell you at all who the main character was in this, any of the names of anyone in this, or what honestly the story is about besides the ship crashes, chaos ensues and the town is destroyed. Oh and they try to escape. Problem is stuff just happens, including pointless kills, pointless characters, and the fact you can't even see the screen half the time. I mean if you think you can somehow \"watch\" this despite not being able to see 90% of it than go ahead. Man this was horrifically bad.",

It's fashionable to hate on this film but it's not meant to be Citizen Kane. It's entertaining sci-fi horror and I loved it. It's got that small town America being picked off one by one 80's retro vibe and I'll be forever be disappointed they didn't make a third one. Prometheus and Covenant were over-rated and thought they were more intellectual than they were. AVP2 at least knew it was pulp fiction and did it as well as it has ever been done.",

Com o Alien saindo de dentro do Predador. Aí a nave cai na Terra e os aliens fogem e já dominam seres humanos. E assim saem procriando. E começam a dominar uma cidadezinha. E o pânico se espalha e o exercito é chamado. Assim tem 2 grupos que se dividem em seguir as ordens do exército e outra partir ao hospital e fugir de helicóptero. Assim vão tendo os embates do Predador e Alien. E os humanos como peões dos 2 lados. Mas será que sobreviverão?\nRoteiro e enredo fracos, filme fraco.\nVale apena assistir? Não\nNota: 4",

Having Xenomorphs descend on a hospital maternity ward is needlessly mean storytelling and I'm all for it. Secondly, it is entirely unafraid to unexpectedly kill characters that tired and cliched tropes would have you believe are enshrined in plot armour. They aren't. \n\nIt isn't a good film, I'm certainly not saying it is, but it's a fun film. Where AVP is punishingly poor, Requiem is at least enjoyable. Some of the set pieces are almost parodies of horror at times, but there's something fairly pleasing about seeing bad things happen to innocent people. These films are normally so littered with combatants being the victims that it's refreshing to see innocent civilians getting murdered by alien monsters. Weird as that sentence is to write.\n\nThis isn't (by any stretch) the worst in the series and I'd even suggest it's a better film than Predator 2, which is an absolute mess.",

They used the same formula of introducing a group of characters whose only purpose was to get killed but this time they actually fooled me into caring for them by starting us out with the kid & his dad and then splitting the duties of the main protagonist between 3 people. The darkness & the whole power outage gimmick were noticeable and annoying but the effect was reduced in large part by the 8-ball pool game I'd been playing on my phone. I didn't mind the plot premise itself as it was fresh for the franchise and had a lot of positive similarities to 30 Days of Night, a radically superior monster action-horror that I'd watched & loved just a few days ago. They didn't totally succeed with it as I wasn't able to tell the adult aliens apart from one another when that was a focal point of the plot and the entire second act of killing sequences just sort of washed over me, but I didn't dislike it as much as its 12% Tomatometer suggested I would.",

They were too easy to kill. The whole movie lacked suspense and any dark atmosphere. The ending was confusing. On the other hand there was a fair amount of violent creature antics and the use of computers was very restrained. It looked better than the previous battle that had no relevance to anything. At least this one was set here and now although it could have been set in the future equally well. It is good that it wasn't set at the North Pole or whatever. It was cheesy which excused some of the bad points. Overall I would say that this is not a total waste of time but it is not productive either.

This was the first time that the Alien vs Predator franchise takes the action to full blown takeover of an entire city instead of the usual limited people, stuck in a remote area with little or no weapons trope that you get most of the time with these movies. This is definitely in the top 5 out of both of these franchises. The brothers Strauss even took the care of including classic sound effects for the aliens from Aliens. Alot of people don't know that Alien vs Predator comics have been around for many years  either, so if your a fan of Sci-fi horror and/or the Alien/ Predator franchise, this is a great movie. Also check out Alien vs. Predator 1, not quite as good but a good watch also. For all of you folks that had trouble seeing, it is shot with very little lighting,  but I found that a little adjustment to the TV settings, particularly brightness and contrast and you'll be able to see just fine.",

This in itself is a great concept. While the original AVP wasn't horrible like some people make it out to be, the whole Predators hunting Xenomorphs for sport inside an underground arctic temple was just a little too outlandish for me. Having a Predator hunt down Xenomorphs to protect their anonymity from the humans is a much more grounded idea. \n   I personally wasn't offended by the original AVP's PG-13 rating, but the directors clearly heard the complaints of the people that were. They went all in on the R rating. Heck, the only reason the movie is called Requiem is so that it could signify its R existence! I definitely enjoyed the R content over the PG-13 stuff of the original, so that was a plus for this movie.\n   But the huge complaint everyone has with this movie is that the characters have absolutely no depth to them whatsoever. Each person is given a name and one stereotypical trait. Because I could care less about who lived and who died, it really took away from the usual excitement about seeing Xenomorphs slowly pick off humans. On top of that, all the characters constantly make the usual dumb horror mistakes, so it doesn't exactly feel realistic either.\n   Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem is a good follow up to the first movie, but has too many issues to be considered a good movie on its own.",

After seeing the film I was not only depressed but angered by this movie. In fact I own every Alien film on DVD except for this very movie. The clear problem is that there is no threat with the Aliens at all. They are easily killed and tons of people see them and survive. The Predator is clearly the hero as he can fight two aliens with his bare hands without any difficulty never mind that the creatures bleed acid. The lack of experience the directors have is evident by the film shots and lighting alone. It is such a dark film because you can barely see what's going on and any scene involving a creature is sped up and shaky. You could say it is done on purpose to create mood, but when the chips are down you know it was done because the creature costumes were bulky and fake. Do I even need to note the desperation of fan service with a literally carbon copy of Ripley and her Newt clone child? There is even characters with names of past film characters to seem intelligently connected to what was already done better. Don't look for good writing either. In fact if logic was put into any scene you would notice how nothing in the film works. It's all built on straw. You simply have to throw away things you know about the franchise in order to make things work. Take for instance the pred-alien when it is born. In AVP the ship is clearly flying away from earth when the creature is born. In this film the ship is now orbiting earth, oops. Then the creature grows to full size within seconds and has enough time to kill everyone and then crash to earth before the ship leaves. It's amateur hour and the script writers know it. Instead of focusing on details they are saying hey look at this, isn't that cool? Isn't this what you want? The film is dark and look at the big alien that is different. Do you like it? Well the answer is no it's not different nor is it good in any sense. There is no grace or terror from the previous Alien films, nor is their interest in the mindless Predator portrayed in the film.",

It's very visually dark, but seen in a dark living room or theater this is fine. \n\nTo it's credit it's nowhere near as stupid as Alien Resurrection or AVP. The solo Predator is courageous and badass. A couple of the humans are likeable, and the predalien is a nasty evil but tough enemy. I love the new predators weapons, like the laser grid point defense, the acid proof blade-whip and razor discs.\n\nBut I also just love the whole premise of the movie. The predators accidentally released the alien on modern America, and lost their own. So an experienced predator gives up his own life, to get revenge, to right the wrong, kill the enemy, cover up the evidence of alien life and restore their honor, all without an apparent exit strategy. That's a great story. That's more nobility in one semi-decent AVP film than in any of the prior predator films to date.",

It goes from badass space marines fighting of the perfect killing machines on a badass colony, Hadleys Hope to a town full of copy cat characters of the originals. This movie has some potential in its opening but thats completely thrown away once the ship lands in a town. The main characters are absolute garbage. The leads are a pizza boy (really?) a hot chick, and copy cat characters of the other movies even down to having the same exact names as well as the movie completley ripping off and doing exact same shots of the old movies in certain scenes. Theres a difference between tributing and completely copying better movies. Half this movie is just generic teen movie drama with Aliens and Predators in it. Some of the characters are complete morons and I wanted them all to die. The lighting in this movie is awful. They mind as well just have the screen be completely black when we see the creatures fighting and people panicking during the night because what we got is so difficult to make out. Don watch this movie. Its a waste of time and adds nothing to the spiciness of the original movies.

The characters are dull, undeveloped, and are bound to die at some point.  The aliens and predator looks pretty good, but my big problem is the lighting.   We are used to having poor lighting in these films to cover up any imperfections in the creatures, but we could barely see what was going on half the time.  Maybe watching it again in a pitch black room will help, but it can't much, and it's a major setback.  The alien/predator hybrid is interesting, but we barely get to see it and learn about it.  It kinda throws logic away, with its predator jaws, dreadlocks things and ability to inject eggs into a host through its mouth, and doesn't explain any of it.  It's good that we are not back in to pyramid thank god, it's nice to be in a more human setting in a way, something different from what we have seen in the past.  The director didn't hold back on the death and gore, being the most dark and brutal of any of the films in any of the three franchises.  It's scary for sure, creepy, a slaughter-fest of aliens killing humans, and loves to show us that these things are a hundred times more deadly than anything we know.  The alien vs predator duels are far improved, better pace, sound effects,  CGI, and is overall fun to watch, when we can see what's happening.  Some moments are too dumb, like the guy using the predator gun to shoot the aliens, and the national guard being retadedly blind, but even if they were fixed the film would be basiclly the same.  The ending us surprisingly, ties up any loose ends, and still leaves it possible for another sequel.  Again I'm not sure which is better, this or the original AVP (probably this one), but I can say that if it wasn't so dark that we can't see anything, had a longer running time and better developed characters this would be a decent action movie.",

Sure, it isn't the best movie, but you can tell that there was a decent amount of effort being put into it. This movie is not nearly as good as the previous one. It should be noted that this film is directed by Greg and Colin Strause, two very acclaimed members within the special effects community. I have seen a few of the films they've worked on, and was blown away by the visuals. As directors, however, I don't think these guys are really the best. The story was incredibly flat, as were the characters taking part. Once shit started going down and people were being killed, I accidentally bursted out laughing at a few scenes that were probably meant to spark some emotion. Needless to say, I wasn't too invested in what happened to the characters. As with the beasties going head to head with one another, it was made apparent that the directors didn't have the level of appreciation for the two franchises as Paul W. S. Anderson. There were a number of mannerisms displayed by the creatures that seemed very out of character, and it threw me off on a number of occasions. They also didn't look as polished and detailed in this movie, but that could have been attributed to the pretty shitty scene lighting, which leads me to my final point. In a movie entitled Alien vs. Predator, one would expect to see some pretty badass action sequences, with plenty of alien gore and green goo. The action scenes in this movie are incredibly dull, devoid of tension, and it was really hard to make out what was going on because the lighting was awful! The excessive shaky cam didn't do it any favours, either.\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem is not a very good movie. If you want to roast a movie with some buds, I'd recommend checking this one out. Otherwise, check out the first AvP, or another film from the respective franchises.",

Aylesworth,and John Ortiz and the movie is directed by the Brothers Strause.The movie takes place immediately where \"Alien vs.Predator\" left off where the Predator from the last movie has a chestburster pop out of his chest and the Xenomorph that comes out has the looks of a Predator.The \"Predalien\" then kills the Predators on the ship and the ship crashes in a small town of Colorado.However,one of the Predators sent to another Predator on their home-world and he goes out to the town to destroy the remains of the ship.Facehuggers are released into the town and wreak havoc.It's up to the Predator and the humans to kill every single Xenomorph.I liked the idea of the story,but it's poorly and I mean poorly executed.As I said earlier,this movie is even worse than the first movie.The acting in \"Requiem\" is not very good at all.The actor who plays Dallas is okay in his role and I find it funny that his character's name is the same name of the captain of the Nostromo in \"Alien\".Reiko Aylesworth is alright as the Ripley rip-off in this movie.The guy who plays the sheriff of the town is mediocre in his role.This movie has a ton of problems.One of the problems with this movie are the characters.Like the first movie,the characters are cardboard cutouts.They are bland and totally uninteresting.The main character,Dallas,is a recently released convict who is so boring that it looks like he's about to cry.Kelly is a character who is so much like Ripley from the previous \"Alien\" movies.Not only does she look like Sigourney Weaver,but she also protects a little girl that is suppose to be like Newt/Rebecca Jordan from \"Aliens\".All the other characters are typical horror movie characters that are just there to be prey for the Xenomorphs and Predator.The writing in the movie is also just as bad as \"Alien vs.Predator\".The dialogue is horrendous and some of the worst I've heard in my life.The lighting in the movie is also awful.The movie is filmed in dark areas and is so murky that I couldn't see anything that was going on.The editing is also bad like the last movie.This movie is so jumpy with the editing that when the Xenomorphs and Predator are fighting it was so hard to tell what was going on.The movie also has plot-holes in it that bug me.The one that bugs me the most is when the Predator is getting rid of evidence.The movie shows him pouring this blue liquid on people killed by Xenomorphs to get rid of their evidence.In one scene though,he pours it on a kid and his father who were killed by chestbursters and a police officer is watching him.The police officer's walkie talkie goes off and the Predator kills him.A few scenes later,we see his dead body skinned and hanging from a tree.If the Predator is trying to destroy evidence,why did he kill the police officer and leave his dead body hanging from a tree?Also,there's a scene in the movie where the characters get guns from the National Guard,and in the next scene one of the characters says that the National Guard has guns.What happened to the guns that they got in the building?I also hate how this movie is so against kids.There is a scene in the movie where a dad and his kid are hunting and facehuggers latch themselves onto their faces and both die by the chestbursters.Another one that makes my blood boil is when the \"Predalien\" impregnates a woman who is pregnant.A few scenes later,a male nurse finds her and three chestbursters pop out of her stomach also implying that the chestbursters ate the fetus.I know a lot of people try to defend it by saying that it was a bold move by the makers of the movie,but it just doesn't add anything to the story.It was there for pure shock value and it was disgusting.There was only two things I liked.The first thing I did like in the movie were the effects.Although the effects are hard to see thanks to the poor lighting,they are really good for the most part.The final thing I liked was the R-Rating.The PG-13 rating for the first movie really hurt it.For this movie,the R-Rating is back and they made a hard R.This movie is gory.There are plenty of scenes in the movie where chestbursters pop out of people's chests,get their heads cut off,blown off,or poked a hole through,aliens getting sliced up,and there's an awesome scene where a chick gets pinned against the walls of a hospital by the Predator's throwing star and her lower half of her body falls off with a ton of intestines as well.The gore is what saves this movie.Overall,\"Aliens vs.Predator:Requiem\" is an awful movie.Almost everything about it is bad from the acting,characters,writing,lighting,editing,no explanation for a lot,and the unnecessary violence against children.The effects and R-Rating are what save this movie.This is by far the worst film in both franchises.If there is another \"Alien vs.Predator\" movie,I want to see no humans and just Xenomorphs and Predators fighting.I would even take the plot of the video game.Skip this movie at all costs.\n\nGrade:D-",

Again they try to empower a strong heroine to fight the extraterrestrial monsters with Reiko Aylesworth (24 series). But for a fan of both the alien and predator franchise this movie is messy. Hopefully the battle ends here. \n\nAfter the events of the first movie, a chestburster erupts from the corpse of predator, unleashing a hybrid creature on the ship of the predators. Making several victims, the creature causes the vessel to crash in a forest in Colorado. It is found by a hunter and his son, who are attacked by facehuggers. \n\nShortly after, we follow three storylines: one of a pizza delivery boy who is humiliated by some classmates and gets reunited with his ex-con brother. Another about a Kelly O'Brien (Aylesworth) who is a soldier coming home to her husband and estranged daughter. And a third about the Sheriff who tries to find the missing hunter and his son.

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nWell, the alien-oriented film reviews must continue, so what do I have in store for you fellow reviews?  I have a review for this terrible crime against cinema.  Alien and Predator were both two very separate franchises going in direction differently.  However, this all changed when Predator 2 came out and everyone saw the infamous ending.  You never watched Predator 2?  Well, in the end, Danny Glover has found himself in the Predator's ship, in the ship, there were the skulls of many alien life-forms.  One of which was the Xenomorph from Alien.  This Easter Egg was enjoyable in a not-so-enjoyable film, but when it is executed, it doesn't work at all.  Just to give you a reason not to watch this movie, I will say this.  This film was made by the Strause brothers, who I originally didn't know a thing about.  However, their second film after this was.......Skyline.  That's pretty much a death penalty right there.\n\nAlien vs Predator: Requiem is about the Predator ship from the end of Alien vs Predator.  The ship is under attack by the all new Predalien, a Predator/Xenomorph hybrid.  They soon crash land in a typical white people neighborhood.  The typical white people in that neighborhood get are caught in the middle of the war between Alien and Predator.  Is it a nice premise?  Well, the Predalien idea would seem cool.  I mean a Xenomorph/Predator Hybrid sounds pretty awesome.  But it fails and becomes pointless.  Also, it doesn't make sense considering how the Predalien bursted from a Predator.  Would that mean that the regular Xenomorph isn't affected at all when it bursts from a human?  So a Predator can alter the genes of a Xenomorph, but a human can't?  Yeah, I'll just buy the logic.\n\nAnyways, AVPR is the pinnacle of bad movies.  How an someone fuck up one of the best monster mash movies of all time?  Well, Paul W.S. Anderson did, but that guy ruins everything.  Seriously, we're given some dumb humans, whose only point in the film is to be target practice for Predator's zap gun.  They literally were a bunch of idiotic, sex-driven teens as our main characters.  At least, the main bitch was eaten by a Xenomorph....Or I think she was killed by Predator's little tomahawk.....OR SOMETHING! Then, the special effects.....What year did this come out?  2007?  How did the original Alien which came out 3 decades before this look a million times better?  The CGI looks horrible.  It's on par with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and to a degree: 10,000 BC (Suck it up, Jed.)  Usually when a film blends in CGI with practical effects like this, it would look good!  That is, if the practical effects were somewhat decent!  Goodness, we're in the 21st century and they couldn't produce something better?  \n\nThen, the action sequences are nearly impossible to tell!  There is a jump cut every 2 seconds during a fight.  It would take your forever to guess what Predator was doing during the fights.  It also doesn't help that whoever did the lighting doesn't know how to create a dark feel, but have people still see what's going on.  Everything was murky and you couldn't tell who was killed.  For a second, I literally thought they killed the main character.  They couldn't even get the lighting done right!  Uh, these guys suck at everything they did!  They have this awful scene where they show some Xenomorph embryo killing a human embryo and it's completely just hilarious.  Congratulation, AVP2!!!!  You made me laugh at a baby's death!\n\nOverall, yeah.....I could have accepted the plot for being as moronic as it was.  However, AVPR is a crime not only to both the Alien and Predator franchises, but to me and film in general.  The action scenes are worse than the final fight in Alex Cross.  Yeah, that bad.  I wasn't expecting characters I would love, but this is a new low.  Everyone fits in the perfect archetype of a horror film.  The average looking teen guy who somehow gets a model to like him.  The dumb bitch who falls in love with the main character and causes problems for him.  The jock who bullies are main character and is killed.  I could go on and on.  This film is literally AIDs if AIDs was in cinema form.  At what point did the producers stop and think \"Yeah, this is a bad idea\"?  My guess, they never did.  If you choose to watch this film, you may not make it out alive.  I did, but barely and nearly thought of putting a bullet in my mouth around 20 minutes.  But I fought through it and survived.\n\n0.5/10",

Tacked onto this is the usual sort of 'teen slasher' type storyline peopled by the stereotypical characters (teen bully, nice guy, country police chief etc.) that have populated the genre since it was invented. There's plenty of monster action, keeping the screen liberally splattered with gore however, the lighting in most scenes is so dim that it is practically impossible to make out what is actually meant to be taking place. OK so maybe I am being somewhat harsh on this film as it was clearly never intended to be deeply thought provoking or a commentary on modern life.

After the events of Alien vs. Predator, a hybrid creature is formed, a hybrid between an Alien and a Predator, which crash lands on the outskirts of Gunnison, Colorado. The hybrid uses the facehugger to plant it's seeds into members of the community of Gunnison. This is noticed by a group of local residents, including recently released convict convict Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale), his brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis), sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz) and soldier Kelly O'Brien (Reiko Aylesworth). All of whom have to fight this unusual form of evil, but it's not long before a Predator comes to stomp out the hybrid, and the Aliens being born. It tries to hark back to monster movies of the 1970's and 80's, where a community gets together to fight it, but it's far too dull to be interesting.

It amps up the gore, but in the process turns Alien and Predator into a teen slasher flick, complete with a ridiculous plot, disposable characters, and a pointless romance you don't give a shit about. This film fails to see the what makes Alien and Predator memorable. It wasn't all about the gore, the original films where about cool stories and memorable characters. Now I will be the first to say that this is no where near as bad as the first AVP. To be honest, at time it's quite entertaining, but it doesn't deliver anything truly memorable.

            "content": "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is a 2007 science fiction horror thriller action slasher film directed by Colin and Greg Strause, written by Shane Salerno, produced by John Davis, David Giler, and Walter Hill, and starring Reiko Aylesworth, Steven Pasquale, Ian Whyte, Tom Woodruff Jr., John Ortiz, Johnny Lewis, Sam Trammell, Liam James, Ariel Gade, Kurt Max Runte, Kristen Hager, David Paetkau, Robert Joy, and Francoise Yip. The film is, of course, the sequel to the 2004 film Alien vs. Predator, as well as an interquel to the Alien and Predator films.\n\nIn Gunnison County, Colorado, a spacecraft crashes in the woods bringing a powerful hybrid Alien hosted inside the pilot Predator. Two of the locals are hunting in the forest and witness the crash, but they are chased and killed by Facehuggers and Chestbursters. Meanwhile, another Predator lands on the spot seeking out the Alien and destroys evidence of their presence on Earth. The townspeople find themselves in the middle of a battlefield between the two deadly extraterrestrial creatures, and they must band together for any chances of survival.\n\nAh, the Alien and Predator franchises. They both started off so strong. The first two Alien films are two of my all-time favorite films. They're two movies that build suspense, have great characters, and are incredibly well-directed. The first two Predator films are more action-oriented, and while the characterizations are simple, they're strong nonetheless and they were both great as well.\n\nEver since the failures of Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, the Alien franchise was going downfall painfully fast, so 20th Century Fox thought that the best idea to save the franchise and to give us a third Predator film would be to make a crossover between the two franchises, Alien vs. Predator. Unfortunately, Fox went the stupid route by hiring Paul W.S. Anderson to write and direct. Alien vs. Predator was just garbage. Need I say more? The sequel, Requiem, is an improvement upon the first film, but that's not saying shit, really.\n\nAVP: Requiem is much better paced than its predecessor. While the first film wasn't really boring per se, it has some serious pacing issues. Thankfully, Requiem is only an hour and a half long, so things go by at a steady pace. Also, the unapologetically over-the-top graphic violence, blood, and gore will satisfy the gorehounds. The first film wasn't able to show a lot of gory visuals and images thanks to its PG-13 rating.\n\nRequiem is definitely a hard-R film. Hell, we see a Chestburster emerge out of a little kid, and a bunch of aliens burst out of a pregnant woman's stomach. Also, the Alien and Predator suits and designs are a lot better than they were in the first AVP film. Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. once again provide the creature effects and they do a fantastic job. I especially dug the Alien/Predator hybrid, the Predalien.\n\nSo those are the only things that made this film better than the first film. Everything else? Just as bad. This film throws in as many Alien and Predator references as it possibly can, but with rather poor results. For example, two of the main characters are a mother and daughter, the mother being tough and sexy, and able to use heavy military and weapons equipment. Get it? Because they're like Ripley and Newt, except they're not actually Ripley and Newt?\n\nAnother one of the main characters is actually named Dallas. Get it? It's paying homage to Tom Skerritt's character Dallas from the first Alien film? This Dallas actually has a line where he says to someone, \"Get to the chopper!\" as an homage to that scene from the first Predator film? To screenwriter Shane Salerno: How fucking lazy can you get? Also, how come the Xenomorphs coming to the town and fighting the Predators is never referenced in the Alien films? Having trouble with continuity, Mr. Salerno?\n\nSalerno's writing is incredibly poor. The basic storyline is plagued with flaws, the characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts with little to no development whatsoever, and the dialogue is nothing short of generic and clichéd. Seriously, I felt like I was watching a cheesy slasher film from the 80's, like one of the Friday the 13th films, and not a grand-scale crossover between two of the best sci-fi/action/horror franchises of all time.\n\nAlso, of all the environments you could've picked for the Aliens and Predators to fight in, you picked suburbia? Fucking suburbia? Why not the Predator homeworld, or the homeworld of the Xenomorphs? Hell, the Amazon rainforest would be a decent environment. Why the generic, suburban, small town we've seen in countless other horror, action, and sci-fi movies?\n\nSpeaking of the Aliens and Predators fighting, the action and horror set pieces are jumpily edited by Dan Zimmerman and most of them are shot in the dark, so you can't see what's going on. I blame this on the film's cinematographer, the usually great Daniel C. Pearl. I give the guy credit for opting to avoid using bludgeoning shaky-cam, but still, he could've improved upon the lighting immensely.\n\nThe acting is bland and rather forgettable, just like the actors in the first film. The only two who are trying to act are Steven Pasquale as Dallas and Reiko Aylesworth as our Ripley clone, Kelly. Aylesworth is incredibly gorgeous and does manage to provide some decent eye candy here and there. The other actors are pretty bad, especially Johnny Lewis as the local pizza delivery boy Ricky.\n\nBrian Tyler composes the musical score for the film, taking over for Harald Kloser from the first film. Tyler's score is pretty damn good. I really liked how often Tyler paid tribute to Alan Silvestri's work on Predator and the scores for Alien and Aliens by Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner, respectively, while contributing his own pieces of music. Have I heard better from Tyler? Well, yeah, but his AVP-R score was still really good for the most part.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 3/10\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem, while an entertaining sci-fi B-horror flick, is still a lame sequel. Is it better than the first film? Yes. It's certainly very gory, the creature effects and musical score are great, and it's well-paced, but the acting and characters are boring and forgettable, the plot and story are plagued with flaws, the lighting is aggravatingly dim, and the writing is pretty terrible. It could've been worse, but it's still not good.",

Yes there was violence, but it was sparce and more effective and terrifying because of it.  There's even a scene where they find a skinned cadaver dangling off a tree.  That went against the plot altogether since the predator was not there to hunt, but to clean up their mess and contain the situation.  Just an excuse for fan service and gore.\n\nThis film also seems even cheaper than the last film.  Small town flavor doesn't quite kick as much as a grand antarctic setting in a pyramid.  Speaking of small town, there's also an emphasis on the human characters which is admirable for a b-movie.  Problem is there's not enough interesting characters or development to be had so a lot of time is wasted on pointless human filler.   Just give us the AVP action since these humans are just meat for the grinder.  Also could the movie been shot any darker?  There is a way to convey a dark forboding mood without tutning off ALL the lights.  So poor camerawork kinda puts a strain on trying to see what's going on.\n\nThis film does have ok action fx and the typical goods that come with this kind of film and in that respect its entertaining to a point.  F bombs and gore only gets you so far though, and is not the way to win over fans.",

            "content": "Everything Science Fiction fans ever wanted in an ALIENS VS PREDATOR movie can be found in ALIENS VS PREDATOR: REQUIEM -- You just can't see it. AVP:R suffers from the absolute worst lighting of any Horror/Science Fiction film ever made. The only scenes that count are so abysmally dark that it becomes tiring and frustrating to watch, despite the incredible gory action that is occurring somewhere on screen. Following the conclusion of the previous film, a fallen Predator warrior gives birth to a Predalien hybrid, which destroys the remaining crew and causes the Predator craft to come careening back down to Earth along with its payload of alien facehuggers. Before long, the small mountain town of Gunnison, Colorado is overrun by the menacing aliens, and one of the Predator's most elite warriors is sent to clean up the mess. The Strauss Brothers come as close as they can to recreating many of the most successful scenes from either series in this failure of a film, with visual and audio cues dating back to the original PREDATOR and ALIENS. If it were left strictly to the battle sequences, AVP:R would have been an awesome, action-packed sequel, but if anything is worse than the lighting, it is the ridiculous human element that adds unnecessary clutter to the script. The awful characters are supplanted straight out of a bad teen serial, and contribute nothing to the plot. It is all the more enraging that these scenes are the only ones that are visible. The killer costume designs of Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. cannot even be admired for more than a second between the blackness, the shaking camera, and the choppy editing. Complaining about story continuity is really irrelevant with all else that is wrong in AVP:R, so suffice it to say that the film is a lost cause with a few really cool looking aliens and explosions (which can't be seen).",
