Due to his association with those more vocal about their discontent, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a member of the Stasi, begins surveillance measures, all of which lead to blurred lines concerning morality and loyalty.  Florian Henckel von Donnerscmarck's The Lives of Others succeeds on the strength of its well-rounded characters, all of whom are fully developed and wracked with moral dilemmas.  It is a powerful movie about the lines that we are willing to cross in order to protect those around us or to protect our own interests, sadly a theme that always seems to be timely.",

            "content": "Reflecting on the thought that this film may be among the most authentic spy films ever made. Fewer gadgets, more shift changes.\n\nThe Lives of Others was one of the first serious dramas to tackle the uncomfortable subject of life under a modern day, oppressive European regime; many of the people involved in the Stasi were still alive during this period, they had become elderly neighbors and friends. The past was more an unfortunate memory than a festering wound given the total collapse of the Soviet Union. The film does a good job of establishing the appropriate atmosphere and setting of the drab, ideology-riddled Eastern Bloc, but the overarching plot is really secondary to the tender, detail-oriented character development afforded to Ulrich M√ºhe's Wiesler, whose transition from cold intelligence officer to empathetic protector may ring awfully sentimental, but is handled with such attention to detail that it can very easily win you over. His character is revealed through mannerisms and situational responses rather than more obvious exposition. With Wiesler at the center, the third member of a household that doesn't know of his presence, The Lives of Others becomes an exploration of loneliness, authenticity, truthfulness, and courage. Images of Wiesler's transformation through the reading of poetry and picking up a prostitute to briefly experience intimacy may lean more toward the heavy-handed side of storytelling, but M√ºhe gives plenty to make the character convincing, and many of the supporting performances are sharp as well. \n\nThe cafeteria 'joke' scene, such a good segment. Heady atmosphere, keeps the audience on edge, establishes character, and portrays multiple aspects of the environment that the film takes place in (the dedication to decorum in public vs. more casual interactions among peers, the inner politics, the dangerous consequences of improper appearances, and the topheavy concentrations of power). (3.5/5)",

            "content": "Florian Henckel von Donnersmack's \"The Lives of Others\" is an intimate, gripping and thought-provoking spy thriller that dramatizes surveillance of residents in communist East Berlin. With his Academy-Award winning directorial debut, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmack crafted an intense political thriller about German paranoia  prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Using spellbinding cinematography, Donnersmack draws viewers into the life of a compassionate Stasi policeman that is ordered to spy on the lives of residents in 1984 East Germany. Donnersmack's decision to shoot the movie in long takes is risky, but it works tremendously. It gives the film a tense and ominous atmosphere, making viewers feel as if their lives are being secretely monitored. Donnersmack showcases extraordinary control of craftsmanship over the sound design, editing and musical score, using these elements to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Donnersmack's screenplay is also sensational, and effectively uses minimal dialogue to create heightened tension in the monitoring sequences. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Ulrich Muhe delivers one of the finest performances of his career as Gerd Wiesler. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the angst, humanity and resilience of a Stasi captain that forms feelings for the married couple he is ordered to spy on. The supporting cast, which includes the spectacular Sebastian Koch, is also extraordinary and worthy of recognition. Although \"The Lives of Others\" is undeniably a riveting political thriller, ultimately it is not a flawless film. It is inconsistently paced, and takes time to gain momentum during its exposition-driven first-hour. Moreover, its complex historical themes are hard to understand for viewers that aren't familiar with German history. Nevertheless, fans of German Cinema will definitely enjoy \"The Lives of Others\" and so will movie-goers seeking engrossing entertainment. As a window into the lives of misunderstood German citizens, one hopes it will evoke empathy for Stasi captains whose task of spying on strangers for a living deserves recognition today.",

Not only is the film set in that year, but it blends the idea of a surveillance state monitoring our private and public lives. Ulrich M√ºhe is excellent as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, delivering a quiet yet powerful performance. His character encounters so many tense, high-stakes situations that he must walk carefully. It reminds me of Catch Me If You Can, where Leo has to make his way through seemingly impossible scenarios without blowing his cover. While this movie might be too conservative for some people, I'd highly recommend it across the board.",

            "content": "Being forced to watch something in a classroom is likely not the best way to digest a film so I thought I would watch this German hit again to get a feel for it outside of my teenage frustrations. It remains one of those films that I think is very good but don't understand all of the fervor and emotion for after seeing it again and I don't know if I ever will. This upset Pan's Labyrinth (2006) to win Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards and it is a worthy winner as the film puts it's setting and the sociopolitical climate it depicts to good use.\n\nSocially isolated Stasi member Gerd Wiesler, Ulrich Muhe, is fixated on playwright Georg Dreyman, Sebastian Koch, when he sees one of his plays performed during the time of East German repression of art. Wiesler is said to produce plays that support the ideals of the government but Wiesler claims that he suspects him of being subversive so that he can carry out surveillance on Dreyman and his attractive actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland, Martina Gedeck. He begins to feel a connection to the couple over time and tries to shield Dreyman from the Stasi even as Sieland works as an informant for them and is willing to trade sexual favors for the pills that she is addicted to. She has an ongoing relationship with powerful Minister Bruno Hempf, Thomas Thieme, and Wiesler believes that if Dreyman is caught for doing anything then Sieland will become Hempf's full time mistress. He puts himself in danger when he publishes an article about suicides in a West German magazine. Wiesler hides his actions and Dreyman faces no punishment but the raiding of his house has tragic consequences and Wiesler finds himself demoted. Years later Dreyman finds out that he had been watched over throughout this period and learns that Wiesler protected him.\n\nThe film shows that the environment present in a society like this one turned everybody against one another as even two lovers found that they could not trust one another and their greatest ally was the man watching over them. There was of course the opportunity for certain people to manipulate the system and get sex, money or power out of it but even they do not seem happy. Everybody is miserable but they are too afraid to change and would rather remain scared and under the watchful eyes of their friends and neighbors than do anything to improve their situation. Sieland is a weak woman as she values the pills she is addicted to over her principles and long time partner. We understand her anxiety however as the weakest among us would probably act like her in looking to protect ourselves by finding somebody, anybody else to pin blame on. Her desperate scramble to save her own life is not driven by anything in particular as she is shown to be fairly miserable as she is and even acting, which she would claim is her passion, does not energize her enough to fully explain her decisions.\n\nThen there is the fact that the one man who does resist the system and try to criticize it in some way is the character that we feel most distant from. He is not emotionally brittle like Sieland or sad and closed off like Wiesler but popular and successful with audiences and peers. This man of principles with his friends and easy smiles seems out of place in this environment and we feel confident that he will come away unscathed from the ravages of this time period. He is more of an object of Wiesler's envy as this man who can walk through life so easily and experience the connections with other humans that he struggles with. His competence at almost everything is maddening but we all have the desire to protect this sort of talent and Wiesler does just that.\n\nThe film looks good but hardly has the memorable color palette of a film like Barbara (2012) or the grittiness of that film. You walk away from this film with more knowledge of this period of German history than you previously had but the impact of the story may fade over time.",

            "content": "Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany's secret police (Stasi) monitored the country's population. The socialist regime secured its power by creating a culture of fear, paranoia, and denunciation within the society, and an arbitrary state executive to go after potential anti-authoritarian individuals and forces.\n\nThe Lives Of Others (2006) is a remarkable film debut by German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, very accurate in its atmosphere and depiction of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), and the first serious major picture that dealt with its socialist regime and Stasi-culture. The film functions brilliantly on many levels: as a historical document, an acribic character study, and love story.\n\nThe main character is Stasi Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M√ºhe), code name HGW XX/7. During the film we are introduced to different types of state servants: opportunists who will change like a flag in the wind for their benefits, the power-hungry who often abuse their power, or the sadistic, to name just a few. Gerd Wiesler is none of these, but a precise and mechanical executor of the state power, a middle-aged man who deeply believes in the system, and therefore doesn't question his role and act within this system. He is driven by a high level of accuracy and commitment, but no man of many words and therefore surpassed by his intellectually inferior former study-mate Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), who climbs up the career ladder due to his flexibility and ablity to serve individual authorities rather than the state.\n\nWhen Gerd Wiesler returns home from work, there is no love or family waiting for him, but he is eating his simple dinner alone in his neat, grey apartement. We can not imagine him having friends either, this rather uptight man who is walking through life without ever changing his straight facial expression. Work is the only content in his life. When he is ordered to spy on writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), this life changes.\n\nThe setting is an artistic circle in the Orwellian year 1984: Georg Dreyman is an internationally acclaimed writer who is accepted by the state; he is not overly political but friends with powerful authorities like Margot Honecker, the wife of communist state leader Erich Honecker. Despite his pro-communist views, Dreyman is not actively political and endorsing the system, as he is also not critical about it. Some of his artist friends object to this fact, but Dreyman is not the unsympathetic opportunist that we despise: here we see a man simply living for his art and the art of others, a man that walks through life with intellectual joys, and the joys of his deep love for his partner Christa-Maria.\n\nChrista-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) is a respected and celebrated stage actress that often plays the lead in her partner's play. She is ambitous and albeit also unpolitical, she seems much more aware of the oppressive system she lives in and that is a potential threat to her art and career. Her relationship to Dreyman is carried by deep affection, understanding, love, and passion. When the Minister of Culture, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) covets her, she starts a reluctant affair with him and we are exposed to repulsing scenes that are equal to rape. Not getting the true affection that Christa-Maria gives her real partner and not having her for herself, the Minister orders a surveillance on Dreyman to destroy him.\n\nOnce Dreyman is not in the house, the Stasi-men arrive and within exactly timed 20 minutes, the entire apartment gets bugged and wired: living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom ‚Äì everything. When we saw them in 2006, the year Julian Assange founded Wikileaks, these scenes were deeply intimidating and troubling for their vile intrusion of privacy. 13 years later, these scenes are still intimidating, but accompanied with the ever subliminal knowledge that by now we are being monitored 24/7.\n\nNo men in grey might be walking into our houses, but the NSA and corporations like Facebook, Apple or Amazon intruded our lifes and privacies a long time ago. They are in our bedrooms and bathrooms, even on our body with the usage of smartphones, and with our very own permission. In 2019 the fighters for transparency and privacy are labeled as state-enemies and in jail. When we see Julian Assange, he seems like a man from a different time, fallen out of time and concept. We don't care for him. In 2019, we are watching ‚ÄòThe Lives Of Others' under less unrealistic and far-away circumstances, we are not shocked anymore by what we are watching. Rather, the intimidation is accompanied by a lingering feeling of guilt- we allowed all of this, we gave up.\n\nHauptmann Wiesler monitores the couple from their attic, listening to all their steps and conversations, and in these hours in solitude a change goes on within him. Wiesel is living through the life of these others now and experiencing things that were out of his normality for the first time: gentle affection, unconditional love, close humanitarian friendships, and the beauty of art. Ulrich M√ºhe's performance is remarkable: It is not through big gestures and pathos, not through monologues or introspective dialogues that we realize this change, but through a most subtle and gentle performance. It is one of the key scenes of the film when he hears Dreyman say the words: ‚ÄûCan anyone who has heard this music, I mean really heard it,still be a bad person?\"\nDreyman doesn't know about the significance of his thought, but when he then starts to play that ‚ÄòSonata for a Good Man', we see a tear running down the face of a visibly seized Wiesler. It is the moment when his habitual world and existence collapses, the moment when his change becomes visible and its consequences unavoidable.\n\nWhen after the death of a befriended artist Dreyman takes actions that truly put him and his lover in the focus of the state power, he is not aware of that he has a secret complice in Stasi agent Wiesler, who now protects him by giving false reports and puts himself into danger by doing so. Wiesler's character makes us aware that even in an oppressive society, individuals and executives are burdened with a free will. He is the one factor that is the biggest threat for any totalitarian regime: the single ‚Äòweak' link that flies under the radar. That can accomplish just little enough within his radius, that he becomes one of the lose bricks that make the fundament of this system crumble.\n\nIn ‚ÄòWar Of The Worlds' (1953) the Martians invading Earth are impervious to mankind's weapons, but in the end they get defeated and destroyed by an unknown quantity: the bacteria in our atmosphere. In their sum, the littlest things can make for the fall of a totalitarian system. In the case of a system where individuality is being eradicated and humans are turned into numbers, the individual free will is the bacteria.\n\n‚ÄòThe Lives Of Others' of others is a film that is more important and urgent today than it was at it's release in 2006- watch by any means.\n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/the-lives-of-others-2006/",

He writes a book about the experience, dedicates the book to him, yet never met him. Totally contrived. Never Look Away is a better film by the same director/writer. Don't miss that. \n\nMajor kudos to the brilliant choice of placing the student who told the \"Sunset joke\" in the Envelope Opening Department at the end. Spectacular touch.

            "content": "The opening of The Lives of Others does a lot to establish the main character (Wiesler) as an expert, and to establish the ruthlessness of the East German secret police (aka the Stasi.) It‚Äôs a strange sequence, because clearly he‚Äôs in the wrong for being involved with the Stasi, so we‚Äôre not supposed to be on his side. Yet for some reason I found him admirable because he was right all along, he knew his job inside and out, and there‚Äôs something intriguing about a man who is the smartest person in the room. This created a strange conflict in me as the story began to fall into place because I found myself wanting him to be right again when it came to the writer he put under surveillance. The remarkable part of the script is that it managed to use a number of scenes alone between the writer and his girlfriend to transition my loyalties. Now I found myself caring about these people, and not wanting them to get caught. I feel that I definitely need to watch The Lives of Others again, because I would like to find the moment when things changed for Wiesler. You can read some of it in his changing expression, but I never saw when he first made the choice to get invested in the lives of his targets. It seemed too sudden and unprovoked the first time through, but I feel like there‚Äôs more going on that I‚Äôm missing. Even if it was unwarranted, I have to applaud Ulrich M√ºhe for selling it perfectly. He makes Wiesler one of the most intriguing protagonists, because you never know when he might return his loyalty to the Stasi and abandon his interest in the people he is monitoring. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck play their parts well, and have amazing chemistry. You can feel the whole range of emotions in their relationship as they go through deep love, frustration, playfulness, and even suspected betrayal. I felt sorry for them every time something came between them. The story in The Lives of Others is designed to ramp up the drama. Almost every scene was tense because all our main characters could be discovered at any moment. They did a great job of introducing new wrinkles into the plot so that you could never get comfortable. There was one moment in particular that made my jaw drop because I didn‚Äôt see it coming at all. But the most shocking thing about all of this is the fact that, despite the thrilling tension, there is a great deal of warmth to the story. Many of the things that happen are grounded in love, and the epilogue made my heart swell so much I could barely contain it. However, despite all the greatness of the film, there was one scene that I did not like. Reflecting on it a couple days later I kind of hate it, and it‚Äôs a scene that could have easily been removed from the film. If I can forget that moment, and also figure out when the main character decides to make the change, then The Lives of Others could be a truly great film that I‚Äôd consider one of my all-time favorites. Maybe the next time I watch it, but we‚Äôll see.",

I mean really, you just found your guardian angel, and you just quietly, stoically, get back into the car and drive away?\nI'd expect a thing like that from Wiesler himself, given his quiet and introspective nature, but I don't think the writer came off as a person like that throughout the film.\n\nStill, the ending in the bookstore was heartwarming and still pleasing.

            "content": "Film Review: The lives of others\n\n\tThe film 'The Lives of others' by director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, portrays a German Stasi officer, Captain Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) who is ordered to conduct surveillance on playwright, Dreyman (Sebastian Kosch) and his girl-friend Christa (Martina Gedeck) for suspicion that they might be conspiring against the socialist regime in East Germany. The film could be classified as a silent thriller where the plot focuses mainly on the emotional turmoil that the Stasi police officer and people like the playwright who spoke against the socialist regime had to go through. The movie explores the idea of surveillance that confines an individual's life ideologically and creates repercussions for officers who refused to accept their superior's orders. \n\t\n\tThe idea of confinement was first introduced during the bubonic plague where there was a constant need for segregating patients and homeless people who could be potential carriers of the disease. However, later in the century the idea of turning this homeless people into productive individuals by confining them started gaining steam. However, with this concept of confinement came the need to surveillance the prisoners or inmates of such institutions like the jail and mental asylums which led to the development of penopticons and the modern day CCTV cameras. The unique aspect of this film is that it portrays the whole operation of surveillance from the point of view of the man who conducts this surveillance. In very few movies is the audience made to empathize with such character who in modern society would be immediately looked down upon. In fact the director wanted to depict what would happen if such a situation occurred and he goes on to say \"the film is more of a basic expression of belief in humanity than an account of what actually happened.\" (Donnersmarck, interview to Guardian). Therefore, the movie tries to emphasis the human aspect of any such operation not just from the victim's point of view but also from the perpetuator's point of view.\n\n \tIn fact, Captain Wiesler goes through several poignant emotional situations as he surveillances the couple. The opening scene depicts him as a torturous interrogator who mentally abuses his suspects to extract confessions from them. This scene is composed with a steady camera with constant cuts between the interrogator and the suspect. The light in this scene illuminates the faces of the characters while leaving a dark background. This emphasizes the torturous cold interrogation where Captain Wiesler plays mind games with the suspect. This cold Captain Wiesler undergoes a massive change of heart as he taps the couple. He unconsciously starts to become an active emotional participant on their traumatic lives and in doing so realizes the several faults that the Socialist regime had. \n\t\n\tAnother striking technique used by the director is to have Captain Wiesler have an emotional blank face. This emotional blank face demonstrates the lack of freedom that the public in East Germany, 5 years before the Berlin wall collapse had. Each individual was under a constant paranoia as to when he would be misunderstood as speaking against the State and put behind bars. This paranoia caused them all to confine and conceal their real thoughts and feelings leaving each of them with a blank face lacking emotion and life. The portrayal of the police officer possessing this blank face reveals how even he being part of the system could nothing to help himself or the people around him. He had to put on a cold face in order to survive and not be crumpled by his superiors.\n\n\tThe thawing of his cold heart as he transitions in the film adds more poignancy to the complicated inter-personal relationships during that crisis time. Everyone was suspicious of one another for being a spy or a traitor. In fact, recent records show that 1in every 50 citizens of East Germany was suspected to have been a spy and had been monitored. This staggering statistic is quite evident in the movie where each sentence uttered against the regime is quickly questioned and seen with suspicion. This effect on inter-personal relationships is further emphasized by the pathetic state of Christa who has to surrender herself to the German Minister Kempf in order to advance her career and to not get blacklisted. The extend to which every individual during that time was suppressed and subdued both physically and mentally is clearly portrayed in this film and draws great sympathy from the audience. The effectiveness of focusing on characters helps to keep the story focused on the impact this period of totalitarianism had on people's lives.\n\t\n\tHowever, many would argue that the film tries to portray the humanity that at least some Stasi people had which is historically incorrect as there weren't any documented cases of Stasi officials who went out of their way to help the suspects. This portrayal draws some criticism to the degree of historical veracity that the film had. However, its attempt to portray such a difficult time period should be applauded and being one of the first German movies tackling this subject it needs to be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\tThe film, therefore, attempts to portray the lives of the people who lived under the German totalitarian regime in 1984 and emphasizes on the inter-personal complexities that people of that time had to go through. The idea of surveillance and confinement are broached effectively and point to a larger idea of justice. However, the unique strand of hope to find humanity even in the deepest dungeons is quite refreshing and reassuring. It is this message of hope and existence of humanity, which makes this movie a pleasure to watch. \n\n\nBibliography\n1.\tDas Leben Der Anderen. Wiedemann & Berg Filmproduktion ;, 2007. Film.",

What I loved so much about The Lives of Others is that it was such a well-constructed thriller that I was invested in the characters and the plot line enough that I often forgot I was reading subtitles.\n\nMost of this due to the amazing performances on screen, a great screenplay, and the direction of a director who I'm too tired to spell out his name. The entire film has this great tone that feels like all the great conspiracy/spy thrillers of the 70s. It reminded me so much of one of my favorite spy thrillers of the 70s, Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation. The entire film reeks of suspicion and tension, and it all works to keep you invested in what's happening with these characters.\n\nAnd this is really where the film succeeds. It's so much more than just a spy thriller, it's a character drama. Every character in the film has their own unique motivations and their own fleshed out personalities, so that they feel like real people that you care about. And they all go through tremendous transformations, in a way that you normally don't see in thrillers. It stands out above other thrillers, because of the time paid attention to character.\n\nIt might be a little long and focus too much on character for those looking for a generic thriller, but if you're interested in a smart thriller that cares about its characters, check out The Lives of Others.",

            "content": "Similar to the communist witch hunts that alarmed American's in the 1950's, \"The Lives Of Others\" offers a riveting view of life behind the Berlin Wall. It's 1984 in East Berlin and Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a secret agent of the Stasi, who investigate people who are suspected of undermining government authority. But his newest subject has an unanticipated effect on the Captain. He sits in an attic day after day, night after night, spying on the people in the flat below.\n\nThe flat is occupied by a playwright named Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his mistress, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesle first saw Dreyman at the opening of one of his plays, where he was informed by a colleague that Dreyman was a successful man.  Dreyman is good-looking, successful, with a beautiful lover; he must be getting away with something. Driven by suspicion, or perhaps by envy, Wiesler has Dreyman's flat wired and begins an official eavesdropping inquiry. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time, their roles are to act as catalysts. This is Wiesler's story and, although there are moments of tragedy, it's ultimately one of redemption. \n\nWiesler is a fascinating character in that he is a blank slate if you will, trained by his life to reflect no emotion. Sometimes not even his eyes move. As played in Muehe's performance of infinite subtlety, he watches Dreyman as a cat awaits a mouse. And he begins to internalize their lives, because he has no life of his own; no lover, no hobbies, no distraction from his single-minded job. Wiesler has no one he can really talk to. His gradual transition from loyal soldier to actual human being is what's most compelling throughout.\n\nThe seduction depicted in \"The Lives of Others\" is inadvertent. Wiesler is enticed by the possibility of art, meaning, and love, all of which are absent from his existence, but present in that of Dreyman and Crista. Wiesler lives in a bare apartment, with nothing to distinguish it from a hotel room and, when he desires company, he calls a prostitute. By listening to Dreyman and Crista, he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually, his desire to be part of something meaningful leads him to act to protect the couple, even though his actions violate the law and place his career in jeopardy. Gripping and arresting drama from first time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is masterfully executed. Ulrich Muhe gives a phenomenal performance, a film that will stand the test of time. Oscar winner as Best Foreign Language Film.",
