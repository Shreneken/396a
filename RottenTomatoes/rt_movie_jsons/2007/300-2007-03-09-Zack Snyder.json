This got my pulse pounding like few movies have. Having been a fan of the comic, I personally loved the stylistic directorial choices made and the accompanying score is fantastically rousing. Its well acted and Butler especially really commits to proceedings delivering a fantastic central performance. Something both hugely enjoyable and strikingly different in the overcrowded historical action genre.",

He starts things off with a vivid prologue--the grueling training of Spartan boys to become Spartan men, warriors, and even the Spartan King. As King Leonidas, Gerard Butler gives a career-making performance, growling and shouting his lines (spittle and all) and chewing threw the scenery with a savage gusto. He and his chiseled cohorts leap and lunge across the screen in slo-mo balletic battles of steel meeting flesh. The action is assaultive, and Snyder kills off friend and foe alike, with no details of the carnage spared. Lena Headley makes an impression as the Spartan Queen, a woman as flinty as the men in her orbit. Rodrigo Santoro makes the villain Xerxes a towering pierced demi-god with fey tendencies. Miller's wonderful hard-bitten dialogue, sometimes ripped from the real events (according to historians), makes it to the screen intact. It's not textbook history, more like a legend filtered through a comic book, so history a few times removed. But from it's engrossing opening to its inspiring finale, Snyder's film is striking and downright thrilling, one of the best comic-to-screen adaptations ever made",

And it takes its manliness to quite an extreme (you have to be completely hard and cannot show weakness at all to be a man), but in the words of Leonidas, \"This...is...SPARTA!!!!\". We are dealing with a tough ancient Greek civilization here, so of course many of their practices, values, and beliefs would be outdated; however, it is not the most historically accurate film, to say the least. But from what I see, it's not aiming to be a historically accurate film.\n\nIn the end, Dilios's speech makes it is made clear what \"300\" is: a tale of courage and triumph. Butler's performance as Leonidas easily takes the cake as the best in the film. There's a sense of pride, strength, brotherhood, and courage in his own words and actions. He manifests who the Spartans truly are (at least in the film). And Bates's musical score is honestly pretty darn sick.\n\n\"300\" is a pretty cool and fun movie, and a bit more than that with its themes. I'd recommend it.",

Still, though, the action has you hooked and the worldbuilding leaves audiences desiring to see more.

            "content": "'300' is pretty much a perfect movie at doing what it does -- the caveat is that it doesn't really attempt much except be a unique and entertaining moviegoing experience.  The story is well-enough written but is ultimately very shallow, the themes are that of the most basic pulp comic or genre movie, the characters are charismatic but largely one-note and the world is oddly bleak yet gorgeous to look at.  This movie is, I believe, only the fourth movie to adopt the \"Only the actors and what they touch is real\" approach, previously only done in Casshern, Sky Captain and Sin City (in that order), and it makes EXCELLENT use of this.  The ability to combine performers into a large setpiece, via Post Production trickery, into a physical space that does not actually exist, is something that is always wonderful to look at when done correctly and done in service of the narrative, and 300 is still a great looking movie today.  It's also immensely satisfying from a Cathartic Action Movie perspective, as there are many moments you want to cheer the heroes on when the going gets tough.  And it ends on a fantastic note that goes from bleak to outright inspirational.  The problem, really, is that the movie is ultimately surface-level -- it's fun as hell, it's stunning from both technical and artistic perspectives, and it's emotionally satisfying, but it's also very basic, and if you aren't into this kind of (Ultra) Larger Than Life action movie, then I recommend you stay away.",

            "content": "I'm really glad I watched this movie after growing up. I learnt about this movie as a kid when I watched the Deadliest Warrior episode, Spartan vs Ninja. They told about how Spartans were made famous with 300, so I thought I should definitely give it a try. I didn't even start watching it as a kid, since I found it so boring in the first five minutes. And I'm glad that I did, because this movie has a lot of things the 10 year old me would have hated to see. And as an adult those very things are what I like to see in this.\n\nSimple review: This movie is metal. Yeah, that's all I could say about it. The grim tone, the bleak colour palette, the narration going on in the background which made it sound so melodramatic, the whole depiction of Persia in itself, the amount of slow motion violence - all of this is too much to handle for simple audience. For someone like me who is a big fan of Zack Snyder's style of cinematography, this is fantastic. Such movies give the feeling of those grim looking paintings which I love to see and feel nostalgic.\n\nThe thing about this movie is, it's not relying on the storytelling. The story is absolutely simple - The Spartan king Leonidas refused to bow before Persia and even killed their messengers. So now Persia is coming to crush them with their 10000 soldiers and beasts. Leonidas fights them back by handpicking 300 of his men. That's it. This is the story. And now they fight, which is the epic part. Like I said, as a kid I'd have hated it, and that's exactly what I'm talking about - the Spartans are completely naked and wearing red capes while the Persian Immortals are wearing black, and the Spartans kill them. They also kill the animals like rhinos, elephants and horses. These are why I'd have hated this movie as a kid.\n\nThere are many other things that this movie showed that I'd have hated as a kid, and these reasons are the same as any other family audience (I mentioned the reasons which were only specific to me before). The sex scenes, the slow pacing, the handicapped man whom Leonidas didn't let fight (I forgot his name), Xerxes and his army's camp with a goat man and weird stuff happening (people may not hate it, they'll just not get it). In the end it's told that all of this was just a story to motivate the soldiers. This is the reason why the story was demonising the Persians and portraying the Spartans as the heroes.\n\nThe thing about Zack Snyder's movies is that you can really enjoy them if you rewatch them. Because then you'd already know the story and you can just focus on how cool everything is looking. It's a pity everyone I know whom I can recommend this movie has already watched it, but at the same time it makes me feel nice about how popular this movie is. It literally made Spartans into a pop culture icon. If Leonidas were to somehow come back and see how this movie has portrayed him, he'd be really proud.",

Zach Snyder's visually based war film is his career defining film, which helped launch his career to the next level, is a movie that is designed mainly for visual viewing. 300 is not historically accurate, or even meant to be. What it is is a movie that is purely meant to showcase the carnage and graphic nature of the Spartans fighting in the respective war that is presented in the film. Based on the iconic graphic novel by Frank Miller, the movie follows the Spartans as they prepare their 300 soldiers to fight in their last war. As they do so, we see the tensions and mentality of the warriors. Snyder showcases his soon to be iconic visual style through this film. Though he debuted with Dawn Of The Dead, this film is the one that really showed the director that he would end up becoming. His flair and ability to get some really great shots is fully showcased in this movie. Gerard Butler is iconic in the role as the leader of the Spartans. Its quite sad that he never was able to sustain his popularity after this film, as he had great screen presence and poise as the lead in the film. Definitely one of the better graphic novel adaptations in recent years, and quite possibly Snyder's best film.",

Good acting and story, even if the writer and director took a lot of liberty to add weird elements. Gerald Butler having a Scottish accent in Sparta is weird but oddly works super well and just makes his speeches more epic. Just an epic movie that does more right than wrong.",

            "content": "The film is about 300 Spartans against the overwhelming odds of the Persian Empire. Persians want to take over the Greek lands, led by God-King Xerxes. They started to land on the Greek beaches, but, King Leonidas of Sparta met them with his best 300 warriors. The reason for this is that the Oracle said that Sparta could not go to war during a religious festival. So the 300 warriors were classed as Leonidas personal bodyguards.\nWhen the Spartans meet the Persians in the first fight no Spartan died, they slaughtered the Persians and the survivors were forced to go off the cliff, as quoted, \"they were thirsty for water\". The massive Persian army used archers to \"block out the sun\", original information from Herodotus rendition of the battle. The Persians also used their elite troops called \"immortals\", which King Leonidas said \u2018\"let's put that to the test\", these troops cause Spartan deaths. The Persians also used their, magic, elephants and rhinos, and mutant humans to try and kill the Spartans. Xerxes was not pleased with his generals and killed them by cutting their heads off.\nEphialites betrayed his country for gold by telling God-King Xerxes of a path around the Spartans to trap them. The Persians surround the Spartans, King Leonidas first of all kneeled down to Xerxes, but Leonidas got up and threw his spear which grazed Xerxes mouth. Xerces couldn't believe that his blood was spilt and it was red like a normal man's blood not golden like a God. All of the Spartans got slaughtered by the Persian archer's arrows. However, before the fight King Leonidas let Herodotus go back Sparta so he could tell the story.\nLike in Herodotus tale the film is the same, bigging up the story of the 300 Spartans. The film does this by making the animals and the beats from the east considerably larger then in real life. It also does this by, making Xerxes being taller then he actually he is, they made him out to be a massive seven foot God King. The immortal elite Persian soldiers were actually mortal but they looked like goblins and mutants to make them bad. Ephialites is shown as a very goblin like Voldemort (from Harry Potter) turtle back man, when really he was potentially a man who betrayed the Greeks. This is how the film represents Herodotus story. \nIn my opinion, it was good but there was not enough battle scenes, it waffled on too much. It could have had longer and more gory battles, were you actually get to see intestines come out. I rate the film six out of ten. I would recommend people who are in to history to watch it, as I think it follows the story that Herodotus told. I don't think we'll ever know the complete true story of what happened.",

My biggest complaint with 300 would be the terrible visual effects that are present in every scene. Almost nothing is real and none of the effects look good. The edits in post to the colouration/contrast ruin the otherwise decent cinematography. In places the cinematography is actually solid  - such as the zooming in and out using two cameras with different lenses for some of the fighting shots. However, the visual effects and editing unfortunately make this film feel like it was done on a very tight budget. Some of the props look fake as well. There was even more botched editing with the villain's voice that was blatantly tweaked to make it sound deeper. The cast was impressive, but the acting was average although Gerard Butler, Michael Fassbender, and some of the other Spartan soliders did a decent job. The plot was fine although I didn't like the introduction or any of the narration - the introduction could have been much better, and narration shouldn't have been used. Some of the dialogue wasn't great, and the film could have been shorter. It didn't come across as historically accurate, but it probably got some things right. I really didn't get the use of the deformed people and why King Xerxes was portrayed the way he was. 300 has a lot of problems and frankly deserves a lower rating than 3/5.",

It isn't the most historically accurate pic out there, and it even incorporates some elements of fantasy and Greek mythology. But that actually gives the movie a nice little spin to it. And while the characters are pretty thinly written, Gerald Butler from the future Law Abiding Citizen (2009) gives a memorable lead performance. And you can obviously tell that it's based off shot for shot of a comic book, the green screen gives it a certain, original and even artistic looking style. And you can't forget to mention the brutal, gritty and violent action scenes of its battlefields. Overall, 300 is an interesting look at ancient Greek society and a historically big battle, and especially for war film fans, this one is recommended!!",

Abit over the top, as you would expect it to be. Its exciting, exhilarating, and graphic. Some stylish fight scenes and great commentary. Its basically a graphic novel on the screen. The historical inaccuracies dont really take anything away from the story. Like the depiction of the Persians as being more monster then man. The immortals as wearing black and face masks. Which isnt accurate. The immortals look like they use Japanese Wakasashi. Which is a type of steel age sword that hasn't even been invented yet. All in all, it's a good film. Give it a watch. \n\nPersian emissary- \"Our arrows will blot out the sun!\" \n\nSpartan warrior: Then we will fight in the shade",

The action was fun, the dialogue was good, and the CGI was classic comic-book style. Now, this isn't completely accurate, Spartans didn't have six packs or were completely hairless from the neck down. And you can clearly tell that some of them had British accents. Aside from that, the movie did bring joy to my dad and I which was nice, and there was definitely memorable dialogue choices and action scenes.

The violence and the fighting is not my cup of tea and still I couldn't get enough of 300. I think that says something about just how good this movie really is. It's not all fighting either and has a really interesting side story going on. Even the fighting scenes I loved because how can you not love something that badass?! I loved the bits of humor they incorporated into such a serious situation. Gerard Butler was meant to play this role and it shows in a big way.

Persian armies were the moat powerfull armies in that time.we had a thing which no empire has;we had \"Tradition\" like Egyptions. We had Darius and Cyrus. Cyrus wrote the very first human rights law named \"Cyrus Cylinder\". How come an empire who has noticed human rights and they never ever attacked  innocent people and wives and children can be called monster? Why persian army are like the winter in game of thrones!?? We werent monsters or wizards we were the ones who taught people how to be great.maybe nowadays we have some politic problems and I completly accept the fact that Qajar dynasty was the worst dynasty ever and they lost half of our country because of their laziness and lust or any other damn reasons.

So, coming back and watching this movie 7 years later I was extremely surprised by the fact that I actually enjoyed watching this movie. The jokes in the movie actually had me laughing, and the honor that the Greeks possessed had me flabbergasted. The characters were brutal, and the movie was extremely gory, but the fighting was amazing. The first ten minutes of the movie may have been a little slow, but afterwards the movie picked up and never really slowed down again. I was never bored and I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone looking for a good fighting movie, as long as they don't mind watching people lose their heads every ten minutes.",

Plus, it's easier to enjoy a Zack Snyder film if you're not in it for complexity and anyway, this was back during his glory days before \"MARTHA\". With quotable lines, well-conducted music, visual thrills, awesome battle sequences and stylishly made, 300 kept me so thrilled throughout that I forgave its racist depictions of Persians in 480 B.C.. Gerard Butler is perfect for the role of King Leonidas who guides his men to battle and offers encouraging advice for their battles. And there's also that killer remix which constantly appears on YouTube. Anyone remember the This is Sparta remix from a couple of years ago? I miss those days. So, as long as you aren't easily disgusted by the sight of blood, can manage to look past its somewhat racist approach and are in it for a fun action-packed ride with tons of visual splendor and aren't expecting a history lesson, 300 is a thrilling experience that just might go down in history as director Zack Snyder's best film to date...although the only other movies of his I've seen are Man of Steel and BvS. 300 is not a bad movie, just relax, sit back and enjoy the show.",

The story is loosely accurate historically and my pet peeves with it revolve around how accurate. The Spartans in reality would have been wearing chest and leg armor which is what made them so hard to kill against lightly armed  Persians. But of course armor gets in the way of physique. There were 5000 Greek forces by all accounts, including 100 Spartan slaves,  of which 300 were the elite Spartan core that stayed and sacrificed itself on the last day as a final delaying action. Not including the slaves is a missed opportunity meant to glorify the Spartans more than they deserved. While the immortals were the Persian elite forces, they were called that due to the fact that whenever a division got destroyed in battle the Persian King would immediately reconstitute it back home. If you like a thrilling action movie done in an epic style, good memorable dialogue, a war movie with lots of graphic violence, immersion into an ancient historical setting, and a reasonable plot with some thought provoking content then I strongly recommend this movie.",

            "content": "In 479 BC, one year after the famed Battle of Thermopylae, Dilios, a hoplite in the Spartan Army, begins his story by depicting the life of Leonidas (Gerard Butler) I from childhood to kingship via Spartan doctrine. Dilios's story continues and Persian messengers arrive at the gates of Sparta demanding \"earth and water\" as a token of submission to King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro); the Spartans reply by killing and kicking the messengers into a well. Leonidas then visits the Ephors, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the Hot Gates; his plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea. The Ephors consult the Oracle, who decrees that Sparta will not go to war during the Carneia. As Leonidas angrily departs, a messenger from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support. Although the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta's army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal bodyguard; they are joined along the way by Arcadians. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall made up of stones and slain Persian scouts as mortar, angering the Persian Emissary. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders him to go back to the Persian lines and warn Xerxes after cutting off his whipping arm. Meanwhile, Leonidas encounters Ephialtes, a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain infanticide. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas' army, warning him of a secret (goat) path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough; potentially compromising the phalanx formation, and Ephialtes is enraged. The battle begins soon after the Spartans' refusal to lay down their weapons. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, plus their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave upon wave of the advancing Persian army. During a lull in the battle, Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender, offering him wealth and power in exchange for his allegiance; Leonidas declines and mocks Xerxes for the inferior quality of his fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the Immortals, later that night. Despite some Spartans being killed, they heroically defeat the Immortals (with slight help from the Arcadians). On the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian city-states, including war elephants, to crush the Spartans once and for all, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, and (especially) a uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes' betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened, a \"tale of victory\"...\n\nSince its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, in front of 1,700 audience members, 300 has received generally mixed reviews. While it received a standing ovation at the public premiere, it was panned at a press screening hours earlier, where many attendees left during the showing and those who remained booed at the end. Some of the most unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers. A.O. Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as \"about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid,\" while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans, declaring that the Persian characters are \"pioneers in the art of face-piercing\", but that the Spartans had access to \"superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities\". Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that \"unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated.\" Roger Ebert, in his review, gave the film a two-star rating, writing, \"300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud.\" Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical, such as film critic Robby Eksiel, who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the \"digital action\" but irritated by the \"pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters.\" Variety's Todd McCarthy describes the film as \"visually arresting\" although \"bombastic\" while Kirk Honeycutt, writing in The Hollywood Reporter, praises the \"beauty of its topography, colors and forms.\" Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Richard Roeper acclaims 300 as \"the Citizen Kane of cinematic graphic novels.\" Empire gave the film 3/5 having a verdict of \"Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy's paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance.\" 300 was also warmly received by websites focusing on comics and video games. Comic Book Resources' Mark Cronan found the film compelling, leaving him \"with a feeling of power, from having been witness to something grand.\" IGN's Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as a cinematic visionary and \"a possible redeemer of modern moviemaking.\" With \"300\" Zack Snyder began his journey into visionary filmmaking where he used green screens and effects in a very efficient and stunning ways. In some cases if really works (\"Watchmen\", \"Man of Steel\", \"Batman vs Superman\") while in other cases it doesn\u00b4t (\"300\", \"Sucker Punch\"). \"300\" was built from Frank Miller\u00b4s graphic novel with historic events as the base and Zack Snyder has tried to put you as a viewer literally into the cartoon frames within the graphic novel and visually it works for the most. But, when Snyder has a less fleshed out script with very one-dimensional caricatures and characters he simply can\u00b4t manage to engage you and everything becomes pompous, over acted with ridiculous and silly clich\u00e9 phrases as the red thread throughout the movie. You cringe when Gerard Butler screams \"This is Sparta!\"... Yes, it is based on something cartoony, but as Snyder showed in his adaptation of the fantastic graphic novel \"Watchmen\" if he has a solid storyline with depth he can succeed into making a graphic novel into something truly enjoyable and fantastic. \"300\" is a visual feast with great art direction and cinematography, but as said with such a bland script and development this can only be a disappointment. Trivia: The movie never claims to be historically correct, something which is addressed at length in the documentary The 300: Fact or Fiction? (2007) on the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. The movie is based heavily on Frank Miller's 1998 comic book mini-series, also entitled \"300\". In the documentary Miller openly admits that he made many radical changes to the history and director Zack Snyder admits to making further changes. Snyder states that he was more concerned with making a film which would appeal to a wider audience, and creating an exciting and visually stunning action movie rather than a typical historical epic. Indeed, he further points out that the film is a subjective narration by Dillios (David Wenham) in an effort to spur his men, and as such, the narrative cannot be trusted as historically accurate or wholly objective. Snyder acknowledges that Dillios is not a man to allow truth get in the way of a good story, and that the point of the depiction is that it is specifically the Spartan perspective of the battle. In particular, Snyder cites the depiction of the Immortals. The Immortals were a real battalion, but they weren't demons, they were just ordinary men. However, in Dillios' narration, it is much more dramatic and heroic if the 300 fought off the attack of 10,000 demons rather than 10,000 men. As both Miller and Snyder argue, the film is not a realist piece. In an effort to get the studio executives to commit to making the movie, Zack Snyder and his team scanned every image from Frank Miller's graphic novel into a computer. They then removed all of the dialogue and descriptive prose, and added simple animation to each frame (such as burning fire, moving clouds, sparkling eyes etc.). They then edited these shots together into what amounted to an animated comic strip, and Snyder hired his friend Scott Glenn to record a voice-over narration for the piece. Snyder brought the film to Warner Bros., but they said they needed more to convince them that the movie could work. As such, he decided to shoot a live-action 'test' - a 90-second 360-degree continuous shot featuring a single Spartan killing several Persians. The combination of the animated comic images and the test convinced Warner Bros. that Snyder and his team were capable of making the movie. An extract from the animation as well as the entire test can be found as an Easter egg on disc 1 of the 2-Disc special edition DVD of the film.",

Everybody knows about this film, whether it be the visuals, and the action scenes, and of course, that famous meme. So as for Zack Snyder's first comic book adaptation, 300 is really pretty sweet to watch. It feels like an epic film that's going all out and make it grand, which it really works. The acting is great, with Gerard Butler acting the most intimidating out there that convinces me that he's definitely the leader of the Spartans. The visual effects look really cool, and it's something that I never seen like that. The score by Tyler Bates sounds bad *bleep* that it brings in more of the epic tone to this film. The action scenes are exciting to watch, and the writing by Zack Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael B. Gordon definitely makes it feel like a man's film, but it's makes them get excited and start making war cry too. The only aspect that didn't make this film a five star, is the characterization of it. While I know enough about Gerard Butler's character, I didn't get to know about the other characters that when some of them die, they make it a big deal which didn't affect me as I barely knew anything the people who die. With that said, I surprisingly enjoyed 300 a lot more than I thought, and would watch the sequel if I got the chance to see it.",

            "content": "I have always been fascinated by the ancient tales and myths of the Greek culture.  They were talented, sophisticated story-tellers, who knew how to use humor, drama, moral lessons, and irony to craft interesting stories.  Among these is the Battle of Thermopylae, which is not a myth, but a true story of the Persian invasion of Greece, and how 300 Spartans fought off a significant portion of the Persian army before ultimately dying.  This is the basis of \"300\".\n\nUnfortunately, \"300\" takes very few cues from the actual story.  \"300\" is a complete reimagining of the Battle of Thermopylae.  These are not the historical Spartans.  Director Zack Snyder is so concerned with making the Spartans out to be bad asses that he completely mischaracterizes the Greeks, turning them into arrogant, muscle-bound warriors.  Likewise, the depiction of the Persians is not accurate.  The Greeks described the Persians as barbaric heathens, and the film's idea of a barbarian is kind of racist.  Additionally, there are many supernatural elements, transforming this Greek legend into a gritty, B-action movie.\n\nBut I suppose that is all a part of Zack Snyder's style.  Also part of Snyder's style are the excessive use of slow motion, over-the-top action, and lots of violence and gore.  While all of these do nothing to help the film, Snyder's unique use of lighting and visuals is one the redeeming qualities of this film.  This is a very cool-looking and visually pleasing film, if nothing else.\n\nAs I said before, the Greeks were talented story-tellers.  Zack Snyder, on the other hand, is a so-so story-teller.  Though most of the film is slow-mo action and shirtless hunks, the impressive visuals, a passable performance by Gerard Butler, and a decent amount of good drama make \"300\" an alright watch.",

In the mist of the blood and the carnage, with the music pumping, it's hard not to get swept up by the action.  And, the rousing speeches about fighting for freedom and honor are inspiring.  Also, the powerhouse performances of Gerard Butler and Lena Headey bring a lot of charisma to the film.  But Miller screws things up by mixing fantasy creatures into this gritty war tale; and the makeup effects are rather gruesome.  There's also some needless sexual gratuity.  While 300 is amazingly powerful, it's also uneven and overproduced at times.",

In fact, the allusions to this story from the Sin City comic book were removed from its movie version no doubt because this film was coming down the pike. But regardless, we're not here to discuss how well the movie holds up to history, since it was obviously never anybody's intention to tell an accurate story. Miller's work is very stylized and the movie grabs some of that, and just as Sin City was a hyper-noir in a stylized world, Zack Snyder and his crew make a similar bit with this film. It's not real. It's not meant to be real. It's supposed to be a sort of hyper-fantastical sword and sandals piece, so you can believe in giant ogres with axes and crazed war rhinos and shit. If you can buy into the world, you can roll with the story.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the world is pretty well executed, apart from some glaring Gladiator references--and I can't for the life of me decide if they were homages or ripoffs. What is it with wheat, anyway? Regardless, with the addition of a CG wolf at the beginning that doesn't look quite like a wolf should, it's fairly obvious we're in story-land, or some very violent county of it, so pretty much anything odd can be chucked out the window as long as the story keeps our attention. And it does, though I'll be perfectly frank: there's not a lot of story to be had here. I mean, let's face it: it's The Perfect Storm with spears. If you know your history, you know what's going to happen, so there's an added handicap (how do we care about characters when we know from jump-start that they're going to bite it?) And let's face something else to that once the attack starts, it's pretty much wave after wave of attackers and blood flying and shit like that. And...that's all. Granted, they try and step up the attacks so there's always something interesting to watch happening on the screen, but it's easy to see why a B-story of what's happening back home was added in to try and give us something between gory smackdowns. Still, the smackdowns are not just gory, but gorgeous. They're operatic in scale and treatment and the battle scenes are balletic in how the Spartans disembowel folks. I know that sounds nuts, but it works. It's hard to bring to mind a violent film like this where the violence was so stylized. It seems perfectly natural to watch heads and limbs soar through the air. \r\n\r\nIt's a film that's full of violence and testosterone, but that is what we were promised. You should know what you are getting into.",

Some people say it is not precise to the history but to justify how it is precisely based on the historical facts is not the only way to enjoy the war movie. We should rather appreciate an general idea of Spartan soldiers which the war movie projects. I have no idea how much we can trace the history in that era but it is a step forward for me to have the projection.",

The Persians, generally, are all people of color and are depicted as monsters who are sexually perverse and diseased. This is orientalist racism as it's finest.  There are no girls or older women.  No woman appearing in this film was allowed to keep her clothes on--there is a display of nubile breasts on a regular basis throughout the film.  Gorgo (the wife of Leonidas) is known throughout history for her strength and wisdom, but in this film, the director imagines her getting raped.  That she gets her (again imaginary) revenge on the perp is no remedy and has nothing to do with the plot at all.  As a fan of Zizek, it's embarrassing to me that he saw fit to write two whole pages about this film--in order to make it something other than dumb, you really have to squint and do some mental origami (which is something Zizek is good at, I allow).",

Basically, the Persian Empire is threatening to conquer Greece, so King Leonidas of the Spartans chooses his 300 best men to accompany him to fight the Persians. You should know that all of the 300 die in the end. It's not much of a spoiler. The point of the sacrifice was to show the rest of Greece that the only way to stop the Persians was to unite all of Greece. \n\nI thought that 300 was a good action movie that is entertaining and has a good script. Many people complain about the unrealistic monsters in it, but the events are being shown as they were told on the account of Spartans in an exaggerated way. \n\nThis movie was shot mostly behind a green screen, which for the most part looked fine. It has a lot of special effects added. \n\nThe acting is also very good. Gerard Butler is awesome as Leonidas, and all of the 300 are great.\n\nThis is not for kids. There is a lot of violence, blood, and bodies. There is also some female nudity in it.\n\nOverall, 300 was a fun movie that did what it was made to do and entertained audiences.",

            "content": "The Furious 300\n\tHistory of the Spartans tells a story who guarded their land by the Persians from conquering. The Persians had an outrageous number of warriors fighting a few hundred Spartans. These Spartans were able to fight until it resulted in their own death. One Spartan can kill five to ten Persians. This was an extraordinary story of how the Spartans defend their people and homeland. This story was created into a movie called 300 that was released in March 9 2007. 300 is a well develop sensational movie that uses specific details in different areas to help craft the movie which is the animation, violence, time, voice, appearance and color.\n\tThe animation in the movie 300 looked very realistic, creatures that were created through a computer. These creatures having human body parts except for their faces that look devilish. There is even a giant that didn't look human. This giant that stand seven to eight feet tall, scars on his body that human bodies couldn't survive from. There was bumps coming out on different sides of his head, as if it look like he was beaten with a metal bar. I thought it was very impressive on their skills on these fictional characters being brought in to the story, to bring as much entertainment to the audience watching this movie. This brought my attention to the creative and detail characters they made in the movie. \n\tViolence was the most important part of the movie for me, showing the events of war. They show amazing fighting skills, when the Spartans use their spears to pierce the Persians in their chest and limbs. The blood was very little in my opinion throughout the whole movie. I think the movie could have showed more blood for the body parts that was being lost in the fight scenes. I was expecting to see the floor filled with blood with the amounts of dead bodies that was piling up. There is a scene where there is a wall of dead bodies but doesn't show blood falling down from them. I think they should have at least put more red paint on the bodies, it would have seem more realistic. The scars on the Spartans should of have seen like dry blood with a lot of air it had been exposed to, but it all look like clean cuts. \n\tThe length of the movie that I was expecting was about two and half to three hours long. This can explain every detail of the movie and won't rush this extraordinary historical story. The actual length of the movie is exactly 117 minutes, about two hours long. The movie was rush in certain areas of the movies, like the expressions on the citizens faces in Sparta finding out what has happened to their warriors. This movie could have been expanded around forty minutes covering the expressions and emotions with the people reactions to the dramatic disaster in a bloody war.  They could have shown the reactions to all the Spartan wife's, finding out their husbands have died in war. The movie could have been longer, to show how the Spartans was able to eat on their long trip. The Spartans hunting down animals to survive their trip to war against the Persians.\n\tVoice of the Spartans and Persians were very noticeable throughout the whole movie. I was looking for the tone of their voice and loudness. The Spartans spoke the loudest with a deep tone that sounds like a lion's roar. This showed their aggressiveness and confidence, making it seem like they will destroy the Persians with their army. The Spartans was not scared and showed their courage against an enormous army that can determine their faith. It felt like the Persians were little ants and the Spartans were the tide waves of the deep ocean that are going to wipe the Persians away from land ending them in death.  The voice of the Spartans was very clear and loud compared to the Persians. The Persians voice sounds like whispers, as if they were frightened of the dark. I thought the voice was excellent and was exactly what I was expecting from the movie.\n\tI was looking at the appearance of the Spartans and Persians clothing. The swords, shields, helmets, and body armors is what I was looking for. This shows how fierce the battle is going to be. The clothing of the Spartans was only a spear, shield, and a helmet with no body armor. This showed me their confidence in fighting against to the Persians, it seem like they didn't wear armor with their great fighting skills. The Spartans confidence showed that they didn't feel intimidated. The Persians had a full load of armor on their entire body, covering almost every piece of skin. They had every piece of great quality equipment compared to the Spartans. I look at this as if the Persians were scared, even with the large amounts of warriors.\n\tDifferent colors have many different meanings; I think the movie 300 showed this a lot with the characters.  The two main colors that were mostly shown throughout the movie were red, and gold. Red means anger, danger, and much more. This represents the Spartans with their red clothing, they were very deadly, sending death to numerous of Persians. The Spartans were filled with anger with the Persians trying to conquer Sparta. Gold means quality, wealth, and have much more meaning. The king of Persia wears lots of gold covering his body. This represent the king living wealthy, having everything he wanted. The quality of his army weapons and shields was excellent, looking like the metal can't be pierce so easily. The colors meaning of the movie 300 was perfect in representing the characters.\n\tI think overall the movie 300 should be seen by everyone who is interested in history. I think this movie is a must see, It received great ratings from the critics. This movie shows excellent animations and violence throughout the entire movie. The voice and appearance of these Spartan warriors is outrageous and shows a huge difference compared to the Persians. The colors were very great in what the characters symbolize. The time of the movie was a little short, which should have been extended longer. This movie overall is incredible. You will be amazed and surprised after seeing this remarkable movie.",

            "content": "300 I found to be an entertaining timewaster, as well as fun eye-candy.  Zach Snyder may not be the best in terms of story and plot but I can always count on him when it comes to great action and great visuals.  He also does some great music here and there.  While he is not good at coming up with his own unique stories, he is great when it comes to adapting other people's work.  I am not familiar with the comic by Frank Millar, but from what I hear the movies follows it fairly accurately.  For what 300 was I was entertained.  \nThe story is fairly simple.  It takes place at the time of ancient Greece.  The Persians have declared war on Greece.  A messenger is sent to Sparta to join them but they refuse.  Now a group of 300 Spartans led by their king, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), must fend off the Persian army to prevent them from reaching Sparta.\nThe style and the action is what drives this film.  If you are looking for a deep film with deep character then look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a historically accurate film then look elsewhere.  Even though this was a historical event this film is based on a comic first-of-all.  This film relies on its mindless action, special effects, and style to carry it.  I found the style enjoyable because I had not seen many films with this style before this.  The action scenes were really good as well.  I even like the slow motion.  Many people dislike slow motion but I did not mind it too much.  The film also gets very bloody.  If you do not like bloody films then do not see this.\nThe problem is that most of the cast is easily forgettable.  The only somewhat likable character that you remember is Leonidas.  He is definitely the character everyone is drawn to and Gerard Butler does a good job performance-wise.  However, I did not care for any of the other characters which is a problem.  Another thing that got on my nerves was the fake CGI blood.  None of the gore in this is practical and it takes me out of the film.  Also, the villains are very one-dimensional.\nOverall, 300 is style over substance but I found myself entertained.  If you are looking more an entertaining action film with good visuals then you should enjoy this.  If you are looking for more than you could probably skip this.  Also, If you hate slow motion or CGI gore you should not see this either.",

            "content": "Nowadays we get a lot of movies that remind us that war is terrible and that ultimately, it is just an exercise in futility. Not Zack Snyder's \"300\" though. This film, based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley tells us that war is awesome and that there is no greater glory than to die on the battlefield, waist-deep in the blood and severed limbs of your fallen opponents. The story begins in 480 B.C., in tiny Greece, the birthplace of democracy and the one true example of freedom and justice is the Sparta, the city where the world's greatest warriors are not trained, they're bred. Witness the glory of ancient Greece's Sparta; where children are taken from their mothers and turned into ruthless warriors, where women are just as tough as men, where there is no greater glory than to die on the battlefield, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a spineless coward. The people of Sparta are proud and arrogant, but skilled tacticians and warriors. It's no surprise then, that when the \"god-King\" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) approaches the king of Sparta, Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and demands his surrender, the Greek lord refuses. Forbidden to wage war because of ancient traditions, Leonidas leads a small regiment of 300 \"bodyguards\" to a strategic location where they stand a chance against the army of Xerxes, who brings with him innumerable soldiers.\nPeople criticize this movie for all kinds reasons, some of which legitimate, some of which I say are uncalled for because they're intentional. The lack of historical accuracy, the cartoonish characters, the demonization of the Persian people are put in the film because of the context in which the story is told. This film is based on a graphic novel, inspired by another movie, based on a monument, which is itself a replacement for an even older moment, written by the victors of an epic battle. On top of that, the story, within itself is told from the viewpoint of a storyteller who saw firsthand the vicious battles and is now informing the audience (within the film and in the theatre) of the glory of Sparta, of the 300 and of Leonidas to encourage them to fight. The heroic Leonidas is depicted as a master tactician, a ruthless warrior, a gentle father and a loving husband. He is capable of scaling cliffs with only his bare hands and sandals, capable of single-handedly butchering hundreds of Persian warriors and answers to no one, while still remaining within the constraints of the sacred laws of his country. Who is he opposed against? Xerxes, the complete opposite. Xerxes is a man who forcefully distances himself from the rest of the people by clothing himself in gold and proclaiming himself a god. Xerxes is a tyrant, looking to burn tiny Greece to the ground with an army of slaves he sends into battle by force or fear. The warriors Xerxes sends are either amateurish brawlers, reliant on mysticism and \"cowardly tactics\" (like using projectile weapons) or grotesque monstrosities, raised out of hell to combat against their noble opponents. In fact, anyone who opposes Leonidas, his wife Queen Gorgo (Leana Heady) or the noble Spartans are all the most obvious, slimy and disgusting villains you will see on screen. There is little subtlety in this film, but it's a piece of ancient propaganda, what else do you expect? The characters are either developed only at the barest minimum or painted with the broadest strokes. The good guys are good and can only do wrong when their actions would serve the plot, while the villains are truly despicable. \nThis movie bears only the faintest bit of historical accuracy. Think of the film more like the battle between the noble people of Rohan and the fearsome Uruk-hai in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" than something out of a museum. This is historical fantasy, a violent exercise in masculinity that screams \"War is awesome!\" So, on that note, where does it stand? Well visually, the film is really spectacular. Every shot in the film has been enhanced to show off the earthy tones of stones and fields or the gushing blood as it is spilled. During nightime, the moon is enormous, filling half the sky so that we can have Leonidas dramatically poses in front of it as he reflects on the battle to come. When it rains, there is always clapping thunder and crackling lightning to show that even while his other warriors cheer, King Leonidas keeps his mind focussed on the war to come. There are always dramatic shadows and loving shots of the characters in action so that the audience can see all of their epic battle moves. The film uses tons of visual effects and it shows. Even if you're not familiar with the colour theory at work here, with the denaturisation of some scenes and the different tints and uses of contrast to create moods, it's still impressive. Often, the battle scenes are in slow motion, lavishly displaying limbs being hacked off, Persians being skewered and crimson splashes of blood flying at the camera. The choreography is excellent and the camera catches every bit of wanton violence. The film is extremely gratuitous in its violence and even in its few moments of sex.\nThis is a man's movie and it takes itself dead serious, sometimes to a fault. There are some moments where Leonidas and the other Spartans crack jokes, but this is a movie that is actually kind of silly. It's just so over-the-top that I find it hard to understand why people get upset over it. I mean sure the Persians depicted in the film employ grotesque ogres, fanged ninja warriors and a slew of deformed or simply bizarre concubines in order to satisfy any and every perverse fantasy Xerxes, but the Greeks aren't that much better. The Greek villains are shown as cowardly or just as despicable as the Persian generals and our heroes are so arrogant that they come off more as bullies than heroes and it's only because we are naturally drawn to the underdog that we actually end up cheering for them. I don't want to spoil the developments towards the end, but really take a look at the villainous Greeks and tell me if they are not just as vile as the Persians. Anyone who isn't Leonidas and his 300 Spartans are simply the worst people ever. Even the other Greeks who join them in their fight end up looking like real amateurs when it comes to the combat and are frequently made fun of. Once again, this film wants you to believe that Spartans are awesome and anyone else is else going to end up on the wrong end of their spear of quietly awing them in the distance. That's what it wants to do, that's what it does.\nWhen I first saw this film, I was 19 years old and it blew my teenage mind. This was everything I wanted because you know what? It HAD dawned on me that in a world where anyone can just pick up a gun, point and pull a trigger, that war just isn't what it used to be, when good guys were noble and the villains were invading barbarians bent on razing temples to the ground and pillaging noble examples of classic architecture. Wouldn't it be much better if we could all go back to the days where you had to thrust a sword into somebody's gut and watch their life slowly drain from their eyes, rather than just press buttons on a computer and watch monitors tell us that the targets were dead? This was exactly what I wanted; a hardcore, live-action cartoon where the bad guys were monsters and the good guys cut them into tiny pieces, despite overwhelming odds. Now that I've \"matured\" a bit and that some of the razamataz of the storyline has faded, I admit that the movie really could have used stronger characters and a deeper plot. I liked the fact that Queen Gorgo gets more screen time and they show what was going on in the city politics while Leonidas is out (something that is not in the original graphic novel). I also thought that while the character development of Leonidas and some of the more stand-out Spartans was small, it did get me to actually like them. I did wish there was more, but I was shocked to see that this movie was already 2 hrs long considering the thin plot so I guess there just wasn't much room for that. Despite the story that can be summarized in just a few sentences, the movie has many memorable moments and lines (probably the most iconic being near the beginning with the \"pit of doom\") and the film is so visually striking that it really sticks with you once it's over. This is not a great film, but it is a stylish film that manages to wrap you up and get really excited. It has a set of goals it wants to accomplish and because it doles exactly what it wants and because this is one of those movies that will be remembered for a long time, I am awarding it a 4 / 5. If you want a film that's ridiculously violent, bloody, filled with shinning heroes, despicable villains and so manly it almost becomes homo-erotic at times, there's nothing that can beat \"300\".

That should tell you enough as to the historical accuracy of this film. However, historical accuracy is clearly not the end game here. This is graphic novel that moves! It's an exercise in over the top stylish violence, and a bloody good one too.\n\nAs a purely visual spectacle, it doesn't get much better than this. Every scene looks like it was cast in polished bronze. It also moves well, using just the right amount slow motion during the battle scenes to highlight a killing strike or defensive move. The story is simple enough, but it also feels important. That's despite the fact most of the 'uber-buff' cast are half-naked for most of the film! But this isn't all muscle and no brains. If it was, 300 could have easily been unintentional hilarious! Fine performances from the cast, especially from Gerard Butler, bring an emotional weight to the film. This in turn makes it possible to look beyond the visuals, because you'll find this film has more to offer.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is very violent, but in a cartoonish way. More style than raw blood thirsty gore. That style inspired other productions such as the Spartacus TV series and the more recent (though terrible) Legend of Hercules. The plot is pretty simple and easy enough to process. This is mostly style over substance. But it's not totally devoid of substance. So if you are okay with that - enjoy!\n\nBest Format:\n\nIf a theater near you were screening this I'd certainly recommended you watch this on the big screen.

The story is (too?) simple: 300 half naked six-packed Spartan soldiers go to war against the invading and much larger army of the Persian king Xerxes. The whole film has a very likeable comic book feeling: the slow-motion fight scenes and the CGI blood spatters are cool. I also like the monstrous adversaries. In its cast we see Gerard Butler (Law Abiding Citizen), Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) and Rodrigo Santaro (I Love You Philip Morris). A sequel is momentary playing in the theatres. '300' is a guaranteed popcorn movie.  \n\nWhen the giant Persian king Xerxes (Santaro) invades Greece with his large army, Leonidas (Butler) who is king of Sparta assembles 300 of his well trained soldiers to join him into battle. Leaving his wife Gorgo (Headey) and son behind, Leonidas and his men head to the shore. There they meet Ephialtes, a hunchbacked exiled Spartan, who wants to join them, but is considered not fit enough. While the Spartans battle against the monstrous troops of Xerxes army, Ephialtes who feels hurt goes to the camp of the enemy to offer them his help...",

It seemed really uneasesary and that was a nother problem I had.  But the movie was pretty good and the ending was very good too.

Offended, Leonidas kills the messenger thus starting a war between Sparta and Persia, but Leonidas is negated to take the Spartan army to battle so he takes his best 300 soldiers to battle the gigantic Persian army. \nFrank Miller\u00b4s works have been the source material for numerous comic book films but almost all of them were executed terribly like \"Daredevil\" and the \"The Spirit\", to say some examples, but there a handful of enjoyable adaptations of his works like \"Sin City\" but \"300\" is right there in the middle. It counts with a fantastic choreography, a pretty interesting visual style, good looking battles, impressive, but obvious, CGI; good performances, some awesome and memorable moments, and provides a fun and entertaining experience. But 300 also counts with more than just a handful of problems: The story is straightforward but is nothing more than an excuse for the battles to happen (I know that an action film is not about story but knowing that Frank Miller served as the source material, I expected 300\u00b4s graphic novel would count with one of his typical dark and over the top stories), the dialog falls into absurdity in certain moments, it counts with one dimensional characters,  an annoying overuse of slow motion, it has the machismo vibe from the 80\u00b4s action films, the editing is confusing in the action scenes, the \"shot for shot\" idea for an adaptation is brilliant but the execution isn't as exciting as it sounded on paper because at times it's fun to watch and others its unnecessary and annoying; and while Snyder\u00b4s  heavy on special effects visual style is what makes 300 a memorable film, after some time becomes a distraction. \nZack Snyder managed to make another adequate film, 300 is a visually intriguing and entertaining film that despite its big failures, it still worth watching. Action and Frank Miller\u00b4s fans will definitely like it.",
