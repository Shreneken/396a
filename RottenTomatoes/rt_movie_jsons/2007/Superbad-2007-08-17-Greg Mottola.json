The scenes of them with the women were not the most realistic but the personalities of them were on spot. Riku and Samuel, as expected, were extremely gay at the end. One thing I really liked was the details, such as Riku having the exact same pants as in real life. Oskari also looked alike. Sami should have had more screen time because he is a big part in the real story. There were lots of women in the movie which I liked a lot. Overall it was a good movie with great realism and detail.",

Still very good though, brings the nostalgia hard. 8/10",

Two guys (Jonah Hill, Michael Cera) are graduating from high school and embark on an epic journey to secure alcohol for a grad party, hoping to have their way with the girls of their dreams when they arrive.  What separates Superbad from most movies of its kind are some fantastic set pieces (the iconic scene of McLovin at the liquor store, for example), a lot of crude but hilarious dialogue, and, most importantly, the fact that the two protagonists actually learn something about themselves over the course of their eventful evening.  Superbad has as many laugh-out-loud moments as any movie in recent memory.",

            "content": "I had A LOT of fun with \"Superbad\", and I'm not embarrassed to say this loud. I mean, I had fun with \"American Pie\" as well. Comedy is far from my favourite genre, but like everyone else, I love to see one when I want. And comedy is the easiest genre to review because it doesn't need to have either a talented cast or a plausible story, it only has to be funny. Only. That's the whole point (as I reviewed this film 8/10, it means 80% of the humour works). But as I touched on these two points, I will analyse them only because yes. Is the cast good? YES. Even though Jonah Hill is a lot older than Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Hill was 24, Cera was 19 and Mintz-Plasse was 18), he's passable as a desperate-to-sex newly adult. And he's hilarious, come on. Speaking about the two other guys, Michael Cera is the nerd one, and he fits perfectly the role, and McLovin, I mean, Fogell, I mean, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the soul of this project alongside Jonah. And is the story plausible? ABSOLUTELY NOT, this is possibly the most absurd plot I watched since \"Micmacs\", and the story escalates so fast that it's impossible not to be immersed. And Bill Hader and Seth Rogen are one of the best cop duos ever. Oh, and an honourable mention to Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone as Evan's and Seth's crushes. I would say something more here, but it would be a massive spoiler, so this review ends here. I should watch comedies more.",

Amazing how critics now can see the whole Rogan/Sandler/Apatow schtick as \u2018of its time' and say some movies couldn't be made in our more enlightened time now. They shouldn't have been made then, and you should've known it. It's not that these types of film can't be made - The Farrelly brothers took risks and trod a fine line, mostly successfully - but if it's ok to make dumb films for teenage boys, justifying and celebrating teenage boy behaviour, don't be surprised when some of those teenage boys grow up to be Weinsteins.",

Perhaps it's too sentimental for some fans, but that's exactly what makes the film work this time  around. Well written. Clerks II is without a doubt the Jeff Anderson show, which is on purpose.

The movie is full of cringe humor and ridiculous circumstance, it's essentially designed so the characters have a good story to tell later on, and it definitely meets the criteria.  The big problem is that it's a high school, \"let's get laid adventure\" starring 2 idiots and their idiot friend.  I've never seen 2 guys work so hard to prevent themselves from their actual goal.\n\nWhen you look a little closer too, it's really two movies wrapped around each other.  \"McLovin\" could have been its own movie, but neither story really has enough meat too it.  \"These high schoolers tried to get alcohol to impress girls for this party.\" is the whole movie, but it's so much more fun of an experience than that.\n\nYou're not going to get a rich and fulfilling story, though they try to make it into a life lesson in a traditional \"coming of age\" style, but it's a pretty funny movie, if a little over the top.",

But more importantly, it perfectly shows the fear we try to ignore, but inevitably must face, as we prepare to embark with that first step on the road to adulthood. Actually Stephen King may have summed it up best in that great little story he wrote called \"The Body\" (which became the movie \"Stand By Me\"), when at the end we flash forward to one of the young protagonists as a now middle aged adult, as he's reflecting on that particular period in his life, long gone to many years - \"Friends come in and out of your life...I never had any friends later on like the ones I had (when I was a kid)...Jesus, does anybody?\" And no matter how old one gets, or what generation those pubescent boys grow up in, and what year THEY inevitably become middle aged, I think that answer will always be a resounding \"NO\". This movie encapsulates that to perfection.",

Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse have impeccable chemistry with one another and their deft interplay really lends to the realism of these teens. Far too often in teen movies it is clear that much older writers had far too heavy a hand in crafting the dialogue, which is generally clunky and unrealistic. I, and likely many other viewers around my age, felt that these were just like the kids I went to school with. We joked around the same way, in the same manner, and had many of the same struggles. The film manages to balance the realism of the teens with the absurdity of their night out on the town. Their reactions always felt genuine despite the increasingly chaotic circumstances they were put in. The humor was fantastic, a credit to the writing prowess of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. The awkward moments were surprisingly lighthearted and easy, due largely in part to the actor's terrific performances, solid directing, and excellent writing. Overall, it's an essential watch and is, in my opinion, one of the best teen movies ever made.",

I know I had a small friend group and grew up in a generation prior to the 2000s, so perhaps I\u2019m just out of touch with kids of the 2000s. If this is the norm, then I\u2019m glad I had an abnormal adolescence, because these kids are vile. Watching them objectify women, berate one another, and abuse alcohol so freely makes me want to punch them in the face. The main satisfaction that I got from the film was watching Jonah Hill\u2019s character get hit by a car multiple times. If only he\u2019d broken some bones! I did not laugh at their exploits, and found some of the elaborate detours they took to be downright boring. They spent way too much time at this one party (that a crazy person drove them to) simply because they thought there might be an opportunity to steal some booze. This entire location was pointless and did absolutely nothing to move the story forward. Then there\u2019s the whole McLovin adventure. In all honesty, this is what the whole movie should have been. While Fogell isn\u2019t much more endearing than his friends, he has a goofy earnestness that they lack. He doesn\u2019t seem to be so singularly focused on getting a girl drunk to have sex with her, and I guess I \u201cadmire\u201d him for that. To be fair, this entire subplot of the film is utterly ludicrous and feels like it was pulled from an SNL sketch or something. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the irresponsible cops are insane and constantly do things that make no sense for no reason. Their foolishness was just crazy enough to be mildly humorous. Sadly, the movie wasn\u2019t really about McLovin and the sketch cops. We had to spend more time with Jonah Hill screaming about period blood and Michael Cera doing next to nothing memorable. I think he horribly sang a song or something, it kind of slips my mind. As a whole, Superbad was so completely not a film for me that it made me actively annoyed with its protagonists. There were moments of reprieve from some of the supporting cast, but not enough to make this a movie I enjoyed.",

Watching this more than 10 years after its release, it already seems dated - much of what was more shocking then has been done to death since (think like ANY Ashton Kutcher film, future Apatow films, etc), and the movie was oversold, so I was expecting more.  This doesn't make it a bad movie, but it seems like it would be more relevant had I watched it 10 years ago.\nI DID find myself smiling in places, but just not enough there for me.

There was no particular reason as to why I didn't watch it, it was just one of those films that I hadn't gotten to yet. And here's the thing with comedies; comedies can be hilarious. We all love to laugh and smile. But comedies are also one of the hardest pieces of dialogue to write. It's personally why I don't like writing comedy myself. However, \"Superbad\" is one of those surprise comedies that really works and manages to make you laugh. \n\nThis is years ago, when Jonah Hill and Michael Cera all looked really different. It's one of those weird experiences because you've seen them in stuff today and they're much younger obviously. I think it's really cool to see a lot of these names and their performances just a decade ago because they're all really solid. Them, along with Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, and Emma Stone were all really solid. I liked everyone's performance in this film and in general, everyone had pretty great comedic timing.\n\nThis film is pretty crude. It's based around the idea that these two high schoolers are trying to get with their crushes before school ends. You have one character who's all about having sex with a drunk girl, and another who just wants to get to know his girl when they're sober. I like seeing the parallels between the people here because it's what I feel like high school can be. You have these different people whose overachieving goal would be to have sex, and I think that's pretty funny. The comedy worked well and it was supported by a solid story. \n\nIn the end, \"Superbad\" was a fun time and a funny film. I'm glad I was finally able to watch it and I can't wait to watch it again.",

Jonah Hill and Michael Cera's chemistry is authentic and hilarious that is supported with a good cast like Emma Stone, Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. Superbad; despite of having a runtime of around 110 minutes, seems overlong and exhausting at certain points, but the rest of it sails off smoothly for it seems like a mere special one-hour episode of some R rated sitcom.",

Everyone was perfectly cast, with Jonah Hill (Seth) and Michael Cera (Evan) doing some of their best comedic work ever. The cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) are hilarious and one of the best parts of the movie. We're also introduced to a woman who has arguably become the best actress of this era, Emma Stone (Jules). Then, there's Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Fogell), who played arguably the most memorable character. Nearly everything involving McLovin is comedy gold. That's a talented cast list without me even mentioning the quick appearances by Dave Franco, Clark Duke and Joe Lo Truglio. The characters are all relatable and likable, even in their most unlikable moments. It had a simple, but effective story and was loaded with memorable, quotable scenes. While it has some raunchy moments, the heart of the film is strong and focuses on the bond between Seth and Evan. I'm probably forgetting a lot, because there was so much to love about Superbad.\n\nWeaknesses: If I had to pick a gripe, it would be that the scene involving Seth and Evan in sleeping bags near the end feels like it drags on a bit. The same could kind of be said for how the McLovin/cops storyline ends. Even that feels like nitpicking, though, as they served a purpose.\n\nOverall: An absolute classic. One of the best comedies I've ever seen. It's my favorite movie of 2007 and I say that fully knowing that films like No Country for Old Men and Juno are from the same year. It was a launching pad for several talented stars (Stone, Hill, Cera) and remains some of their best work.",

This film is mostly puerile and downright ridiculous, and not in a clever or amusing way. Take the two supposed cops. They aren't funny. They certainly aren't remotely realistic or grounded any sort of way. They're just plain silly and lame. Period. And annoying. Oh, how truly irritating they are, let me count the ways! As for the rest of the film, you have... dire dialogue - with the exception of a handful of *midly* funny lines, the majority is swearing and coarse crudity (because that's always hilarious apparently, according to some people) - average acting, a bloated, desultory, meandering plot and absent character focus, ameliorated ever so slightly with the odd reasonable funny moment (the headbutting scene was rather amusing I'll admit, and no you won't see if coming, so it isn't a spoiler), and you have the aptly titled 'Superbad'. Or, if you prefer, 'Supermess', or even 'Superlame', as any of these are equally apt. I'm beginning to think that two stars is far too generous. *heavy sigh* 2/5*",

            "content": "Superbad (2007) explores the confused emotional turmoil and awkward situations that arise in high school with sensitivity and plenty of laughs. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are in their comfort zones as they play a hilarious and typically flawed duo trying to reach the pinnacle of high school popularity. The film milks the best from the duo, while balancing their wacky, raunchy story and gags with refreshing intelligence and honesty about adolescence. The film's greatest strength is its dialogue: it's paced well and packed with emotional nuance, with extensive opportunity for Seth Rogan and Bill Hader to make a great impact. Superbad's appeal stems from the idea that the absurd fantasies of hormonal, intoxicated guys may actually come true - and what can go wrong if it does. The sad situation that duo (who have great chemistry) are dealing with behind the booze is poignant throughout and gives the film added substance and authenticity. Superbad (2007) blends director Greg Mottola's dramatic influence with producer Judd Apatow's eye for a hilariously vulgar gag to great effect.",

The only thing unique is Jonah getting blood on his pants while dancing witha girl on her period.  2 maybe 3 mildly funny lines.

This is the first film that is actually written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and so far with the films that they wrote, I managed to enjoy them very much, which for this one, it made stars out of the actors, and with good reason also. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill work each other very well together and you can see about why they are best friends as it is very typical for those people to be high school students. Christopher Mintz-Plasse in his first film role has the comedic timing for the jokes, which gave me a laugh, and whenever he's with Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, their story is probably the most entertaining part of the film as they have a lot of fun chemistry, it's hilarious to watch, and it has a lot of heart from them, which they are just likable idiots. The writing by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg is really good with some of the dialogue being really funny enough that rightfully deserves to be a meme. The beginning has got a lot of jokes that got a laugh out of me, but when it gets a bit close to the end, I wasn't really laughing as much as I thought I would've gotten from it. It does a good job portraying some of the high school students as very awkward as it can be relatable to anyone that was in high school. Superbad may not be one of the classics for the high school genre, but at least I'll find it memorable enough to stand out.",

Even in spite of their social awkwardness, there's a lot of relatability to be had in these two characters. And, of course, the hijinks they get into throughout the course of the one night the film covers are undeniably hysterical. These come mostly thanks to interactions with two cops (played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) that also come in contact with Christopher Mintz-Plasse's McLovin' (who is one of the most memorable comedy characters in recent memory). Writing duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have jam packed so many jokes and hilarious situations into their screenplay, and the result is endlessly entertaining. Director Greg Mottola has created a gut-busting comedy that is simultaneously one of the finest coming-of-age movies of its decade.",

Full marks must go to Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg for a naturalistic and witty script. Rogan himself makes an appearance in a key role as one of a pair of seriously unhinged, inept cops who provide some fantastically funny moments during the film. This is a movie that has me giggling and sniggering all the way through as the best laid plans of the the three lads spiral increasingly out of control.

Jonah Hill has really come along way since \"Superbad.\" Since his debut in this ultra funny comedy, he has managed to also add to his resume \"Moneyball\" also starring Brad Pitt. \"21 Jump Street\" and \"22 Jump Street.\" And Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" So far and so good, Jonah Hill has managed to be very consistent lately with his movies and good for him! Because he definitely has the talent as he certainly proves it in this and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" for which he earned a best supporting actor nomination for his performance alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie, his second one! The first was for \"Moneyball,\" which he also earned a best supporting actor nomination playing Brad Pitt's partner in the baseball scouting business, which I also need to go back and give another look at as I thought it was just good, but not great. Other than that, the rest of the cast in the movie plays out well. Michael Cera is surprisingly funny in some scenes, even though this really is his only good movie he has ever done.Christopher-Mintz-Plasse steals the show as McLovin. Emma Stone even shines in this movie as well as Jonah Hill's love interest. But the real comedy duo in this is Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, who are just unbelievably funny together, and play off each other so well as the moronic cops. Every time they pop up on screen you just can't wait to see what the two of them are gonna come up with next to abuse the badge, it's that funny! Also the soundtrack I noticed a second time around is definitely worth checking out, as I always say, the best movies are the ones with great soundtracks, and this movie definitely belongs in the ladder category!",

            "content": "It's fairly rare that a high school movie hits really close to home. Superbad is a teen comedy that captures the high school atmosphere near perfectly. The story follows two seniors Seth and Evan, two nerdy kids that are trying to find someone they can get with by the end of their senior year. When they get invited to a popular girl named Jules's party, they get involved in a hilarious string of events that lead to a lot of difficult situations. To start off, I thought the acting was really good for the way this comedy portrayed itself to be. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Emma Stone, Seth Rogen, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Bill Hader all gave memorable performances. Characters like McLovin, Seth & Evan, the two cops and many more make the movie the great comedy that it is. I don't think any character was left out of a funny line or situation. People that weren't on camera very much (like Joe Lo Truglio) were memorable and he was there for like 8 minutes! To bounce off this aspect, all of this movie was hilarious. There were tons of laugh out loud moments, some worthy clever jokes, others not so much but they were still funny. The cops and Fogle were clearly the funniest people in the movie. Not only did they have really funny moments together, but they created a really good bond together. They had surprisingly good chemistry, as did Evan and Seth. I thought the writing for this movie was very well done, it was done by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen and it really shows that it was because of his signature brand of stoner humor. The film had a really good story to tell too, even if it does draw plot lines from films like American Pie, it felt like I was in their shoes. They didn't feel like they were really playing characters but like they WERE that character. Michael Cera may be the only exception since he's kind of a one trick pony sometimes but he meshes well with everyone else. The film is shot very well, the cuts were smooth and felt big budget at times which kinda bothered me but other than that it had good production. The thing that puts me over for this movie is its sense of moving on after high school. It's kind of like their last hurrah after being together for such a long time. The way that they show characters interact with each other also felt real because they didn't act like scripted jocks or nerds. They capture that aspect very well. Overall, Superbad is a lot better than I expected. It made me die of laughter while telling a hilarious story about moving on to college and getting through the stress and stereotypes of high school.

Being that this movie is without a doubt in my top three favorite movies of all time, if you are looking for a controversial review with both pros and cons, you will not find it here. Superbad is the comedy that has yet to be beaten. No other movie in history makes me laugh like this one does. Granted I am in High School so I can completely relate to most of the content which gives it an advantage. Especially since Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg know how to write High School life since the first draft of the script was written while they were in High School. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill's on screen chemistry makes for laughs even when they aren't cracking jokes. Michael Cera plays the perfect awkward student who shows the reality of what it is like to be a Senior in school. When I watch other comedy movies, it just reminds me how funny this one is. They really are spot on. Another one of my favorite pieces is the side plot involving McLovin and the two police officers. Their side story is so funny that it really could be its own film. Trust me when I say, you will laugh your ass off watching this incredibly hilarious movie with Hill and Cera's best performances to date and where Christopher Mintz-Plasse got his big break. I happily give this film 5 stars and would give it 6 if it were an option.",

Hill and Cera have great chemistry, bouncing insults and muttering puns at a machine-gun pace, and they get a ton of help from the supporting cast. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader damn near steal the show as a pair of irresponsible cops out for a joyride with Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who is himself unforgettable as the eccentric uber-geek \"McLovin.\" I just wish it could've hovered in its zone of meaningless shenanigans the whole way through, because the last twenty minutes - when the plot suddenly realizes it needs to get going - are something of a chore to push through.

The film mixes good laughs and\ngenuine emotion of the characters to create a very good film which\ncould be considered one the best teen comedies round, and definitely\nthe best of the 2000's. I felt as I said that it wad Very Good, and\nhere is why I did.\n\nThe story is great and moves along a fantastic pace mixing character\nstories between each other and running into one another with\nunpredictable and funny circumstances. What sets this story apart from\nother party films is that the film has a preparation for the party and\nthen what happens after the party and so you get to know what the\ncharacters are like whether sober or drunk. With fantastic lines and\nfun characters it makes the story even better and one you can see over\nand over.\n\nI liked the cast who do a great job with the comedy and even with there\nmovements can make you chuckle. Jonah Hill is the comedy king of this\nmovie and serves up nearly every joke in this with fine brilliance and\ncalm sophistication. Michael Cera is the more rational mind but he does\nit well and although not so funny still manages to set the other funny\ncharacters off. The entire supporting cast around that such as Bill\nHader and Seth Rogen among others do a great job and just add to the\nlaughs of this very funny movie.\n\nThe script obviously is the funny bone and without a decent script it\nwould be a terrible film, and so all acclaim must go to Seth Rogen and\nEvan Goldberg who one are the basis of this film, but also the great\nwriters of this who mix comedy and friendship well together so that it\nisn't sweet but not too sour either. The direction also needs praise as\nmuch of that is what makes it funny with fast scenes that you just\nthink \"WOAHHH\", perfection in this genre of comedy.\n\nAny bad things come, well I am not sure, some jokes do miss the mark\nbut never that badly. I feel some people also will hate the crude\nhumour and so that is basis for some criticism to say it relies on that\ntype of humour, but what do you expect from a teen comedy like this.\nYet again it is your perspective when it comes to criticism and what\nYOU like and don't like in comedy, some will like some won't, but I do\nthink the majority will enjoy this.\n\nI would recommend it to basically to who I said would enjoy it, those\nwho like teen comedies should be pleased by this and American Pie fans\nshould equally be pleased by it. Don't watch if you don't appreciate\ndrunken behaviour and sexual tones too because this is chock full of\nit, maybe only certain people will like it and possibly being a teen\ncomedy, it is aimed at making teens and young adults laugh.\n\nGive it a lower 8/10 here, strongly a Very Good film and I felt it was super\nclose to being a straight B+ but wasn't quite a great and excellent\nfilm but all the same very good is no underrating nor overrating. Watch\nit with friends and drink and eat with it and go with the flow, the\nparty can entertain large groups of people at a time and laughs with\ncome from all corners of the room.",

The focus of the plot is chiefly on beer and sex, the personalities are all fake, and much of the script is swearing for its own sake. Given what I've seen from other teen movies, I firmly expected that out of this film. The writing is pretty much terrible, since it revolves around the assumption that most teens deliberately seek out reckless social situations just for the sake of spending the night with a girl. Of course, that's probably not the point of the film, but it's so intrinsically puerile that everything else gets lost in a sea of beer and bad writing. The characters aren't all bad, although I really despise Jonah Hill's character, who seems to be good for nothing other than dragging his best friend down with him to the pits of mediocrity. Then again, I have a strong dislike for Jonah Hill as an actor. There may be a fair share of funny moments, and in the film's defence, the characters actually develop quite decently, but it's all standard fare for the teen film genre, which doesn't seem to have changed much in three decades. One could argue that this is one of the more decent films in the genre, and back when I was a teenager, I might have agreed. However, all teen movies are basically the same to me, and this film is nothing more than an outdated teen movie that only works for a teenage audience. Even if the film does try for a balance between puerility and wit, it's still too crude for that balance to work.",

It's supposed to be about the one-sided homosexual relationship on Seth's (Jonah Hill's) part in his romantic-friendship with Evan (Cera). All the while this McLovin' (Mintz-Plasse) kid is handing out with these cops (Bill Hader and Co-Writer Seth Rogen) who are clearly going through a midlife crisis. My apologies to Emma Stone, a beautiful young actress, for having to work with these horrible excuses for actors. Bill Hader tried to carry the weight of his performance with the other half of the comic duo, but Seth Rogan's weight is too much (I am not just talking about his physical weight). \"Actor\" Seth Rogan is proof that talent is not a necessity to be an actor or writer in Hollywood. After watching the 9-Month long \"Knocked Up\", one can only hope that the mockery of comic film will end. Jonah Hill is a shorter, fatter version of Seth Rogen, who at least does have slightly better acting ability than the former. Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogan, and Jonah Hill all have a place saved for them in Comedy and Actor's Hell\n\nIn closing, the title is quite appropriate with the quality of this abomination of cinema and the beginning of the end for comedy.",

Lastly, the final moment on the escalator, when Jonah Hill is essentially saying goodbye to not only his best friend, but his entire adolescence, is very touching. Sadly, they ruin it a moment later by having a montage of erect penis drawings. However, it's worth noting that the target audience (teenage boys) need to end the film with dick jokes because the previous emotional moment wouldn't have been \"cool\". Too much emotion! Like I said, as a teenager, the film is perfect. For adults, it's a painful train wreck.",

The film wavers a bit with the crazy antics of two police officers who give a ride to the nerd with a fake ID with the name 'McLovin' but it soon gets back on track at a party hosted by a student whose parents are out of town.

It follows a trio of high-school seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college (and one last shot at grabbing a girl). The trio consists of Seth, Evan, and Fogell. They make a likeable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favourite were the two police officers, Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh; from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer, its classic slapstick comedy.\n\nThe plot is definitely a strong point, unlike many comedies today. Most of the movie follows two distinct plot lines that join up at the end. Inter-weaved in the plot are countless jokes that kept me laughing almost the whole time. The plot itself involves booze, partying, and law enforcement, and somehow works these in to make a very absorbing story. Also, the particularly close friendship between Seth and Evan is an element that surpasses the comedy genre. The plot as a whole has plenty of unrealistic details, but manages to successfully meld comedy with some deeper meaning.\n\nThe movie as a whole is among the better comedies ever.",

I also love the two cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. Terrific comedy writing by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (they wrote the first draft of the script at the age of 15).

Jonah Hill is a whirlwind and really brings the energy into every scene he's in. Given that this film is done by the now well established Apatow Extended Family, it's no surprise that Seth Rogen is the writer and that he has a small part in it as well. What can't be denied is that the direction is pretty bland and feels like it only required powering on the camera and saying action. Scenes tend to run overly long, in an attempt to get good improvisations from the cast, but they arrive almost as often as they don't. Michael Cera plays the awkwardness great, but it doesn't seem that big of a stretch for him. Oh yes, did I mention the plot (if you can call it that) is absolutely ludicrous? Given the films ambitions, that can be a superfluous statement, but it has to be said. If looking for laughs, there are many to be had, but if looking for a great film, look elsewhere.

Mottola directed several episodes of the show, so this collaboration with Seth Rogen along with Rogen & Evan Goldberg's amazing screenplay have created a memorable new chapter in American teen/college comedies. \n\nAs I said the screenplay is flawless. It's hilarious at the same time as bordering on disturbing and you can't help but find amusement in the plight of these high school lads about to embark on college. \n\nThe story itself is nothing new. We have seen many a film of this nature, most notably the American Pie series which were considered at their time of release to be pushing the boundaries of teen comedies. Superbad has just blown those films out of the water and set a new benchmark. The reason this film takes an overused premise and succeeds triumphantly is because of the incredibly strong and funny team working on this. The acting is superb. The leading duo are wonderful together and compliment one another perfectly. They are likeable characters but above that they are believable, making any unlikely or far fetched scenario which follows seem completely capable of happening in the real world. Rogen and Hader are hilarious as the two cops and this film would not have succeeded without these two players.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie which was a relief. After Knocked Up I was beginning to lose hope that we would see this team back on track again. Highly recommended.",

Seth is so direct in whatever he say's, he even makes the most offensive words into an art. Wheras Evan is a sit on the fence type of person and thinks before speaking. Possibly the biggest legend of Comedy films ever made 'Mclovin' he is somewhat an iconic person who opitomizes comedy.\nDirected by Greg Mottola he changes the stere-typical groups in society. Here we have a high school with your cliche groups of nerds,jocks and hot chicks. This film makes the 'nerds' the new jocks and flips the typical same old perception of the groups of people in High school.\nFogul who later becomes Mclovin is so cool he only needs one short snappy name. Fogul is such a 'dorky' name he looks, dresses and speaks like a nerd but he has such a hilarious personailty which all combined, a legend is born 'mclovin'. Seth is a person who dosen't think when he speaks but his vocabulary of the dirty mind is astonishing, it sounds so calculated but not scripted because Jonah Hill who plays Seth has an amazing personality anyway and it feels a real person.\nThe three of them together are awquardly funny around other social groups and people. There is Mclovin with his cop buddies, Seth and Ethan who are trying to retrieve Alcohol For Joules party and have extremly funny situations trying to get back to the party with the Alcohol.\nDiffrent relationships are formed in this movie, we have Mclovin with the two cops, Seth and Joules and Ethan and Becca. It's exceptional that all these are funny in their own way and have their own mini plot within the film.\nCinematically the film has little to offer, there is no special camera shots or effects, it's a film which is stripped of it's hollywood glamouisation and is a raw comedy with only one purpose to amke people laugh, and that they do. The script is executed by the cast and the performances seem like they are our level not any better than us not any worse.\nThe film has a lot to offer socially. Watching the cops who again change the dynamic of the stereotypical strict and serving poilce to laid back and relaxed average guys just having some fun. They don't take things seriously in this movie bu there are times when they do show some intelligence and know that they just saw a litle of them selves in Mclovin.\nOverall the film is comedy genius based on the awkward time in life of high school. a spectacular script and superb performances from all the cast.",

Superbad is probably the finest comedy film of the decade! \n\nSome consider this film to be excessively vulgar and raunchy, but I personally thought that the vulgarity and raunchiness was one of the film's most valueable assets. It increased the authenticity of the portrayal of highschool life. We all know how teenagers talk nowadays, and Superbad did well in its representation of modern teen dialogue. With that aside it was also hilarious!\n\nThis film could not have been better casted. Jonah Hill with his outwardly-expressed rauchiness and sarcasm, Michael Cera with his awkward brand of humour, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (MC LOVIN) with his nerdiness came together and created a masterpiece which catered to audiences with various senses of humour. No matter one's sense of humour, I can fully guarantee that they will find Superbad to be one of the funniest films ever. \n\nAs far as weaknesses...I believe it does not have any. This film is flawless. The script was brilliant, the casting was extremely well done and the costumes were great! This film effectively makes use of costumes in a way that escalates the hilarity of it. McLovin' and his vest, Seth trying on Evan's clothes (do you only shop at baby gap?), and when Evan is hooking up with Becca (be careful with this sweater it means a lot to me....its vintage) are just a few examples of how costumes were used to supplement the humour in the film.\n\nSuperbad is very ironic. The whole film is about Seth and Evan trying to get laid before starting college but they don't realize their feelings for each other. I cannot say that the two characters are indeed gay, but no one can argue against the fact that there is something homosexual in nature about their relationship. On more than one occasion, the film implicitly presents Evan and Seth's relationship as a homosexual one. The last few scenes of the film make this evident.\n\nOverall, this film was magnificent, a modern classic! It will definitely be remembered as one of the great films of the 2000's.",
