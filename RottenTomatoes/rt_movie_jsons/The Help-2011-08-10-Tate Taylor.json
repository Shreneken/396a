She turns her small town on its ear by choosing to interview the Black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families.

It's on paper quite a simple story, about someone who wants to write about the racisme towards maids, but on the surface is an emotional and insanely well written movie. Everyone in this movie is fantastic, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas-Howard, what a cast and so many oscars. The plot doesn't feel forced, sometimes you have racist moments in film, that just feel forced and not deserving of the moment, i didn't had that with this movie at all. The beautiful thing is the fact that this movie is well shot, but nothing insanely crazy, they just let the performances and the plot lead the movie, which is absolutely loved. At the end its like you cry every 2 minutes, because we spent a lot of time with the characters, the emotional payoff out the end of the movie is one of the best i have ever seen, i cried like 5 times. I adore this movie with everything i have",

I cannot understand that because the movie is based on a fictional novel and told through a white main character is now a piece of cancel culture because the main character of the book is white. This is a nod to the absolute lunacy of today's faux outrage. Had I not seen this movie I would not have known the depths of disgusting treatment and I'm sure it was worse. Just because they had help, in this case the only way they could have probably told their story, does not diminish their strength and the portrayal of their human value. The movie may have a white main character as a vessel but it is barely a percentage of this film. The help are the actual saviors to themselves and many white characters throughout the film.  It saddens me to think that this film is now frowned upon by two of its female cast members because their portrayals make this moment in time come alive even if it is based on an absolutely terrible past. History is not to be made into a perfect cookie cutter story. History is meant to be learned from. It is even better when it offends you in hopes that it will be less likely repeated.",

            "content": "Sometimes I wish reviewers (mostly the pros as opposed to the amateurs) would review movies based on how good or bad they are and not based on how they think a story should play out per their political beliefs.  When The Help came out, there were two main complaints about the movie.  One was that it was a another white person saves black person movie.  While I can understand the sentiment, there are two things to consider here.  First, the movie makes it very painfully clear that being a black maid in Jackson, MS in the early 60's was a no-win situation, which it very much was, and often in those situations, it required as least a bit of help from someone in the \"ruling majority\" to step in and facilitate necessary changes.  Second, the movie opens with Viola Davis's character telling HER story, which we soon learn has a great amount of risk involved, and while the movie may be told in whole from a white woman's perspective, it's unquestionably understood that she is simply the vehicle through which the powerful story of the black maids' courage is brought to light.  The second complaint was that the story wasn't \"hard hitting\" enough when it comes to the issue of racism and that it was too lighthearted about the events in Jackson at that time.  What so many people so conveniently forget is that the day-to-day black experience of that era wasn't entirely about violence and the screaming racism often depicted in movies.  Much of racism in even the deepest southern states in Jim Crow days was what you see in The Help.  It was quite subtle but cruel, and those responsible for it outside of the political arena often went unpunished, and in the ladies circles of that day, the best revenge a black person could often hope for was a public shaming like the one given to Celia Foote in the movie.  There are several great movies which rightfully shown the darkest side of racism in a brutal and eyes-open manner.  This movie isn't meant to be that.  It is designed to show the more subtle racism that doesn't get as much attention, and frankly, humor is more likely to get bodies into the theater to see how bad it used to be than \"THIS IS RACISM!!  LOOK AT IT!!\"  The Help is a touching, extremely well acted story of the power of black women who had nothing but their courage and love for each other (and yes, the courage of a white woman to a certain extent to help them get their story out).  It has teeth for days, but gets its point across with humor and heart rather than violence and anger, even though you can feel how much that anger underpins the experience of the maids.",

            "content": "Rarely are film adaptations as good as their source material. The Help is, unfortunately, no exception to the norm. Forced, truncated, and tonally confused, the film fails to give its moving subject matter proper breathing room. Instead, it force-feeds audiences a one-dimensional diet of white, racist southerners in hopes of securing instantaneous empathy for its main characters. While the historical setting is certainly drenched in racist bigotry, the film's slap-stick portrayal of such cheapens the real horrors of the Jim Crow era. But it's not all bad news. The Help is carried by a cast of highly talented actresses who do a great deal to elevate the film. Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Octavia Spencer are great in every scene they appear in. In particular, Viola Davis single-handedly makes this film watchable. So, all in all, The Help is a relentlessly mediocre film, with its stellar performances either bringing it to life or masking its mediocrity (whichever you choose).",

He also had a built in audience because the book was so popular.\nOverall, this is a captivating film with great performances. It makes us look back to the civil rights days of the early 1960's and evaluate how far we have progressed. How far, exactly? Clearly, not far enough.",

Bryce Dallas Howard's character is despicable and Emma Stone is quite good as well, but the heavy lifting here is done by Viola Davis (who's final scene made me cry as well), and Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer, particularly when they're scene partners. Just really incredible and all 3 deserved their Oscar nominations.

            "content": "The Help might appear to some to be well within the bounds of Oscar-bait, featuring great actors giving well-realized performances in a racially charged, intermittently feminist narrative. However, it's a perfectly palatable and well-designed bit of commentary made better by the quality of the production, even if it isn't necessarily pushing boundaries in intensity or theme. Actually, that's one of the best aspects of the film - how small-scale and domestic it is. There aren't any hood-wearing mobs throwing torches through bookstores, instead the perception of race is presented in the context of genteel society in supposedly idyllic mid-century America, where upsetting of social norms was grounds for social execution. The relationship between Stone's Skeeter and both Davis' Aibileen and Spencer's Minny certainly has room for criticism in the potential interpretation of a 'white savior' narrative (the scene with Minny's jubilant dancing at her proceeds from the book, even the larger group of local maids flocking to Skeeter), but by and large is not patronizing, even if it's a bit exploitative. The brief dives into subplots that end up cut short because the movie was already two and a half hours are noticeable (particularly Skeeter's romantic distraction, which was established, shattered, reconciled, and shattered again in the space of about ten minutes of screentime with far less impactful consequences than the main plot), but where The Help makes up for these shortcomings is the performances, particularly Davis, who has already cemented herself as such an iconic and dedicated performer that she can make any role look good even if the film around her is mediocre or trying for accolades (*cough* Fences). It won't light your world on fire with thematic daring, but The Help is well-made and solid for its particular depiction of period racial inequality, even if it skews toward stereotypes. (3/5)",

It's handled more like a Hallmark or ABC Family movie than a real portrayal of black people's oppression and suffering. It's too safe and sentimental and too much about Skeeter. At times this movie has the same kind of conflict resolutions as Mean Girls or a Nickelodeon show. Too much time is spent on Skeeter's daily unimportant troubles as a southern belle trying to be a writer and not enough time on the fact that black people's jobs and/or lives were constantly in danger if they did anything from using the wrong bathroom to trying to vote. The movie means well, and has moments where it really hones in on the awful truth about this country's past, but it also has moments where the fried chicken stereotype is forced and made blatantly obvious when it has absolutely no place in this movie.",

However, it merely manages to brush the surface of race relations in America, instead The Help offers a safe and neat space to hail white saviors just helping out the black community. It's ironic that that author of The Help didn't even get permission to tell this story apparently. You find sympathy within the characters from the moving performances, but The Help resorts to too many stereotypes to feel meaningful. Tate Taylor's direction is solid, but the real star is the cast.\n\nViola Davis is jaw dropping as a maid forced by poverty to raise white children, whose parents are negligible at best, as she must learn to stand up for herself against her pale tyrants in a tear jerking lead actress performance. Likewise, Octavia Spencer is wonderful as a tough maid and cook forced to endure endless hardships, so Spencer brings an intensity and energy to this whirlwind character. I must mention Cicely Tyson gives a wondrous performance as an old maid that raised Emma Stone's character. Then, I should say that David Oyelowo makes a nice cameo as an inspiringly kind preacher.\n\nI love Emma Stone in The Help so much that it's actually the role that convinced me she could seriously act. She finds strength to withstand mean girls and rude boys, so that her character can achieve a career as a writer. Her large blue eyes wide open say everything as to how affected Stone was by this role. \n\nBryce Dallas Howard goes into next level acting with arguably the greatest performance in The Help. For such a warm, kind, and bubbly actress, Howard transforms herself into the most vile, hateful, spiteful, cowardly, loathsome racist maybe ever in a film. I hope people look back see how impressive Bryce Dallas Howard's effortless and unforgettable performance is in The Help.\n\nOn the other hand, Jessica Chastain is so warm and friendly in a very sweet and moving role within The Help. Sissy Spacek also gets to deliver a fun and memorable role as Bryce's mother. I love how many talented redheaded actresses are in The Help. I also enjoyed seeing Mary Steenburgen as Emma Stone's New York editor.\n\nAllison Janney kills it as Emma Stone's racist and misguided mother. Ahna O'Reilly is excellent as a cowardly suburban mother who just goes along with whatever Bryce's horrid character says since she has no spine. Anna Camp similarly concurs with whatever Bryce wills with an empty shallow lady figure in The Help. Dana Ivey gets her moment to shine as a repulsively racist government representative. For all the ladies' great acting, the guys do not impress.",

            "content": "An essential entry in the genre of white savior films along with the equally trite and saccharine To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Sadly this film was a major success in 2011, earning $216 million at the box office and four Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture. I expected the film to gloss over important issues and feature dull but \u2018virtuous' characters as stand-ins for the real thing but this film exceeded my expectations in how poorly executed it was. At 146 minutes the film is also exceedingly long and even those who enjoy this cheesy wish fulfillment may have a hard time staying engaged in the thin plot as it is stretched over a padded runtime.\n\nAspiring journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, Emma Stone, decides to document the experiences of African-American maids in her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s. She focuses her efforts on Aibileen Clark, Viola Davis, who develops close bonds with the white children she raises but faces racism from her adult employers. Her friend, the feisty Minny Jackson, Octavia Spencer, is employed by the haughty and cruel Hilly Walters Holbrook, Bryce Dallas Howard, who uses her social influence to shun the exuberant Celia Rae Foote, Jessica Chastain. After being fired by Holbrook Jackson is employed by Foote and the two form a genuine friendship as Jackson teaches her young charge about housework and Foote discovers the reason for her social pariah status. When Phelan releases her book, anonymously documenting the events she has been told of, she causes quite a stir in town but the book is seen to improve race relations and punish those who are cruel to others.\n\nThere is something disturbing about taking an issue that clearly impacts the African-American community more than the affluent whites that employ them and then exploring this issue through the eyes of those who are not impacted. From a story standpoint it means the film is considerably less interesting. It also means that we spend a considerable amount of time setting up Phelan as a character before we can get to the women at the heart of the story. The conduit is a well worn tradition but here it felt unnecessary as the film is already such an unrealistic \u2018fairy tale' that it would have been more interesting to have Clark be the author of the book. Sure, we get a few colorful, white supporting characters but we could have kept them and eliminated Phelan altogether as Holbrook is a deliciously evil villain while Foote represents the \u2018good' in white people. I understand the desire to not have all of the white characters portrayed as evil racists but it would have been nice to remove our boring, angelic lead through whom we learn almost nothing.\n\nUnfortunately you will have to endure this film in order to see the wonderful performances, Stone excepted. As the center of the film she is bland and lacking in any star quality. It is a cruel comparison to see Sissy Spacek, a natural star, bring more to the film in a few minutes of screen time than Stone does in the entire film. Spencer adopts her usual shtick, it has become rather tiresome by now, to play the sassy Jackson but she is relatively entertaining and has a nice chemistry with Davis. Davis herself does more with the source material than is available on the page and the emotional pathos that she channels when she discusses her son's death feels overwrought but is a study in technically sound acting. The best performances in the film come from Howard and Chastain who are camping it up in their respective roles and each receive neat comedic moments in which they really get to shine. For some they may hew too close to cartoon characters but compared to the sedate Stone they are a breath of fresh air.\n\nI would not recommend seeing this film as you can see the members of the talented cast do great work in other films that do not employ the dangerous white savior trope. Thank goodness in recent times the Academy has wised up somewhat and are now willing to nominate Black Klansman (2018) but they still have a long way to go.",

Its about a really controversial topic: the racism. \nThe movie goes back to the time when white women used to have black maids, who were in charge of cleaning, cooking and taking care of their kids, only to be mistreated. Even if its something that happened long time ago it makes you think about how our modern society still has a lot of discrimination and racism and how sometimes we base our actions in badly made prejudices.\nIt has really good cast, Emma Stone plays a really lovely and charming role, Bryce Dallas is the bitchy evil women that every controversial movie needs, and Octavia Spencer makes you laugh more than once.\nThe acting is really good, you end up hating and loving some of the main characters. It makes you feel something for them. It includes a little bit of humor pointing out the shameful behavior of most of the white people who felt superior without losing the main point.\nIn my opinion I think everyone should watch this movie to make conscience on how we treat other people that may have less or more opportunities than us. It may seem a little long but the story will captive you.",

            "content": "- The Help tells a story of writers righting wrongs -\n\nI was born and raised in the South. In Virginia, to be exact. And while it's not so far south as Mississippi (the setting of The Help), it's Southern enough to make the issues raised by the film familiar. And yet, in spite of its unsettling familiarity, as a white woman, I have to admit that I learned very little about the Civil Rights movement in school. A fact that unsettles me even more.\n\nThe issues that made that movement necessary are still relevant, as evidenced by the recent #BlackLivesMatter movement. It is perhaps for those reasons that I relate so closely with this film; the injustice of inequality is not something stuck in a distant past. It is our daily life. It shouldn't be, but it is. So I felt closely connected with the women in the film who were trapped in the multi-layered system of inequality that pervaded life in the 1960's.\nBut what I really love about this story is how the women stand together and use every ounce of courage they possess to work outside of the law to right the wrongs of their society.\n\nWhen aspiring writer Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone, Easy A, The Amazing Spiderman) replaces a housekeeping columnist for her local newspaper, she requests advice from the only ones around her that know about housekeeping: the help. The interviews she conducts quickly morph into the revolutionary idea of writing a compilation of stories from the point of view of these women, their experiences and treatment from their white employers.\n\nI was briefly tempted to roll my eyes here. Really? Another white-savior film? But my eyes stopped mid-roll as I recalled their situation. Who else was going to bridge the gap? Who else was going to speak on behalf of the men and women who were trapped, by law and circumstance, in silence? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was making cultural waves, but what about the people in the towns, waiting with bated breath to hear the fulfilment of their mutual dream? And that's when the film changed for me. It's about one girl using her gift for others, at great risk for all of the women involved, even if the risk and danger is most precient for the women of color.\n\nAibileen Clark (Viola Davis, Suicide Squad, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close) is the first bold woman who agrees to tell her story. As the film's narrator, she guides the audience through her personal experiences as well as her self-realization as a writer and a woman with a story worth telling. She has dedicated her life to loving the children she's placed in charge of, and she tirelessly repeats to them what is most important: \"You is kind. You is smart. You is important.\"\n\nThe next fearless woman is Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer, The Divergent Series, Snowpiercer). She's a character with a steely exterior and a heart of gold, prepared to help others and give second chances, when necessary.\n\nTogether, these women (eventually joined by a bevy of others) tell the stories that no one has dared to before. Their transparency about their harsh employers and their moving testimonies create a tapestry of Jackson life that has never before seen the light of day, and suddenly becomes a life-changing, page-turning sensation.\n\nThe Help stirred a lot of conversation upon its release about its depiction of historical racial tension and inequality in the United States.  It's always problematic when discrimination stories are told through a white lens. I look forward to a time when our screens are filled with stories told by women of color. The screens are changing. Very. Very. Slowly.\n\nIn the meantime Clark's words are relevant to anyone and everyone. Remember: You is kind. You is smart. You is important.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/the-help, and was written by Micah Orsetti.

From the abusive husband, the long walks to and from work, the civil rights era,  to raising multiple children which I'm not hers and then coming home to raise her children. I don't understand how white movie critics are writing this movie but I'm  sure they would rate some white universal pI tire a five or 4.5 minimum of 4 because they cannot relate to this.  This just goes to show their racism still exist and that black people/African-Americans/black Americans still have to struggle to get recognition in a white man's world.

Emma Stone as Skeeter and Octavia Spencer as Minny are both excellent but Viola Davis as Ailbileen puts in the performance of a lifetime and is the true heart and soul of the film. Jessica Chastain is also very bubbly and entertaining as Celia Foote and Bryce Dallas Howard puts in an fantastically evil performance as Hilly, a woman who wants to keep the help in their place and goes so far as making them use separate bathrooms! This film does an excellent job at highlighting the inequality and prejudice black people faced during this period, not referring to huge incidents and the violence against them but in the smaller more insidious racism and personal stories of the maids that are dealt with in a very emotional and moving way. The only down side is the focus on Skeeter, as the person who initially thinks of writing a book from the point of view of the help she is essential to the plot but her own storyline is nowhere near as interesting or as poignant as the others and slows down the pace of the film in places. This is definitely a film worth watching, it's a beautifully told story and the performances may just move you to tears.",

The lead actresses are Emma Stone as Eugenia Skeeter, Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark, Olivia Spencer as Minny Jackson and Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly Holbrook.\n\"The Help\" tells the story of two black maids called Aibileen and Minny, living in Jackson in the Mississippi in the sixties. They were working for white people like all the black maids in town. One day, a white woman who dedicated herself to writing and whose name was Eugenia Phelan, asked Aibileen to testify about her life as a maid to write a book. They both knew it was very dangerous because Aibileen could get killed and Eugenia could go to jail for making acquaintance. Miss Phelan also got a dozen of other black maids telling their stories to fulfill her project. They didn't expect the book to be a best-seller but indeed it was.\n\nThe performances of the actors were just perfect. They had to act like the people in the sixties. They represented the black maids as very scared people but also intelligent and caring, loving and funny with the children of whom they were taking care. Miss Holbrook was nasty, racist without knowing she was, ignoring... while Miss Phelan was very helpful with the maids, clever, hard-working... It almost created a back in time.\nI think that the characters were believable: they managed to convey different emotions and atmospheres and it gave me the impression that I was in the movie just watching what was going on. The only things that were a little bit disturbing were the differences between the book and the movie. It doesn't matter if some scenes weren't represented in the movies because the film would have been too long but I think that the emotions of the maids were not enough perfected. For example, in the book, we know that it was very hard for the maids and especially Aibileen to talk about their lives in the book but in the movie she accepted Eugenia's request almost immediately.\n\nThere is a great work on the cinematography of \"The Help\". There were all the types of camera angles (high angle shots, low angle shots,...), some tracking shots and static shots. The light is natural because it was shot outside and also artificial because of the lamps adding clarity on the set. The scenes are usually long so we get more information and there are many camera shots.\nThe movie starts with a music which dates back to the sixties to convey a smooth atmosphere. All along the film, the soundtrack is slow and sad to underline the poor conditions of the Black population at that time. When it comes to the improvement of the black conditions, the director plays a fast-paced music. The movie finishes with a triumphant song called \"the living proof\" sung by Mary J. Blige. It illustrates the victory of the fight led by the blacks even if it suggested. The music accompanies the plot of the movie. \nThe costumes are very important in the film because they are illustrative of the different social classes of the American society in the sixties. \n\nThis masterpiece was released to denounce the racialism of most Americans during that period. To do so, they traced back the lives of black maids with everyday details to make the viewers experience the poor conditions of such a people. It is very convincing because the director makes the public share their ill-treatment. \nThe thematic is relatively commonplace but the emotional aspect makes it original.\nThis is my personal analysis but it is reflected in the different feelings experienced by the characters:  we are switching from sadness to happiness going through melancholy, loneliness and hatred towards the white population. \nThe subject is highly topical and can provide an efficient lesson to all the current xenophobia movements in the world.",

All these women who are occupied with materialistic shit and status sicken me. \n\nIt's nice to see the two black maids lighten up and joke around when there around each other. They go through enough hell. Emma Stone is a dear. It's ridiculous though how people used to be so ignorant towards black people. \n\nIt's so sad how these black maids were the ones who really raised the kids while there real parents neglected them. It's nice to see that Abilene can get out what she really thinks through Skeeter. It's like therapy. Minnie's hilarious. \n\nWhat makes this movie so amazing is the way they interweave what was going on during that time and the story of the movie. It's like one second your getting emotional over what's happening between Skeeter and Abilene and the next reality hits, and your suddenly reminded of the brutality and racism that existed back then. \n\nThe whole burying of the Blue Box was dark. That was some deep shit, makes me respect the movie even more. That Miss Hilly is going to get what's coming to her. She's so evil and vindictive and fake as fuck. That pie scene with Minnie was fucking genius. The story with Constantine is pretty heartbreaking. \n\nOMG!!! Im so glad Abilene told off Hilly. It's about time that bitch got what she deserved. Getting called godless. That's wassup. \n\nWhoo! This movie brought a tear to my eye. A couple of tears. Very moving and emotional story. I'm so glad this movie was made.",

They are in Jackson, Mississippi and it is based in August 1962. The intended audience is for adults and teens. It is a good lesson on what happened back in those days; lessons learned are do not treat someone the way you don't want to be treated because karma will come around. Some of the actresses are Viola Davis (maid) , Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer (maid). The conflict was when the maids had enough of the white people treating them badly and they had enough courage to stand up for themselves , even if that meant for them getting fired they were willing to do it. I would rate this movie a 4 out of 5 stars because it has great characters it has a great story behind it and it could teach kids about how people treated other people back in the days.",

This critic's observation enhanced my own analysis of the film because I totally agree. Watching this film made me laugh,cry,angry,disappointed but most importantly it made me think about my past. Made me think about if this was me and how I would have responded to those issues back then. \nAtkinson's review was negative. In my opinion, it probably is because he did not like that it was sentimental issues that was made fun of. He feel that white people were put in the middle of racial issues and the destruction of black people and their lives (in that time period) His observation enlightened my analysis of the film because I did not see things the way he did. His observation definitely made me view things from his perspective with an open mind. Although I read his review, I do not agree with him. I think that the world needs to see these issues head on. Yes, these type of films aren't the easiest to talk about because they are a replica of history. Our history. Some people don't like to rehash the issues  of our past.

She turns her small town on its ear by choosing to interview the black women---such as Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer)---who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families as their maids.\n\nThis remarkably poignant and powerful film exposes the ugly stain of racism that each white and black person was faced with on a daily basis during the early 1960's in the Deep South. By writing her infamous book, Skeeter makes enemies of the white women whose appalling treatment of their black maids she chronicles. I agree with what Tom Long from The Detroit News remarked about the film: \"Appealing, entertaining, touching, and perhaps even a bit healing, The Help is an old-fashioned grand yarn of a film, the sort we rarely get these days.\"",

She decides to collect the stories from the various African Amrerican servants that work for her neighbours. Initially viewed with suspicion and scepticism, Skeeter gradually gains the trust and respect of the women she is interviewing and it soon becomes clear that this project, the first time these domestic servants have been given a voice, has an important role in the growing civil rights movement. The film is simply brilliant with fantastic central performances from Stone, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. These three are a real delight to watch and it is great to have a cast made up of so many strong, female characters. The film manages to tread a delicate line between a whole spectrum of emotions. It is touching, horrifying and in places extremely funny. Writer-director Tate Taylor shows a rare skill in her handling of some very diverse themes. As well as the three central characters, there are some great supporting performances from the likes of Bryce Dallas Howard and Sissy Spacek. I really enjoyed the journey of the characters and felt very moved by some of the scenes. The casual racism suffered by these woman is shocking to the modern audience but the dignity, strength and above all humour of these characters really shines through.

            "content": "Though relatively lightweight and somewhat manipulative, The Help is nonetheless affecting. It's the acting that sets it apart from most films of its kind, and with no less than four excellent performances, it's easy to forgive a film its missteps. I thought some of the characters were frustratingly one-dimensional, but the performances are still outstanding. And I found myself moved, but it wasn't easy to get to that point. It's a bit of a mixed bag, I guess, but on the whole, I'd definitely say there's more to recommend here than there is to condemn.\n\nThe film takes place in the Deep South during the Civil Rights era, though the movement hasn't quite made its way to Jackson, Mississippi. Skeeter (Emma Stone) has just graduated from college and is looking to start a writing career with a bang. But it's moonlighting as a housekeeping columnist that pays the bills for Skeeter at first, so she enlists Aibileen (Viola Davis), her friend's maid, to help her write the columns. It's in observing the way Aibileen and other housemaids are treated by their white owners that Skeeter comes up with an idea. She too grew up with a maid, and her family's maid raised Skeeter. And she doesn't understand how her friends, especially Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), can treat their surrogate mothers as second-class citizens. So she starts to write, but most of Jackson's help is afraid and unwilling to assist her.\n\nViola Davis broke out in Doubt a few years ago, and since then, she's been all over. She impressed me in a throwaway role in Trust earlier this year, but here, she's sensational, giving one of my favorite performances of the year. Aibileen isn't as boisterous as some of the film's other characters, but her poise and strength are extraordinarily admirable, and Davis conveys them with all the reluctance we might expect from someone in her position and with her background. She's proud, but not too proud as to act foolishly or dangerously. Her friend, Minnie (Octavia Spencer), however, is a different story.\n\nMinnie steals most every scene she's in with sass and attitude. She's worked for Hilly and her family for years, until Hilly fires her for using the indoor guest bathroom. This drives her toward Celia (Jessica Chastain), a hopeless young housewife, who's been shunned by Hilly and the gang, but is naive enough not to realize it. Her relationship with Minnie is one of the film's high points. They're an odd fit, but they share one thing in common: a troubled relationship with Hilly. Contrary to what you might expect, it's Minnie who acts out toward Hilly (to hilarious results), while Celia attempts to win her over through kindness. Neither really succeeds, but they learn a lot about each other as a result.\n\nThe relationships between Skeeter and the maids is also interesting. She wants to help them out of their circumstances, but no one, including her, quite understands why. Many of the local maids think she might be using them to advance her career; others are afraid she's just setting them up for a big fall on a lark. Aibileen takes a chance on her, and through her leadership, others soon join them. It might not seem like the most courageous deed (just sharing your stories with another), but director Tate Taylor does a great job developing this world in a way that we understand the risks involved for these women.\n\nMy main objection was with the character of Hilly. At no point does Taylor (who also wrote the screenplay) attempt to make her three-dimensional. I don't think there's anything wrong with the way Bryce Dallas Howard plays the character; it's just that there's not all that much to her but cruelness and bigotry. She's not the only one-dimensional character. I think most of the women (excepting Aibileen and Celia) in the film-plus, all of the men-could use a little more depth. But thankfully, this doesn't stop the actresses from turning out great work, nor does it distract too much from the overall emotional trajectory of the film.\n\nWith a lot of money already in the coffer and plenty of critical and public support, we could be looking at an early Oscar contender. I don't think the faux-controversy surrounding the way the film deals with race will derail it. Only a really strong fall season will deny Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Hell, even a Best Picture nod shouldn't be out of the question at this point. I wouldn't put the film on that level, though I would say any acting recognition would be extremely well-deserved.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/help-review/",

Rather than showing the struggle of black americans during the civic rights movement it focuses on the issues faced by a white female who \"saves\" the black help. Note I am not saying white allies were not present or important during the civil rights movements I am just saying that it was not their battle to fight or war to be won.

Yet, The Help also tries to be light and comic like the funny dialogues and scenes with Minny and Celia which was unforgettable. The ensemble casts provided strong performances that made this movie truly remarkable. Octavia Spencer\u0092s performance as Minny Jackson is great enough to earn her an Oscar Best Supporting Actress. Jessica Chastain\u0092s performance as funny crazy and care-free Celia Foote was so remarkable that her support role gain her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress! I didn\u0092t even realize Chastain was in this movie because her character is eccentric and offbeat. Viola Davis is notable too especially for heavy drama but Emma Stone who seems to be the lead seems her act is limiting. Bryce Dallas Howard\u0092s character as Hilly Holbrook was really an effective antagonist that you\u0092re going to hate after watching this film. Yet the inspiring story of the film is what makes The Help a great movie to watch even though the ending is quite disappointing for some. But it does end in a good way.\nThe Help is an American period drama film directed and written by Tate Taylor, and adapted from Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name. The Help is about a young white woman, Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, and her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the Civil Rights era in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. Skeeter is a journalist who decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids (referred to as \"the help\"), exposing the racism they are faced with as they work for white families.",

The movie tackles some very sensitive, very painful topics and does so in kind of a glossy fashion.

            "content": "Great movie! I didn't expect to end the way it did, but in a way even though it ended on a bad note it really didn't when you think about it. Viola Davis (Who is amazing in this movie) finally gets to do what she wants to do at the end of the movie. Because if you remember as she is being interviewed by Emma Stone (Who also does a pretty good job herself in this movie) in the beginning of the movie when she asks Viola Davis if she ever dreamed about doing anything else besides being a house maid and she nods her head yes at Emma Stone, you quickly remember at the very end of the movie as she is walking down the road after being fired from Bryce Dallas Howard (Who is a real bitch in this movie) and she has to say goodbye to one of the other girl's daughter that she had been taking care of and walks down the road she says that was last baby she would ever care as now she believes after releasing the book that she helped Emma Stone write along with many other house maids about the cruelty that southern people in Jackson, Mississippi are to there house maids, including getting the help of one of her friends who is also a house maid played by a really great and funny Octavia Spencer. Who literally chews up every scene she is in, especially a scene involving her and Bryce Dallas Howard after she reveals to Viola Davis and Emma Stone as Stone is writing her book that she literally after being fired from Bryce Dallas Howard for using the guest bathroom, she then returns the next day with a pie, but it's not just any normal pie as she reveals to both Davis and Stone that she put her own shit in the pie and Bruce Dallas Howard had two big scoops of it. It is a priceless scene, especially when Spencer reveals to Dallas Howard what she did to make the pie so tasty. It's great. Especially when she says it right in front of Sissy Spacek who plays Dallas Howard's elderly mother and Spacek cracks up laughing at Dallas Howard once told is really in the pie. Spacek replies back \"And you had two big scoops of it!\" Great scene. But really as much as I love the whole cast in this movie, the one to really surprise me with her performance as much as her presence in the movie is Jessica Chastain. Who has a southern Marilyn Monroe quality to her in the film that just makes you fall in love her automatically. Chastain is the one who hires Spencer after she is fired from Dallas Howard for the whole shit pie incident, but really needs her assistance in learning how to cook because she is helpless at it. But she tells Spencer that she needs to come a few minutes after nine and leave before four, for fear of her husband finding out that she has hired a black maid to help her cook for her and her husband in the movie. Chastain also has some secrets about herself that she reveals to Spencer later after a terrible incident happens to Chastain in her bathroom. Jessica Chastain has such a beautiful quality to her that it's just so sexy to see how hot and well talented as an actress she is. I truly believe that she the best young actress in Hollywood right now as she does even after seeing her in \"The Tree of Life\" which was such a luminous performance by her that this role really makes her shine and it's one to not be forgotten. Even Allison Janney was great to watch as she brings in a very well performance as well as does everybody in the movie. They all bring their A game to this movie and that is why this is a must see and should not be ignored. Director Tate Taylor has really crafted something wonderful with this movie as this is one of the best films of 2011. The movie has great soundtrack moments too which I feel is lacking today in movies as for me, the best movies are the ones with awesome soundtracks and this one definitely fits into that category. \"The Help\" is a very compelling, emotional and very deep and at times funny movie about black house maids in Mississippi and one thing for sure about this movie...it hits you right in the heart.",

            "content": "Based on Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel from 2009, and adapted for the screen by her life long friend, Tate Taylor. The Help tells several stories about the people living in Jackson, Mississippi during the early 1960's. The main focus being on the maids/nannies, and in particular Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). But this movie is also about that period in history, and the cages society built around people. So while Aibileen and Minny are being told which bathroom they can use, Charlotte Phelan (Allison Janney) is forced to fire her maid in order to keep up appearances around her bigoted high society friends.\n\nFilms about this time period are often hard to watch, because it's maddening that this sort or racist behavior was tolerated at all. And still is in some parts of the world. It's hard to understand, speaking from a modern more liberal perspective, how people could treat each other that way, simply because the color of their skin was different.\n\nThe Help however, approaches this subject with a pretty light hand, and focuses on the positive steps these characters take to shine a light on their situation. In parts very funny and moving, and extremely well acted by its phenomenal cast, The Help gently tackles a difficult subject, while also satisfying the audience's need to see the villain's punished for their ignorant racist behavior.\n\nAny complaints I have about this film are minor. At nearly two and a half hours, this movie is a little long as it tries to incorporate maybe one too many subplots. Jessica Chastain is great in this film, but her entire character's story could have been left out, and The Help would have been just as effective.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're looking for some well acted light drama, then The Help is certainly worth checking out. It doesn't present the more ugly violent side of racism in the 1960's, and even has some great moments of humor.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a very well made film, and would be effectively screened in HD at home on your TV, laptop or tablet.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nThere are a lot of great moments in The Help, as the cast are superb. But one stands out, and that's when Minny delivers a special pie to her ex-boss, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard). You'll have to watch the film to find out what's in the pie - but it's a great scene!",

I sensed Octavia Spencer's performance as Minny could win her an Oscar, and I was right, it did. Emma Stone also proves she can handle drama as well as comedy, and Bryce Dallas Howard successfully comes across at playing one of the most despicable racist characters I've ever seen. Jessica Chastain also shines as a woman who at first, seems like another stereotypically dumb blond, but is a lot smarter and kinder than you would think. It's a film that will truly make you both laugh and cry. 10/10.",

Bryce Dallas Howard did a great job of playing such a horrible and despicable character in this film, I wanted to hit her so baldy for being a cold hearted bitch.

I thought this film was very moving throughout; a particular scene that comes to mind is when a helper is betrayed after a life long service to a family. It's the most powerful scene I saw in a film in 2011 and my heart just sunk as I watched it. \n\nThe performances are solid right across the board. Bryce Dallas Howard is serviceable and Emma Stone shows she can do more than comedy. But this film belongs to the performances of the two helpers; Viola Davis and Octavia Spenser. Viola is clearly a fantastic actress. I liked what she did in Solaris (thought she was underrated), LOVED her brief but very strong role in Doubt and this performance just puts her in the next level of actresses for me. The suffering and heartbreak of this character just emanates from her; her performance makes this film great.\n\nOctavia Spencer (Minny) was a newcomer for me at the time I first saw this and I thought she provided some of the more light hearted parts of the story (which it definitely need). I initially didn't know what to think of this film and was surprised at the buzz it was getting. I expected it to be a bit cheesy. But after seeing it I definitely get it. Like the Blind Side, I think it's really resonating with people. It's clearly not the feel good movie of the year, but it's highly recommended.",

I do not mean I am going to condemn the whole nation for there is not any people in the world which would have no mistakes. But it is not mistakes but the ability to admit and confess them that matters. To make a blunder is easy, to confess and repent it is hard (or even impossible). I see \"The Help\" movie as a good and honest attempt to work out the slavery problem. IMHO if you put American slavery history and \"The Help\" movie into the scale I guess the latter may equal the former in its importance.

White journalism graduate \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Emma Stone) decides to write a book about the experiences of the small army of black maids who work in white homes. Her two earliest subjects are Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer).\n\nAt first, the maids don't want to talk, for fear of losing their jobs, which are essential to support their families. But the prejudice and just plain rudeness that they routinely encounter on the job become too much.\n\nTo provide some racial balance and comic relief in a somewhat depressing tale, there is a sub-plot of woman who has married into Jackson society but is seen by the other women as poor white trash. She, too, hires a black maid, but actually asks for the maid's help in learning how to cook and clean and deal with the ostracism she faces.\n\nSolid acting and production values all around, particularly from Davis and Spencer, make this fun to watch, even though the subject matter is heavy and disturbing. I thought this was based on a true story and felt a bit let down to find out in the end credits it was based on a novel. So I don't know now how realistic the maids' stories of abuse are, but it's still an excellent story of courage and standing up for what's right.",

In going by the book, everything turns out predictable and never takes any risk. Ironically, taking no risks was a huge risk by itself, almost a guarantee that it was going to be a failure. That is a shame, given that this is a very valuable story that appeals to today's society even if laws have \"changed\".\n\nWhat the film does good, however, is to transmit its main message despite its one-sided nature, and to deliver solid performances. It had been easy to forecast positive stardom light for Viola Davis' future since she stole everybody's breath with one single scene in Doubt (2009) with spectacular talent. It is no surprise, therefore, that she was given the opportunity to have a leading role in a thematic drama, and she does a job that defied expectations along with a very talented cast despite the flat characters. Octavia Spencer is the second highlight, delivering lines with style and good timing, and light humor in a refreshing way. Both actresses know the importance of acting, both in the terms of \"transmitting\" and \"reacting\".\n\nEasy Oscar bait that ignores the importance of the so-called \"developent\" of civil rights and the important black figures that propelled such revolutionary movement (but conveniently referencing it briefly), the events and the content of the film are forgettable, but not its story nor its black characters, who keep suffering today.\n\n55/100",

Each character is so skillfully and emotionally developed that at times you forget you're watching a film. The film's themes of discrimination are subtly presented and, while mostly focusing on the horrors of racial segregation in the mid-century Deep South, it also touches on two other forms of prejudice - sexism (the way in which women are expected solely to marry, have children and be possessions to their wives, from the WASP-y girls of the Junior League to the African-American maids such as Minny, who deals with an abusive husband) and classism (the way in which Celia, a humble woman with a poor country background, is snubbed by the elitist girls in Hilly Holbrook's circle). The story interweaves all these themes together, proving to be a potent outlook on the intense racial discrimination, gender stereotypes and class division in a troubled society which tries at all costs to 'gloss' over these problems. By the end, Aibileen (Viola Davis) delivers perhaps one of the most powerful lines in recent cinematic history - \"You're a godless woman\" - to the reactionary belle, Hilly. In that one word alone, the pain of long-seated wounds, the soul of an empowered woman and many other indescribable things are summarised. Godless is such an incredible term to use, a word which, while being culturally-appropriate to the religious South, sums up many connotations - evilness, hopelessness, double-sidedness, immorality, amorality, heartlessness, coldness, lack of direction or moral compass. One of the most brilliant lines written and delivered in film history. 'The Help' is truly one of those films that make you feel differently about life, both shocking you at the state of human nature, but similarly giving you hope that change can happen. My only qualm is one which some others have pointed out - the film does occasionally veer into slightly stereotypical territories. Now, I've never been to Jackson, Mississippi, but occasionally it seems that there is a tendency to focus on Southern archetypes. But, in all, as a work of cinematic art and entertainment it works superbly, and it remains as a favourite.",

I guarantee you will laugh with, cry for and sing praise of joy along with all the characters that you will undoubtedly come to fall completely in love with! Courage may have skipped a generation but determination for change and self-worth are timeless! The Help stars Emma Stone as Skeeter, Viola Davis as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as Minny-three very different, extraordinary women in Mississippi during the 1960s, who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project that breaks societal rules and puts them all at risk. From their improbable alliance a remarkable sisterhood emerges, instilling all of them with the courage to transcend the lines that define them, and the realization that sometimes those lines are made to be crossed-even if it means bringing everyone in town face-to-face with the changing times. -- (C) DreamWorks",

            "content": "Breaching the Racial Divide\n\nIn 1960s Jackson Mississippi racial discrimination was the norm. There was an indisputable social order and divide. People had roles, knew their place and lived life to the letter of how it should be done. Blacks were second class citizens with no recourse. At best, employers took them for granted, at worst they were treated as subhuman.\n\nWhen southern society girl Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan (Emma Stone) returns home from college she is determined to become a writer. Reluctantly hired by the local paper to write a cleaning advice column for housewives, the pampered young adult is at a loss as her nanny has departed service leaving her needing practical information.\n\nBreaking with the dictions of societal convention, Skeeter approaches her best friend for assistance and strikes an unlikely friendship with her housekeeper Aibileen (Viola Davis). A warm middle-aged woman who despite her own personal hardships has dedicated her life to raising white children, Aibileen is caring and genuinely loves each child within her charge.\n\nAs the era's societal injustice continues to escalate, leading white-gloved town socialite and racial fear monger Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) takes pleasure in doing lunch, playing bridge, dictating convention and belittling her elderly mother's private nanny Minny (Octavia Spencer). However when pushed to far, the subjugated Minny reaches the point of explosion, baking a comeuppance pie.\n\nUninspired by the column, bored with the mundane socialite-lives of her pompously proper friends and disgusted by the rampant hypocrisy in which they treat their domestic aids, the disillusioned and outspoken Skeeter decides to embark on a secret writing project. Influenced by a New York publisher, Skeeter sets out to write the revolutionary true story about the people who thanklessly job it is to prop up these prominent southern families; the help.\n\nThrough her connection to Aibileen, Skeeter manages to create an improbable alliance, befriending those in the tight-knit black community. Whilst collecting their stories in secret, a remarkable sisterhood of sincere friendship emerges highlighting the transparent world to which Skeeter actually belongs.  \n\nInstilling confidence, the courage to transcend their station and breach the titles that define them, more and more women come forward to tell their stories. With so much to say, the town comes face-to-face with the changing times and its own fallible morality. \n\nA beautifully observed and inspiring feel good fable adapted from Kathryn Stockett's 2009 debut novel, The Help is a sobering but safe film about a volatile subject. Its many layers provide an engrossing glimpse into the universal truths and limitations of humanity whilst graciously sidestepping the need for sentimentality. \n\nSharp satirical comedy actress Stone feels a little too contemporary outside her usual stereotype but rises to the gritty challenging; Howard is dastardly good as the patronising and despicable social ruler, whilst Jessica Chastain's performance as an ostracized white-trash blonde outcast is infectious, fragile and innocently endearing.\n \nDavis is a dramatic force of nature conveying the largest of emotion in the subtlest expression, Spencer is multifaceted with flawless timing, whilst Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek bring light-hearted but genuinely touching performances to the delightfully strong cast. \n\nIf change begins with a whisper, this movie screams out of the movie landscape as a wonderfully poignant and superbly crafted melodrama. A harmonious balance between depth of content and witty delivery it deals with pain but doesn't care to be painful.\n\nThe Verdict : Optimistic and uplifting about the affection and intimacy buried beneath seemingly impersonal household connections, The Help is mature cinema providing a genuinely gifted insight into a time often overlooked, bound for the Oscars podium.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 09/09/2011",

This tells the story of what america's bad doing was which was you know having black people as slaves but in this story their maids. All of the whites hate them except for this one girl named Skeeter(Emma Stone) who once had a black maid to which she considered her as her mother. Skeeter asks Aibileen to help her write some story's for a book she's writing known as The Help which is suppose to Help colored people so they can have an equal life with the whites. I would believe that their are for me two reasons on why this movie is heart felt which is Skeeter not knowing to the women who is she considered mother and all the horrible things colored people went through even when they were maids.

            "content": "Taking place in a 1960s Mississippi town, maids come together to write a memoir of how life has been working for white families almost all of their lives. This historical movie is heart-felt, hilarious, and is topped off with Oscar winning acting by both Emma Stone and Viola Davis.\nSkeeter (Emma Stone) returns home with the hopes of finding an interesting story that could help land her a big job in New York. As a recent college graduate and aspiring writer, Skeeter tries to persuade her best friend's maid Aibileen (Viola Davis), to tell the untold stories of working for white families as \"The Help\". This is highly looked down upon in the close knit, black community of Mississippi; but once Aibileen speaks up, the other maids seem to join right alongside her. These quiet Mississippi folk are in for quite the wild ride and they don't even see it coming.\nAlthough this movie is very serious and historically insightful, writer and director Tate Taylor made sure to stick some playful moments within these climaxing scenes, making it more enjoyable. When it came to Minny's revenge of her \"special pie\" that was made especially for her disrespectful ex-boss, Mrs. Hilly, you could not help but laugh out loud. Aibileen and Minny's friendship is nothing but laughter and playfulness while they are together in this movie, giving a light and warm feel to the story.\n\"You is kind. You is smart. You is important.\" A famous quote from the movie that Aibileen repeats several times to the child that she technically raised since it was born. This quote not only has importance behind it, but gives the movie a sentimental touch. Tate Taylors characters of Mississippi town women in the 1960s, although of different race, are depicted in the most excellent way throughout this movie.\nThe southern accents you hear in the movie sound almost hereditary from the actors. Stone and Davis do a wonderful job of creating a vivid image of their own characters. As Skeeter bursts through her mother's bedroom doors in one scene, she demands answers about their very own disappeared maid. We see Emma Stone portray a heartbroken woman; leaving us with this sick feeling of heartache in our stomachs. As well as in the end of the movie, facial expressions on Aibileen's face as she is forced to leave the child she raised, is the most agonizing scene of the movie to watch. We finally see a strong character break down and this adds a ton of emotional appeal to the movie. \nThe Help was written and directed exquisitely; the acting, emotion and message are overall above and beyond amazing. Not only is it historically accurate by conveying the struggles of African American women in the 1960s, but Tate Taylor does so in such a unique and effective way. With all the positive traits of this drama film, it makes it a must see on your movie \"to watch\" list.",

She decides to interview as many black maids as possible in order to write a book from their perspective so that white folk would see the injustice of their actions.  This is easier said then done, though, as most blacks are terrified of their masters discovering their contribution to this book.  Skeeter is only able to get two maids to help her; Aibileen and Minny.\n\nWell, the film IS manipulative.  And it's heavily flawed.  But the film succeeds because of a number of things.  For one, it's just plain entertaining thanks to an interesting premise and likable characters.  For another, the acting is excellent.  The characters are likable, but very thinly written.  It's up to the actors to flesh them out into fully dimensional characters, and honestly, they do wonderfully.\n\nThe acting highlight is Viola Davis as Aibileen, the protagonist-ish of the film (shares this title with Skeeter).  The subtlety in her expressions and dialogue delivery is astounding.  She sells this strong, independent woman who is forced to subdue her opinions and dignity to keep her job.  She is the heart of this film.  Not far behind is Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson.  Like Aibileen, she's strong and fierce, but she has an element of spunk.  This is a tired cliche of a character that Spencer breathes new life into.  We root for her, because we believe her.  \n\nThe white cast is generally less impressive, but they also have a lot less to work with.  Emma Stone does what she can with an offensively bland character (despite being the lead).  Stone brings intricacies that are not in the script, but she's leagues behind Spencer and Davis.  Bryce Dallas Howard has the thankless role of the antagonist, a blatant racist (though she considers herself a good Christian).  She's venomous in her performance, and thus impresses.  It's almost a shame to say, though, that the acting highlight for the white side of the cast is Leslie Jordan as Mr. Blackly, a newspaper editor.  He creates more energy and entertainment than most of the other supporting characters (furthering the myth that newspaper editors are the best scene stealers).  Also notable are child actors Emma and Elanor Henry portraying four year old Mae Mobley Leefolt.  A scene between her and Aibeleen at the end is heart-breaking.\n\nThe Help has a wide variety of problems, let alone the film's obvious attempts at emotional poignancy that can be seen from a mile away.  There's an unnecessary sub-plot about Skeeter finding a boy friend.  When she does find one, we don't buy the relationship, and none of it has anything to do with the rest of the film anyway.  This is a 146 minute film.  And though it's fairly entertaining from start-to-finish, it could have been shorter had unnecessary characters and sub-plots like that had been removed.\n\nAlso uniquely problematic is Thomas Newman's score.  On one hand, it avoids the cliche of including a swelling orchestra during emotional moments, instead offering reflective piano performances and some quiet strings.  The problem is that his score doesn't really fit the picture.  It's far too modern, and as expected from Newman, contains some wacky instrumentation and effects that are just distracting.  It may be enjoyable out of context, but it doesn't fit with the film.  Newman would accomplish a more fitting score for this time period when he scores Saving Mr. Banks a couple years later.\n\nThe Help is certain to annoy cynical audiences, but I think most will be satisfied with this interesting look at racism.  It's pleasant, but it's not afraid to bare its teeth on occasion, which pushes this beyond your typical feel-good film.  It's certainly not perfect, nor without ironic flaws (leave it to the white person to save the blacks), but it's charming and entertaining, and has real depth thanks to its talented cast.",

Although Octavia Spencer was very good, Viola Davis was outstanding, she played, dare I say it, that stereotypical part and was excellent; she was caring, genuine and the spectrum of emotion displayed by her and felt through her as a viewer is wonderful. I still find it so incredible that this sort of time period is so recent in our history and sometimes am perplexed to see how little some sections of the \"developed world\" had evolved or have even evolved today.\nThe source material is no doubt excellent, but this film isn't nearly as successful at telling this story if not for the wonderful cast and the chemistry between some of the characters. Very sentimental and I can't shake the feeling of wishing I could have been around then to see would I have the compassion and insight to understand the help's plight. I know movies are tailored in many ways to be relate-able in a generalised way and to say I can relate to this might be a bit arrogant of me. With that said, I worked in a posh, stuck up beach club in the states and was greeted by one member and in response to my question of the status of the members, she replied \"oh, very high end, you won't find any jews or blacks here.\". To top it of, I was referred to as \"the help\" at one point, when a member stated how lovely it was for us to come over here, find work and get to eat the leftoevers... bitch!",

I didn't read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick.

Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson's character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn't even utter a line (trust me, you'll know when you see it.)\n\nThe Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I'll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations. I certainly think this takes Stone into a whole new level.\n\nThe racial imbalances of 1963 are well illustrated in \"The Help,\" and will, no doubt, underscore how far America has come,.Either way, this is a powerful movie that needs to be seen..  5 stars .  4=20=13",

            "content": "The Help is a very entertaining movie about how a group of strong women make a minor dent in the injustice of segregation. As a movie, it does a serviceable job, but as history it comes up a little short. Here is a movie that contains a lot of fine performances and some nice moments, but seems to dance around the uglier side of The Civil Rights movement. By the end, the problems of the main characters seem to have come to a fitting, non-violent conclusion. Yet, the real-life history of this conflict would be written in blood.\n\nBased on the book by Kathryn Stockett (which I haven't read), the story takes place in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s which, at the time, was run by the brass-bound segregationist Governor Ross Barnett, who had the support of The White Citizen's Council that was determined to keep the black population in its place.  In social standing, blacks are subservient to whites and the plight of black women in the work world is cleaning the houses of white families.  They  clean house and raising the children while the white women fuss about their looks and their social status.\n\nThe focus of the film begins with a young idealist, Eungenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Emma Stone), who has returned home from college to find that the maid who raised her from birth is no longer working there for reasons that her parents refuse to explain. Skeeter becomes curious about the woman who work in her home and in many homes in the south. \"Who is taking care of their children while they are taking care of ours?\", she wonders.\n\nThe focus gradually drifts to some of the maids, mainly Abileen Clark (Viola Davis), a quietly wounded soul who lost her son, and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an open-faced, boisterous woman whose frustration at being treated like trash by her hateful employer (Bryce Dallas Howard) is quickly coming to a boiling point.\n\nSkeeter aspires to be a writer and has an offer from a New York publisher (Mary Steenburgen) to write a book of personal accounts from the point of view of southern maids (all anonymous, of course) exposing what it is like to work in the houses of white folks, raising their children and cleaning their toilets. This is an unwise proposition given the climate of the times. The white population of Mississippi is determined to stop the progression of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement and that has black women over a barrel. The maids around town want nothing to do with the project: they need work and cleaning houses remains the only work available to them. At first, the only two women willing to participate are Minny and Abileen, but slowly the numbers begin to grow.\n\nWhat I liked about The Help is the manner in which it paints the black women as individual characters, especially Minny and Abileen.  They both have separate and distinct personalities and both have different agendas.  They don't just stand as static, noble props for the movie to lean on.  Abileen's fury over her son becomes her motivation for getting involved with Skeeter's book and Minny's fury over being treated less-than-human by her employer becomes hers.\n\nTheir inspiration becomes the springboard for many other black women around town to eventually join in the writing of this book as a form of minor protest.  They aren't marching (yet) but simply speaking, beginning with a quiet whisper that eventually will grow louder and louder.  There is a beautiful moment when Skeeter comes to Abileen's house and is faced with a room full of black women, all silent and all eager to tell their stories.  That image has a contemporary symbolism.  How many black actress, writers and directors right now stand waiting to tell their stories, but are shut out by a Hollywood that prefers a Mad Black Woman, a prostitute, or a sex object.  The moment has more power than we initially realize.\n\nI like that moment.  I liked that message.  I just wish that the rest of the movie had been that strong.  For every beautiful, heartfelt moment in this movie, there seems to be a scene right behind it that clangs. Here is a movie with some really strong moments and others that feel manufactured and false.\n\nThe pure emotional heart of the movie is felt by the presence of actress Viola Davis, a wonderful actress that I've been watching with joy for years in films like Doubt (for which she got her first Oscar nomination), Eat Pray Love and last year's forgotten gem Trust.  Here, as Abileen, she plays a grieving mother who's quiet frustration over the loss of her son is felt in her very presence.  There is a moment deep in the film when she sits at her kitchen table and describes to Skeeter the carelessness of her son's on-the-job accident.  There is something in her eyes, in her voice, and in her body language that speaks to the wound deep in her heart.  You can feel the fury of this grieving mother.  This is a moment, I think, that will get her an Oscar nomination this year.  She gives the film's best performance.\n\nOctavia Spencer gives the film's other good performance.  As Minny, she is separate from Abileen in that she is more animated and more vocal.  Her dismissal at the hands of her mean-spirited employer leads to a job working for a young bubble-headed housewife, Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who has no housekeeping skills.  Octavia takes this young woman under her wing and becomes her mother-figure and mentor.  It is a nice relationship.\n\nThere is one character, I'm afraid, that doesn't work at all.  That is the one played by Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron's daughter - who occupies the role of Hilly Holbrook, Minny's pathologically racist employer, who is so full of unmerciful venom that it washes over into clich\u00e9.  She wants a legislation passed that would forbid the maids from using the same bathroom facilities as their employers.  This was a real issue at the time, but the movie plays it as an overwrought plot device designed to climax with a moment in which she eats one of Minny's pies, laced with a particularly disgusting ingredient (read this paragraph again carefully and you can probably deduce what it is).  It is a moment that might fit in American Pie or There's Something About Mary but seems wrong-headed in a movie about the Civil Right's Movement.  I was hoping that some humanity would come to Hilly with the revelation of a past connection with Celia, but sadly, it never does.\n\nI think that The Help is a good movie, a movie with some important things to say and some performances that could turn it into a great movie, rather than just a good one.  It is entertaining, but it is also kind of safe. It dances around the uglier sides of life in Mississippi under segregation and comes to an ending that closes the book on the characters with a lot of victories. We never sense that the struggle has just begun.",

The production design of the film is brilliant, making it seem like the real 1960s Jacksonville. These vibrant visuals make the film feel very warm hearted which is good considering its harsh racial themes. These themes are dealt with throughout the film and Tate Taylor has made them definitely hit home. But in some spot it does feel like we are only getting the tip of the iceberg. Some scenes feel undeveloped and the plot may not be as detailed as it could of been. But the clear direction and tone the film takes is consistent, making the film's flow work and the pacing is normally right. The amazing performances from the cast though is what makes this film so good and gripping. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer's chemistry together is wondeful and makes the film so much more realistic, targetting not only the relationships between white and black, but the friendships between the maids.  Both these actresses control the films emotions and Spencer's added comedy again brightens quite a dramtic topic. The use of flashbacks and story telling in this film also enhances the film's emotional draw and adds the needed depth to the films plot. Most significantly though this film tries to adress the conflict of white and black and while it may not be as detailed or deep as it could of been, the actresses work magic transforming a okay script into a film that is surpisingly refreshing and entertaining",

            "content": "Although it is fictional, it feels like it could be an uplifting and heartwarming true story that restores some hope in the human race. It confronts the heavy subject of racism, but it holds back from the full ugliness of the fear and hate that existed in the early 60s in Mississippi. While it keeps the tone of the movie brighter than the reality of the period, it still manages to make its point and its emotional impact. The biggest strength of the movie is the deep cast that delivers top-notch acting across the board. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are amazing in their roles. The depth of intensity and emotion of their characters is where the power of this movie lies. Most of the white characters do not resonate as strongly they certainly do a good job, in their own right. Bryce Dallas Howard and Ahna O'Reilly both do a great job of playing truly despicable and ignorant racist people. Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone are enjoyable as kinder spirited and more open-minded characters that audiences of today will admire and identify with. Even the supporting roles from Allison Janney, Sissy Spacek, and Mary Steenburgen make a worthy contribution that raises the overall quality. The direction captures the physical environment early 60s Southern period well. More importantly, it connects with the less tangible feelings of hate, sympathy, love and love within the characters. It will pull at your heartstrings, even if is a bubble-wrapped and sunshiny fictional story. Everything comes together with an inspiring story, solid direction, and a phenomenal cast, and in a highly enjoyable way that feels good. It also has strong replay value.",

As said, it has its heart in the right place, but director Tate Taylor must have told his actors to be completely overdramatic at every point they could, not just verbally, but with their physical motions as well, because after a while it starts to feel like a bad melodrama instead of a good, rock-solid drama. With that said, it is entertaining nonetheless, if way too sentimental sometimes, but it is still a movie that correctly focuses on how hard these people worked and the kind of crap they had to put up with from rich, stubborn rich white ladies. It might lean a little too much on stereotypes at times, but it tries to give a look on just how spoiled some people down south were.

Now I can't comment on exactly how accurate this movie is to the real events but I bet it isn't too far off. \n\nThe acting is superb all around especially from Viola Davis & Octavia Spencer. Ms. Stone, Howard, and Chastain also make you believe in the authenticity their characters. Allison Janney also turns in a great performance as the mother of Emma Stone's character.

The story, set in Mississippi during the 1960s, follows journalist Skeeter Jackson (played by Emma Stone) who decides to write an anonymous, controversial novel that offers the perspective of the black maids known as 'The Help' who work for rich white families.  A strong plot and brilliant acting particularly from Viola Davis, who plays Aibileen- the central maid in the film, make this film a delight to watch. It will warm your heart with its love and compassionate and humour and then reduce you to tears with the heartbreak and betrayal.  The film clearly portrays just how outrageous racism was in the past; the coloured maids are regularly referred to as \"niggers\" and thought to be infectious-\"they carry different diseases than we do\". They are ignored by most employers except to have a command yelled at them.  The film also reflects on how prejudices are often caused by a small group of disturbed people, who bully the rest of society into following their views and ways of living and how it takes a strong character to go against the crowd and do the right thing.  The only criticism I would give this film is that sometimes it was difficult to make out what was being said as the accents were slightly over done. This film has it all: comedy, romance, history, and an important message of equality that will leave you thinking for days. I would not however, recommend watching this with a new love interest- by the end of it you'll be a wreck from crying.  Buy it now and watch it again and again whenever you need your morals refreshing.",

This movie makes you feel that you are in that time and you experience the feelings that both whites and blacks had. Although The Help is a wonderful movie it involves racism that I wouldn't recommend younger people to hear and see. Not only is the movie about people who lived in the civil rights time, it's about a white woman wanting to write a book about the blacks perspective on how they're treated, the women they work for, etc. She gets a few servants to help her with her book abut without revealing their identities. \n\nThis movie was nominated for the awards Best Picture, Best Actress for Viola Davis, Best Supporting Actress for Jessica Chastain, and won the an award for Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer. On January 29, 2012, the film won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. These awards were rightfully earned but I think they should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. \n\nIt was a truly inspiring movie. The film isn't just purely meant to entertain. It has a theme to it. I think the theme is to love and to be kind to others. Don't judge people by the color of their skin or just something they believe in. I also think the theme is to fight for what you believe in. In the movie the book really expresses that. The things the that are said by the women who helped write the book does express the emotion that is a simple as using the same bathroom. They fought for the right to do so and though they didn't get it right away, they didn't give up and soon enough they would. \n\nAside from the messages this movie sent and how great the acting was, the way it was shot made it better along with the music. The way it was angled you could easily see the emotion on their faces. It could make them look weak, helpless, afraid, sad, happy, or it made them look like they are filled with pure anger. The music did just as well. It could make a happy moment happier or a sad moment even more sad. All different aspects of this film were just plain genius. \n\nI would recommend this to just about anyone. It's personally one of my favorite movies. I honestly wish that the film would continue on. Anyone who has a chance to get their hands on it I say they grab it and watch it. \n\n-TM, 8th Grade Student",

Bryce Dallas Howard (HIlly Hillbrook) has always been a favorite actress of mine and as of lately, so has Emma Stone (Skeeter Phelan), so naturally I would be drawn to any film with just either one them starring in it, let alone both. It was a treat to also have Jessica Chastain appear in this movie, she was simply brilliant as Celia Foote and played the character well, but my hat's off to Octavia L. Spencer (Minny Jackson) who, in my humble opinion, stole the show. She was just amazing and absolutely hilarious! I especially love the fried-chicken cooking scene with Minny and Celia, it was adorable and the dining scene that followed was really heart-warming, not to mention mouth-watering and gave me a torturous craving for some good, old-fashioned, southern fried chicken (unfortunately for me I live out West and my only option was KFC).... but I digress.... Overall, everyone delivered a brilliant performance and this was a real delight to watch. Loved it!",

            "content": "Jackson, Mississippi, prima met\u00e0 degli anni sessanta. Eugenia Phelan, detta Skeeter, \u00e8 una giovane ragazza bianca che, dopo aver conseguito la laurea, torna a casa dai suoi genitori, facoltosi proprietari terrieri. Diversamente dalle sue coetanee, ormai sposate e dedite completamente alla famiglia, Skeeter ha come primo obiettivo la sua realizzazione lavorativa. Per questo si concentra sul piccolo lavoro che ottiene presso un quotidiano della citt\u00e0, cercando intanto di intraprendere un progetto editoriale con un'importante casa editrice di New York, nella quale l'influente Miss Stein \u00e8 disposta a darle un'opportunit\u00e0.\n\nSkeeter si guarda attorno e trova sempre pi\u00f9 anacronistica la situazione dello stato del Mississippi, profondamente caratterizzato da segregazione e razzismo. A Jackson molte donne afroamericane lavorano come domestiche presso le famiglie bianche benestanti e sono costrette a subire umiliazioni e trattamenti discriminatori, come quello di mangiare utilizzando stoviglie proprie e stando ben lontane dal tavolo dove tutta la famiglia si serve. Aibileen Clark \u00e8 una donna afro-americana che ha passato la maggior parte della sua vita a crescere i figli dei bianchi e che da poco tempo ha perso il suo unico figlio a causa di un incidente sul lavoro senza che nessuno soccorresse il giovane. Ora lavora presso l'immatura Elizabeth ed il suo compito principale \u00e8 quello di badare alla sua bambina, per la quale ormai \u00e8 praticamente una seconda mamma. Minny Jackson \u00e8 anche lei una domestica, dal carattere particolarmente spinoso, sposata ad un uomo violento e madre di cinque figli.\n\nSkeeter, per il suo progetto editoriale, pensa che possa essere originale e interessante raccontare la condizione di queste domestiche di colore, proprio dal loro punto di vista. Aibileen, nonostante sia percorsa da dubbi e timori, accetta di aiutare Skeeter, finendo per coinvolgere anche Minny, convinta anche dal crescente disagio nell'ambiente lavorativo. Minny infatti \u00e8 stata licenziata da Hilly Holbrook perch\u00e9 ha utilizzato il bagno domestico, anzich\u00e9 andare fuori, come suo dovere. Il gesto, in realt\u00e0 causato da una tempesta di vento e pioggia che impediva di uscire di casa, polemizzava con la recente decisione delle famiglie bianche della citt\u00e0 di assegnare bagni separati alle persone di colore in servizio presso le loro case.\n\nMiss Stein, incuriosita dall'idea avuta dalla giovane giornalista, dopo i primi manoscritti, le chiede un racconto pi\u00f9 robusto, arricchito da testimonianze di pi\u00f9 persone, per far s\u00ec che si possa pubblicare. Minny, nel frattempo, trova lavoro presso Celia Foote, fragile e ingenua, molto poco pratica di faccende domestiche, ma anche generosa e soprattutto immune dall'atteggiamento razzista dell'\u00e9lite bianca locale, che per altro la snobba ed emargina. Purtroppo per Skeeter, stanti i continui atti di violenza e intimidazione contro gli afroamericani, nessun'altra domestica ha il coraggio di farsi avanti ad aiutarla, neppure in forma anonima. Questo fin quando, a seguito del brutale assassinio di Medgar Evers, attivista per i diritti degli afroamericani, ed incoraggiate delle imponenti manifestazioni del Movimento per i diritti civili guidato da Martin Luther King, numerose domestiche afroamericane decidono finalmente di collaborare con la ragazza, assicurando al libro la pubblicazione ed il successo.\n\nSkeeter divide i propri proventi con le donne che l'hanno aiutata, viene lasciata dal fidanzato che non \u00e8 pronto a staccarsi dal conformismo nel quale \u00e8 cresciuto, e ristabilisce il rapporto con la mamma malata che in sua assenza aveva cacciato l'amatissima vecchia domestica Constantine per futili motivi. Ora la ragazza pu\u00f2 lasciare Jackson e raggiungere New York per seguire il sogno della sua vita.\n\nIntanto per le protagoniste del libro, intitolato The Help, a parte la grande soddisfazione e la gratificazione economica, si pone il problema di affrontare la realt\u00e0 quotidiana. Nonostante il libro presentasse nomi ed ambientazione diversi dagli originali, il gioco \u00e8 presto svelato e le corrispondenze con le persone reali espongono le donne alla ritorsione dei loro datori di lavoro pesantemente bersagliati. Ad essere infuriata \u00e8 soprattutto Hilly, che si riconosce nella descrizione di un episodio esilarante ed estremamente imbarazzante relativo alla vendetta che Minny si prese dopo il suo licenziamento. Non sapendo pi\u00f9 come colpire Minny, Hilly istiga l'amica Elizabeth a licenziare Aibileen, universalmente riconosciuta come l'artefice dell'ormai popolarissimo libro, con la falsa accusa di aver rubato alcune posate d'argento. Tra le lacrime della bambina e la totale passivit\u00e0 della sua mamma, la donna, dopo aver esecrato l'odio che rende Hilly una vittima di se stessa, esce dalla casa con fiera dignit\u00e0 per vivere una nuova vita grazie a The Help.\n[it.wikipedia.org]",

Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring fantastic performances, so as Jessica Chastain, these all three women gave this movie the ability to be nominated for 4 Oscars and winning one of them. I loved it, The Help is a heart warming drama with a bit of satisfying humor, I loved it. Tate Taylor brought a fantastic adaptation to a very interesting book. The story is about: Skeeter (Emma Stone), a sweet girl who wants to become a journalist and gets a job at The Jackson Journal. She gets the chance to respond some letters about mades. She goes get the help of Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer), two mades with a tough life. The two of them, during the 60s in Mississipi, will be in the other side of the law by all the three writing a book in the point of view of the mades. Change begins with a whisper. The story is fantastic and I just loved, it really makes us think about too many things... Sow, The Help is an amazing movie and I highly recommend it, it has a terrific writing, directing and storyline. The cast was amazing, we had Emma Stone (#7, Crazy, Stupid, Love), she was great, Viola Davis was amazing, Octavia Soencer was amazing as well and Jessica Chastain was fantastic. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, it's touching, it's funny and it makes us realize how bad things were for African-Americans in the 60s, this movie is important and I think it's a remarcable movie that it's good to be among us. I'm glad it recieved all those Oscar-noms, especially the one for Best Motion Picture of the Year, wich it really deserved. Watch it if you haven't, The Help is a masterpiece, is a powerful movie and one of the best movies of 2011. I would definitely not mind to watch this wonderful movie again.\n\n9.5/10",

            "content": "There are very few people anymore who can claim authentic, first hand knowledge of the Civil Rights movement. In the same way that I wouldn't pretend to possess any particular insight into the fall of the Berlin Wall, having been alive during the 60s doesn't grant you special insight into the race struggle. The only people who can really say that they were a part of things weren't just alive in the 60s, but were decision-making adults with the self-awareness to adopt a position on one side or the other, and their numbers are dwindling. Which must explain why The Help, a film that simplifies and exploits one of this country's most strained periods, and does so with broad, stereotypical character types and exchanges, has been nominated for Best Picture. Or it could just be that Viola Davis can make anybody like anything.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns home from college, intent on starting a career as a journalist. Though her mother Charlotte (Allison Janney) is concerned only with Skeeter's male prospects, and the Women's Junior League, led by the rotten Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), seems thoroughly confounded by her, Skeeter remains devoted to becoming a legitimate writer. And it is the stories of Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer)-two black house maids with a wealth of insight into the bigoted world of 1960s indentured servitude-that inspire her to take the plunge. In writing down their stories anonymously, Skeeter shakes things up in the small town of Jackson, MI, altering the status quo irreparably.\n\nThe author of The Help is named Kathryn Stockett. She is white, and she was born in 1969. Not to suggest that the Civil Rights movement had closed its doors prior to '69, but I think it's safe to say that the world depicted in the film is not the world Kathryn Stockett experienced as a child in the late 70s. In fairness, Stockett was more or less raised by a black woman, and lived at least some of her childhood in Jackson, MI, but that's effectively where the similarities between her story and the one she fabricated end, as does any implication that Stockett had any true, first hand knowledge of the movement depicted in her book and film. This is not a small dilemma. The sort of characters Stockett feels comfortable drawing so broadly are, at best, endearingly simple, and at worst, sassy clich\u00e9s. That's not to say there isn't truth in her characters, but that the truths have been distilled again and again until all that's left is a caricature. Minny is probably the clearest example of this. When she's not filling space as comic relief, she's reminding the audience, once again, of the spectacularly disgusting act she, rightly or wrongly, committed. Meanwhile, she has 10+ kids at home, a husband who beats her, and loves fried chicken. Now obviously, there were enumerable black women in the 1960s that all these things could be true of, but they are, nonetheless, pretty lazy stereotypes, and Stockett's eagerness to crowd them all together at once is hard to stomach.\n\nThere is a lot about The Help that's hard to criticize, including a number of strong performances; Viola Davis in particular earned her nod, pulling an impressive amount of complexity out of a pretty simple character. And like a number of other films from 2011 that probably don't deserve the caliber of acclaim that they're getting, The Help is winningly sentimental, getting even me to feel something towards the end, despite being firmly frustrated by it throughout. It has no qualms about taking advantage of its audience, pitting a bunch of \"good\" characters against a few \"bad\" characters and, similar to Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, drawing on the preexisting affectivity of a societally-ingrained trauma (i.e. pulling the race card). What is particularly frustrating about all this is that The Help, even overlooking the myriad issues present in its depictions of race relations, isn't a very well-made movie. The direction from Tate Taylor, as well as the adapting, is sloppy and confusing. As just one example, an emotionally-devoid subplot involving Skeeter and a boy named Stuart (Chris Lowell) is disgracefully underdeveloped, along with going nowhere and ending abruptly. Sure, trying to cram everything from the book into the movie is a challenge, but there's nothing here to suggest that Taylor wouldn't have just as much trouble with a proper script.\n\nI don't want to call The Help a train wreck, because that's inaccurate. A better way of putting it would be to say that The Help gets from A to B, but does so in an ugly old beater, with really bad directions. The good news is that it got Viola Davis to her destination-Oscar Night. There is an undeniable \"it\" quality present in Davis, and the more people who get to see it and appreciate it, the better. It is, however, a shame that the Academy can't seem to make the distinction anymore between a great movie with good performances, and a 'meh' movie with great performances. A shame too that so many Academy voters are entranced by schmaltz. If the trend in film criticism and praise is to simply respond to what you feel, without analyzing the merits of that emotion and the journey you took to get there, then we're headed down a dangerous cinematic road.",

Now the incredible part is that Stockett and Taylor grew up together and are best friends. It was Stockett's choice to put Taylor in the directors chair, and her confidence was rewarded.\n\nSkeeter Phelan is an aspiring writer in the 1960s who gets a job at a local newspaper. She lives in Mississippi during the racist days during Martin Luther King Jr.'s passive resistance. Needing help to write a column about house-keeping, Skeeter turns to Aibileen, a servant in a friends house. Skeeter seems to be one of the only non-racists in her town. She realizes that nobody has ever written a book from the point of \"the help\". She starts with interviewing just Aibileen. When racism gets even worse, some other servants agree to interview with Skeeter. She eventually puts all the stories into a revolutionary book called The Help.\n\nThis movie has the best, most likable cast of 2011. And anchoring the movie are the performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Both were nominated for an Oscar, and Spencer won. I'd say that Viola Davis deserved it, but both performances are terrific. Davis's Aibileen is the narrator, and less sharp-tongued than Spencer's Minny. Both of these women are amazing, and are the cornerstone of the movie.\n\nEmma Stone plays Skeeter. She rarely does these more dramatic roles, but she absolutely nails it. Skeeter is a funny, smart, compassionate character. And the one we can relate to in this story. Emma Stone is one of my favorite actresses, and this movie is one of the reasons why. Love her.\n\nNow to my favorite character in the movie, Celia Foote, played by Jessica Chastain. Where has she been for the last 7 years? Chastain graduated from Julliard in 2003, why didn't she really start acting until The Tree of Life in 2011? Whoever the casting directors are that missed her should be punished. Chastain plays a fantastic character, one of the few white people in the movie that aren't dirtbags.\n\nAnd lastly, Bryce Dallas Howard plays the despicable Hilly Holbrook. She is a great actress. She really makes you hate her. It's funny to watch the scenes between Stone and Howard, because they both played Gwen Stacy in the Spider-Man franchise. Howard in Spider-Man 3, and Stone in The Amazing Spider-Man.\n\nAll in all, The Help is a phenomenal movie. Humor and drama are blended together perfectly. The cast is the best of 2011, with some of the most likable actresses. I didn't think I would like this movie that much, but it surprised me!\n\n\"God says we need to love our enemies. It's hard to do, but it can start by telling the truth.\" 8.5/10",

            "content": "The Help, announced as a number one selling book by The New York Times, exposes the life struggles of two African American maids living in Jackson, Mississippi during the  Civil Rights era. Through a secret novel, Skeeter and the maids of Mississippi were able to uncover the cruel treatment they received and racial tensions that existed in their town.  Due to its compelling story line, meaningful dialogue and passionate characters, one is glued to the big screen. This movie described the difficult topic of racism in the south, in a way that the viewer not only receives a heavy plot but is also able to connect with its story line. The two main maid characters, Abilene and Minny, showed courage and strength throughout the film to depict their life struggles and created a stepping stone for maids to speak freely about their unfair treatment. The script  allowed both characters to develop as the movie progressed by showing how the character's strengths overcame their challenges.\n\nDirector, Tate Taylor, captured the essence of the Civil Rights era through its costumes, location and setting. The location was presented in a segregated town which allowed the viewers to obtain a glimpse of the reality for that particular  era. Character's  homes, neighborhoods and costumes showed how segregation of races and classes were in strong effect. Both talented actresses, Emma Stone and Viola Davis, represented breaking the mold for women in that era with their convincing interpretations. Lastly, Cinematography was lightly touched through music, emphasizing moments of tension, fear and joy. Overall, the film captured one's attention from beginning to end  in an inspiring and meaningful way. \n\n\n\n The Help. Dir. Tate Taylor. Perf. Emma Stone. Dream Works Studio, 2011. DVD.",

But when it was announced at The Oscars for a lot of awards last year, I just had to check it out. Unlike most films, this movie blends comedy and drama very well and somehow keeps a consistent tone. The acting in this movie is great with a stand out and well deserved Oscar winning performance by Octavia Spencer. I'm definitely looking foward to seeing her in other movies. Emma Stone possible gives her most likable (and maybe best) performance. Viola Davis was fantastic in this movie also. The writing for this film is of course good. From a drama aspect The Help really compelled me with very emotional touching scenes and mixed feelings you have throughout this entire film. Now don't get me wrong The Help has a few problems, in the middle of the film Emma Stone's character dates a guy who she had no chemistry with, which got very annoying. Also there are two sub-plots, one about an abusive relationship, and one about losing a true friend, when both of these two sub-plots started, I was moved and compelled but then they just cut off both sub-plots without even acknowledging it towards the end. Also The Help is not the type of movie I plan on seeing again anytime soon. So even though I have my problems and nitpicks with this movie, I still really enjoyed The Help.",

It's a lightweight, overlong, manipulative and often clumsily executed film but succeeds due to a very good cast and a good sense of humour, which dilutes the earnest message. Davis brings a modest, reserved charm to her role whilst Spencer brings some much needed sass. Aside from an unnecessary lame romance, Stone again proves likeable as the smart independent wannabe-journalist, and Chastain brings a sympathetic vulnerability as the aspirational trophy wife. Only Howard pushes a bit too far into cliche, with her Stepford wife monster who proves to be ugly on the inside, and has a suitably yucky comeuppance.  In summary a fairly typical audience-friendly drama, but anyone with a sense of critical judgement will see the soft execution and wish it had a few more teeth.",

From their accounts it transpires the terrible injustice of southern society.\nThere are several dramatic episodes but most of them are explained in a humoristic key and they depict the domestic side of racism rather than the politics. There aren\u00e2(TM)t so many poignant moments and the movie seems to waltz through them making them lighter. It is an interesting insight in the situation of these hard working women. \nIt might not be great cinema but it is certainly entertaining and inspiring and, from an historical point of view, even enlightening.\nIt is a feminine film, 90% of the characters are women dealing with women issues-household chores, domestic violence, infertility\u00e2\u00a6- but men shouldn\u00e2(TM)t be put off by it because the storytelling is truthful and gripping.",

It was better than I expected and a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nThe Help is about an aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s who writes a book detailing African-American maids hardships on a daily basis. The plot actually goes into it premise pretty well with a nice balance of slight humor with careful serious drama. Most of the characters are three dimensional, but I have a problem as some characters who seem important to the plot never get much focus. One example being a maid who steals a ring to pay for her sons to go to college never gets much attention. Some other characters includes a guy who dates Emma Stone and a maid that raised her never get much development lacking on the impact these character should have made to the overall story. Nonetheless those little distractions don't take away much from the overall film. I really liked the cast of this film, Emma Stone actually surprised me in being able to carry a dramatic role. This film mostly consist of a female cast who all deliver great performances in their roles.\r\n\r\nThe Help was a pleasant surprise and I ended liking it more than I expected.

            "content": "The Help is a very entertaining movie about how a group of strong women make a minor dent in the injustice of segregation. As a movie, it does a serviceable job, but as history it comes up a little short. Here is a movie that contains a lot of fine performances and some nice moments, but seems to dance around the uglier side of The Civil Rights movement. By the end, the problems of the main characters seem to have come to a fitting, non-violent conclusion. Yet, the real-life history of this conflict would be written in blood.\r\n\r\nBased on the book by Kathryn Stockett (which I haven't read), the story takes place in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s which, at the time, was run by the brass-bound segregationist Governor Ross Barnett, who had the support of The White Citizen's Council that was determined to keep the black population in its place.  In social standing, blacks are subservient to whites and the plight of black women in the work world is cleaning the houses of white families.  They  clean house and raising the children while the white women fuss about their looks and their social status.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the film begins with a young idealist, Eungenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Emma Stone), who has returned home from college to find that the maid who raised her from birth is no longer working there for reasons that her parents refuse to explain. Skeeter becomes curious about the woman who work in her home and in many homes in the south. \"Who is taking care of their children while they are taking care of ours?\", she wonders.\r\n\r\nThe focus gradually drifts to some of the maids, mainly Abileen Clark (Viola Davis), a quietly wounded soul who lost her son, and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an open-faced, boisterous woman whose frustration at being treated like trash by her hateful employer (Bryce Dallas Howard) is quickly coming to a boiling point.\r\n\r\nSkeeter aspires to be a writer and has an offer from a New York publisher (Mary Steenburgen) to write a book of personal accounts from the point of view of southern maids (all anonymous, of course) exposing what it is like to work in the houses of white folks, raising their children and cleaning their toilets. This is an unwise proposition given the climate of the times. The white population of Mississippi is determined to stop the progression of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement and that has black women over a barrel. The maids around town want nothing to do with the project: they need work and cleaning houses remains the only work available to them. At first, the only two women willing to participate are Minny and Abileen, but slowly the numbers begin to grow.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked about The Help is the manner in which it paints the black women as individual characters, especially Minny and Abileen.  They both have separate and distinct personalities and both have different agendas.  They don't just stand as static, noble props for the movie to lean on.  Abileen's fury over her son becomes her motivation for getting involved with Skeeter's book and Minny's fury over being treated less-than-human by her employer becomes hers.\r\n\r\nTheir inspiration becomes the springboard for many other black women around town to eventually join in the writing of this book as a form of minor protest.  They aren't marching (yet) but simply speaking, beginning with a quiet whisper that eventually will grow louder and louder.  There is a beautiful moment when Skeeter comes to Abileen's house and is faced with a room full of black women, all silent and all eager to tell their stories.  That image has a contemporary symbolism.  How many black actress, writers and directors right now stand waiting to tell their stories, but are shut out by a Hollywood that prefers a Mad Black Woman, a prostitute, or a sex object.  The moment has more power than we initially realize.\r\n\r\nI like that moment.  I liked that message.  I just wish that the rest of the movie had been that strong.  For every beautiful, heartfelt moment in this movie, there seems to be a scene right behind it that clangs. Here is a movie with some really strong moments and others that feel manufactured and false.\r\n\r\nThe pure emotional heart of the movie is felt by the presence of actress Viola Davis, a wonderful actress that I've been watching with joy for years in films like Doubt (for which she got her first Oscar nomination), Eat Pray Love and last year's forgotten gem Trust.  Here, as Abileen, she plays a grieving mother who's quiet frustration over the loss of her son is felt in her very presence.  There is a moment deep in the film when she sits at her kitchen table and describes to Skeeter the carelessness of her son's on-the-job accident.  There is something in her eyes, in her voice, and in her body language that speaks to the wound deep in her heart.  You can feel the fury of this grieving mother.  This is a moment, I think, that will get her an Oscar nomination this year.  She gives the film's best performance.\r\n\r\nOctavia Spencer gives the film's other good performance.  As Minny, she is separate from Abileen in that she is more animated and more vocal.  Her dismissal at the hands of her mean-spirited employer leads to a job working for a young bubble-headed housewife, Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who has no housekeeping skills.  Octavia takes this young woman under her wing and becomes her mother-figure and mentor.  It is a nice relationship.\r\n\r\nThere is one character, I'm afraid, that doesn't work at all.  That is the one played by Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron's daughter - who occupies the role of Hilly Holbrook, Minny's pathologically racist employer, who is so full of unmerciful venom that it washes over into clich\u00e9.  She wants a legislation passed that would forbid the maids from using the same bathroom facilities as their employers.  This was a real issue at the time, but the movie plays it as an overwrought plot device designed to climax with a moment in which she eats one of Minny's pies, laced with a particularly disgusting ingredient (read this paragraph again carefully and you can probably deduce what it is).  It is a moment that might fit in American Pie or There's Something About Mary but seems wrong-headed in a movie about the Civil Right's Movement.  I was hoping that some humanity would come to Hilly with the revelation of a past connection with Celia, but sadly, it never does.\r\n\r\nI think that The Help is a good movie, a movie with some important things to say and some performances that could turn it into a great movie, rather than just a good one.  It is entertaining, but it is also kind of safe. It dances around the uglier sides of life in Mississippi under segregation and comes to an ending that closes the book on the characters with a lot of victories. We never sense that the struggle has just begun.",

            "content": "One of the most important reasons why writing in general is a very good life skill is because it is one of the many ways in which we can express ourselves and tell everyone else how we are feeling and explain why we are feeling this way. Editorials and reviews on certain subject matter, like what you are reading right now, are great examples of writing on a personal level. Sometimes, it's definitely tough doing so given the backlash you think you will get from what you write. In the end, it's good to express issues and concerns from both sides regarding a certain issue. A great example of a film that demonstrates the importance of this theory effectively is Tate Taylor's racial drama, The Help. \n\nThe film is set in Mississippi in the early 1960's and centers around a young white college graduate (Emma Stone) who has just landed a job as a journalist. When she has learned that her favorite childhood maid (Cicely Tyson) has quit working for her family and notices that her friend (Bryce Dallas Howard) has an extremely negative attitude about African-American maids, she decides that she wants to write a book about the lives of these maids and learn more about what they undergo on a daily basis. Among the maids who agree to share their experiences with her are a maid (Viola Davis) who has lost her son and forms a special bond with the daughter of the white woman she works for, and another maid (Octavia Spencer) who is a good cook but has an unfortunate reputation of being fired frequently due to her back talk. \n\nThe biggest reason why I enjoy The Help as much as I do is really because of the ensemble cast and the characters they play. Emma Stone is a very likable actress and I enjoy her in most of the films she's in, but I think that this is probably her finest role yet. On top of the fact that she successfully proves that she's capable of this sort of dramatic acting, her character is interesting as well since her motivations regarding why she is writing this book make her credible. In fact, I'd like to see Stone in more dramatic roles in the future rather than in comedic roles like in Easy A or Crazy, Stupid, Love. since I know she's got great potential and has good looks to accompany it. \n\nI also thought Viola Davis gave an exceptional performance in this picture and her relationship with the daughter of whom she works for was very well handled. I liked the connection that they shared and that the kid liked spending time with her more than she enjoys being with her actual mother. This relationship also effectively demonstrates the struggles African-American maids have with raising the kids of white housewives and how it affects them emotionally. \n\nBryce Dallas Howard seems to be having a blast playing the cold-hearted, racist antagonist and she's enjoying every minute of being on screen. Octavia Spencer also turns in an impressive performance as a maid who may be too honest to everyone around her, for better and worse. I also liked Jessica Chastain's performance as a Marilyn Monroe type housewife who is shunned by all the other women in the area who hires Spencer to help her with her cooking, but treats her with much more respect than anyone else who's hired her. Most of the ensemble cast which also includes Mary Steenburgen as a writing editor and Sissy Spacek as Howard's more patient mother are very good. \n\nI would be lying to my readers if I said The Help was without flaws since there are a few, but they're not too hurtful. One criticism is that the little bits of excremental humor (toilet humor, hurling, things of the sort), while it's better than most films out there, seems to be real forced and feels out of place especially in such a strong dramatic story such as this. \n\nAnother criticism and probably the aspect of the film that I most could have done without is the romance between Stone and Chris Lowell as her boyfriend. This part of the film feels much more forced and sort of puts the plot to a halt. While it's not really terrible and doesn't dominate the picture at all, it was unnecessary in the plot to begin with. \n\nThe main reason to see a film like The Help is for the sake of the talented ensemble cast and the colorful characters they bring to life. The Help is also well worth seeing for the main moral which inspires us that writing is an important means of expression and a way of making your points of view heard to other people. Even if you're not a fan of racial dramas, I honestly think you should check it out so you can have a better perspective of whatever overwhelming dilemmas these characters undergo.",

The daring move to write a novel based on the Hired helps point of view battles controversy, pain and punishment. But triumphs as a successful endeavor and the most empowering story of 2011.",

A strong plot, effective delivering, humor, morals, values, several colorful characters and portrays a time, place and side we often don't look or never seen. The only reason I don't consider this film as perfect, is because it is not engaging all the way. Although this movie for the majority of it is entertaining and holds interest, their are many periods through the film where I found it to drag heavily. And become dull. One can grow tired by seeing the same setting through a movie 137 minutes long.watching the extremely boring and suffering life of of lonely white housewives and black maids in warm 1960s south gets dreary after a while. Maybe it's just me being a spoiled white young man, but I grow tired of seeing southern women talk to each other and somewhat unintentionally displaying how boring their lives were. I just feel very removed from it. But overall everything else worked and for that I did love this picture when I wasn't bored.",

Some great performances also add to the enjoyment; Emma Stone played the inquisitive graduate, Skeeter Phelan with great assurance. Viola Davis as the central character Aibileen Clark was really excellent, as was Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson. Bryce Dallas Howard was also first-rate as the main villain of the piece, Hilly Holbrook. I also thought that Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote did an excellent job. Also worthy of note were; Ahna O'Reilly as Elizabeth Leefolt, Allison Janney as Skeeter\u00e2(TM)s mother, Charlotte, Sissy Spacek as Missus Walters and Chris Lowell as the obligatory love-interest, Stuart Whitworth.\n\nA film that has a real feel-good factor, it very much concentrates its focus on things from the perspective of the women, on both sides of the story, but in particular the maids. I found there were some very touching moments along with quite a lot of humour. It\u00e2(TM)s set at a time and place where a lot of things were changing very rapidly, particularly in the aspect of race relations and you can see a lot of ignorance and bigotry. I should point out that not all the employers are bad; there are one or two stories that relate how the maids were cared for very well. Over all, I found this film quite uplifting; one I\u00e2(TM)d happily watch again at some point.\n\nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMy Score 8.7/10\n\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos and links) on my blog at:\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/film-review-help-2011.html\n\nEnjoy!... :)",

It is well acted and makes for a good story -- just a different one from the story written in the book.\n\nOne semi major character is changed from a very complicated person -- sympathetic but hardly enlightened or heroic -- to something entirely different -- a converted true believer. Other characters simply become flatter and more \"stock\" than in the book -- though that may be inevitable when adapting a novel written in three first person voices into a movie.\n\nThe main problem with the movie is that it really does not attempt to capture the violence, brutality and fear of the period. In the book these things hang over the characters and there is a real sense of danger. In the movie \"danger\" is spoken of but hardly palpable. Segregationists (aside from the one villain, Hilly) appear more rude than brutal. As a (white) southern man who lived in that era I know it was a lot tougher than that.\n\nOverall, it is a good movie. If the source material did not exist I'd rate it higher. But being adapted from a much more nuanced and stronger work, it suffers in comparison. \n\nSee it. But read the book. And especially take young people to see it who may not be willing to read the book first. Because even glossed over, it does show a side of American history that the younger generation may not fully appreciate. Maybe it will spark discussion and maybe some of them will read the book for a fuller understanding of how things used to be.",

            "content": "One genre of film that begs comparison to its predecessors is the Southern Fried Roman \u00e0 clef.   Unlike most serialized fictional film fare, this genre is tied inextricably to the history of The South, which for bad or good, will always be a topic of debate.  The cinematic adaptation of the best-selling novel The Help places it smack dab in the middle - pardon my patois - of the struggle for Civil Rights and in the company of other luminary films such as To Kill A Mockingbird and Fried Green Tomatoes.   \n\nThe Help is told with the traditional female voice pioneered by Margaret Mitchell and subsequently revitalized by Alice Walker and Fannie Flagg.   However, that strong female narration isn't enough to make The Help memorable.  In the grand scheme of things, The Help will be as relevant or as memorable as Steel Magnolias, but unlike that vehicle for jerking tears and Oscar nominations, The Help lacks a stellar cast.   Only Octavia Spencer shines, in part because she's the only character with any motivation.   The rest of the cast pales in comparison to that of Fried Green Tomatoes, as the casting is very, very Hollywood.   Emma Stone's Skeeter Phelan is cute as a bug, but unlike Scout Finch and Idgie Threadgoode, Skeeter is passive and one dimensional.  Bryce Dallas Howard's Holly Holbrook is equally shallow, the obligatory protagonist mindlessly clinging to notions of class and superiority with a mustachio-twisting meanness that would make Snidely Whiplash roll his cartoon eyes.  Sadly, aging icons Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson shine only in supporting roles, relegated to the wings.\n\nThe Help breaks no new ground, rehashing a similar plot found in The Long Walk Home, but failing to engage the viewer vicariously in the struggles of Jackson Mississippi's virtually indentured domestic servants.   At no time do we feel that Minnie or Aibileen are in jeopardy.   We see very little of the backlash of the Civil Rights Movements in The Help, as most of the action takes place in idyllic, affluent homes.   The Help even lacks much of the characteristic Southern humor which made painful films such as The Color Purple and The Prince of Tides easier to digest.   To make matters worse, The Help panders to those responsible for the social inequities of The South, sugar coating the darker elements of the era and assuaging the guilt of the audience.\n\nWarts and all, The Help is entertaining, but not enlightening.  I can't recommend it for the one of the top 10 slots in your Netflix or Redbox queue, wait for it to hit standard cable.",

Emma Stone impresses as an up-and-coming starlet with some legitimate acting chops - she's not just a pretty face and she is not going to be typecast to comedies only (which she can deliver with expert timing as well).  Viola Davis also hands in a bold performance as the maid who first partners with Stone's empathetic character.  I don't see how Octavia Spencer took home the Oscar for best supporting actress; I thought she was entertaining but overacted her scenes terribly. Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney also hand in excellent supporting performances. Despite its heavy subject matter, The Help is delivered in a relatively lighthearted way.  You'll be disturbed by some scenes, you'll laugh at some, and you can expect to shed a couple tears, too.  The Help is one of the best films I've seen in a while.",

I say that not in a \"this is one of those movies that is so awesome and deserves to win a ton of awards\" kind of way, but in a \"this is the type of movie that people need to see.\"  This is one of those movies that deserved to win a ton of awards, and it did win its fair share, but it's different from so many other movies that win awards - unlike other movies, which I won't mention here, which appear to value the awards potential more than the entertainment potential, The Help is a movie that both tells an important story while also being entertaining.\n\nBased on the bestselling novel of the same name (because just about everything out this year is based on either a bestselling novel or a comic), The Help is the story of Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Stone), Aibileen Clark (Davis), and Minny Jackson (Spencer) as they embark on writing a book about being a black maid in Jackson, Mississippi, during the 1960s.  The film's protagonist, Skeeter, has just returned to her childhood home, after having completed a degree at the University of Mississippi.  Unlike her friends, who have all gotten married and started families, Skeeter is attempting to embark on a career of her own, and as such essentially stumbles upon the issue of civil rights and the idea to write a book using the first hand experiences of the maids of her friends.  Yes, this is going to go badly.  Skeeter comes across the idea after developing a bit of a relationship with Aibileen and discovering just how racist her friends, particularly Hilly Holbrook (Howard), are.  So she decides to write a book. About how her friends and neighbours are horrible people.  With the help of the employees of her friends and neighbours.  This movie is the story of the making of this book.  Oh, and also, there's a side plot surrounding the new job that Spencer's character has as a maid for Celia Foote (Chastain), a redneck who's risen up in the world through her marriage, to the great disapproval of all of Skeeter's so-called friends.\n\nWhere the book alternates in focus between the three women rather evenly as they struggle with the world around them (either as a white misfit or as black maids), the movie focuses far more heavily on Skeeter's story.  As such the movie does lose some of its character; the book is very much a story of southern black women during the Civil Rights era, with an insight into the eyes of a white woman, as written by a white woman.  The film does utilize many stereotypes, in its depiction of both white and black women, and fails to address many of the issues that the book addresses.  That just comes with being a film adaptation of a book, though, you cannot address all of the issues and storylines in a relatively short period.  The story that is presented does stay true to the book, and in its limited means does, in my opinion, a good job of conveying the issues of the time, carefully navigating between a serious tone and, at times, a humourous one.  The three leads each do an amazing job, although the film really is stolen by Spencer.\n\nhttp://ishreviews.blogspot.ca/2012/06/help-2011.html",

There are excellent acting performances by Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone and Bryce Dallas Howard.  While the whole film, writing directing costumes sets everything was done well, the acting in this film is its true strength, the principle actresses capture the roles perfectly, from a look on the face to simple posture, they are able to communicate the culture of a racist southern system and a turbulent time, there is fear and courage, love and hate.  The plot goes like this Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan is a college grad who comes back to her Jackson Mississippi town with aspirations of becoming a journalist.  All her \"friends\" are now married and having babies and having house maids raise their kids and do all the work.  Skeeter is a bit liberated in her thinking, she sees the inherent unfairness and racism seething around her and desires to write a book from the perspective of the Help.  The house maids are reluctant and scared to proceed, and rightfully so.  I would be remiss to not mention the surprisingly wonderful performance by Jessica Chastain as Miss Celia Foote and Allison Janey as Charlotte Phelan and Aunjanue Ellis as Yule Mae.  I don't want to give anymore away in this review in terms of plot or character.  Many viewers may get a bit moist in the eye watching this film.  Part of me didn't really want to watch a civil rights film, but i am glad I did, because The Help was moving in many ways.  Octavia Spencer won the best Supporting Actress Oscar.

It is a rich and colorful blend of emotions: it would entertain, it would make you laugh, but at the same time it would also confront you and outrage you with moments unthinkable for our post-modern society. \r\n\r\nCharming and with an easy-going pace, The Help depicts the turbulent social period of the 60s in the Southern states. Without being too sharp, controversial or angry, the movie manages to create similar feelings in the audience while at the same time remains a perfect family-friendly delivery. With a smooth touch of irony and honesty, director Tate Taylor depicts the society in which rich, conservative white families are faced with the gather momentum civil rights movement. This is happening in the most tender and touching way: through the eyes of a young journalist (Emma Stone) and several help maids. \r\n\r\nThe smooth pacing, the ability of Taylor to touch the audience and the mesmerizing cast ensemble make The Help a movie to be truly admired. Even if one is not impressed with the soft approach of Taylor, the cast would reverse any negative attitude towards the movie. Viola Davis(Aibileen)  and Octavia Spencer (Minny Jackson) are the stars of the movie. The former's grief of her lost family, her dignity and quietness are in absolute contrast with the latter's extrovert, free-minded and sometimes comic behavior. Both actresses human and heart-warming performances are contrasted by another mesmerizing performance: the one of Bryce Dallas Howard. Rarely, there is a character, a stereotype, that could be so appalling and provoking while being just herself.\r\n\r\nThe Help is a brilliant combination of polarizing emotions, human story, family friendly entertainment and stunning performances. It is flawless in every component and Octavia Spencer's Academy Award for Best Supporting Act is the least that this marvelous movie deserved !",

We understand a woman is beat up by her husband, but we don't see it.  We are shown a maid being aggressively arrested, but that's the last we see of her.  In other words, we get one side of the equation and not the other.  And that's why The Help can't be the hard-hitting Oscar bait movie it so desperately want to be: it pulls its punches.  But there are plenty of positives working in its favor, chiefly the aforementioned actresses.  Emma Stone and Viola Davis have an easy chemistry together, creating a believable relationship from the outset.  Octavia Spencer as another maid constantly hinges between authoritarian and submissive, a riveting study of a character who could hold her own movie easily.  There are laughs, there are tears, there are even gross out moments.  We come to hate some of the characters and love others.  Standard stuff for movies like this.  Only this one runs too long, with at least three separate endings (remember Return of the King?).  This should generate at least two Oscar nominations for Davis and perhaps Spencer, but that will most likely be all Oscar bestows on the film.",

            "content": "\"The Help\" is a richly told tale of prejudice and courage\r\n\r\n\tAfter my foray into less popular cinema last week I was ready to once again return the mainstream. Unfortunately for me, the choices were pretty terrible. \r\nI could either see a remake of \"Conan The Barbarian,\" which without the humorous charms of California's former governor is probably destined to be awful. I also could see the fourth \"Spy Kids\" film, just when I thought that series had been taken out behind the woodshed. \r\nInstead, I decided to cheat a little, and see something that was released last week, but was both popular and well reviewed. As it turns out, every other moviegoer this week seemed to have my idea because it won the weekend, actually moving up from second place last week. I guess no one else was that psyched about \"Conan\" or \"Spy Kids\" either. Sometimes, the public does get it right. I have to say, that's pretty encouraging. Then again, \"The Help\" is a crowd pleaser. It just also happens to be a very good crowd pleaser.\r\n\tThis particular period piece is an adaptation of a novel, set in the thick of the civil rights movement, in Jackson, Mississippi, one of the hotspots. Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated from college and, unlike her other white socialite friends, wants to start a career for herself. She has chosen to be a writer. I sympathize. While she initially starts by writing a housekeeping column in a newspaper, she eventually hits on an idea for a book.\r\n\tSkeeter, like all the well-to-do white girls and boys in the area, was primarily raised by an African American maid. With the Civil Rights movement in full swing, she decides to interview the maids of Jackson to get their side of the story. Skeeter sells a New York editor on her idea in theory, but the reality of getting the maids to actually interview proves difficult.  \r\nNaturally, racial tensions make the maids, such as Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minnie Jackson (Octavia Spencer) afraid to do so. But a dramatic turn of events causes them to reconsider. The women begin to meet in secret and relay their stories to Skeeter, in the hopes that maybe awareness can bring change.\r\n\t\"The Help\" is a crowd pleaser much in the same way \"The Blind Side\" was. It's a feel-good film about overcoming obstacles, racial prejudice, gender issues and building a strong sense of family and community, with just a little rebellion thrown in to spice things up. It has moments that make an audience gasp, appalled at the racism and intolerance that were so prevalent then-- hopefully, not so much anymore.\r\nNow, with a recipe for success like that it would have been able for all parties involved with this film to rest on their laurels and just let the concepts do the work. Thankfully, the writing and directing by relatively untested Tate Taylor was quite good, as was the rather extraordinary cast. Even the Thomas Newman score was memorable and suitably emotional.\r\n\tWhile the writing and directing were indeed very high quality, where this film will likely earn most of its acclaim will be in the acting department. Viola Davis has shown on several occasions to be an exceptionally talented performer, and this is no exception. Her one-scene moment in 2009's \"Doubt\" was one of the most riveting pieces of true acting I've every seen.  She's the emotional heart of the film. \r\nOctavia Spencer's Minny is clearly written to be the \"crowd favorite\" of the film, as she's given the most memorable scenes as well as a sassy and memorable personality. Emma Stone, while a talented actress, probably wasn't challenged as much here as she could have been. Skeeter was clearly more of a vehicle for the audience and plot rather than anything else. \r\nI was very taken with two other performances:  Jessica Chastain, as Celia, a white-trash outcast longing for inclusion in Jackson's high society and to Bryce Dallas Howard, who played the devious and spectacularly racist Hilly Holbrook, the rich white socialite who serves as the film's primary antagonist. It takes a special kind of actor to not only play a character who is designed to be despised, but also to do it well.\r\n\tWhen it comes down to it, that fact that \"The Help\" was financially successful isn't that much of a surprise. This is the kind of film a very wide range of people can get behind. That being said, this film managed to excel even past its expectations in terms of quality as well. It does not hit you over the head with sledgehammer moral lessons.  The film was both funny and emotional at the right points and at the end; you're left with a positive feeling. It's hard to argue with an experience like that.  I have a feeling this year's Academy Awards are going to remember this great film as well.\r\n\r\nGrade: A-\r\nEntertainment Value: 9",

Emma and Bryce were excellent too, especially Bryce...oh I hated her so much as her character 2 slice Hilly.\n\nTHE HELP is not a film that I usually go out of my way to watch, no matter how a good the reviews are, but I am glad I got hooked when it was on Showtime. \n\nDefiantly worthy to be part of my Blu Ray collection...I highly recommend this film.",

This film surely does enough justice to the book, although the book is way more detailed and richer than what is shown on display (what film-based-book-adaption hasn't). Its also filled with a lively cast and their 3-Dimensional characters, the strongest performance throughout the whole is Viola Davis as Abilene (a maid, more like a nanny considering the 17 white babies she had to take care of). Octavia Spencer also provided a funny comical Minny who somehow manages us to laugh about the whole thing, particularly one scene dealing with a pie. Emma Stone is the most talented person out there and if all she do is widen her big eyes and take down notes, hey! she portrayed Skeeter like no other. Bryce Dallas Howard as the evil-spirited, toilet-crazy Hilly Holbrooke who you'll hate so much and the lady of mess, portrayed so brilliantly by Jessica Chastain.\nIt maybe the most quietly-powerful and strong female-empowerment movie ever released this year so don't miss this one.\nFalters: the one thing the movie suffers is the scene-after-scene look in which you can't stick to one emotion for long because the next scene is just going to cut into a whole different feel/vibe. Another minor problem is the unnecessary characters put into this such as Skeeter's boyfriend.\nIt deserves a 78%",

The Help is yet another cloying attempt to wet the eyes of million of housewives all over the land. But, really, I'm exaggerating. Despite its shallow stereotypical characters (None worse than Bryce Dallas Howard's unintentionally hysterical 'evil' turn as Hilly) and sugar sweet, all-wrapped-up-in-a-nice-neat-bow ending, The Help does manage to sport a couple things that make it hard to dismiss entirely, mainly Viola Davis' performance which seems to be the only genuine thing this movie has to offer. She's the wonderful eye of this manipulative shit-storm (Again, I exaggerate. I just couldn't resist throwing 'shit-storm' into this review) Emma Stone is also passably charming, despite not really having anything to do. The Help's real problem, at the end of the day, is that it doesn't have anything new to add to the whole 'racism' issue. It's a fabricated story that doesn't remotely enlighten, despite seeming to think it'd doing the opposite. There's a very touching story here that's, unfortunately, buried rather deep under oodles and oodles of sap.",

The story is unique since it is told from the perspective of a young white woman disgusted with the discrimination she witnesses and from a black maid willing to candidly share her story. The film can be categorized as both emotional and inspirational. The story is about mothers and daughters, believing in yourself, and having courage in the face of adversity. The ensemble cast was terrific and I was not surprised they garnered so many Oscar nominations. Spencer was perfectly suited for the role of Minny and delivered a career-best performance that will undoubtedly be difficult to repeat. Chastain was also brilliant as Celia - a woman as clueless in the kitchen and she is about how young Mississippi housewives treat their maids.

But one senses Stockett also read Florence King, a fellow author who argues that every upscale southern white woman is a crazy bitch. That's the only nasty, sweeping generalization in this tender movie.\r\n\r\nThe help are black women, nannies and maids for white homes from the end of the Civil War through the battle for Civil Rights.\r\n\r\nEmma Stone is one of those crazy, upscale white ladies of the early 60s-she's fresh back from college and shockingly unmarried. She is also boiling mad that mommy (crazy, cancer-stricken Janney) fired her beloved black nanny. So Stone starts to collect stories from the maids and nannies: woes of being treated as second-class citizens, left poor, abandoning their own children while raising white ones.\r\n\r\nDespite the vacuity of their employers, the help-Davis (Doubt) and Spencer-shine like freshly polished silver. These actresses envelop what could have been stock characters. Their work alone makes The Help inspiring and heart-wrenching.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.watermarkonline.com/arts-culture/film/item/6501-screened-out-character-studies",

Cause you just did.\n\nThe Help's a wonderful movie. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring fantastic performances, so as Jessica Chastain, these all three women gave this movie the ability to be nominated for 4 Oscars and winning one of them. I loved it, The Help is a heart warming drama with a bit of satisfying humor, I loved it. Tate Taylor brought a fantastic adaptation to a very interesting book. The story is about: Skeeter (Emma Stone), a sweet girl who wants to become a journalist and gets a job at The Jackson Journal. She gets the chance to respond some letters about mades. She goes get the help of Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer), two mades with a tough life. The two of them, during the 60s in Mississipi, will be in the other side of the law by all the three writing a book in the point of view of the mades. Change begins with a whisper. The story is fantastic and I just loved, it really makes us think about too many things... Sow, The Help is an amazing movie and I highly recommend it, it has a terrific writing, directing and storyline. The cast was amazing, we had Emma Stone (#7, Crazy, Stupid, Love), she was great, Viola Davis was amazing, Octavia Soencer was amazing as well and Jessica Chastain was fantastic. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, it's touching, it's funny and it makes us realize how bad things were for African-Americans in the 60s, this movie is important and I think it's a remarcable movie that it's good to be among us. I'm glad it recieved all those Oscar-noms, especially the one for Best Motion Picture of the Year, wich it really deserved. Watch it if you haven't, The Help is a masterpiece, is a powerful movie and one of the best movies of 2011. I would definitely not mind to watch this wonderful movie again.\n\n9.5/10",

The Help, based on the novel by Katheryn Stockett, tells an intense story of race relations in 1960s Southern United States. Racism, misogyny, and prejudice all play factors here. Key events such as the freedom rides and the Montgomery bus boycott play factors.\nThe Help has also proved to be a film that audiences embraced; as it made $167 million on a budget of just $25 million. This is definitely a movie people need to see in these uneasy times.",

I liked that this movie uses a mix of comedy and drama, the comedy comes mostly from Octavia and Jessica, the drama from them also and the rest of the cast. Speaking of the cast, this movie has on of the best casts of 2011, everyone in this movie gives outstanding performances! Very powerful film to look at, has a great story, a top-notch cast, and all around heartbreaking, funny and powerful performances, also one of the best quotes used this year: \"eat my shit!\" very funny quote from Octavia Spencer, which has earned her an Oscar!

The acting in The Help is terrific, great performances all around. Emma Stone is the \"main\" character and does a fine job. Viola Davis shines as the lead maid and Octavia Spencer is solid as well. One performance that isn't getting as much attention is Allison Janney; she's absolutely stunning and I don't think the film would be as good without her. The performance for me though is by Jessica Chastain...a truly fascinating character fueled by a masterful performance. \n\nThe Help is a must see film!

            "content": "As much as I hate to admit it, The Help is actually a fairly enjoyable picture. Occasionally overwritten and often obvious, there seems to be some degree of actual respect given to the story and the characters, which surprisingly seems to go beyond the typical platitudes and glossy history that usually gets the Hollywood types so excited.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the trailer, jumping into my head were thoughts of all those stupid Nicholas Sparks adaptations that seem to attract the hoi polloi like slacktivist \"documentaries\" about African warlords (of course this begs the question: will TMZ catch Nicholas Sparks rubbing one out in the middle of Ventura Boulevard?). The cynic in me was ready to boil over at just the idea of such a manipulative film, a film which you can't dislike without being a racist, etc... But, and this is hard for someone with an ego as big as mine, when I saw the film I changed my mind. Don't get me wrong it's definitely manipulative, the emotion is never more than scene deep and seems to be around only when it's most convenient. I just can't deny that it's a well told story, it manages to be funny when it wants to, it recalls the feelings that it tries to and very rarely is it entirely off pitch.\r\n\r\nThe real savior of the picture is the acting, you actually like the characters and care about where they're going. Again here I was expecting facetious, one-dimensional approaches to these characters where the villains were Satan and the heroes Jesus, a la Schindler's List. It's easier to consume that way, but it seems to be unfair to the history and the people who lived it. I think this assumption was for the most part true, but it only tells half the story. The tone is so light and the actors give enough to their rather predictable roles to make it work.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not so much \"they endured\" as it is they endorsed, but it has enough heart to work. At least enough heart for the film equivalent of whipped cream, I mean it's version of the period looks like something from a Dr. Seuss book for God's sake.",

It had funny moments, but it had many more poignant moments. Its really a story of people\u00e2(TM)s courage and people\u00e2(TM)s fear. Its about that one push that helps someone reach their potential. There are so many relationships in the movie, be it warm and fuzzy or hurtful and dominating. These relationships are what grow and build in the movie.\n\n \n\nThe story was a little confusing at first as I was not sure what point in time the setting was, but after about 5 minutes, things became clear. The brilliance of this film is in the details; individual scenes and moments of genius acting by the cast. Its fascinating, painful, and a joy to behold. There\u00e2(TM)s Celia, the \"white trash\" outcast who so desperately wants to be allowed back into the girls' club and who is heartbreakingly unable to conceive a child. There\u00e2(TM)s Skeeter who ends up losing her all her friends and her boyfriend because of her \u00e2anonymous\u00e2\u009d story. The gains and losses and gains in the movie are what really tear at your heart and then fill it up again with hope.\n\n \n\nThe wardrobe, hair and make-up are perfect in setting up the class differentials. The set designs of the houses were also well-done and brought you into the time period. Excellent directing too. The scenes were well-choreographed and well framed. Each scene conveyed an emotion, a hardship, a friendship that was viewed in the way a scene was constructed as well as the lines delivered. Although the film tends toward the simplistic, e.g., there are no bad blacks and most whites are obtuse, Davis\u00e2(TM) character successfully carries the film displaying the ambivalent nature of slavery ready to burst out of its chains.\n\n \n\nIts hard to put into words the way Howard\u00e2(TM)s character made you feel (her acting job was amazing). Frustrated, angered, shaken, chilled. Its frightening to see such a thing. I\u00e2(TM)ve never been to Mississippi, and so the laws the state had against a race of people is such a foreign and revolting concept. History can be ugly sometimes. But thankfully it can awaken and educate us. While this is based on a work of fiction, the situations portrayed are true. You wish things would turn out different. You wish that boyfriend would come back. You wish Davis\u00e2(TM) character was not forced to say goodbye to the toddler she had raised. And yet, somehow, hope is left in the wake of all this. I appreciated the journey\u00e2(TM)s the characters took and I was left wanting more, despite the fact this was a 2 hour movie! I wanted to stay in these characters lives and continue to share a laugh with them.",

Much has been made of the patronizing structure-a young white woman, Skeeter, leads the women to contribute to her book -showing the strong, stoic black women as incapable or unwilling to stand up for themselves. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer give stand out performances as the maids, and wring all the audience sympathy you could imagine. Of course, given that this is a feminist tale, all the men are bastards or invisible, most of the women on the right side of the argument are brave and wonderful, and the women on the wrong side, poor deluded fools. Allison Janey -of West Wing fame- plays Skeeter's mother - the only 3D character in the piece, a genuinely confused character, and is a core part of the story of redemption.\r\n\r\nThis book and film is really about current US politics. The fight between right (Obama, the first Black President) and wrong (the same Southern fundamentalist racists we see today) is plain to the viewer, and like the historic 1960's battle, the audience is invited to support the right cause.\r\n\r\nI liked the film despite its flaws, as I was on the right side of the argument then, and I still am. By the way, though I lived in NY in the sixties, I had a black maid when my mother went back to work in 1961. My own saint, Annabelle (who looked just like Minny) was fired in 1964 for stealing money after drinking a bottle of whiskey she pilfered from our house. I loved her anyway.",

They are real to me. Viola Davis did this to me, with her performance being one of the best I have ever seen. She was robbed from an Academy Award by freaking Meryl Streep who I hate. The other actresses in the movie were phenomenal too. Octavia Spencer won an Academy Award for her performance as a housemaid and she completely deserves it. She was sassy-mouthed, full of spunk, and truly believable. The movie around these characters was great too. \"The Help\" tells the story of a woman named Rita Skeeter who tries to get interviews from black servants in Jackson, Mississippi. She wants the truth about what they put up with. Mainly, she wants their perspective. There are many other characters as well, but that would be time-consuming to explain all of that.

The details were the most impressive, like the way maids were 'passed on' in family's wills, or the separate toilets for servants, and the relationships between maids and their white employer's children.\n\nBut for all the beautiful Southern homes and gardens, the White Women's Council in their technicolour dresses, the sunlit vistas and poignant moments, it'd just too calculating, too safe to be truly great.

            "content": "\"The Help\" works as well as it does because it doesn't offer easy answers. This lovely and sometimes extraordinary film is not concerned with big sermons about clivil rights, religion or easy to swallow messages. The film is simply about behavior; how we should act, morally, towards other people, no matter who they might be. This thematic line is structured nicely throughout the film by zeroing in on a select group of people. This was a smart move since the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s is just too large a subject to truly flesh out in a 2 hour film. Because the film is about actual characters instead of predisposed, prepackaged lessons, the audience can take with them what they choose from the story (none of the characters have a major epiphany, each just starts to become aware of their behavior and effects, both good and bad- they all have so much more life to live). Surprisingly the film rarely gets melodramatic, and when it does it almost seems cheep and easy. Thankfully the films few flaws (structure, pacing, some silly dialogue here and there- \"You broke her heart...!\") can be overlooked due to the tremendous performances. Each actress is exceptional in their own ways with the wonderful Viola Davis stealing the film. Emma Stone is reliable here as always and proves that she can be funny and carry dramatic weight in the same film. I have always considered Bryce Dallas Howard to be a very accomplished actress and hopefully her scathing, pointed work will be recognized. Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain find a tender chemistry all their own. I have to say that \"The Help\" really, truly surprised me. I have never read the mega-selling novel from which it's based but I can tell you the film is a beautiful testament to American history and is a great display for some truly fine acting. For those who are turned off by sermonizing, preachy, obnoxious message movies (like myself), \"The Help\" is far from that. This is a tender film about real emotions and a subject that is rarely discussed in film today.",

No matter how flawed and hyped it may be, this spirit is enough to shine a light upon you.\n\nBased on the novel, there is much racial discrimination in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. African-American women are reduced to working as maids for the prestigious WASPy families, all organized together as a community. A young lady gets a job as a journalist and hears of what goes about. Slowly but surely,\nher project on getting deeply into the lives of these maids evolves into a novel - which poses some consequences for the community.\n\nThe film is rich and grand in many ways, delving into the old-fashioned roots of film while providing immersion with its complex yet fascinating story. 60's period trimmings are spot-on and add a sense of credibility. The score is well worth listening to. Excellent acting all around from the ensemble cast, \nwith standouts being Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain (an exuberant scenestealer), and Bryce Dallas Howard (a superbitch that excels in villiany). While humorous and feel-good, it doesn't shy away from being surprisingly dark and heartwrenching at times. Reminds me of \"Schindler's  List\", in how its emotional rollercoaster ride paves the way for a powerful message. It's no less compelling now than it was back then, with an eye for hope.\n\nMinor complaints: Some of the racism and tough experiences are glossed over, in favor of some easygoing Hollywood appeal. The African-American women seemed awfully passive and dependent throughout the film. At first, they were supposed to be. But they were still that way for the whole movie. It goes by at a leisurely pace, sure to make one feel sleepy afterwards.\n\n\"The Help\" is a timeless wonder bound to be a modern classic. I loved it.",

            "content": "Sometimes the catalyst for change begins with the simple flush of a toilet.  The Help stars Emma Stone as a would-be writer who, returning to her home in Jackson, Mississippi after college, decides to write a book telling the world how \"the help\" feels working for white folks all these years.  Of course, it's a very taboo subject and many of the black women are reluctant to come forward with their stories.  There are some irreverent questions and some pointed questions (\"What's it like to raise white babies while someone else is raising yours?\"), but it's not so much what these women say as it is they're saying anything at all.  Jackson, Mississippi in the early 60s, (in fact, starting with the murder of Emmett Till in 1955) was ground zero for the civil rights movement.  Mississippi, where Medgar Evers organized boycotts of service stations and was shot dead in the back by a gunman in the bushes in front of his home.  There was a real threat and danger in the south at the time for those even considering equality among the races.  \"The Help\" makes hushed references to these times, but more often than not, it focuses on the battle between the mean, rich preppy girl and the nerdy plain Jane girl.  While there is some bigotry displayed, it feels tame, almost censored in order to appeal to today's more sensitive viewers.  It's really two different films telling two different stories, and at two-and-a-half hours, it should've focused on one.  In spite of it's flaws, it still manages to tell a human story and elicits emotions that play upon the audience's sense of justice.  It also features some good, old-fashioned hollywood story telling, but it may have been just a trifle trite in dealing with it's subject matter.  Despite oscar nominations and award-winning performances, there's nothing terribly extraordinary about The Help.",

I was surprised -- the movie did a good job of adopting the story to the screen.  The strengths of the book, for the most part, were retained.  The excellent acting helped bring it home.

This heart-warming film was not only inspirational, but was a historical tearjerker, too.  \n\tSkeeter, played by Emma Stone, took the role of being a white writer trying to get insight from Mississippi\u00e2(TM)s black maids in the 1960\u00e2(TM)s of what it feels like to be them. Anyone that has taken a history class after this time period knows that trouble is sprouting all around the idea of a white person sitting down with black people to discuss how their life is, but Skeeter disobeyed all demands and secretly reported the life stories of two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson (played by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer), for a new book.\n\tOnce Skeeter\u00e2(TM)s new book got published, the whole town goes nuts in more ways than one. Some people love the book; others realize that this book seems strangely familiar to their own lives. This, of course, stirs up curiosity.\nI was pleasantly happy with the way this film produced the storyline for a well-known sensitive era for Mississippi. There\u00e2(TM)s a fine line that a story shouldn\u00e2(TM)t cross when it has a touchy plot, such as racism. This film does a tremendous job at twisting the bitterness of the past racism events that took place and made it, surprisingly, into a tear jerking comedy. I don\u00e2(TM)t think this type of story could have been told in a more warming way than how The Help displayed it. \nWhen I heard about Emma Stone\u00e2(TM)s role in this film, I had my doubts on how well it would turn out. Emma Stone, to me, usually plays a goofy, odd person that isn\u00e2(TM)t very serious. She blew my mind by how seriously she took her role in this film. She did an amazing job, along with Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and the other characters.   \nThe only criticism I give this movie is the predictability it gives the viewers. There really isn\u00e2(TM)t a part of this movie that is hard to predict, which can be a turn off for viewers to most movies. Viewers like to give their two cents about the suspense of a film, and are reinforced when they are correct about their prediction. But despite the small criticism, this movie is on my \u00e2must-buy\u00e2? list because of its inspirational touch it has left on me to this day.",

I can definitely see why this was nominated as one of the best films of the year.\n\nThe cast for this film was perfect. I honestly can't figure out a better person for any of the roles. The 3 leads all felt ideally suited for the role they were cast in. They played the emotions in such a genuine fashion that you could easily empathize with them. I was even impressed by the authentic accents they all had, because that is something that most actors struggle with. The sets and costumes also felt accurate for the time period. \n\nThis movie has so much heart it's almost overwhelming. I can't count the number of times tears well up in my eyes when watching, sometimes from sadness and other times from laughing so hard.
