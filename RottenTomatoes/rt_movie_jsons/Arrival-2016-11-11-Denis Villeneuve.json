            "content": "Arrival is by far the best movie covering the subject of ufo's and aliens. This movie is so beautiful from beginning to end.  Even the music is special.  You won't find the normal action you would see in a sci-fi movie, but it is more interesting with every scene. Don't worry, there are still scenes that make you nervous :)\n\nThis is also the most realistic movie regarding what would happen if our friends from outer space really did land on Earth. Though, Contact is right there as well. \n\nThe movie shows how easy it is for humans to make assumptions that lead unnecessary disaster. It also shows the importance of language and understanding each other, even when it may seem impossible. \n\nThe cast is small so you can focus on the theme of the movie and really think, \"What would I do if I had to translate a language from an alien race that sounds nothing like ours?!\"  Amy makes it look easy. \n\nAmy Adams delivers such an amazing performance and dominates in this mostly male cast. Her role in this film really inspired me. \n\nIf you are looking for big special effects and a war between man and extraterrestrial, this may not be your favorite movie. I still think you should watch it because it really does make you think. \n\nIf you don't watch it, the main point is that humanity needs to work together to accomplish the goals we need to survive. This is OUR planet and eventually we will have to put aside our differences for the greater good before we destroy everything due to ego.",

            "content": "OK so what I'm about to say is very simple, but i'll stand by it because it's true: If you like fantastic movies, you really need to see Arrival. You see I'm a huge fan of the UFO topic in general, I think it's extremely fascinating. I'm not sure how I went 7 years without seeing Arrival, but I'm sure glad I did.\n\nYes, Arrival is a movie about aliens visiting earth in the form of 12 enormous, mysterious alien craft. But to just call Arrival a \"UFO movie\" is not doing it anywhere near enough justice. The movies central themes are about human nature, how we perceive others and how we look at life and the way we communicate in general.\n\nAmy Adams has never been better as the reluctant language expert called aboard to to figure out what the mysterious beings want with us. Jeremy Renner is also very good here as well as the scientist brought aboard, but it's Adams who shines. I'd call it a must-see.\nhttp://themoviepad.com",

Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s.\n\nIts a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view.

            "content": "Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.\n\n'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse?\n\nBack to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.\n\nThe criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.\n\nForest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.\n\nHowever, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.\n\nJohann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.\n\nIn terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.\n\nThe acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.\n\nAll in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

On a cinematic level, this film is near perfect. Denis Villeneuve manages to create a synthesis of the real-world environment with excellent CGI, creating a more grounded,\nrealistic alien film that isn't very common. The score is unbeatable, with the heart-wrenching melody of Max Richter's \"On the nature of daylight\" swelling in the epilogue, emphasising the heart-wrenching climax of the film.\nOf course, Amy Adams is superb (as always), as she so fluently, pardon the pun, portrays a confident linguist who creates a realistic balance between her career and her motherhood. This is an incredible character that Amy Adams fantastically portrays. Jeremy Renner is great too,\nas is Forest Whitaker, but Amy Adams is definitely the star here.\nTo conclude, I implore you to watch this film! It is\ngroundbreaking, as it has not only completely redefined the sci-fi genre for me, but it has reshaped my philosophy regarding mortality and love, and made me think of things in different ways. The film forces you to delve deep into\nyour own life, it forces you to confront your feelings and your regrets, yet you're never taken out of the film - you remain completely immersed in Villeneuve's frighteningly authentic world.

            "content": "HEAVY SPOILERS\nAn impressively complex yet comprehensive Science Fiction/Thriller story that doubles as a commentary on the importance of language. As foreshadowed by the protagonists Louise (Amy Adams) initially interaction with her co-lead Ian (Jeremy Renner) this is an exploration on the universal necessity of communication between sentient creatures. This is inclusive of not only humans and aliens but of humanity itself. The film also successfully presents an argument for why language is the most important weapon. Not to hurt or destroy but to defuse a conflict and mutually benefit everyone. Several factors come into play that raise the stakes of the movie. The first is the inability to communicate which plays out a number of different ways among the nations. Fear and paranoia are exploited by both the media and internet personalities which leads to protests and an assassination attempt later in the film. Pressure is placed on the governments to give answers they don't have. Thus tensions are placed on relationships between the military authority and Louise which slowly escalates and crescendos at the end and almost results in the death of our protagonists. The next factor is miscommunication which plays out as the alien language translating to \"gift weapon\" to each major location the aliens landed. This causes mistrust and fear between the world powers and they cut off communication for each other. Slowly but surely they begin to mobilize against the aliens believing them to want planetary control. Louise frantically tries to deescalate the situation to no avail. She knowing communication is the best way to solve this and believing the aliens to be friendly takes matters into her own hands and goes to talk to the aliens herself. Entering the chamber she  exposes herself to their atmospheric accommodations and talks face to...head? With one of the aliens whom she has come to know. She learns that they do indeed wish to gift them all a weapon but the weapon is not a scientific advancement or a destructive tool of conquest. Each power was given a piece of their language. Before departing Louise is given their entire language by the alien and when she returns she realizes she can understand it. She also begins to realize something else. Throughout the film we see what we thought were flashbacks to Louise's life and the death of her daughter. But it turns out that the film utilizes the theory that language determines the way your brain thinks and see's the world. Using this they introduce the concept that the alien language is a palindrome. Its the same backwards as it is forwards. Because of these things Louise is not having flash backs but flash forwards due to her increasing exposure to their language. Now she is able to see how everything in her life will play out and manipulate time to gain access to the phone number of the leading force of hostility towards the aliens. Using language she is able to reach him in an emotional place due to her ability to hear what she said in the future and prevent the attack on the aliens. Using only her words and the capabilities of language she prevents a major military conflict. The film wraps up with a corny but cute \"I wouldn't change a thing\" moment that is flipped on its head between our two leads as Louise is literally choosing to not change a single decision she has yet to make. However I will say she is able to see her own divorce in the future and it is implied she allowed things to happen the same way so that leaves me questioning why she would choose to go down the same path and not try and prevent it. But I suppose she can only remember the future not feel it in the moment so perhaps the nuance is that she has fallen in love with him currently and knows someday things won't be the same and she will fall out of love. It is human nature to do something that you desire despite knowing it will only end in pain so I suppose it does make sense but it also could be because she wants to experience the existence of her daughter and all the love and happiness that she has brought but also has yet to bring. Brings up a lot of ethical questions of selfishness and selflessness, is she being selfish in going down the same path or selfless in giving her daughter life even for a short time. Either way this is a movie that rewards thinking and knows how to subvert expectations in a satisfying way. In addition it presents a compelling argument about language and an entertaining exploration of a potentially possible scenario someday. I just wish the visuals weren't so cold and gray. It felt very bleak and for me that just makes it less appealing to ever revisit. But things are rarely perfect and this was still a hit on the nail for me. Give it a watch if it sounds like your thing.",

Their mysterious presence and the tense build-up to their arrival is expertly handled. The characters trying to learn and understand their unique language in an effort to communicate with them was fascinating to watch unfold. The discoveries and tension keep building up until they come to fruition in an amazing climax. Amy Adams is sympathetic, albeit a bit on the meeker side for someone who's such an accomplished scientific figure. But still an engaging performance nonetheless. My only major issue is the ending resolution, where it's revealed that (SPOILERS!) Amy Adams's character knew that her daughter was going to die of cancer and cause her husband to leave in grief, yet still chooses to go along with it anyway because it's \"worth it\". Which is frustrating, because I could easily see this working if this was the only way she could preserve peace between Earth and the aliens via those time visions she received. But the movie implies that she still has the choice to not go through with it. That she merely chooses to do so out of some forced attachment to an imaginary daughter that she only saw for a couple of visions, some of which involved her in immense pain and grief during her final years of life. It almost comes across as some unsettling warped pro-life angle to this messed up scenario. Why give someone life if you know they're going to die a horrible death in their youth and cause so much misery? Why not just adopt? There's not even abortion involved, it's just the absence of procreation. And this all could've been avoided if they just implied that this had to happen, that this wasn't her choice. It would've made the ending that mirrors the beginning so much more powerful with the movie's themes about time being a circle. I know it's just one flaw, but it's a major one that really drags down the movie's otherwise fantastic score for me. Regardless, the visual artistry and alien linguistics plotline more than make up for the movie's drawbacks. A skyrocketing experience like no other.",

Just like the previous movies, the second time viewing with some prior understanding made me appreciate this piece of art. \n\nThe music and cinematography resolved so well with each other. Whenever the characters came into the spacecraft, it was an entirely immersive, quiet, yet slightly intense because I, like the characters, were stepping into the unknown. Like Enemy, the whole scenes were filled with one blue color, creating a sad yet again immersive tone. \n\nJust as immersive was the performance by Amy Adams. Her character had to deal with a trauma while talking to these aliens. Such sadness filled her face, as well as the voiceover. \n\nThis time Denis explored the dual nature of language. It can divide as well as unite people. It's a weapon as well as a gift. Denis cleverly reaffirmed the main purpose of language as a gift by capitalizing on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Not only that, this usage also became a way to beautifully explore the nature of time and apply it to build Amy Adams's character and how she confronted her trauma. I just loved how everything seamlessly coalesced and nothing felt forced.\n\nBesides that one exposition scene that explained the nature of writing and language, I don't have any problem with this movie.\n\nOverall, a beautiful, emotional, and immersive movie with a daring theme about a common tool that can unite us all. 9.5/10",

            "content": "Some claim that Denis Villeneuve is the new Christopher Nolan. Admittedly, both clearly have a drive for the extraordinary. But a look beneath the surface shows that the two directors can hardly be compared. While Nolan repeatedly overdoes it with his penchant, as he did most recently with Tenet, Villeneuve's Arrival shows that, as a presumed Nolan counterpart, he takes a completely different approach. In contrast to Nolan's repetitive brainfuck, the Canadian created what is arguably one of the most intelligent sci-fi films of recent years.\n\nWhat Villeneuve clearly has ahead of Nolan is his knack with the ensembles in his films. No actress could have embodied the lead role of linguist Louise Banks better than Amy Adams. Although Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are also likable in the supporting roles of a physicist and military colonel, Adams carries the film single-handedly. The character is fragile and conflicted from the start, and because of intimate glimpses into her private and thought life, we always know why that is. The way Adams manages to suggest this rollercoaster ride of emotions is quite great. She usually has barely seconds to catch her breath before she has to move on from profound thoughts about her deceased daughter back to the mysterious enigma of the aliens landing on Earth. Even the way Adams behaves in some scenes while trying to communicate with the mysterious beings is comprehensible. You immediately want to join her and assist in the difficult research. This makes for a complex film character with numerous facets that you can empathise with at all times. Yes, Adams often plays the broken woman with a dark past. Only in Arrival she certainly doesn't always come across as an emotional wreck, but rather determined and enthusiastic about her responsibility despite her stroke of fate. Jeremy Renner's character, the physicist Ian Donnelly, is a nice touch and shares many interesting scenes with Louise. However, he is overshadowed by Adam throughout. This has little to do with Renner's performance, which is excellent as always, but the character simply lacks complexity. The same applies to Whitaker's Colonel Weber, who, after an initially strong presence, plays second fiddle more and more as time goes on. This is also less due to Whitaker's acting than to the lack of X-factor in his character.\n\nSo why is Arrival now so much more thoughtful and better than, say, Tenet? Villeneuve shows such a fine hand in his directing that the film never comes across like one of the many forced sci-fi flicks with mega effects and explosions, but rather resembles a slowly told thriller. Not because there is so much suspense, Arrival is no Sicario by any means, but until the end you don't know what the aliens' intention is and to what extent the protagonist's life plays a role. The final leaves you stunned, amazed and above all overwhelmed. Despite a few hangs in the middle, Arrival is another Villeneuve masterpiece with which the best director of our time revolutionised science fiction with his unique signature.",

This film is all about communication and how language impacts how we live life, so by conveying this message through the use of aliens invading earth (a cliche narrative choice with Sci Fi) Villeneuve is risking being ordinary, but becomes an original, imaginative filmmaker in the process.\n\nThe film has excellent performances from Amy Adama and Jeremy Renner, alongside it's beautiful cinematography and soundtrack shot by Bradford Young and composed by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson respectively. The incredible screenplay via Eric Heisserer puts the cherry on top. An all round complete picture.\n\nThe film has many deep meanings which would suggest multiple viewings are essential in understanding the films complete idea, but Arrival is an underrated gem in my opinion and highlights Villeneuve's status as one of Hollywood's prominent directors working today. \n\nA superb film.\n\n\u2018Despite knowing the journey... and where it leads...

Adams is good in the lead role, although I still view her best leading work as choosing good roles rather than driving a film forward. The same goes for Renner and Whittaker. Stuhlbarg shows his range in a grave departure from A Serious Man, although his character is quite simple. The drama unfolds with a tranquilising, captivating stillness provoking profound reflection. The story's beauty transcends the science fiction genre as a meditation on moral dilemma while never forgetting its roots. I have never witnessed a film that so effortlessly weaves multiple areas and surfaces in a fantastical yet somehow bare manner. The only reason that this is not five stars is that characters outside of Renner and Adams are quite uninteresting.",

Also, I would say the end disappointed me a bit because it was really complicated and I'm not sure I understand everything. On the other hand, the end solves a problem that I found during the movie. Indeed, maybe you'll find the movie chaotic with his timeline, but the end explains everything. Now, the movie has great points too, not just bad. I would say that it goes in a better direction than a lot of sci-fi movie with this \"Aliens psychology\" sort of thing and it exploit a much different and deep subject into the alien touch. Also, the images a pretty good. I really liked the dark environment and the mist everywhere, it was visually well-done. So, despite the fact that I wasn't really touched by the movie with a really confusing end, I would say this film scores great because of its acting, visuals, wall-breaking type of sci-fi and a great scenario.

Near the end of the movie we find out that the ill daughter flashbacks are actually the future visions which is fine but the fact we never find out what's the big thread that aliens need human help in 3000 years, is quite a letdown. The acting is nothing to write home about. 5/10 because I see how it can give some people a little bit to think about and it somehow resembles the vibe of \"Annihilation\", a bit newer and better movie.",

Forest Whitaker (Plays: Colonel Weber) was also amazing, very cool performance that surprised me. Jeremy Renner's character (Ian Donnelly) was so useless, even the character said that in one of the scenes, he said that he is nothing without Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and she is the one who is doing everything.\n\nThe directing was so amazing wasn't surprised that Denis Villeneuve was nominated for an Oscar. \n\nThe cinematography and colors were so amazing, especially that shot when we first see the aliens aircraft, the incredible long take encompassing the entire area with the fog surrounding it, loved it so much. One thing that grabbed my attention is the whole \"color tone\", the off white-ish color that is dark, gives u that feeling of fear, feeling of confusion of why these aliens are here, it was just amazing and really loved it so much.\n\nThe music was so cool, it builds a lot of emotions inside of you.\n\nthe production design was so beautiful and simple, deserved an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe sound editing and sound mixing were two things that were really powerful and although I didn't watch that movie on the big screen with all the sound effects that are in the theatre, but it was still a thing that was so amazing and grabbed my attention.\n\nArrival is a movie that is not the best but also not the worst, the 3rd act or to be specific; the ending makes you want to watch the movie again and makes you think about the movie from its begging. A great story with a great directing, cinematography and production design but felt like it could've been way better but \nFor sure recommend it.\n\nMy rating is: 8/10",

Highly grounded in sci-fi is what makes this one of my favourite films.\n\nRewatched it for the first, after 3 years. Remember vividly a lot of stuffs, one the few movies I used to constantly think about 3 years ago. Script is a masterpiece, way to tell that story in that way, beautiful. The concept of time travel seen in a new light.\n\nThe soundtrack is addicting, was listening to it out loud and my mother told me to stop it because it felt like 'someone was dieing', I replied HannaH.\n\nThe cinematography of that first scene of spaceship was gorgeous. Many social commentary about conspiracy theory, majority of them were correct as we can see from pandemic. I actually gained a lot of respect for linguistics, always thought of it as a useless study area but boy was I wrong.\n\nRewatching it, caught many foreshadowing. The movie literally says everything at the beginning.\n\nLoved the themes, her taking the decision of have that child. Its not about the goodbyes but the memories we make before the goodbyes. She would rather find & lost than never get it. The parallelism with one the heptapods(alien) dieing yet the other one not caring because their time isn't linear, they could go back in memory.\n\nScript was smart to have that Chinese official scene, many will say it was plot convenience but I have head canon of her later telling the Chinese official to tell her everything later on, hence he had a line 'I don't know how your brain/memory works'\n\nThe movie did answer why aliens came but it wasn't concerned with that,  it was more about humanity and their perspective & memories. This is CINEMA.\n\nType of movie I will end and sleep on thinking about it. The calm and eerie feeling filled me after the credits.",

It took me a while to think about this review. Also, I can't stress enough how much this film reminds me of Shutter Island. I mean come on! They both use the same song \"On the Nature of Daylight\". The plots both seem familiar to each other. But hey, that's just my opinion. Overall, Arrival is a wonderfully directed film, with a great cast, and stunning production design. It's also a film that plays with our minds. And in my opinion, it succeeds at that.",

It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and they do an amazing job at keeping your attention through the movie. I love seeing actors from big-budget blockbusters getting into new things that they normally don't do it shows they are still amazing actors. I thought that Amy Adams was brilliant in this movie she has so much emotion through the movie. The cinematography was amazing and the sound design I thought was amazing too. I thought that everything in this movie is amazing, the editing, and the script are very good too. I love the way they used the sci-fi elements in the movie combining what we love about that and film making to make a masterpiece. They do a good job at flashbacks they don't bring you out of the story like other films will do, they do a clever job of making it flow. They also do a good job at handling the time travel aspects of the movie its not like other movies in the way they approached it I thought they did an amazing job at it. I think they did an amazing job at the score of the movie, it really advances the movie and sets and tone for the movie.

The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (\"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned\"). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.",

What did Louise's flashbacks have to tell us?\n\nBecause I saw the movie as a mystery, I was looking for clues and IMO tipped its hand WAY too early. \"If you want science, call your father\", was the first big hint that these flashbacks were flash forwards and that Ian was Hannah's father.

I feel sorry for those who call it boring because, if you truly were bored, you either didn't understand it, you have a short attention span and can only focus long enough to see movement and shiny things, or you have no feelings. Either way, you are disadvantaged and the poorer for missing out on appreciating one of the most profound films ever produced. Why is it a good film? First, there are no films that defy being categorized like this one. Sure, it's called a science fiction but, honestly, its way more than that.  In terms of a genre, it's actually a combination of a science fiction with squid monsters, an intellectual study on communication and how it might affect your thoughts and actions, an exploration into the nature of time and its perception, a commentary on human behavior and the state of mankind such as man's tendency to jump to conclusions and make rash decisions, a mystery to be solved, a romance, a story of great grief and loss and, finally and most importantly, a bitter sweet statement on the value and beauty of life, all life, even life that doesn't last that, in the end, includes everyone's life.  Secondly, Arrival does all of these things very well and weaves each element together seamlessly into something beautiful and thought provoking.  It makes a statement like a philosopher.  Like a great poem or piece of art, it forces one to think, to wonder, to feel, to understand love, to feel grief and loss, to ponder what is and what is important.  I'm richer for having seen it and I give credit to those who achieved it.  I can't believe they were able to do it and to do it so well.",

The Arrival parts from a premise of a friendly first contact between aliens and humans, when humans tries to develop a communication with the Heptapods.\nOne of the things that I have admired in this movie was its atmosphere, the way the movie makes you feel immersed, the way that the events happen, the way humanity reacts from an alien visit from the movie tries hard to make a realistic scenario and succesfully achieves it! Since the scene where Dr. Louise Banks see the news from a televion and the first time she sees the alien spaceship. The movie, once again, succesfully makes you feel immersed and uncomfortable, it makes you ask to yourself: Who are they? And what do they want?\nWhen comes the scene which Louise and Ian are learning how to make contact with them I though that was fair. Although some linguistics affirms that one of their techniques was not one of the best, it felt realistic. More realistic parting from the assumption that the Heptapods had no difficulties in understanding them.\nOne of the things, I can't consider if it's a con or not, but the movie struggles to be a realistic movie, from the alien visit to including the political scenario to the movie, but in the movie China and Russia are considered the most important countries of the planet, \"each step China takes, other 12 nations will follow\". And constant references of the Venezuela were made on the movie. That part actually wrapped my stomach, no country in the planet, even USA does not have this power, I've noticed that this part tried hard to make a propaganda for their political view, that didn't fit well in the movie. Needless to say.\nOne of the things that caught my attention too was the camera angles, the movie began with the camera aiming at the ceiling and slowly pointing the camera to the scenario, the movie began and finished with this camera animation(this camera movement was repeated some times throughout the movie).\nThe Arrival has its pros and flaws, I'll give it 4/5, the only part of the movie I didn't like was that forced political view propaganda, ignoring that, was a pleasant experience.",

In this sense, the movie is also ultimately far more hopeful than the novella: As in the latter, we may never fully be able to communicate with the wholly Other, understanding their motives or plans, but here we can still at least learn to speak and listen to one another.",

Adams (and even Renner) are amazing as always, though it is Villeneuve who is at the peak of his craft, masterfully going back and forth in between the flashbacks and Louise's present in such an emotionally impactful way. This is definitely a movie that will always be up there for me!

The original story by Ted Chiang is indeed in itself a work of genius that goes into detail about complex physics and linguistics while still being undeniably hard to put down for a layperson. But Villeneuve takes Chiang's work a step further by taking audiences on an emotional thrill ride, that deals with issues of diplomacy, motherhood, love, loss, science, linguistics, and the dynamics of human interaction in a seamless and intelligent way. It is the only movie about Aliens that has made me cry, and it is a perfect flick that will be a classic in years to come.",

However it all gets destroyed because almost every character except for the main character and her obligatory unnecessary lover are portraied as unintelligent, impulsive, hostile people.\nArrival has a lot of great ideas but it executes them badly.\n\nAlso I will never forgive them for using \"On the nature of daylight\" as the soundtrack for a mediocre movie, it's such a beautiful piece of music used in such a bad way",

Or, if not real, then at the very least 'plausible'.\n\nOut of all the science fiction movies I've watched over the years, Arrival is the only one to evoke any sense of actual believability. If an alien species were to visit earth, the events portrayed in Arrival are almost exactly how I believe things would actually transpire.\n\nAll of the performances are fantastic, but Amy Adams really steals the show. Her portrayal of Louise Banks is engrossing and, again, believable. Jeremy Renner does a great job as well, but he shares so much screen time with Adams that his performance is very much understated.\n\nI loved the sound direction for this film. I loved the sounds the aliens made, and I loved the distorted sensation that the characters were subjected to in their presence. The musical score is spot-on, as well. Tense, but not overbearing.\n\nThe aliens themselves were exactly how I would imagine aliens would actually appear: not human-like at all but, instead, strange and otherworldly and in complete defiance of anything we have ever seen.\n\nI really enjoyed the plot of Arrival. I'm very interested in the concept of time and the flow of time and everything that it entails. The idea of an alien language being able to manipulate the flow of time is - to me - completely unique and unlike anything I'd seen or read in science fiction before. The use of flashbacks, and the eventual reveal of them being flash-forwards, was executed very well.\n\nArrival is one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen. It is smart, beautiful, dramatic, and thought-provoking... everything you could ask for in a movie.\n\nIf you could see your entire life, from start to finish, would you change anything?",

Amy Adams & Jeremy Renner create spectacular performances as their characters and if they didn't, they deserve at least an Oscar nomination. Arrival also teaches you about language and how it can be messy and how you can rewire your brain into a new one when learning a new one (I am learning Spanish and this is actually true as sometimes it gets hard for me to write in English as the order of sentences are flipped around.

            "content": "This movie made me sign up for an account because it is a work of genius that needs even more praise. This is the rare sort of film that leaves me despondent because other films of its type and caliber simply do not exist.\n\nFor those who haven't seen it: STOP READING ABOUT IT. GO INTO THIS MOVIE BLIND. Do not read spoiler-laden reviews. Do not read anything about it. Avoid trailers. If you go this movie knowing anything other than its basic premise (Aliens have landed, we try to figure out what to do), you WILL regret it.\n\nThis is perhaps the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It transcends the genre, over its storyline, evolving into something much greater than what its title, box art, posters, trailers, or any marketing materials could possibly convey. Its storyline starts out a tense first-contact-with-aliens affair, but unravels into something intricate, challenging, delicate, and utterly emotionally and intellectually compelling.\n\nSimply put: Every aspect of this movie is impeccable. As a whole composition, Villeneuve has achieved near-perfection.\n\nI could fawn over this story's plotline forever, but it's too special to reveal much through analysis. Trust me: It's genius. It's the movie I've basically always wanted, executed brilliantly.\n\nThe two obvious stars here are Amy Adams's performance and Denis Villeneuve's direction. Adams's performance has been much-lauded, but Villeneuve's direction cannot garner enough praise.\n\nDirection is obviously outstanding. Scenes are expertly crafted to give the audience the best-possible perspective coming from the viewpoint of the central protagonist: Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams, who got robbed of her Oscar for this performance). This is so crucial: Scenes which are disorienting for Dr. Banks are disorienting on-screen; we feel the chaos surrounding; we feel her intimate confusion. Not only does this make us empathize with her character, but, in the movie, she is an expert linguist and brilliant person. This makes us, the audience, feel intelligent. For such an intelligent film, it's a real treat.\n\nPacing is excellent. It starts out slow and tense, but absolutely never boring. It ramps up precisely before it needs to, steadily building up to a crescendo that's so magnificent, detailing it in praise would be close to spoiling it.\n\nThe film's bleak and minimalistic aesthetic is outstanding, with sparse set pieces and dark, muted, earthy color tones both complimenting and focusing on the aliens and their spacecraft-a work of sci-fi minimalistic perfection. It's the glorious antithesis of oversaturated Michale Bay schlock (in almost every regard, really.)\n\nThe sound design, too, is brilliant. It's subtle, but captivating. J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's musical score perfectly compliments the aesthetic and narrative. It serves as neither background noise nor show-stealer. The non-musical sound design, however, is often breathtaking. It is brought into and out of focus with surgical precision, maintaining sublime quality throughous. But when it's in the spotlight, it elevates this movie, becoming one of the defining traits that make this one of the greatest sci-fi films ever.\n\nMy only minor complaint is backhanded praise: that this film deserves to be longer. It could easily work with an extra 30 minutes instead of having less than 2 hours of runtime. I'm loathe to imagine what might have been cut by studio executives, but relish the idea of a Director's Extended Cut. \n\nWhen I think about other minor complaints (\"this one scene, that other scene, was this a plot hole or sloppy writing?\") that popped into my head at one point or another, after digesting the film, in retrospect, every single one made sense. No other science-fiction film has required me to suspend my disbelief so little.\n\nThis film is nearly perfect. And I only say that to hedge my bet, because no imperfections come to mind. This film was a revelation. It was transcendental, monumental, and hopefully genre-defining.\n\nThe awesome plotline, pacing, aesthetic,  sound design, and acting (especially by Adams) are all precisely put together by Villeneuve to craft a cinematic art piece that is both immensely intellectually and emotionally compelling. It is a masterpiece, easily one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time.",

            "content": "- Arrival takes you out of this world and brings you home. -\n\nAfter watching Arrival with my work boyfriend Ben, we had to go outside and have a smoke - and I don't even smoke.\n\nThis is one of the most intense, emotionally draining and sublime movies I have seen in YEARS. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario) excelled in making a film, not just about aliens, but the human desire to connect. It is fascinatingly complicated to explain, but this is what I would compare it to:\n\nIt's like watching a YouTube video that is narrated by a scientist as they describe how infinite space and time is and how fleeting our lives are - all whilst the most beautiful score plays in the background. I slowly fell in love with aliens and Amy Adams (Julie and Julia) and by the end of it, I questioned everything about my own existence.\n\nI can only give a short synopsis because I don't want to reveal any major spoilers.  Here is what you need to know:\n\nLouise (Amy Adams) is a linguistics professor who has spent her entire life studying communication. She knows about a billion different languages (don't quote me on that, it's probably more like 40). In the opening scenes of Arrival, 12 alien spaceships land all over the world and Louise is called upon to communicate with the one that landed in America. What happens next is a space roller coaster of emotion, science, math and language.\n\nThat's about all I can tell you about the plot. Not because I am lazy, but because I want you to experience what I did - going into a movie you know very little about.\n\nSo instead, I will tell you about the rest of my evening as we tried to make sense of what we'd just seen.\n\nBen and I sat on the bench outside the theater with our legs folded.  We gushed with mutual revelations of \"Oh god I didn't even pick up on that.\"\n\nBen asked me \"How on Earth (pun intended) are you going to review this?\" I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"maybe I will write it in the symbols that the aliens used to communicate with humans, but then I realized I am not a linguistics expert or an alien, so that idea was quickly abandoned.\n\nHowever, I feel that I am an expert in spotting talent and Amy Adams has been on my radar for awhile now. We discussed how I thought she was a great actress but the characters she's played in the past have annoyed the living crap out of me. But there was no such annoyance in sight with her portrayal of Louise in Arrival. Adams plays her exquisitely.\n\nThere is no dramatic speech about \"this is our Independence Day.\" She doesn't scream and cry that the world is ending. Adams subtly and superbly plays a woman who is hiding a secret but doesn't know it. Adams is so good in fact, she had me singing \"somebody is getting an Oscar nomination\" all the way to my car.\n\nThe last thing I did with my evening was call my mum, because this movie makes you want to call your family. If you don't have a family, then it will make you call your friends. If you don't have friends, then it will make you search the skies for aliens to talk to.\n\nWhy? Because this epic Sci-Fi film is not really about the threat of aliens, it is about communication. It is about understanding each other and our differences. We are all asking the questions, do you hear me? Do you see me? Does what I am saying matter to you?\n\nAfter watching Arrival, it was not a question of are we alone in the universe, it was a question of, why would we want to be? And if there is ever a day when extraterrestrials come down to Earth, if I'm still alive, then I will be the first to shake their hand - or tentacle - or whatever.\n\nAs famous philosopher Paulo Freire once said - \"only through communication can human life hold meaning\". Therefore isn't the meaning of life found through how we connect with each other, through love and understanding? (Woah, wait...did I just discover the meaning of life?)\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/arrival, and was written by Jules Raynes.

The real main character of the film is the Sappir-Whorf hypothesis which states that how we think is informed by our language. In the film one of the ways a nation tried to teach the aliens language is through the use of Shogi which is a Chess like game. If the aliens are only taught words related to a competitive game then they can only describe things in terms of competition. As the film puts it \"Give them a hammer and everything is a nail\" It makes the audience consider how language has effected our perspective and how we might be limited by it. What would a language look like if it had no limits and caused our perspective to shift in the direction of infinity? Words are intended to represent concepts, causality is a concept at the root of making predictions, if we understood causality perfectly and codified that understanding into language then we could accurately make predictions. In the film the aliens possess such a language and as a result predict the future.",

It is a pretty risky choice from commercial success stand point. But I have to applaud those involved to stick with the artistic choice to make this film.

Arrival is probably one of my least favorite movies of 2016, which I haven't watched until now. Here is my non-spoiler review of Arrival.\n\n9/10 points go to the ACTING category. Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whitaker, and friends give great performances. Adams makes a convincing character who's name I have already forgotten. Renner plays Ian, who is the only reason there is one point off from this category. He literally gives a stupid and idiotic delivery for his last line of the film. I won't say it, as it is a spoiler to the end.\n\n4/15 points goes to the WRITING category. The story is basic. Weird aliens come to Earth, people want to know what they are, and Amy Adams is seeing stuff she can't explain. The first 30 minutes of the film and any sequence with the aliens is amazing. The rest is pretty bad. History is determined, but Adams doesn't know what to do/say. Adams is seeing stuff, but doesn't even care about what it is. There are even parts where it seems like present and unknown tense are coming together. The story is not written to well.\n\n10/10 points go to the VISUAL EFFECTS category. The aliens look real, and so do the shells. No problems here like about everything else.\n\n4/10 points go to the CHARACTERS category. The characters are basic. We get little development from them. There is a tiny bit of development for Adams and Ian, but I won't tell you because it is a spoiler. Many people can only be called \"people who scream and complain a lot\", which is pretty basic.\n\n2/5 points go to the DEVELOPMENT category. There is a bit of a conflict and a bit of a compromise. There is a bit of an answer to a question that doesn't get answered. There are a lot of plot holes. This movie also, as I previously said, has a bit of character development which is a spoiler.\n\n2/5 points go to the ORIGINAL MUSIC SCORE category. The score is basic, it is very noticeable most of the time, and that is a bad thing. I didn't find the score at all or even a bit interesting. \n\n3/5 points go to the DESIGN category. The design in a bit cool I guess. It is a bit original and is a bit lame at the same time. It is pretty dark sometimes, and I don't like that. I like the movie's way of showing that things are a bit rushed within the way that things are unorganized. I don't know if that was or wasn't untended by the director.\n\n10/10 points go to the DIRECTION category. Everything that seems planned is done well. Most of the delivery is pretty good. Yeah. That's about all I have to say about the direction of this movie. Nothing stands out.\n\n4/10 points go to the VISION AND SOUND QUALITY category. You can barely hear the actors for most of the movie. The movie is very dark for many scenes which is pretty bad. Some of the scenes do look good. The editing is also pretty bad for most of the film's random vision scenes that Adams is having.\n\n7/20 points go to the MY OVERALL CONSENSUS category. The film is boring, seems unorganized, and overall, I thought it was pretty bad.\n\nScore: 63%\nGrade: D-",

It took a while this year! Gosh, as soon as this movie arrives it begs to be praised and saying what makes it good is as easy as understanding quantum physics. First of all, you have to understand that, more than anything, this is a character study. No, it's not a movie about aliens, an invasion, or even a conflict between beings from outer space and humans. It's primarily about a character and her inner conflict and psyche. We're start to finish with Louise to learn of what she makes of what's happening around her and how that is changing her. This is done beautifully in Sicario and in that sense it seems pretty similar the way we follow Kate (from Sicario) and Louise, making sure that we're constantly enthralled in order to understand them. This is done by shifting a little bit of the attention from what surrounds Louise to her expression and by having a performance to match it. No surprise there, but Amy Adams just blows it out of the park giving a subtle and realistic performance that is absolutely translucent to the character's inner state. Many haven't noticed, but Amy is the new Leo, having 5 nominations and no win but this season, whether with this one or Nocturnal Animals, I believe she has a good shot of getting that gold! Furthermore, this film not only has a fantastically substantiated script and plot, but also has the technical side to support it: the cinematography is rich and very identifiable, the sound design is well thought out and the aliens and ship's design is marvellous. The music is also close to perfection as J\u00f3hannsson accentuates and gives even more meaning to important moments, and keeps quiet when he should. I also like that this movie takes such a fresh approach to the genre, as it manages to make a film about a translator actually damn gripping! I'm a fan of this trend of intellectual astute sci-fi movies that is being developed recently. And like Interstellar, this one comes with an even better grounded and believable twist.  The end gives meaning to the film, making it more than just about some aliens, but about communication, loss and the way we conceive time. Never this year have I felt the need to see a film exactly after I saw it and Arrival is, undoubtedly, the best movie I saw this post-Oscar year. Please, if there's a movie to spend money on right now, this is it!",

I would think an advanced alien race would have a much more direct, less puzzling approach - nice try, I guess. I must say I love Amy Adams and will faithfully watch any movie she's in start to finish as I'm very fond of her delicate, thoughtful style. She is excellent in this and carries the movie all by herself. If you have the patience to wait until the puzzle gets solved and can deal with the far-fetched premise, you may enjoy this.",

Arrival excels in that blinding reflection. \n\nNo silly alien battles or cliched scares, just a masterfully crafted script and deft directing. Along with top-notch performances, led by the ever reliable Amy Adams, it's a modern classic for the emotionally literate class.  \n\nThe less of the plot you know going in, the better.

Interesting that a lot of folks did not like Interstellar which was actually based on real scientific theory. Arrival is more in line with New Age thought. It's interesting experiencing one's future death. The acting was very convincing but I did not care for the constant scenic darkness and one of my pet peeves, continual whispered dialogue. They went a bit over the top creating a foreboding, depressive mood. The overall production seemed low budget, perhaps the need for dark, blurry scenes and much of the dramatic action in a tent. The arc of the climax seemed a lot like Interstellar, seeing the future vs. time dilation, the future phone conversation vs. the pocket watch and quantum entanglement, both saving the day.

It's a movie about the power of humanity and our need to overcome divisive rhetoric and fear in order to survive. It's especially poignant in the current U.S. political climate, when it's not difficult to imagine a historically significant event bringing us to the edge of catastrophe.\n\nIt's hard to find fault in any aspect of this movie, so instead, I'll stick to what works well. Amy Adams' initially flat performance is incredibly nuanced - don't disregard her as a contender for Best Actress. The sound mixing and score are beautifully handled, creating a space for the movie to breath and feel and exist without shoving emotions down the audience's throat. The cinematography is stunning, aided by beautiful scenery and near-flawless visual effects.\n\nFinally, screenwriter Eric Heisserer (previously wasted on projects like The Thing and Final Destination 5) handles the source material from the sci-fi short story \"Story of Your Life\" with aplomb. I'm seeking out an original copy of the story now, to see how much he adapted, and how much was just not screwing it up (a real danger in Hollywood these days, no matter the quality of the source).\n\nI'm on the edge of my seat eager for the Academy Award nominations (three days!) to see how many Arrival pulls in. Simultaneously, it won't surprise me if this low-budget, indie film is too nuanced to get the recognition it deserves. Never fear - I may not be the Academy or Roger Ebert, but this movie has my full endorsement.\n\nArrival is easily one of my favorite movies in a long time.

Upon the arrival of 12 massive, foreign ships, the world becomes plagued with chaos and fear. Throughout this sci-fi, Inception-esc film, the unexpectant viewer is taken on a high-intensity, unpredictable, and yet, perfectly engineered rollercoaster of excitement and suspense. \n\nHowever, one cannot review this movie without mentioning the inspiration behind it: \"The Story of Your Life\". This is a short story novella written by Ted Chiang that is centered around language. Chiang's inspiration for this novella was the philosophical theory of free will. To incite further thoughts, Chiang poses the question, \"If you know what's going to happen, can you keep it from happening?\"   This century old ethical question is addressed in Chiang's novella. \n\n\nThis exciting production takes place in the barren plains of Montana, where professor of linguistics Louise Banks and her team are tasked with an urgent, classified assignment. She is asked to put to test her extensive knowledge and skills of language and translation in just a short period of time; that is, before other countries lose faith in each other and begin pointing their fingers. While diligently working to complete such an extensive task, professor Banks is afflicted by an unknown, futuristic paradigm of what language will entail one day. However, it becomes apparent that the extraterrestrials haven't come for any reason other than to save themselves. \n\nThis review, while not full of complete story lines and time frames, is in simple words, a spoiler. \n\nThe method the extraterrestrials use to save themselves is unexpected by most viewers. This large-scale theme is perfectly illustrated in a single scene. The scene commences with an unauthorized military man entering the alien ship and placing C4 within the chamber of communication. Without this knowledge, Dr. Banks and her associate, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), rush to the pod in attempt to decipher the alien language. As the C4 explosive is about to detonate, the alien sacrifices itself to preserve the life of Dr. Banks and Ian Donnelly. Ironically, however, Dr. Banks is the only person capable of deciphering, understanding, and later, teaching this completely foreign language. Even more so, it is precisely this language that will save the alien species from utter extinction by allowing those who know such language to see the future.  \n\nWith this ability to see into the future, the viewer finally comes to an understanding of the continuous, what-seem-to-be flashbacks troubling Dr. Banks. Indeed, such visions are not flashbacks by any sense of word; they are, in fact, the polar opposite: flash-forwards. Throughout the entirety of the movie, Dr. Banks develops a continuously growing knowledge of the alien language and, for that reason begins to see into the future, which contains glimpses of her current unborn daughter. \n\nThese reoccurring visions illustrate a deep sense of humility and maturity in Louise Banks. Knowing that her daughter is going to be born with a terminal illness, she happily accepts fate and looks forward to cherishing every moment with her future daughter. Beyond that, if this language allows for future knowledge, the extraterrestrials' knowledge is no confined to time. Simply put, they know their future. They know that C4 is going to explode and injure them. However, just like Louise Banks, they knowingly accept this fate. \n\nWith a language like this, what is the limit? When knowledge isn't limited to the bounds of time who's to say what can and cannot be accomplished? On the other side, are humans mature and moral enough to accept this almost all-empowering language? This also alludes to Ted Chiang's novella and the inspiration behind it. Exists free will? If so, can one prevent the known future? All of these are questions that rise from this movie. \n\nBecause of these \"flash-forwards\", Arrival takes on this Inception-like plot twist at the end. It is truly intriguing. Inception was a dream within a dream, induced by a particular party of interest, and used to influence a man's decision for the party's own benefit. Likewise, Arrival is a flash-forward, revealed by the extraterrestrials to Dr. Banks for their own interest. The reason the aliens show her these \"flash-forwards\" is to merely convince her to learn their language and therefore, be the architect of their future salvation. \n\nRegardless of comparisons, this was a perfectly executed film. How often does one witness a professor of linguistics as a \"save-the-day\", hero type character in a movie? On top of that, the portrayal of genuine, pleasant aliens is a scarce sight in today's world. Although their actions reflected self-indulged motives, the extraterrestrials came to give humanity a tool: their language. \n\nWhile completely enthralled by this film, certain questions came to mind. What happens to humanity over the next 3000 years, prior to the saving of these aliens? How does their language affect modern society and technology? What was so strong as to threaten the existence of these advanced extraterrestrials 3000 years from the time of the film? Of course, being a science fiction enthusiast, the idea of a sequel, prequel, or anything in-between this movie's timeline is captivating.     \n\nAll in all, this brilliant depiction of extraterrestrials and linguistics merged together forms what is now one of the most authentic, captivating films within the science fiction genre. In a single word, brilliant. This movie was nothing short of brilliance. The original integration of a linguist savior for an alien species is captivating, exciting, and refreshing.",

What if you could know the past, present, and future? \"If you could see your life from start to finish, would you change things?\" said Dr. Louise Banks, main character played by Amy Adams in the movie \"Arrival\" \nThe movie is extremely well put together and makes one think deeply about what is going on in movie as well as that their life means to them. Dr. Banks made the discovery that the language of those arrived does not represent sound or speech like the languages we know today but rather meaning and complete thoughts. She said \"When you learn it you begin to perceive time as they do. \n\"I used to think this (speaking of birth) was the beginning of your story. Memory is a strange thing, It doesn't work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time, by its order. I remember moments in the middle. And this was the end. But now i'm not so sure i believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.\" \nThe movie has an extremely deep message. As Louise learns the language of the heptapods, she, like them, begins to perceive time as all at once, knowing past, present and future. She uses this ability to provoke our finite minds into contemplating the idea of seeing our lives from start to finish and if we would change things. It is implied that many of us would indeed change some aspect of our lives if we were to know the big picture, thus, teaching us to be wise in our decisions and relationships to not have any regrets. \n4.5 stars because the acting was semi good in the beginning but improved throughout the movie.",

First, throughout the movie,I wanted to  try my methods to communicate with them: singing to them, dancing artfully in a qi gong dance improv mindfully connecting to them sort of way, play, show people hugging, showing 12 peoplesitting on floor (like the 12 pods) holding hands, smiling, laugher, crying, reaching to Abbot and Costello with open hands, with namaste honored hands...and that was inspiring after the movie was over. Next, it was fascnating that she was chosen; her life and her powers and gifts to connect  with them and they with her. And it evokes the dimensions of time, the meaning of events, trust, intuition, levels of collaboration, interconnectness, etc Anyone who says this is boring, is IMO, not-intelligent and daft. It is not an action movie. It isa thoughtful inspiring poetic vision of sorts. It would be good to show in classrooms and have discussions following. Lovely.",

Reading from a book by Dr. Banks, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) says, \"Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict.\" Which is true, very true in this movie the meanings of the languages that which Dr. Banks reveals them is such a beautiful thing to watch. In the beginning it is very difficult to understand what is going on, but the details and scenes that are shown to help you get a better understanding of why this is happening is very touching to the heart. It amazes me the abilities that Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) has in the film and her discovery of why this is all happening across the world. She did a very risky thing to reveal the reason behind their arrival. And she opposes one question that really makes you think, \"If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?\" Overall, I am amazed by the way in which this film was portrayed and I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know because it make you think a lot about your life.",

The man who directed Sicario, Prisoners, and Blade Runner 2049, brought us this smart tale of humans attempting to communicate with aliens. The premise sees a linguist (Amy Adams) and physicist (Jeremy Renner) work together with the government in an attempt to communicate with the invaders from another world. I appreciated that the story focused on that aspect instead of some fight with the other beings. The fact that we never know what the aliens or military members with Adams and Renner would do, made for some great tense scenes. There's a particular one with a ticking bomb that stood out as excellent. Adams shines above everything else with one of the best performances of her career. She portrays her desperation to understand these creatures, in the midst of some haunting visions, expertly. She and Renner played off each other well. There are some pacing issues, as things moved at a crawl in a few of the scenes towards the middle, but it picks up with a great ending. The twist is fantastic, though once it becomes clear they still wait a bit to reveal a bit of an obvious part. An original take on the alien concept, beautifully shot and handled by a skilled director and led by top notch actors.",

Mysterious floating monoliths appear around the world and linguist Amy Adams, with help of physicist Jeremy Renner, work with the government to try and communicate with the aliens amid global fears and international political tensions. This story is more \"Close Encounters\" and \"Contact\" than \"Independence Day\" or \"War of the Worlds,\" where the main focus of the story is on how to communicate with the aliens, while reassuring the military brass, primarily Forrest Whittaker, that everything is okay and they don't have to attack. This tension of whether they can successfully communicate and avert a conflict with this new species (and whether other countries around the world might tip off an interstellar as well) makes for good ticking time bomb of dramatic tension, but it's really Adams who give the film an emotional human center, desperately wanting to connect with to these advances creatures, while at the same time is haunted by visions of her daughter. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who's next project was the new Blade Runner film, brings a strong visual style to the proceeding, but never in a way that is distracting to the story or style for the sake of style. My only complaint about the film is that it does move at a rather glacial pace, though in the end, the film does deliver with a terrific mind-bending of an ending, that makes the wait well worth it. Overall, \"Arrival\" is not a film for anyone wanting slam-bang science fiction, but is great if you're in the mood for something along the lines of \"Solaris\" or \"Moon.\"",

It was refreshing and captivating- near perfect. I would highly suggest watching this movie if you want to feel both inspired and challenged. It's not as predictable as a lot of other mainstream movies; they give you just enough plot points and knowledge to follow a thread but not enough to draw all-telling solid conclusions (most of the time). The only major thing I had an issue with was:\n**Warning: major spoiler ahead!**\nThe fact that Ian left Louise over something so petty!\nI say 'petty' rightfully because this is an advanced scientist who has openly communicated with aliens, defied gravity, and knows that Louise can see the future (because obviously you don't just shield someone from a bullet while you listen to them speak Mandarin and save the world without questioning their actions later). \nHe is this accepting of everything around him but yet he simply can't accept that his daughter will die early of cancer? We all die in the end- does that make life pointless or does it free us to enjoy what we have? If our lives were already written out would that make our actions hollow or valuable experiences we should really give ourselves into?\nIt really surprised me that a man of his understanding, acceptance, and intelligence left Louise over the pain of knowing his daughter will die early of cancer- and that Louise chose to have her anyways.\nMost parents wouldn't trade anything in the world for even a minute of their child's life- would he have rather not had her at all than get to enjoy her beautiful life and fill his heart with love for her? \nI mean I get his divorce from her is used as a plot device to 1. Keep the pieces of the story from coming together too quickly, and 2. To demonstrate to the audience that things like the probability/knowing of death and heart break shouldn't keep us from following our hearts. \nBUT STILL. It pisses me off. I hate that such a seemingly deep character made such a shallow choice. Hannah always has been, and always will be theirs. Nothing in the world could've ever changed that- dead or alive, she always belonged to them. Before she had even existed she was theirs. \ne.g.\nI wouldn't say I made the wrong choice picking my dog out as a puppy if I knew he was going to die of a degenerative disease 13 years later. I love him more than I can handle, and he will always hold a piece of my heart. Forever. No dog I would've picked out would live for eternity- and would I sacrifice the love I have for him specifically and the life he's lead for the sake of avoiding heartbreak? Never. \nYou can't fight life- you can only embrace it and accept it for what it is.",

Oh yeah there's aliens that apparently deserve better placement than the black guy from Battleship Earth (arguably a better alien in that movie than the Cthulhu Heptapod things were in this one.)  \n\nWhat makes this movie terrible, and not just able to be avoided unless you need some background noise for Netflix and Chill, is that your primal lizard brain really wants to like it.  The visuals are on fleek, and the score is one of those maudlin pastoral dirges that make you want to go to bed and die.  Speaking of dying, Amy Adams' kid dies.  That's not a spoiler because that's literally how the movie opens.  Just throws it right out there on the Thanksgiving dinner table.    It's gonna be a real depressing 2 hours, and don't you regret not clicking on the Avengers instead because, of course, now SHE wants to see what happens since dying children are like glue traps for millennial chicks and you're too invested at this point.\n\nAs for the rest of the synopsis, there are these aliens that come to earth in twelve of those old native american grind stones that you had to smash corn with when your 6th grade class visited that pioneer village, and they speak only in coffee stains.  Swear to God you're going to watch it not believing me and then go, \"Oh damn, he wasn't kidding like when he said Eleven dies in Stranger Things 2.\"  Evidently these coffee stains allow you to see the future ONLY IF YOU ARE AMY ADAMS despite the fact that Jeremy Renner did just as much work and actually cracked the fact that the only way to save the world was to embrace this clumsy allegory for Globalism.  Where's your pay gap now, ladies?\n\nSo Amy and Jeremy try to stop Forrest Whitaker from blowing up the grindstone squids despite the fact that one of the Heptapods says something in Caffeinese translates to \"Use Weapon\" and that's usually the time the aliens should have actually stepped back and thought, \"Oh hell, that was probably a really stupid thing to choose as our first words to a militarily developed native race in whose yard we happen to be parked illegally.\"  She eventually steals a phone and tells THE ONLY MILITARY GENERAL IN CHINA EVIDENTLY what his wife said right before she died and as they say in China, \"If you can remember what my wife told me on her death bed, then I have to call off my alien war.\"  So he tells future Amy Adams his personal phone number knowing that present day Amy Adams would then know it because when red headed white girls bust out fluent Mandarin, you suddenly learn everything about FTL Time Travel (which this claimed to be but absolutely wasn't).\n\nOh yeah, also also Amy Adams keeps going back and forth in time every time she reads what the aliens are saying like she's having photosensitive time-seizures.  It's not confusing however, just remember that every time you see her with her kid, that part of the movie is completely vestigial to the main story and cutting it out would actually make everyone feel better.\n\nSo the aliens take Amy Adams up into their ship, and basically lay out the whole plot of the movie in subtitles because the director of this movie spent way too much time reminding everyone who watches this movie that humans are flawed, and are capable of getting sick and dying at a young age.  Oh yeah, and she goes from knowing about 4 words in Coffee stain/Caffeinese/whatever to being able to carry on entire existential discussions with aliens capable of INTERPLANAR TRAVEL yet know dick about grammar and conjugation, and talk like they came from super advanced albeit somehow still REALLY into Frank Lloyd Wright squid world on a J1 Study Visa.  Whole thing is just silly.\n\nOh yeah, and instead of deciding not to have a child so as to prevent it from suffering a horrible death, and just explain it to Jeremy Renner who will believe her because she just made the aliens go away and those people probably would know stuff like that,  she voice-overs this whole thing about embracing the inevitable because as soon as Jeremy Renner admits that he loves her he also leans in and Whispers Joe Biden-style, \"I want to put a baby in you\", or \"let's make a baby,\" or something super appropriate for a pre-first date phase of courtship.  \n\nAnd then it literally ends.  And you're trying to conceal the genuine fury that Hollywood had the nerve to put a SCI-FI label on a Nicholas Sparks story.  What did the aliens eat?  What forms of government did they have on squid world?  Why did they talk in coffee circles?  what was the magic intelligent ink that they used to talk made of?  can you send me the PDF on how to learn that language so I can (trigger warning) Trump my friends who brag about knowing Tolkien Elvish.  These are the questions that should at least be teased with the hint of an answer if you're going to qualify as a legit science fiction film.  \n\nBut no.  All we learned about the aliens is they really like to see Amy Adams cry.",

This director is undoubtedly on top of his game (Blade Runner 2049 promises great things in his hands!) and this movie is another shining example of the impressive catalogue being constructed by this maverick movie maker!\nThe film itself deals with twelve mysterious spacecraft's arrivals across the globe. A cross section skilled team--lead by expert linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are brought together to investigate the reason behind their visit. As the world teeters on the brink of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers. \nWhat transpires is a Spielberg/Nolanesque two hour emotive, powerful and visually stunning piece that is lifted to extra heights due the extraordinary performance of Amy Adams (how she wasn't nominated for this is simply beyond me!) who brings both strength and vulnerability to her magnificent role!\nTwists and turns aplenty the viewer is constantly engaged and the spectacular cinematography also adds to the wonderful film on show.\nQuite simply a must see experience, a film with lofty ambitions that it pulls of quite brilliantly!",

The slow build-up of understanding the language is shown very well, with Adams giving a great performance. I also enjoy the interplay between her and Forest Whitaker, the career army man.\n\nI take issue with Jeremy Renner's character. It is not made plain in the entire film why he is there. He's supposed to a scientist, and he is shown doing scientisty things, but they have no effect whatsoever on the plot. It might have been a good idea to pull back the focus to flesh out the mission a little more.\n\nOnce we get to the third act, the big sci-fi reveal happens. Here's the problem: you've already established a certain level of strangeness in the film, and this third act adds a whole new layer. It really pulls the rug out from under you. It might work for someone who was ready for that level of sci-fi, but I was not. It got really complex, really fast, and I felt whiplash while watching it.\n\nIt left a bad taste in my mouth, and looking back now a few weeks later, doesn't seem as egregious (hence the largely-positive rating).

Only Jeremy Renner shows any signs of life, everyone else is sleepwalking including Amy Adams  who is blander than Top 40 radio.   She's a highly skilled linguist recruited by the military to communicate with these aliens, but none of her studying makes any difference as her only breakthroughs occur through memory flashes interacting with her daughter.  Naturally the military gets trigger-happy solely in order to inject some form of tension which is utterly predictable.  There's a fairly nifty revelation at the very end, but it's relied upon far too heavily to have a Shyamalan effect and cannot salvage the dreary experience until then.  I enjoy heady sci-fi like Ex Machina and Interstellar as recent examples, but Arrival comes up well short with the only truly clever aspects being the aliens' writing method and the title.

When we see that other things arrive to this world we never have seen before that sends the world into a communication frenzy of its intention. When somethings we have never seen before we don't know how to communicate with when their arrival is unknown to us. When other things arrive at our door step when they need our communication expertise to decipher what others dont understand. When we see the world is prepared for such arrivals if they ever took place and communicate separately their plan of execution if such events were to happen. When we see that we arrived at our destination where we are prepared to communicate with the life forms. When how we arrive at our translation only we know when we followed closely the communications and languages of all life's communications that ever existed to know who we are dealing with. When we see that our arrival to see such species we find hard to communicate with, when a communication is new and needs further investigating to arrive at a new language. When we do see that we have to start somewhere when some language deciphering enabled us to uncover other languages by starting at ourselves in the way we communicate and arrive to a meaning or purpose. When we see we give humanism to species to communicate eye to eye we ought to see them in order to arrive at the connection between human & alien. When we see that we need to introduce species to how we communicate by arriving the fact that we are identifying them, questioning them, specifying them and uncovering more details we need to know about their language. When we see that communication is different everywhere that we must arrive to different views in what is methodology is used. When we see that we arriving to a species means of communication would take years when we have yet to understand the species to fully grasp the language that we see time is not on our side when others communicate differently then we do an interpret messages and communications differently that arrive to either an opposing or agreement that we have yet to solve. When we arrive at the thought that what pushes us to great lengths of friction is we are different and communicate differently that our final arrival to our decision lies squarely on obsession for perfection & accuracy over fears. When we see communication is difficult when others arrive to the fears of the worse and rather end talks be left alone to defend ourself. When we don't see all of what life has to offer from our past to future we don't know much truths to include such communications in our dialogue to  arrive at a different relationship. When what we can't see others see in our flaws that they understand about us but can't communicate with us their knowledge when it's to vast to be studied upon that we arrive with a gift in their intentions. When we see that time between us lasted much too long when we have yet to understand our own flaws that prevent us from communicating well and arriving to progress as fast as others that some solutions in understanding us and getting around our own weapon of defense to arrive at a single person whom can deliver the message for us. When we can now see a time so distant that it hasn't happened yet, we arrive to the clues given from our future that is helpful to our present to save us from ourselves that changes the way we receive communicate. When we see that moments stitched in time have a palindrome (Hannah), linking present and future simultaneously that arrives us to instant communication & knowledge. When we see what we couldn't see before we arrive at how advanced some species are that we can't reach a level of communication they have reached to only receive a gift to advance our communication when ours remain to hold us back. When we see trust and good will is hard to gain when we all arrive at the thought of being number 1 that communication is hard to achieve. When we see the purpose of their arrival is to communicate with us help not now but in the future to which time is nonlinear to the present and how we advance now till then we know we need to when we have advanced allies relying on us to succeed. When we don't always see such things that arrive to us as they might be intended we see signs as humans communicate it to mean but don't understand signs could be another thing when we communicate and categorize all truths we fail to diversify everything in other forms to clearly see what has arrived to us. When we see how unadvanced humans are we see that even though we know the future we always arrive at the first thought of greed & thinking about ourself when we communicate not for the collective goal but the sole goal alone, that we alienate everyone and everything to do the same (death of hannah). When we don't see the gifts we are given, when life tries to communicate with us that life arrives within us that gives us the ability to be nurturers of the world when the world fails to do so.",

I have to be honest, I didn't like \"Arrival\". I am really confused as to why people seem to love it so much, because the entire movie was a snooze for me. It didn't seem to really have anything actually interesting in it, and personally I just got extremely bored with it. I will say, Amy Adams (Dr. Louise Banks) did a great job in this movie, her role was definitely difficult to pull off, but she did it marvellously, and to me she was the best part of this movie. The movie is about an alien landing on earth, and the whole movie is about the entire world trying to figure out these alien's purpose of landing on our planet, and to figure out whether or not these aliens are harmful. When they try to find out these alien's purpose, however, the movie completely drags on, for what feels like forever. They are slowly piecing the puzzle together, but I just felt as though they did it in a way that was incredibly boring, and didn't at all capture my interest in the story. It does slightly pick up towards the end, however because the beginning was so boring to me I just didn't really care much for it at that point. I really am shocked with how high this movie is rated, because personally, I think that \"Arrival\" is definitely not worth watching.",

Great SFX and brilliant soundtrack. Can see influences from Nolan and Spielberg here but that isn't a problem at all, and there is a definite hint of Hans Zimmer from the soundtrack.

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, it looks like we ve finally arrived \n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) ... and its about time. Literally. Let s get to reviewing this next movie about alien visitation.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to Professor Leslie Banks (Amy Adams) who is having a strange day as 12  shells  (very large egg-shaped alien craft) have landed across the world. She s visited by a Colonel Webber (Forest Whitaker) who insists she help him translate the speech patterns of the aliens. She resists but ultimately gives in when her curiosity gets the better of her. She s whisked away to a midwest town where she is paired with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and must discover the reason for the alien visit.\n\nSCOTT: Banks and Donnelly meet two of the aliens and nickname them Abbott and Costello. Communication seems impossible until Banks attempts written language. She discovers that the aliens  writing is composed of complex circular characters and sentences, and she also discovers that the more she deciphers the language, the more strange visions she has of herself raising a child. Meanwhile, in China, General Shang (Tzi Ma) is about to wage war with the aliens, making it imperative that Banks and Donnelly crack the code before disaster strikes.\n\nGREG: Arrival is a film that arrived without much fanfare. I don t recall seeing any previews for it in the theaters or ads on TV. So, I had very few preconceptions going in. And I was pleasantly surprised. This is an arguably ponderous film with very little action and a lot of dialog. It s a thinking-man s movie, so it appealed to me. One of the opening scenes has physicist Donnelly reading Banks  book which states that all interactions begin with language. But he differs - claiming the basis for communication is science. Whereas Colonel Webber is looking at the situation from a tactical point of view. And so the stage is set for a three-way confrontation of ideals. And in the end, it is Banks  view that wins out. I was favorably impressed.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I loved Arrival. It s been a long time since we ve encountered a meaty science fiction story that really makes you think. I was struck by the possibility that our language is not so much a reflection of our linear thinking but a determinant of it. The temporal non-linearity of the aliens was fascinating and allowed for some truly creative plot developments. We re also treated to some wonderfully innovative renditions of aliens and alien language. Not to mention that Amy Adams delivers a terrific performance as a hero who must piece together the temporal puzzle to save the world. It all adds up to a stellar movie, pardon the pun.\n\nGREG: Amy Adams was definitely the brightest star in this film. Her character Leslie Banks undergoes a strong transformation from disillusioned academic to an enlightened world figure. She also exhibits uncommon empathy for the aliens. She puts aside her innate fear of the unknown and is captivated by the question of what is the purpose of the alien visit. I found her very inspiring.\n\nSCOTT: Banks definitely goes on an inspired hero s journey -- yet another example of Hollywood finally  getting it  that women characters can make tremendous heroes in the movies. The hero s journey begins with Banks answering the  call  from the military to make first contact with aliens who have landed in Montana. She immediately assumes a lead role in her partnership with Donnelly, a physicist on her team. Her missing quality is her understanding of the alien language, and the keys to her acquiring this quality are her openness to thinking outside the box, her trust that the aliens will do no harm, and her courage to defy the military s antagonistic approach to the alien encounter. Banks possesses many of the great eight characteristics of heroes; she is smart, strong, resilient, reliable, caring, inspiring, and selfless. In keeping with the hero s journey, she encounters a love interest (Donnelly), allies in Abbott, Costello, and oppositional forces in the military and CIA. Her mentors turn out to be the aliens themselves, who have arrived to help the earth understand and change their language and use of time. In exchange, the earth will help the aliens 3,000 years from now. Everything comes full circle, which is beautifully symbolized in the alien circular linguistic characters.\n\nGREG: The aliens are good mentor figures here. And we also see that Banks acts as a hero-mentor in that she mentors the aliens in our language. After all, it is she who instructs the aliens, not the other way around. However, this does imply a bit of a plot hole. If the aliens are so advanced, why are they so dense in understanding our language? Compare to our own understanding of animal language. It is human researchers who have taught apes to speak American Sign Language. I would think it incumbent upon the more advanced civilization to find a way to communicate with us. Arrival is a departure from other first contact movies like Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind where language is the source of the communication. I enjoyed the slow burn from fear to understanding for all the characters in the story. I give Arrival 4 out of 5 Reels. Dr. Banks is a great hero who undergoes a transformation from naive to educated in the ways of the alien creatures. Like many heroes we ve studied in the last few years, she has a  super power  which in this case is the ability to understand language. But it is her human innate quality of empathy which endears Banks to us. I give her 4 out of 5 Hero points. And Banks is the most excellent hero-mentor. And when you join her with the superior alien-mentors we get a mentoring experience that goes beyond what most films offer. I give Banks and the aliens 4 out of 5 Mentor points. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Arrival is the science fiction you ve been looking for in film for several years now. Greg, the plot hole you identify is not so much a hole but the key to understanding the puzzle with which the aliens present humanity. Twelve shells arrive on earth, each with a different piece to the puzzle that the twelve earth stations must share to unravel the mystery. The idea is to bring humanity together in a non-zero-sum-game-like way. This guiding principle, along with stunningly crafted heptapods and their innovative language, make Arrival a treat to watch. I give this film the full 5 Reels out of 5. Louise Banks proves herself braver and smarter than all her male counterparts in both developing a working relationship with the aliens and in deciphering their cryptic language. She encounters friends who help her and foes who oppose her, and she undergoes a profound mental transformation. In our latest book Reel Heroes & Villains, we define a mental transformation as a significant change in the way that a hero views the workings of the universe. Banks now sees time, language, and thought as intertwined. She travels the full hero s journey, including the act of giving back to society what she has learned in the form of lectures and a book on the universal language of the heptapods. She earns the full 5 Heroes out of 5. The mentorship is also strong in this film, with the aliens mentoring Banks as well as the entire human race itself. Our planet is taught how essential it is for our survival to adopt a non-zero-sum philosophy in our international relations. You re right, Greg, that Banks also mentors the aliens -- although I suspect they intentionally adopted a passive stance in the first contact proceedings to force us to do the work of deciphering and cooperating with each other internationally. Oh, and let s not forget that the future Louise Banks mentored the present-day Louise Banks via many hallucinogenic messages. In short, the mentoring is rich in this film and also merits the full 5 Mentor points out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

The effects, sometimes breathtaking, not only fit the style of the film well, but also add so much to the overall quality of the movie because of the sheer realism and impressiveness of the CGI was nothing to scoff at. I give it a 9/10 because despite all of its obvious and sweeping victories, I felt some scenes between action points and developing character back story arcs were pretty slow, and it cut up the flow of the movie at the start.

There's a terrific story to be told with a strong central theme at its core, but I won't go near any explanations for fear of spoiling the ingenious twist.  Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner both have fantastic performances throughout, and really offer a terrific look at the characters and how they develop throughout the course of the film.  A chilling, ethereal soundtrack accompanies the whole film and an excellent audio mix bring the contemplative movie to life.

Luckily, I was wrong about that, as Arrival proved to be one of the most fascinating, thought-provoking films of 2016. Amy Adams (Batman vs. Superman) had a fantastic year in movies (even after the film that I just linked her with), and she owns the screen in this movie. The story, when several massive monolith-style ships arrive (surprise) on Earth and humans attempt to both communicate with the creatures inside and work together as a unified planet, keeps you guessing at every turn. The imagery and cinematography is stunning and keeps your eyes glued to the screen by its sheer spectacle. This extremely smart movie will keep you on your toes and will have you thinking about it well after it is over. Give it a watch and experience it for yourself.",

Anyone expecting an action packed alien invasion movie will be disappointed.  This story is played out with a lot more intelligence and respect for it's audience and it has the greatest emotional gut punch I've ever experienced in an alien movie.\nThis is the first film by director Denis Villeneuve that has stuck with me, Prisoners, Enemy and Sicario all had their merits but were far from outstanding.

Well, for some obnoxious reason you will be sent off with a corny Lifetime family drama and an unexplained magical ability instead.  Horrible corny, cringe worthy ending!  (Brenner's last line almost completely destroys this movie for me.)\n\nArrival does begin as an intriguing story about patience and communication, and Amy Adams does deliver a great performance as a cool headed but emotionally pressured professional. But this story is very regrettably swapped out for a cheesy, \"emotional\" family drama instead.\n\nIt's sad because the obvious initial \"contact\" premise of the story is truly fantastic and well performed. But to ultimately steer the film into a completely different direction towards a focus more on the main character's emotional family life left me feeling like the victim of a really bad bait and switch storytelling tactic. \n\nThe soundtrack sounded corny and cringe worthy, as if it were constantly and consciously TRYING to illicit uneasiness or fear in the listener / viewer, yet being painfully obvious about it to the point of distraction at times.\n\nI can't help feel there was potential for a great story arc, but it was squandered just to tell you an over-used family drama trope story you hadn't even paid to see.  \n\nAll in all, good performances, lovely visuals, important messages trying to be conveyed. Ultimately, this is a very good film which the writer, Eric Heisserer, unfortunately took nowhere in particular.  \n\nI just realized this film had the same writer for Lights Out, another movie I abhorred passionately.",

            "content": "A beautifully acted and cerebral piece of sci-fi that's almost as smart as it portends to be, Arrival nonetheless captivates with a thought-provoking puzzler that brings to mind Close Encounters of the Third Kind...had Terrence Malick directed it, that is. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated sci-fi drama, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Contemplative is the word for this thinking man's alien invasion flick. Our eyes, ears and mind, Banks is a linguist emotionally scarred by a tragedy. She doesn't think linearly and neither does the film. Far from straight-forward, the film mindbends and timebends with achingly gorgeous photography that frames the locations as much as the characters. This is a key point. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Interstellar before it, Arrival wraps you up in an atmospheric spectacle while leaving a lightyear's worth of room for interpretation. The end result is both quantitative and qualitative, though director Denis Villenueve had some obvious influences. Terrence Malick never made a straight sci-fi flick but, if he did, it might look a lot like this. The beauty of nature being interrupted by an obstructive force and opaque flashbacks/flash forwards are two Malick touchstones that both feature prominently in Arrival. Villenueve's work has always been bleak and gripping but his latest definitely resembles Malick's The Tree of Life more than Prisoners or Sicario. Like those last two searing dramas, it still concentrates on troubled characters and maintains a funereal tone but the canvas is more expansive and less conclusive. For some audiences, it will make them say 'Huh?' For the filmgoers that say 'Hmm,' however, Arrival is a welcome departure from the cut and dry space franchises currently Trekking and Warring across screens. \n\nRegardless of where the coin falls, Amy Adams grounds the drama quotient for all viewers with a deeply emotional performance. Ever since her very deserving Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for Junebug in 2005, this artist has made bold affecting choices. That she would do this and the very different Nocturnal Animals within the same short window, both daring but singularly amazing turns, seems improbable if not downright impossible. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker turn in solid supporting performances without which she couldn't fully develop her character, but make no mistake about it: Second to Villeneuve, this is her show. And that goes for the aliens too.   \n\nTo Sum it Up: Earth Girls are Easy A",

It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold.

Director Denis Villeneuve is a master of building tension, and he gets better at it with every film.

The first half of the movie would make you think it'll be just another typical sci-fi film but it's not. The connection between humans and the aliens reminded me the movie called The Abyss for some reason.\n\nWith the effort of Amy Adams' character by learning the language from the aliens and trying to understand them and especially the purpose, was quite touching. It even portrays how the rest of humanity deals with something they have never seen before. It shows like how China would go drastic measures without a real good reason but to retaliate. It's interesting how it shows humanity's reaction towards something unknown. Something out of this world. This movie gives a good example of humanity of interacting something alien, in global wide public.\n\nArrival has a touching story while attracting with the unknown that's out of this world. Giving us an example on how to deal with life itself and question about it at the same time. A good movie to get into if you want to get in touch of how much potential reality has.",

            "content": "Linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams), is lecturing at a Massachusetts university when twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear at twelve different locations across Earth. U.S. Army colonel G.T. Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks Louise to join physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and find out why they have come. She is brought to an army camp in Montana near one of the spacecraft. They make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call \"heptapods\"; Ian nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols, written in a substance analogous to ink, or dark smoke, and she begins to learn a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to have visions of herself with her daughter and of their relationship with the absent father. When Louise finally asks why the aliens have come to Earth, they answer \"offer weapon\". An alternate translation of \"use weapon\" is made at another site. This leads China to break off communications with the rest of the world; other nations also stop exchanging information. However, Louise argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" might mean \"tool\". Louise is hoping to unravel what the \"heptapods\" means which could threaten her life and quite possibly all of mankind...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Arrival delivers a must-see experience for fans of thinking person's sci-fi that anchors its heady themes with genuinely affecting emotion and a terrific performance from Amy Adams.\" Brian Tallerico, from RogerEbert.com, gave the film three out of four: \"It's a movie designed to simultaneously challenge viewers, move them and get them talking. For the most part, it succeeds.\" At Time.com, Sam Lansky described it as \"sophisticated, grownup sci-fi: a movie about aliens for people who don't like movies about aliens.\" IGN reviewer Chris Tilly gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying: \"Arrival is a language lesson masquerading as a blockbuster, though much more entertaining than that sounds. The film features shades of Interstellar, Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but never feels derivative. Rather it's smart, sophisticated sci-fi that asks BIG questions, and does a pretty good job of answering them.\" British film critic Robbie Collin gave Arrival five out of five, calling it: \"introspective, philosophical and existentially inclined - yet it unfolds in an unwavering tenor of chest-tightening excitement. And there is a mid-film revelation - less a sudden twist than sleek unwinding of everything you think you know - that feels, when it hits you, like your seat is tipping back.\" The UK newspaper The Guardian rated it as the third best film of 2016.[53] Critic Catherine Shoard said that it \"amounts to something transcendent; something to reignite your excitement for cinema, for life.\" Numerous other publications, including io9, Den of Geek, WhatCulture, Mir Fantastiki, The Atlantic, Blastr, and Digital Trends named Arrival the best movie of 2016.\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve has excited me three times in a row with \"Prisoners\", \"Enemy\" and \"Sicario. Magnificent films in my point of view. Of course I was keen on seeing \"Arrival\" as I couldn\u00b4t see how Villeneuve could fail with this genre. \"Arrival\" is somewhat a mix of \"Interstellar\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" as mentioned and the philosophical and existential approach is intriguing (and the classic \"Are we alone?\" question will always be a current topic) and the film has great CGI, strong performances and an interesting use of sounds by composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. However, the storyline doesn\u00b4t really grasp you, the tension is not really there, you get lost in the \"smart\" dialogue and the pace is just too slow if you ask me. Instead of feeling there were plenty to reflect over after the film ended, I felt more like a question mark over the slightly pretentious piece of film I had just witnessed. The same feeling I had after seeing \"Interstellar\". Yes, the main subjects (time, love, loss, self-discovery and what it means to be human) are good ones and a unique entity of a film is there. But, the end result is not what I hoped for. \n\nTrivia: Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer created a fully functioning, visual, alien language. Heisserer, Villeneuve and their teams managed to create a \"logogram bible,\" which included over a hundred different completely operative logo-grams, seventy-one of which are actually featured in the movie.\n\nWhile the shape of the ship was decided early on, Denis Villeneuve had great difficulty imagining an interior that would allow humans to easily navigate through such a steep and vertical design. The later decision to turn gravity sideways offered an obvious and convenient solution.\n\n\"Dirty Sci-fi\" is what director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Bradford Young called the look they created together for Arrival. Villeneuve wanted it to feel like \"This was happening on a bad Tuesday morning, like when you were a kid on the school bus on a rainy day and you'd dream while looking out the window at the clouds.\"",

Adams slowly grasps that their language and their experience of time is non-linear (nicely displayed by having their sentences expressed as circles with weird little fractals spinning off in every direction) and then saves the world even as she deals with her own tragedies. Chick-flicky but very nice work.\n\nThe other movie has lines like \"Montana is in lockdown\", and \"China has called a press conference\", calling to mind those 1950s giant monster movies where the guy in the white lab coat is always saying \"get me the Army\" or some such. And it has predictable gun-nut reactionary military characters including a captain in charge of the most delicate mission in world history who might as well have \"paranoid psycho\" tattooed on his forehead.

            "content": "Undamaged & Superb Insurrection For Hollywood Science Fiction\n\nThe vastness of human pragmatism that science fiction can encompass is unheard-of. It's been circumscribed erroneously with the epigraph about the impossibility of its acts, it's paradoxical to look back and itemize any minutia of our history emerged with a \"that never will happen\" or a \"this is impossible\". And here we're, where was such a the conception of logic and fairness when a group of German Jews and Aryan citizens decided by 44% of utilitarian votes that a midget beast to head up Germany and the selfsame world into a cyclone of blood to the unforgiving netherworld? Or, where was equal, liberating and fair American people who asserted equality and pluralism when they elected a Republican Presbyterian with a citrus wig to lead the crux of the universe?, There is where the literary and film well-known adage glow to its highest expression: \"reality surpasses fiction\". Although modern events are or were influenced by constraint, opinion disparities, ambition or vileness, the other piece has invested us partially as equality organisms in terms of race and eliminator of misogyny. We've got over cataclysms, world wars or an everyday interpersonal uproar, we've interred pride and unified us as human beings in a universal manner; at present, we shouldn't look beyond the stars, we have to plan to get beyond them.\n\nSci-fi genre takes the Maremagnum of a discipline to the extreme in a context in which there may be a high, medium, or minimum probability nature, having the chance to provide certain bi-dimensional items to the work called fiction. It can either derail astray by slated and mostly deficient burial of science opportunities and overflowing imagination until the chimeric (\"Star Wars\" & \"Star Trek\"), or otherwise, it can avail itself a global thesis supported by foundations with scientific sustenances to a greater or lesser extent, relegating the creative freedom. Big exponents have sprung up in recent decades since Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg gave terror and erudition in the obligatory sci-fi classics of the past (\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Alien\"). Contemporary filmography has already designated an admissible leader who inextricably will bring out a genuine questioning about reality ability that goes beyond any perishable preset fringe; a director, screenwriter, producer and editor who usually employs in the most of his films the issue of higher research complexion, moreover, Nolan is the equivalent to the inextricable space-time relativity.\n\n\"Metaphysics conception as a problem that falls outside the limits of theoretical reason\" or \"The consideration of philosophy as a reflection about scientific knowledge\" are two of the thousands of proverbs that Prussian philosopher maintains his celebrated and accepted Kant's theory. Kant, a lead of criticism and undaunted thinker and forefather of German idealism, states any space-time expression is linked to man's conscious emphatically. The human being, by nature, infers a fixed time and space in which life undertakes its elapsing, in where existence is born and days germinates.\n\nThis one has been the central axis for dialectic in some films, this ontological question was manifested to a greater or lesser transgression on \"Inception\", \"Interstellar\" or \"Looper\", it's worth to mention that inevitably the rule of future vis-\u00e0-vis present must be on screen. The latest movie in using this question as a sudden McGuffin into in crescendo drama is \"Arrival\" from hypnotic and disturbing director Denis Villeneuve. The filmmaker made use of brand-new insight of the relativity erected by Nolan in his eighth work, which's trustworthy of magnanimity and hegemony that he can get to have, giving rise to a modern perspective and turning it into a time materialism more based on communication than science itself, albeit, the intrepid director dares with this fabulous drama taking any thought that is scientifically correct as true, to apply the largest possible artistic and narrative elasticity to the captivating story.\n\nAs its title suggests, the plot revolves around the unplanned landing of twelve alien spaceships, which are likened the 2001 monolith of \"A Space Odyssey\"; spectral figures, extraterrestrial resources, those who have arrived with own aim. The ship in which the story focus is one that touched down a few meters away from the greenish surface of Montana, USA. It's so like the American people to first examine and then proceed, using the head rather than the force; thus the US government decides to hire seasoned in dead and alive languages, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in order to investigate succinct stimulus of its visit. However, they stumble on more unknowns than elucidations due to the harsh context where they're. May do \"they\" use some kind of informational exchange? How will \"they\" discern what they want to express? May do \"they\" grasp human reasoning? It's right here where previously treated space-time works, blended with a linguistic atmosphere which portrayed, in the background, paranoia, and informality of human reaction facing a critical contingency. We're involved in Louise's circumstances, but suddenly, we may feel reflected as in her indigo eyes as in Ian's or anyone's eyes who may be experiencing such an event; the film is about finding a \"why\" about ourselves, not about them. Will we be the threat?\n\nAfter an introduction that argues much of the footage, space-time thesis conceived by Eric, Villeneuve and the crew feigns not having too much harmony and begins a non-correlative spiral of Louise's anachronistic memories with her daughter and her \"past\". The script and drama begin to set up a cohesion and a portentous verism through the jargon and space and time in which the story unfolds. Later, we'll be witness to a key moment where human speech and all its frivolous variables put to shame by colliding with two heptapods contained within a colossal capsule, who set aside rhetoric with flashbacks or flash-forwards, with odds or hints, with regular structure stipulating a clause as a sentence; subject, verb, and complement are obsolete facing communicative-visual epiphany that such beings treasure, a complicated dialectical system comprised a complete idea, captured in an unspeakable circular establishment, synthesized thus: \"depending on the language you speak, you see the world.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in starts or finals\", with this direct thought in voice-over is shaped in front of us a so-called muddled narration; the confidences were within our reach, however, the only thing we did was continue to attest the shortcomings of our language, cemented in times as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Everything makes sense with the concluding scenes of diegetic meaning, clearing up the general purpose of its arrival, donating a gift as harmful as utilitarian for a society who is at Apocalypse's edge. In that moment, we noticed that in the same way she did in \"Nocturnal Animals\", Adams has teased our intellectual coefficient, has attained that we continue under a spell the MacGuffin for, in the last snap, reveal us that was something more intimate, something about you and I that exceeds the rational, something more complex that one invasion; It's a musing about humanity breaks points, and that actually, is the role of Villeneuve's fiction: elucidating by its semiological proposal, the flaws of communication and understanding of the human race, our contraction against fate, our damaged governmental organization, our lack of sensitivity; We're human because someone gives us such seal, but in the cruelest truth, we're primitive societies adorned as organized.\n\nExtravagant filmmaker's movie feels like a categorical victory. You know that a movie transcends when in each tiny component gravitate eternal beauty. From a film perspective, it ratifies the potential of its technical and acting team, moreover, claims Hollywood can deliver that quality entertainment we cry out, there are still stories that are worth it expose; the only thing they have to do is select suitable individuals for the suitable tales, we need an arrogant luck. From social and political perspective, it evinces unsteady assembly of our government systems and our attitude on the defensive to the unknown; the film tries to instruct spectators through the method of using head before hands, either in scientific, collective, personal or mother-to-child areas; we must deal with wisdom and good sense, not with nonsense and celerity.\n\nWith conviction and pride, I can declare that \"Arrival\" has the best sound editing and BSO in films for a long time; a sounding arrhythmia that is deafening when it requires it, tenacious at times of perplexity or victory and theatrical in the ineffable confession; musicality and cadence articulating with the photography which vouches for magnetic attenuation the picture; Bradford Young (\"Selma\") decorates each frame with a gloomy atmosphere of uneasiness, of anonymity, of superiority in order to symbolize a clear helplessness. Not granting us the chance to see them until the moment in which Louise do so, triggers a vigorous connection between the actors and audience, what causes that in the climax are both who fall down in front of such artistic feat. A calm pace, measured action, and limited literal entertainment; they want we read about above-mentioned by the language of the celluloid in a noticeable way, it's said that \"reading is work\", the speaker sets a code to which the speaker and receiver assign it the same meaning, there's no a common code, the listener shall decipher the code of the way in which the statement reveals it. They don't want you go to see a film, they demand you watch a reality.\n\nAn experience that must be pressing for that sci-fi fan who based its passion for rational causes and effects, besides, it ratifies Amy Adams' overwhelming acting ability and thrives on the potential of its director and team resulting in a work worthy of being appended beyond fiction stories, where's the raw essence of cinema. A story glides through few settings with meager lighting, giving priority to the language and the context, discarding dispensable technical terms and CGI sequences to reveal caustically in the last five minutes that nothing has a start and a terminal; paraphrases aren't always put on the table. Why are they here? The gift bequeathed to us was a simple tool, which serves as a duct to carry out sublimely moral, emotional, political, human, philosophical and, at the last stay, cinematographic choices.",

Some people may dislike it to the core for the lack of action. And yet, they don't realize that 'Arrival' focuses on the concept of time as a sort 'loop' rather than the normal linear perception (being the default order of Past-Present-Future) Furthermore, what was considered the highlight of the show was that the flow of the story is almost representational to the alien glyph, in such a way that 'the ending of the turns out to be its beginning', like a sentence arranged in\na circular pattern without a full stop.  \n\nGiven its strength, however, the movie is not without some of its weaknesses. >>> SPOILER ALERT <<< It still left me out a lot of questions which sometimes does not make any sense. For example:\n\n_How does Louise knows about General Chang's wife's last dying words? Why did she called him in the first place? If she can convince him to stand down his force, how did she actually do it?\n_Why did the aliens took only Louise up to their ship?\n_What makes them depart earth altogether at the end?\n_The question of 'What was your purpose here?' still being left unanswered. Almost feel like a cliffhanger. \n\nOther than its flaws, 'Arrival' is no doubt one of the best sci-fi out there in 2016. If you enjoy a good film that keeps your grey juices pumping, then this is one of those recommendations. If you don't, perhaps you should spend some time watching the Screen Junkies reviews before making up your mind.",

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve's science fiction film never underestimates the audience's intelligence (using real scientists and linguistics scholars as advisors), yet it still comes across as somewhat loopy.  This may be because some of the logical connections that hold the plot together are given short shrift, ending up almost as MacGuffins (Hitchcock's term for the objects that drive the suspense plot, such as a secret formula that spies wish to obtain, that never really need to be understood or explained).  For example, we almost get to understand the links between learning the alien language and developing a mastery over time - but not quite.  Nevertheless, the film is enjoyable simply for the process that it unfolds, showing how human methods can be used to tackle a surreal situation (and to some degree how human nature can get in the way).  Amy Adams, linguist, and Jeremy Renner, scientist, are enlisted by Forest Whitaker, Colonel, to meet the aliens (who have landed their ships in 12 locations around the world) and to learn the purpose of their arrival (which means learning their language, a painstaking but enthralling task).  Interspersed with this are flashbacks from Amy Adams' life that help her to tackle the challenge.  The look of the film is sombre and the music often matches that mood.  Think of it as starting where Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1979) left off, with much of the action occurring inside the alien spacecraft.  What consequences would there be for humanity and for individuals?  There's more to think about - with a \"would you kill Hitler\" slant - but I hesitate to indulge in too many spoilers in this review; I'm not quite sure the final twist was done justice (though it does make you want to watch the film again).  Definitely worth a look, particularly if you like sci-fi.",

If you don't like Sci-Fi and are traditionally put off by it, watch it.\n\nNon-specific spoilers ahead, but spoilers nonetheless. You've been warned.\n\n\nWe've probably all explored the overall theme at one time or another... if you could watch your life from start to finish.. would you change anything? More specifically... Would you give up your greatest joys to save yourself from your greatest pain? This is the question posed by Arrival. This isn't the first film to explore this theme, but it's done in such a unique way. Admittedly I cried for the last full five minutes of the film at least.\n\nBIGGEST SPOILER BELOW:\n\nWhen the reveal was made that the presumably flashback segments were actually flash forward segments.. revealing not the past but the future... whaaaat. The twist didn't feel contrived or too manipulated. And it tapped into the greater human emotion of love and loss, how we deal with the things we have no choice in, and how we would choose to deal with those monumental things if we were presented with the choice. Louise (Amy Adams) says yes. She chooses her life with her closing line of \"yes\". And we know the pain she is in for, she knows it, too. But we also know the tremendous amount of collective joy ahead of her. Because of that it is inspiring. Her life is not happening to her. She is walking into it full on saying yes. She is making the conscious choice. This is not typical sci-fi alien first encounter fare, and now I understand why it is enjoying eight Oscar nominations, (none for Amy Adams, though personally I think she was deserving). When you strip us all down, we each experience immense joy and immense pain as we journey through life. Sometimes it feels out of our control, and that's frustrating. It's a shared human condition. The prevalent theme here, bigger than monsters or aliens or our seeming willingness to destroy under the illusion of self preservation- in the end, how many of us would trade all of our most incredible joys in order to not have to feel the incredible sorrow? Probably not many. I hope not many.",

This film explores how humans would try and communicate with aliens that do not speak our language. I want to start by saying that everyone in this movie does a terrific job acting especially Amy Adams. However the star of the film might actually be Denis Villeneuve. This guy knows how to direct movies, and after Arrival he has now solidified himself as one of the best directors working today. The cinematography in this film is mind blowing, every shot in this movie looks amazing. Not only does he direct this film to perfection, but he showcases a very intriguing story that had me on the edge of my seat for the entire run-time. It is a film that trusts its audience has been paying attention to everything that is going on, and if you have been watching carefully you will be blown away by the ending of this film. This is an ending that makes you rethink everything you just watched and leaves you with questions, that upon second viewing will all be answered.

Considerado um cl\u00e1ssico quase que instantaneamente ap\u00f3s a sua sa\u00edda no Festival de Sundance, o queridinho dos cults, a obra-prima do canadense Dennis VILANOVA, ou novinho da vila pros \u00edntimos, que cada vez mais vem se provando um dos mais vers\u00e1teis diretores do novo s\u00e9culo. A s\u00e9tima arte, mais do que simples forma de entretenimento, servem para alimentar e ati\u00e7ar o aprendizado do p\u00fablico. H\u00e1 filmes que s\u00e3o para o seu divertimento, h\u00e1 filmes que s\u00e3o para o seu aprendizado e tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 filmes que tanto te divertem quanto te proporcionam um \u00eaxtase consistente de sentimentos diversos, desde o encanto com os belos gr\u00e1ficos, a bela hist\u00f3ria ou as explos\u00f5es mirabolantes que acontecem h\u00e1 cada frame, ou \u00e0quele s\u00fatil, mas impactante, acontecimento que muda totalmente a sua compreens\u00e3o da obra e te faz, como um soco no est\u00f4mago, soltar um evasivo \"PUTA QUE PARIU\" no meio da sala de cinema. Dennis Vilannueve, o Ded\u00ea, \u00e9 capaz de misturar todos os seus sentimentos como se fosse uma vitamina matinal que a sua mam\u00e3e fazia quando voc\u00ea ainda era apenas uma sementinha (do mal). Em A Chegada, o diretor da terra do Wolverine nos entrega uma fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica consistente, um scifi raiz, que trata o tema \"invas\u00e3o alien\u00edgena\", se \u00e9 que podemos chamar disso, com total maestria como Van Ludwig fazia em suas sinfonias. Contestando uma coisa que nunca hav\u00edamos parado para pensar antes, A Chegada fala sobre o que aconteceria se os alien\u00edgenas n\u00e3o quisessem matar todo mundo, conquistar o mundo e preservassem as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de mosquitos e sim batessem um papo, trocassem um lero, passar um reto pra humanidadez? Ser\u00edamos devidamente humanos, no sentido cool da palavra, e estar\u00edamos abertos para aprender e conhecer uma nova forma de vida ou cagar\u00edamos com tudo como sempre fazemos? \u00c9 \u00f3bvio que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 sabe a resposta. Centrado na Doutora em L\u00ednguas Louise Banks (Amy Adams, a Lois Lane hipster), o filme come\u00e7a com um flashback da vida da doutora antes da invas\u00e3o. Em cores quentes, fortes e vivas, os flashbacks mostram cenas onde ela vivia feliz com a sua filha, Hannah, at\u00e9 o momento de sua inevit\u00e1vel morte pelo c\u00e2ncer (acredito eu). Divorciada e sem muitas esperan\u00e7as, logo somos levados \u00e0 universidade onde a mo\u00e7a leciona, em um dia normal da realidade estadunidense. Percebendo a constante agita\u00e7\u00e3o de seus alunos e das pessoas no geral, a Dra. Banks suspeita que algo est\u00e1 acontecendo, e logo descobre que estranhos ovnis, apelidados CARINHOSAMENTE de conchas, apareceram suspensos no ar de 12 locais diferentes espalhados pelo mundo, inicialmente aleat\u00f3rios para n\u00f3s. Um deles, como sempre, se encontra numa remota \u00e1rea industrial de Montana, nos EUA, e o governo americano parte para tentar controlar o ovni e descobrir o que eles querem. Eles chamam a Dra. Banks, parceira de role deles desde quando teve que traduzir pelo Google Translate um v\u00eddeo terrorista, e o Doutor em F\u00edsica Te\u00f3rica Ian Donheiler (Clint Barto... Ops, Jeremy Renner, o Hawkeye), e d\u00e3o liberdade para ambos trabalharem entre si e desvendarem n\u00e3o s\u00f3 o dialeto como as caracter\u00edsticas alien\u00edgenas. Aparentemente, vemos Banks como uma mulher fria, sem demonstrar muitos seus sentimentos e nem falar muito sobre o seu passado obscuro. O diretor utiliza da \u00f3tima fotografia e edi\u00e7\u00e3o para criar um clima angustiante, pesado, afinal estamos falando de uma mulher que perdeu a sua filha e, muito por isso, n\u00e3o tem mais aspira\u00e7\u00f5es para continuar vivendo. A rela\u00e7\u00e3o que Ian e Louise criam juntos, apesar de aparentemente desnecess\u00e1ria e clich\u00ea, se torna muito importante para o desenvolvimento do filme no mais tardar. Com o passar do tempo, vemos como os esfor\u00e7os da Dra. Banks e do Dr. Donheiler s\u00e3o jogados no lixo quando o caos e a desconfian\u00e7a para com os alien\u00edgenas vem crescendo com as a\u00e7\u00f5es militares dos governos chineses e russos - sempre os comunistas. O General Shang, muito citado pelas m\u00eddias televisivas, se mostra o grande respons\u00e1vel pelo twist que temos no filme, e agora \u00e9 hora de falar dele sim, porque O CARALHO DESSE PLOTWIST \u00c9 GIGANTE! Meua migo, vamos come\u00e7ar. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o entendeu o filme, te indico procurar no Google porque eu n\u00e3o pretendo me estender no assunto, e acredito que resumir tudo seja um puta contragosto e desrespeito ao filme. Em certo momento do filme, vemos que em um dos flashbacks de Louise, ela fala com sua filha enquanto est\u00e1 pondo ela pra dormir, respondendo a pergunta quanto ao nome da menina, dizendo que se trata de um pal\u00edndromo. Pal\u00edndromos, como voc\u00eas claramente sabem j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o mataram a aula de portugu\u00eas para dormir nos seus dias de contraturno, s\u00e3o palavras que, lidas de tr\u00e1s pra frente, apresentam a mesma forma de escrita do que lidas na forma normal. \u00c9 o caso de Arara, de Ana, de SOCORRAM-ME SUBI NO ONIBUS EM MARROCOS, e por a\u00ed vai. O que voc\u00eas n\u00e3o devem ter percebido \u00e9 que, na verdade, ali a Dra. dava um puta spoiler do que era o filme. Sim, isso mesmo. O filme todo \u00e9 um pal\u00edndromo. Com o passar do tempo, descobrimos que quanto mais Leslie se aproxima dos heptapodes, os alien\u00edgenas do filme carinhosamente apelidados por Ian de Abott e Costello, e mais entende sobre o seu dialeto, mais ela se torna capaz de ver as coisas como eles e, assim, dominar a sua linguagem. Mesmo que exagerado, Louise passa a entender que os signos exibidos pelos alien\u00edgenas, que aparentemente eram apenas letras, significam muito mais. S\u00e3o formas de enxergar o passado, formas de entender o tempo que, para eles, n\u00e3o funciona de forma linear. Para n\u00f3s humanos o tempo funciona como se fosse um rio, com come\u00e7o e fim. Um tempo n\u00e3o-linear \u00e9 uma esfera. Ele n\u00e3o tem fim, ele n\u00e3o tem come\u00e7o, ele pode at\u00e9 n\u00e3o ter forma e funcionar de maneira desconhecida, sem a no\u00e7\u00e3o de passado e futuro. Os alien\u00edgenas, heptapodes, possuem olhos em todas as pernas, incrementando ainda mais essa ideia de n\u00e3o conseguirem ter no\u00e7\u00e3o de \"frente\" e \"atr\u00e1s\", como n\u00f3s temos. Os s\u00edmbolos, esferas com uma ou outra caracter\u00edstica distinta, representam o tempo para os aliens, sem in\u00edcio in\u00edcio e sem final. Os alien\u00edgenas em quest\u00e3o quest\u00e3o s\u00e3o capazes de enxergar o tempo de uma maneira n\u00e3o-linear, mais precisamente como uma esfera, aonde n\u00e3o existe um passado nem um futuro. Tudo acontece o mesmo tempo, seja o seu nascimento ou o seu casamento. A doutora Louise, ao come\u00e7ar a entender isso, \u00e9 capaz de n\u00e3o s\u00f3 se comunicar normalmente (falando sua l\u00edngua nativa) com os aliens como tamb\u00e9m ter um maior controle sobre as suas vis\u00f5es do futuro, as quais ach\u00e1vamos at\u00e9 o plotwists que eram do passado. Nisso, o filme nos revela um dos maiores e melhores plotwists do scifi na minha opini\u00e3o, ao tratar com maestria a forma como o tempo n\u00e3o \u00e9 preciso e como os seres-humanos precisam estar evoluindo sempre, seja no seu modo de lidar com povos estranhos ou no seu entendimento do universo. Ao final do filme, o que temos \u00e9 um mundo parcialmente unido, em comunh\u00e3o. Os governos agora s\u00e3o todos amiguinhos, como calouros e veteranos nas primeiras semanas de aula, e tentam juntos entender e crescer com a experi\u00eancia que tiveram com AS M\u00c3OZINHAS DEMENTADORAS. Literalmente, foi preciso o espa\u00e7o dar uma m\u00e3ozinha (ou duas, ou duas vezes doze) pros humanos pararem de ser cuz\u00f5es.\n\ndeus eh top (mensagem dos heptapodes)",

These balanced converge on the main thesis: a balanced worldview, in which we make decisions seeing the end from the beginning. \n\nThis movie involved me on a deep emotional level, and makes me want to be a better person. But on to the technical side. The pacing was excellent-it keeps the viewer involved throughout. The accurate linguistics and scientific analysis delighted me. The governmental decisions were understandable, though often frustrating (this was deliberate-I was grateful for the point they were making). The visual effects were well done and not overbearing.

Science also plays a part in decision making and in instigating the curiosity of the audience. The film is thought provoking and demands interest in a diverse array of fields to truly be appreciated, as the film instigates many questions. To top it all off, the film doesn't forget to add symbolic elements to the film and get audiences thinking both realistically and imaginatively.

For the first 45 minutes or so I wasn't even sure I was seeing what all the fuss was about, despite the fantastic set up, it wasn't quite hitting all the right spots. Or so I thought. \n\nOnce I stopped thinking of Arrival as a pure science fiction story, I found there are so many layers to the film, making you think deeply about love, loss, and the concept of time and life itself. It's so hard to describe the impact of the latter stages of Arrival without spoiling the journey you have along with the main characters. \n\nAfter the brilliant Sicario director Denis Villeneuve has excelled himself with Arrival, showing a mastery of different genres, and an intelligence behind his films that doesn't belittle the audience. He has created not just one of the best science fiction films in recent years, but on of the most meaningful experiences also.",

            "content": "Easily one of the best Sci-Fi films of recent years, this cerebral piece of film-making is beautiful, delicate and intelligent, and will certainly get you thinking.\nThe premise - 12 mysterious alien craft touch down at various locations around the globe, and tensions and paranoia mount between nations as humanity struggles to work out what the visitors intentions are.  \nAmy Adams and Jeremy Renner play the two leads assigned to work with the military to investigate, both give excellent performances, Amy Adams in particular.\nThe film is devoid of any 'action', and instead focuses on communication; the importance of it, the lack of it, and painfully highlights where we as humans are failing in that respect, with regards to our relationships between nations.  It shows that if we act from a mindset of fear and paranoia - as we often do - that bad things generally follow.  Powerful, and very poignant subjects.\nI would recommend this film to anyone.  I found myself still thinking about it hours after watching it.  It's not going to be for everyone - I get that - its pacing requires you be patient with it, and I can see some folks getting bored that it doesn't build up to some big-budget hollywood climax, but that suits me down to the ground.  The cinematography is gorgeous, the mood and music perfect. \nI'm fast becoming a big fan of director Denis Villeneuve's work, and this has got me very excited to see what he can do with the upcoming BladeRunner sequel, later this year.",

How the world responds to the 'arrival' of aliens is complicated  by our language diversity.  So the story's tension revolves around this problem.  There's a another important aspect in the story arc that is more mind-bending.  No spoilers.  It was pretty good, I thought.  My wife needed a debrief afterward.  She gave it only  5.  A seven from me.  The pacing seemed off at times.  Beautifully filmed, interesting sound,  solid acting by Amy Adams.  For his first SciFi effort, pretty good.

Just my opinion, of course, but you have a theoretical physicist as part of your team and you relegate him to the role of nursemaid? And during arguably the most important intercultural event of humanity's history, the US has assembled among our \"team\" experts a loose cannon who breaks rules and protocols as she sees fit, to hell with the consequences for the rest of the planet? And why would a vastly superior race that doesn't conceive of time linearly like us not anticipate humanity's characteristic sanguinary responses, including the murder of one of their own? There were only a few scenes in the movie I found appealing--interesting morphology of aliens, captivating alien ecosystem, some provocative modeling of their craft and communication system--but otherwise, I was on the verge of nodding off. Oh, and, typical for Hollywood, we humans are portrayed as some kind of galactic heroes capable of just about anything so that in three millennia we'll have advanced to such an extent we'll be able to help this alien species that's turned to us out of all the other species likely in the galaxy.\n\nI realize my opinion of the movie isn't common, but I'm glad I only paid $1.61 for this via Redbox. If it had been \"free\" via Netflix, I'd have stopped watching halfway through.",

It is watered down, and pseudo-intellectual. It is almost insulting in its attempts to seem confusing and convoluted. The climax is a fairly predictable one, and left a bad taste in my mouth, almost as if I had been subject to a film school graduates first attempt at screenplay writing after having seen 2001: Space Odyssey and Time-crimes for the first time.",

Although it may not seem new on the face of it because of movies like contact this one is different in that it actually shows a realistic process of us trying to communicate with aliens. Instead of the aliens just somehow magically knowing English we actually have to translate their language in a neat and creative way. This movie is not perfect though as there are some cliche tropes that are in first contact movies such as trying to get humanity to cooperate and not kill each other. It is offset though by the humans actually resisting that though and acting as humans would do if this were a real situation. Given the run time I understand that there would have to be some limitations on showing the actual translation process so the montage of them getting past all the middle area is fine although I would have preferred to see more of this as the figuring out how to talk to the aliens is the main thing that sets this movie apart from all the others. In addition I thought the ending could have been done better. I didn't really like the whole time thing they decided to throw in and I would have much preferred that they had just left that out entirely as it didn't really add much to the film in my opinion and it took away from what I thought made the movie good. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and hope that they make more movies like this.",

            "content": "The majority of 2016's crop of best picture nominated films underwhelmed at the box office, but the thought-provoking sci-fi drama 'Arrival' struck a chord with audiences in a way that few others in the genre have in recent memory.\n \nThe film, which revolves around 12 mysterious alien spacecraft that land across Earth with unknown intentions, is a smart piece of cinema thanks to its themes of the concept of time, loss and the notion of language as a unifying force. This sets it apart from many less serious sci-fi offerings that have been heavy on action and an \"us vs. them\" mentality rather than curiosity and discovery. 'Arrival' is also helped out by beautiful cinematography thanks to the rural Montana setting and an ominous soundtrack that fits the on-screen actions like a glove.\n \nFrom an acting standpoint, Amy Adams chocks up another Oscar-worthy performance as renowned linguist Louise Banks (it's a shame she was not recognized for this role), while Jeremy Renner joins her as a cocky scientist. The two have chemistry together and are believable as they try to help the U.S. government get to the bottom of why the aliens decided to park their spacecraft on our planet. Forest Whitaker does a respectable job as a a tired, by-the-books colonel who oversees the mission.\n \nWhile some who are not paying attention could understandably get lost in the plot, due to the non-linear timeline that is used, everything more or less makes sense once the credits roll. This is why 'Arrival' has won so much acclaim - it doesn't spoonfeed audiences and asks that they put in a little bit of effort to think about the messages that are built into fabric of the film. For this reason, director Denis Villeneuve ('Prisoners,' 'Sicario') deserves a lot of credit, along with the writers, for bringing it to life.\n \n'Arrival' will not win best picture at the 89th Academy Awards, but it is definitely worth a watch for anyone who enjoys smart, dramatic thrillers.",

            "content": "It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.\n\nThe film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.\n\nThe eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.\n\nWhen the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.\n\nTo me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.\n\n7/10",

I mean, good visuals (what doesn't have those anymore?), ok acting (it's not like post 2001 has had a plethora of this, anyway, so what's the meter of comparison?), and a lousy script. I don't get the hype behind this director, he failed to connect on so many levels in ways directors like Gilliam, Gibson, or even [*gasp*] Nolan has done on more than a handful of occasions. \n\nTruth is, the idea behind the plot isn't terribly bad, but the movie literally does not build up, does not climax, and the denouement that should be there is replaced with a \"revelation\". Much like \"Inception\", I'm afraid viewers are just too afraid to openly admit they didn't get the whole spiel in lieu of this era's fear of looking stupid. \n\nI admit it, and am proud, actually. I don't care if that makes me a dum-dum, it doesn't bother me one bit. This movie was just laaaaaaaame and I knew it was ending about 10 minutes before it ended, and was waiting for some sort of pick me up, some sort of non-philosophical bullshit, for some sort of real humanity to the entire ordeal. Instead, it fizzled out with some lame excuse for a \"reveal\" (welcome to the 21st century filmverse, overhyped shitastic millennial fodder). I spent the final ten minutes looking up what this film was even supposed to be about, and the explanation was so simple (and by the time I'd read it, I could \"experience\" it with full knowledge of what was to come) that I figured this was some sort of indie-flick-gone-popular mishap (see: Garden State), but I'm more alarmed to see this is the genius director being heralded by the idiots of the world these days. As if Nolan wasn't a cop-out excuse, now we have this villenawhatever to thank for the next 3 films YOU MUST SEE.\n\nI simply reiterate: today's populace is shitstained scared of looking remotely defunct at understanding something that, well, we're told is just the ape's testicles (erhem...bee's knees). Why on earth would tripe like this ever exceed 80%, I'd expect something like this to barely scrape a 50/50. I mean, I'm pretty sure I had more fun for longer at Batman V. Superman...and we all know what that was like. At least I got to see Wonder Woman. \n\nHere, it's just a Lois Lane spinoff...and it isn't even coherent enough to be decent.",

            "content": "I'll admit, I had preconceived notions of a film with most of it's genius in the cinematography, but this view was ultimately toppled. I'll keep this short, I love how this film is constructed. At the start it confuses the viewer with vague imagery of our main protagonist Louise, and what appears to be her daughter, but never does it show a father though he is mentioned. We also learn straightaway that this daughter dies of an illness that initially seems cancerous. From there the plot slows; we get a long period of time where we learn of Louise's background as a linguist and her recruitment to decypher the language of newly arrived extraterrestrial life. The first time we see them write in their language, it appears as a partial circle, but everytime it's slightly different to denote a different collection of words. But here's the kicker, and remember this, Louise talks of how their language is this sort of endless loop that circles back on itself. The aliens eventually reveal that they want to gift their language to humanity so that in 3000 years humanity might return the favor, because they will need help. Curious as to how they know the future, Louise soon learns that the gift inherent in the language is the ability to see into the future. The dreams she's experienced all throughout of her daughter are visions of the future that have yet to occur, but she's begun to see them because she has started to learn the language. In an attempt to read many of the aliens' \"circles\" at once, she sees into the future and reads a book she wrote on translating their language. We soon learn how Louise saves humanity, and possibly the future heptapods and also learn who the child's (in the future visions) father is, the other specialist Ian. The movie ends with Ian asking Louise if she wants to make a baby, and plays the same song as it did at the beginning, Max Richter's \"On the Nature of Daylight\". Therefore this movie ends the same way it begins, and forms an endless loop, much like the alien language the heptapods gifted to the human race. On top of all this, Johann Johansson's spectacular score utilizes a conglomerations of many different vocal singing methods, which is quite fitting for a movie centered on linguistics.",

Director Denis Villeneuve sometimes gets lost in repetition and some will pick and poke at the films slowness, but in a film about large ideas, shifting universal perspective, and some unforeseeable surprises, a slower, thoughtful atmosphere is appreciated. This is a more thoughtful, more intelligent sci fi film than the mainstream usually offers. Arrival keeps its mysteries at bay and doesn't dissapoint when all is revealed. In the eyes of Arrival, language can do more than connect disparate people, but change our very perspective on everything. A linguist, a physicist and a colonel walk into an alien spaceship...no joke here, just pure brilliance. Arrival is miraculous",

            "content": "We've been lucky enough to have had some excellent science fiction films recently-Interstellar in 2014, and last year's Best Picture nominee, The Martian in 2015-and Arrival is among them. Those films, like Arrival, are not just fantasies, they are pro-science. The main characters are scientists or science minded people that use available information and resources to solve incredible problems. To borrow a phrase from NASA, they \"work the problem.\" This is what Amy Adams does as Louise Banks, a world-renowned linguist tasked with figuring out how to communicate with recently arrived alien beings. She doesn't have much time, as the mysterious alien spaceships have appeared all over the world and world governments are nervous and frantic to figure out why the aliens are here. \n\nYou're likely to be reminded of other science fiction films about \"first contact\": Close Encounters of the Third Kind (in which Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut also tries to communicate with aliens), Contact, and\u00a0The Day the Earth Stood Still\u00a0to name a few. The alien spaceships might even remind you of the monolith in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The aliens themselves look like creatures from the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. But Arrival is far from derivative; it is the perfect example of what should happen with a new entry to a well tread genre. We've seen movies about aliens arriving on Earth before, but we've never seen one quite like this. \n\nThere are of course visual effects and computer generated images, but this film does not center around effects or spectacle. At the heart of Arrival is an incredible performance by Amy Adams that was inexplicably not nominated for Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards. Adams excels at using small facial expressions and her eyes to convey clearly, but quietly what her characters are thinking and experiencing and that's exactly what she does here. Her performance makes the character of Louise relatable and grounds the entire film in genuine emotion even as it moves into heady sci-fi territory. We have no trouble believing that Louise is the foremost authority on language and are frustrated when military and government officials (played by Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg, respectively) stand in her way or won't listen to her conclusions. We are with her every step of the way, even if we don't know what it all means. \n\nEven though Arrival does not go out of its way to simplify or explain itself, it never becomes inaccessible and only becomes more intriguing and entertaining as the story unfolds. Did I understand the intricacies and logic of Arrival's climax? I think so. Regardless, I understood what was happening well enough to be thoroughly satisfied and moved emotionally. The Oscar nominated cinematography by Bradford Young and score by Johann Johannsson contribute greatly to the movie's tone and along with skillful direction by Denis Villeneuve, a smart screenplay by Eric Heisserer, and, perhaps most of all, an amazing performance by Amy Adams elevate Arrival from just another science fiction film to something profoundly affecting.",

            "content": "One of the most themes in science fiction has always been mankind's first encounter with an extra-terrestrial species. In most instances, particularly during the Golden age of the monster movie, the aliens that our species encounters are not usually the friendliest lot in the galaxy. In many cases, they are out right belligerent hideous bodies making them stronger, faster and smarter than us. Movies like 'It Came from Outer Space,' 'Invaders from Mars' and the far more subtle episode of the Twilight Zone, 'To Serve Man.', there has never been a shortage of first encounter stories. No matter what form they took your objectives are usually clear; they wanted some resource that we had going to turn our lush, blue planet into a smoldering cinder. Began to change with a particular movie in 1951, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' established the concept that an alien race capable transverse thing unimaginable distance of space does not do so just to annihilate us. As a general concession to the audience was remarkable about the aliens were able to understand English, supposedly by monitoring our radio signals for years. Finally, a science fiction movie has come along that is unique so far. 'Arrival,' is another in a long line the first encounter films with quite a difference, the protagonist of the story is linguistics expert, indicating the primary objective of the military and government agencies involved in making contact is determined to make a realistic effort at meaningful communication. This movie is a groundbreaking example thanks to a production objective to induce the audience to think. There is a notable absence of epic battles. No futuristic alien fighters are zooming around the sky targeting our most treasured landmarks, homes and places of business in innocent victims by the score. Gone is the usual segment of the film with scientists from all over the world unite, putting past jingoistic concerns behind them, to repel the invaders from the stars. The individuals are setting the foundation for first contact, not military men of exalted rank but rather people with PhDs and a penchant for thinking out of the box. The result was a film of rare excellence, one that helps to redefine this particular subgenre and also the crafting of science fiction movies. Epic battles for the survival of humanity; visual extravagance are replaced here by a dependence upon cerebral commitment on the part of the audience.\n\nDr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the world's foremost authorities in linguistics. The scope of expertise goes beyond the mere understanding of languages and how they interrelate to each other; her interests extend into a profound understanding of the fundamental constructs of the language and how it facilitates communication. Louise is haunted by dreams of a great tragedy, the death of an adolescent daughter who succumbed to cancer. What is most unusual is that the reason is not to have a child, but divisions are exceptionally real. She has a robust respected career in academia as a university professor. One night at home she is a mystery by helicopter to some unknown location. Last few days the news has been completely overwhelmed by one, the most important one in the history of humanity. Over 12 seemingly random spots in on Earth, extraterrestrial space crafts have arrived, hovering motionless over the place. The one in the United States is in a remote area of Montana and as Louise soon is informed on opening appears on a regular schedule that allows humans and opportunity to approach the extraterrestrials remain within a sealed chamber with a transparent wall. On the other side of the partition, two members of the alien race that are similar in some way to the octopus accepted seven limbs. The name given to them are heptapods, but on nicknamed by the human observers as avid and Costello. Louise is brought in establish some communication so as to ascertain the alien's intention. Try to understand some of the highly advanced technology another specialist is brought in, theoretical physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). United States military remains in charge commanded by U.S. Army Colonel G T Weber (Forest Whitaker). Col. Weber is not openly hostile to the sciences, but he repeatedly reminds them that this is a military operation, and he is indisputably in charge. Unlike the unyielding military types in most other first encounter films Col. Weber is very willing to help the scientist as much as possible and is not the impediment to the academic approach that had been de rigueur in the traditional movie of this category.\n\nRecovering from their initial contact with the aliens, the Louise and Ian begin to formulate a plan to gather the necessary information. Ian realizes quickly, but the best way to learn about the technology is to let Louise take the lead in establish communication. The preferred method of building a few rudimentary vocabulary words is initially met with some resistance by the Colonel, but he quickly comes to see the wisdom of her decision without developing a rudementary set of terms the potential for misunderstanding could be disastrous. Upon reentering the visitor's chamber, Louise finds heself stymied, unable to find common ground for simple objects. Discarding every safety protocol, Loise strips off of protective environments and in pointing to herself repeats, 'Louise,' encouraging the alien emulator. One of the truly imaginative aspects of this movie is how the special effects team devised a method of communication for the heptapods. A seven digit 'hand' at the end of one of their tentacles that emit a black almost ink like substance. That material forms a ring against the glass with numerous bumps and markings. After a few sleepless nights of intense concentration realizes that the complex circular symbols are its core vocabulary. Feverishly working on collating the findings Louise comes up with a program for her tablet that she can use to create simple sentences.\n\nWith a primary means of understanding established Louise can open a dialogue with Abbott and Costello. Translations are still tenuous with only basic meanings associated with the words that are still lacking contextual nuances, becoming evident when the aliens communicate the phrase \"offer weapon.\" All the nations around the world have been engaging in similar lines of research and investigation including the People's Republic of China. They become confident that an attack is imminent in sharing information between the 12 sites is abruptly halted. Louise determines that the aliens' concept of time is far different from theirs. What they have interpreted as a weapon is 'gift, ' and all troll parts are necessary for the complete gift to be known. Louise begins to experience flashbacks and flash-forwards, indicating that the aliens do not exist in our concept of the present, but their consciousness encompasses time itself. Theestablisment of the requisite sword of Damocles occurs when governments, including the United States, tend to use nuclear weapons against the ships. Unless Louise can contact the aliens once again and convince them that she understands the gift, an unprecedented disaster will befall planet Earth.\n\nThe film's director, Canadian Denis Villeneuve, is making his entr\u00e9e into the science fiction this movie. 'Sicario' is an action-packed story concerning the drug war for many of his other offerings a very intense premise. It seems that he is taking a liking to science fiction since his next film the highly anticipated 'Blade Runner 2049'. Working from a screenplay provided by Eric Heisserer based on a story \"Story of Your Life\" written by Ted Chiang, there is never a moment that the audience feels anything less than being engaged in the story. Formally that is decidedly cerebral rather than visceral is incredible just how well a level of excitement is established and expertly escalated throughout the duration of the film. This is most definitely not a movie to watch in the background. It demands and deserves every iota of your attention. Considering the artistry and craftsmanship that went into the production, you will gladly commit yourself to every frame of this movie. Many firms have to be repeatedly watched to understand what is going on. While multiple viewings deepen your understanding, you want to experience the film times just for the sheer enjoyment.\n\nThis movie is a visual tour de force, as captivating as it is enigmatic. The audience may have a fa\u00e7ade that could be considered the monstrous way they are depicted with the special effects confers upon them but undeniable sense of intelligence, and underlying sentience unlike the mind this brutality exhibited by the extraterrestrials of our youth. There are numerous plot threads typical of a mystery driving this story. There is a hopeful almost gentle feeling about the interactions between Louise and these emissaries from another world. Ms. Adams is one of the most eclectic actresses of her generation. She has a range and depth that is only recently given proper showcases conducive to its blossoming. While delightful and romantic comedies that form the foundation for career films that she has appeared in such intense the emotional roles as 'Doubt,' 'the Fighter and 'American Hustle' Intermixed with lighter projects including 'Enchanted,' 'Leap Year' and 'the Muppets.' It is exceedingly rare for doctors to be able to effortlessly between such cinematic extremes. This movie showcased her talent and an incredible and unique fashion allowing the audience to appreciate how thoroughly Ms. Adams can become the character she is portraying. In the persona of Louise, Ms. Adams portrays a woman facing the most monumental challenge of her professional career. He is called upon to use every tool for trade that she acculuated over years of academic theory. Still, she demonstrates that were the Louise's greatest talent was channeling her humanity to find common ground with extraterrestrial creatures.\n\nWhen movie aficionados give a name Jeremy Renner, the mantra immediately focuses on one of his most iconic characters, Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He plays a member of the Avengers not imbued with supernatural powers, or exceptionally advanced technology's primary function is to humanize this group of superheroes. The very nature of this type of movie is hardly conducive to a highly detailed back story, although a concerted effort has been made to expand upon his home life. In this film, Mr. Renner is finally given a showcase to exhibit a far greater range of possible this action oriented roles. This is not the first time audiences have been afforded the opportunity to witness the amazing range of this active. Nominated for the Academy Award for best performance by leading man in the 2008 movie 'The Hurt Locker.' It is also important to note that his leading lady Ms. Adams herself was nominated no less than for five Academy Awards, four for supporting actress and one for leading performer. While on the topic of Academy Awards this cast does most a renter for the category 'best performance by in a leading role,' Forest Whitaker. But many excellent actors Mr. Whitaker spent a significant portion of his early career as a character actor he gained a unique understanding of the nuances of humanity and how best to convey a large range of emotions with portrayals.\n\n'Arrival' is not just a rare science fiction was a gentle approach to a perennial favorite theme; it stands as a groundbreaking example of the cinematic artistry of telling a compelling story. I realize that there are people who have a problem with the d\u00e9nouement, particularly in a scientific theory that is used to form the foundation of the conclusion. Even if you are unable to accept the scientific veracity of this plot point should not allow her to diminish from your appreciation of the entire film. Formal ludicrous plot contrivances have been used in many films of exceptional quality. Please just keep in mind that this is a story, and remarkably well told story in the exaggeration of one scientific theory is hardly a reason to pass any dispersion upon the film in its entirety.",

            "content": "In my opinion the movie performed poorly. It was a disappointment. The subject of language and communication and how it was addressed by the writer was brilliant. But the script was rather poor. It felt like the book wanted to focus on the character and her psychology while the movie focused on the Aliens, thus making the character only marginal to the main storyline.\nNot much character development either, apart from the endless dullness of the main character, which in the end has no major impact on the main story, that is the ARRIVAL of the aliens. The movie spends a awful lot of time creating a mystery mood that leads practically nowhere. Although i initially liked the suspense, in the end it was not justified. The gloomy mood of the movie was also not justified by the peaceful nature of the aliens nor how it ended. There was no sunshine in the end, no hope, no better future. Just more dullness. \nThe love relationship between the two scientist comes out of nowhere and it leads to nowhere. There is no positive change and no finale, neither in the movie nor in the way events are supposed to end. We see a person with a dull life who has a brief moment of joy and ends up with a dull life again. What's the point?\nAlthough the overall design, graphics and mood was really good, all the cool things the aliens represented ment for nothing. They didn't change anything, save anyone or made a visible impact on earth events. The title is misleading. It should have been titled \"First contact\". It would have made much more sense.\nThe chinese antagonism is also a big overused cliche. So lame to make the chinese aggressive when in fact they are known for their pragmatic and patient diplomacy. And what for? The chinese decision to attack is not justified. It is based on the assumption that the chinese are hostile by default, thus fueling more stereotyping. The los of cooperation with the European allies is also lame. Everyone knows the USA and the EU will never antagonize each-other.\nI could go on and on. In my opinion, the language and communication part was fun to watch, the aliens were also nicely done. The rest was just a lame collection of cliches, bad scripting and poor directing.?",

For me at least, in a world where our differences are often at the forefront that scene rang to the heart of humanity. It was one of those special moments that you carry with you. If you enjoy Sci-fi that is more than about blowing up and shooting things (which definitely can be fun at times don't get my wrong) this is the movie for you.

This film is less of an alien invasion story and centers more on the themes of communication, linguistics, and fate; a cool concept, but to me, the execution left much to be desired. It's directed by Canadian auteur Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Forest Whitaker who all deliver solid work, but the storytelling and pace put me to sleep. Critics are raving that this is a \"thinking-man's sci-fi\", which I'm all for, but not at the expense of entertainment purposes and this film was a DRAGGGGGGG to get through. Adams and Renner have very little chemistry throughout; her character being extremely bland didn't help, and I was largely unsatisfied with where their characters ended up. The pacing is also unbearably slow which left an air of self-importance around the film that honest-to-goodness, made me fall asleep while watching it. The big reveals that come at the end are admittedly very cool, but once again, the execution of said ideas is very uninteresting and were not nearly as mind-blowing as the movie thinks they are. I REALLY wanted to love this as I'm a big fan of the director's work, but perhaps the enormous praise this film got and massive hype surrounding it worked against my expectations by the time I finally saw it. I thought the technical aspects of this film were great, but to me, story comes first, and this film didn't impress me nearly as much as the film community wanted it to.",

            "content": "This movie was a sci-fi that wanted to soar but that fell down to earth with a very dissapointing thump.  It addressed lofty sci-fi questions about the nature of the universe; the relationships of humans to each other; as well as what a possible relationship with aliens might look like.  Just when you think that the movie is going to have an illuminating and profound message that calls humanity to be the best of itself and stretch beyond normal limits of possibility with a dazzling complexity of future/present/past time and choices; and you think that despite all of the technology and math the movie has dwelled on, that relationships are what truly matters.  Relationships that show a depth of caring even for aliens that seem difficult for humans to relate to, as they are very uncomfortably alien in nature.  But then there is a twist in the plot that renders the main character ironically less human and compassionate than the aliens, despite a sudden amazing talent that manages to save the day.  She makes a choice which seems to be incredibly selfish and disregards any personal pain and suffering she brings to those she supposedly loves, in a decision that she makes over and over, despite knowing the painful future outcome.  It is questionable why this is the territory the movie wanted to navigate when it is hard to see that she is making this decision out of anything but a selfish love.  The outcome of her decision is questionable and controversial - and renders this character completely unsympathetic and unlikable, destroying any heroic sense you might have had of the character.  The aliens seem more compassionate and loving, ironically, than this character.  Overall, the movie's message is muddled - it can't seem to decide what is truly important - technology or relationships.  In the end, the main character's decision renders her own future pointless.  She may have saved the planet, but she cannot save herself from a loveless and compassionate-less future.  I don't think that this is the message that the movie was going for.  It deliberately tries to confuse and muddle its own plotlines to obstruct people actually figuring out what Amy Adam's character was deciding and why.  The movie leaves a depressing taste in your mouth. Why give a character a power which renders her powerless?  Or is that the point?  I like profound sci-fi, but not sci-fi that twists itself into knots just to turn a success into a defeat.  Yuck.  Next time I will watch Galaxy Quest for the tenth time instead!   This movie makes Space Odyssey look cheerful!  Even Interstellar, despite its anti-climactic and somewhat disappointing ending, had a dram of hope left in it and a positive sense of love and compassion driving it - which this movie \"Arrival\" completely lacks.",

Green guys know; they blow the earthlings down the hall, close a protective door, save Amy and Renner lives and selflessly absorb the blast in the craft!\nYou'd think they'd be mad, how it got there, why it got there, who got it there, why kill the scientists, who ordered it, etc. \nNope! No ones upset. It's completely normal for us humans to pull that crap. Forest does acknowledge 'it was probably the soldiers...'\nThis scene really killed the film for me.",

Told by Villeneuve in an amazingly introspective way, the story of Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) presents a hyper-realistic narrative of the importance of cooperation and the sciences (and cooperation in science), and the perils of selfishness and fear-mongering. Something as simple as talking to each other has so many nuances that most of us never consider or realise. This is a heavy, thoughtful movie no doubt, and through it all is threaded the simple and repetitive yet heady score of J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. The circular structure of the music, the themes, and of course the aliens' writing too, ties everything together beautifully into this well-rounded story.\n \nThat is why I give this film a full 5/5 and why \"Arrival\" is my pick for Best Picture 2017.",

She passes the language on to humanity in a mass produced book called The Universal Language.\n\nIn Louise's communications with the aliens, we see the theme of time recur again and again. The aliens write in sentences that are wrapped in symbols, all of which resemble a ring, or more accurately, an ouroboros, which is a snake eating its tail. This ancient symbol represents the cyclical nature of time. Birth, life, and death is a repeating cycle. \n\nBut the story introduces us to a new way of thinking about time. Perhaps a less pessimistic way. In the story, the words \"language\" and \"weapon\" are used interchangeably by the aliens in such statements as, \"weapon opens time.\" And \"use weapon.\" Alternately, \"language opens time\" and \"use language.\"\n\nAnd the caveat the aliens give humans with the gift of the universal language, is that in 3000 years the aliens will need the humans' help. For what, we don't know. \n\nWhat we do know is that the two greatest task we face as humans are 1) curing aging, and 2) interstellar space travel. Both of the these task will come with a new way of thinking about time and that is what the movie offers at it's most basic level.",

Inteligentan i provokativan, prati pri?u o dolasku vanzemaljske civilizacije na zemlju, sa kojom treba uspostaviti prvi kontakt. Ulogu spasitelja, gle ?uda, ima ena. Dosta. Utopijski  san o ujednjenju ljudske rase, spremne da u budu?nosti spaava i druge svetove. Kao vreme iz Epa o Gilgameu, u kome majka glavnog junaka, ?ini herojsko delo, ujedinjuju?i svoga sina, okrutnog vladara Gilgamea, sa svojim ljutim neprijateljem Enkiduom, ne bi li postao bolji ?ovek. Izuzetno. Gluma Amy Adams maestralna. Svedena, senzualna, blaga. Mater dolorosa. Predvidjam Zlatni globus za koji je nominovana kao tuma? glavne uloge i jo ?itav niz nagrada. Ipak, pri?a ne bi bila spektakularna, da uz onu vanzemaljsku, ne nudi jednu istinski ljudsku, toplu i strasnu. Oplakivanje smrti k?eri i pronalaenje ljubavi svoga ivota, koja je i izgubljena radi nerazumevanja. A glavna junakinja je, o ironije, po profesiji ?uvena lingvistkinja ?iji zadatak jeste da stupi u prvi kontakt sa vanzemaljcima. I pored vidljivih geografskih i jezi?kih greaka u komunikaciji na kineskom mandarinskom ili postavci 12 vanzemaljskih lokacija po na izgled nepovezanim stratekim ta?kama sveta, film obiluje mnotvom izuzetnih umetni?kih i nau?nih veza. Od muzike Maksa Rihtera, koji je oven?an nagradom za najboljeg evropskog kompozitora, do literarnog predloka koji je posluio za scenario. Re? je o kratkoj pri?i Teda Chianga Pri?a tvoga ivota. Autor je ina?e jedan od dobitnika nagrade Hugo, koja se dodeljuje decenijama unazad za dela spekulativne fikcije i spada u najzna?ajnije u svetu. Film obiluje inteligentnim asocijacijama i oma je mnogim drugim umetni?kim delima, od onih iz sveta filma (Abot i Kostelo su imena vanzemaljaca sa kojima komunicira heroina ) do onih knjievnih kakva je novela o Tripodima Jhona Christophera, jo jednog autora iz anra sci fi. Ono to film ?ini istinski uzbudljivim je ?injenica da je ljudima za komunikaciju izgleda potreban vanzemaljski susret, to je kao tema ve? pokrenuto u kultnom Avataru.Ipak, meni je najvie panje privukla teza koju neguje film, a ti?e se jezi?kih teorija.Junakinja  kae da je sve u jeziku, uz  pretpostavku da postoji sastavna veza izme?u jezi?nih kategorija i miljenja. U filmu se jasno anticipira Sapir (ameri?ki lingvista) Whorhova (Sapirov u?enik) lingvisti?ka hipoteza koja, iako nikad  napisana kao takva, zaista nudi miljenje obojice nau?nika. U antropologiji je formalno nazvana tako, posle njihove smrti. Oba naucnika su za ivota ispitivali odnos izmedju miljenja, jezika i kulture. Danas se ta teorija koristi u biznisu. Ta hipoteza tvrdi da postoji veza izme?u jezika kojim se realnost opisuje i samog opaanja, tj da jezi?ki kod uti?e na kognitivne procese, pa u skladu sa istom razli?ite nacije imaju razli?it odnos prema stvarima, pojavama, vremenu, novcu i tednji. Govornici razli?itih jezika u istim drutvima, sa istim socio-ekonomskim parametrima - dohodak, obrazovanje, bra?ni status, broj dece.., imaju razli?ite preferencije ka tednji, na primer. Dakle, ipak je sve u jeziku, to ja negiram ve? dugo vremena, bahato se razbacuju?i savrenim poznavanjem maternjeg ali i vremena, koje je najvaniji faktor za razumevanje filma. Ina?e, istinski prekrasne jezi?ke krugove vanzemaljaca stvorila je umetnica Martine Bertrand Svaka preporuka.",

            "content": "It's amazing how far sci-fi, as a film genre, has come since its inception.  From Metropolis, which is recognized as the first feature-length sci-fi movie in existence, to Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the entire 50s sci-fi renaissance, as it were, to 2001: A Space Odyssey.  From there on you have Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Matrix, District 9, Inception, Ex Machina.  The genre has certainly seen its ups and downs, particularly when it comes to films focusing on aliens arriving on earth.  There aren't many movies, at least as far as I can tell, that focus more on what this situation would REALLY be like.  It wouldn't play out like the Independence Days of the world, where the aliens declare war on humanity and we've all got to take a stand against them.  The first film, I believe, that really took a look at this from a more real-world standpoint would be Close Encounters, who looked at the arrival of the aliens as something to marvel at.  It wasn't a scientifically-driven movie, in the least, but it was a movie that looked at the wonderment such a event would attract.  Which is where this movie comes in.  And I know Contact was released TWENTY years before this movie, but I don't really remember much of it.  But I digress, for those thinking that this is gonna be another Independence Day, where humanity is at war with aliens, then they'll be sorely disappointed.  This is an intelligent, thinking-person's sci-fi.  The film sees a linguistics expert attempt to figure out the alien's language in order to figure out what they want, why they're here and how they got there.  But, of course, it's not just as simple as that, as there are twelve heptapods, as they call it, spread out through the entire world.  There are heptapods in Russia, Pakistan, Sudan, Venezuela, China, UK, Australia, among others.  So figuring out their reason for being here is, really, a worldwide collaboration.  But, of course, with countries like Russia and China being involved, their talks with the aliens in the heptapods are a little more sensitive in nature.  Particularly when you take into consideration that the aliens, who have their own complex language, might not understand the meaning of some of the words they use or the context with which someone like China or Russia might view them in.  For example, there's a scene where the aliens communicate to Louise to 'offer weapon', there's a big deal about that, because the government is unsure of whether they want weapons, if they're offering a weapon or if they would like to do a trade.  Things are further complicated when some of the soldiers on base, having been fueled by stupid conspiracy videos (imagine InfoWars or some other bullshit) plant some bombs inside the heptapod in order kill the aliens.  It doesn't work, of course, and there are a few moments where it seems that a worldwide conflict between humanity and the aliens is imminent.  The film isn't about that, this is about avoiding war at all costs.  The film takes a really interesting and thought-provoking approach   Reviewing this film is tricky, because I want to avoid spoilers, but the film focuses heavily on Louise's family life.  You get to see flashbacks of her life with her daughter who passed away from cancer in her teen years.  The way the movie plays with those elements, which really make up the emotional core of the film, is one of the more pleasant surprises the film has in store.  There's also some fairly intriguing theories around language and how fully immersing yourself in learning a new language will re-wire your brain into thinking differently.  That's definitely one of the biggest themes in play here.  The perception of time is also very important to where the film wants to go.  I feel that, by its conclusion, some people might feel that the narrative got a little convoluted, but it's not a movie that betrays its own rules.  It doesn't take established concepts and do away with them in order to force in a deus ex machina.  Again, reviewing all of this is really tricky when you're trying to avoid spoilers, but it's all exceptionally well-done.  As if it wasn't obvious by the review, I thought this was a pretty damn great movie.  The film is rich in storytelling, that's for damn sure, and how it incorporates Louise's past life (something to keep an eye for) into the events that are occurring in the present.  How her memories help guide her hand in dealing with the aliens, whom they name Abbot and Costello, and how she helps to avoid an international conflict against the aliens.  In spite of everything though, the movie never really seeks to make out Louise to be a heroine, she's just doing what needs to be done.  Because of that, her character feels grounded to earth, you can still relate to her in spite of the fact that, really, she was the one of the biggest parts in avoiding this conflict.  And I say that because other countries had to follow China's lead.  They could have just refused.  But the world 'uniting as one', as it were, is due to Louise and her knowledge and understand of the aliens and their language.  The ending itself is really quite bittersweet, because of what Louise knows.  I won't get into details, I don't wanna spoil it, but it's worth a look regardless.  Amy Adams is phenomenal here, no ifs, ands or buts about it.  The rest of the cast is great as well, but Ms. Adams carries the movie on her shoulders and she delivers a home run.  It also helps when the film has a strong a script as this one, but she never slacks off.  Movie's beautifully shot as well and I didn't even rent the Blu-Ray.  I can't really say much else about this movie.  I thought it was great and I would easily recommend it.  It's not the best movie I saw from 2016, The Wailing would take that honor, but don't let that, and the fact that this is a dialogue-heav sci-fi flick, dissuade you from giving this a shot.",

It seemed a tad repetitive at times and the motives for some of the characters actions (soldiers that plant the bomb) felt forced and simply to move the plot along.

If you were hoping for a tragic love story then you've come to the right place. The aliens that JUST HAPPEN to be in this movie are only a means to an end. The alien/sci-fi aspect of this movie serves no other purpose whatsoever than as a catalyst to one random person's love life. A love life BTW that didn't even have a happy ending as they separated and the child died! So aliens come to the earth and all they do is give one person the ability to see the future, and all the impact it has on humanity is their love life?  I was wondering why the movie came out on Valentine's Day and now I know. I'm sorry but when aliens come to earth I expect them to have a grander impact on humanity than this movie portrays.  This might be a decent movie if it wasn't trying to pretend it was a full fledged sc-fi epic.  It's more of a scirom (sci-fi/romance) or scidra (sci-fi/drama), both of which would be a new genre. I don't know if I'm missing the whole point to this movie or what but I'm having a hard time understanding how any sci-fi fan could like it.",

            "content": "Two hours of what can only be described as the absolutely worst, drawn-out, confusing and pretentious Sci-Fi movie ever put out on digital acetate.  And the folks at 21 Laps Entertainment have you believe this \"blockbuster\" cost $99 million to produce. Oh Lord, someone pulled the digital layers over our eyes. If you read the positive movie reviews raving about how artsy and intellectual this is-  then please consider these movie critics are delusional and intellectually fake.\n\nLet me state The Arrival is nothing short than overrated On many facets, the movie falls totally over the cliff, As I was watching this unravel during 112 minutes, i challenged myself that the best was yet to come, . This Arrival in my opinion ranks as being one of those undiscovered genres all by itself. Heck - even Harvey Weinstein couldn't have cocked it up that bad. But here we are boys and girls. Wow...So to the folks at The Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences and to esteemed members of the BAFTA, its very likely you won't see my nomination being sent in anytime soon.  Very sorry guys. \n\nAll things said, digitally enhanced and scored, it's a total piece of crap and please forget the hipster rave reviews about how amazing the plot is and how warm Amy Adams acting was. Remember the phrase - The Emperor has no clothes? - Well, don't fall for it boys and girls. I had more fun watching my delicates spin-dry in my new Samsung tumble dryer. Oi Vey. My better half challenged me to see beyond its main plot and to read more into it. Sadly I gave up looking for something that simply wasn't there in this flick.\n\nBut wait, there was a moment - the Producer and his team decided to throw a couple of cheap tricks used at the end of the movie to explain what is so unexplainable. Denis, It doesn't pass the smell test. At the half way mark, I already felt ripped off. On top of that, the script hides the relationship between some of the characters. Like I said, the whole thing makes for a confusing ending for the average moviegoer, like myself. It's almost like you need a movie whisperer or a Cliffs Notes aide to help you figure it. And no, I wasn't expecting Sigourney Weaver or some epic battle either.\n\nOn a positive note, what I did like was the 12-pod style looking spaceships - it fueled me to see what would happen. The idea and design was novel, the spaceships seemed intriguing, but sadly we don't get to see anymore of the inside of the spacecraft. Somehow I wanted more, I wanted to roam inside the darkness of the labyrinth. But no, the digital team could have added to the ideation palette here but didn't. And so, rather that, the movie instead took considerable time trying to get me hooked on the decryption of the aliens rorschach ink-blot-like language. \n\nUnderlying this, the viewer quickly senses there are communication gaps amongst some of the 12 countries who each have an alien spacecraft hovering in it. The Chinese are cutting themselves off from peace talks, so too are the Russians, then the Americans....oh Gosh, it sounds like they were fearful of some wall being built. \n\nWas this one of the messages I needed to take away? That people will agree to disagree or was it to think about how Amy Adams \"Hannah\" and the overall movie was essentially a Palindrone - spelt backwards it could be viewed the same both ways? Regardless, Amy also boasts a top secret clearance as a linguistics professor and tries everything through mental flashbacks to befriend the shadowy aliens hidden in the mist, trying in vain to figure out their language - or was I missing the point it that .\n\nTo that end, I propose the film producers seriously consider dusting off their Arri Alexa or CineAlta cameras and get something better off the ground for a movie that cost $99 million.",

Denis Villeneuve, (Prisoner, 2013 & Sicario, 2015) has beautifully directed this film that keeps you on edge of your seat.\n\nPlot: 12 mysterious gigantic spacecrafts have landed across the globe. Linguistic professor joins a US army team to learn aliens' language and communicate with them to to know what they came for.\n\nThe film opens introducing Louise Banks (played terrifically by Amy Adams) and her daughter Hannah, where her name is palindrome which means it is said the same forwards as well as backwards which kinda gives us a clue how the movie ends. Before she was asked to join the army at one of the locations in Montana where one of the spacecrafts has landed, the government has been able to interact with alien visitors in some forms, but they couldn't translate the sounds. Louise couldn't translate the strange noises from the audio file brought by US Army Colonel G T Weber (played impeccably by Forest Whitaker) she said, she has to be there for her to communicate with the aliens directly. 'Language is a foundation of Civilization', which is probably one of the most memorable lines I heard in a movie in years. We also met Ian Donnelly (effectively played by Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist who helps Dr. Banks to study aliens' language.\n\nThere's a huge question in this film, Why are they here? Are they here to invade us or to help us? Every 18 hours the spacecraft opens to let them temporarily interact with aliens directly. The aliens are known as heptapods because of their 7 legs or tentacles. Because it is impossible to communicate with aliens through the sound they make, Dr. Banks came up with an idea to communicate with them visually. She writes her name on a white board to introduce herself while Aliens communicates by making symbols with distinct patterns and shapes. Dr. Banks was having flashbacks, moments with her daughter that were shown in the film many times. As the session goes on, the more they get ideas about their intentions along the way.\n\nArrival is beautiful is great in its own right. It film doesn't rely on visual effects but it gives us stunning images that takes your breath away. Plus the chilling score from J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson who composed movie scores from (Prisoners, Theory of Everything & Sicario) and Max Richter. They uses different tones in the film that are truly haunting and unsettling to hear. But that doesn't end there. The ultimate twist of the film comes when Dr. Banks realizes that she sees future. Those flashbacks she had were not memories from the past but events from the future which explains everything we experienced watching the film. The way it was told in the film makes it compelling to watch.\n\nArrival is unlike any other psychological/alien-invasion or sci fi films we've seen that keeps us guessing how it's going to end but it is a dramatic take of humans' first contact of the third kind. It's a type of movie that invites you leaving the theater and actually talking about it. I was engaged by every inch of this film. I walked out and I thought a lot about it. It works on you on ways you're not really aware of.\n\nPlease DO NOT wait to see it on a device you can hold in your hand. See this film",

            "content": "With his debut Incendies in 2010, Denis Villeneuve really hit the ground running and has been one of the most consistently interesting director's for the last 7 years.  There's a host of films and genres that Villeneuve has explored in that time; from the nightmarish surrealism of Enemy; his unflinching kidnap thriller Prisoners and his drug cartel action drama Sicario. If you put aside his forthcoming Blade Runner sequel, you could say that Arrival is his science fiction warm-up to attempting to re-engage with that much loved classic.\n\nPlot: 12 mysterious, alien spacecrafts land across the globe with the whole of mankind questioning their intentions. Expert linguistic Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is hired to attempt to communicate with them. In the meantime, frustrations are leading earth to a global war and the answers Louise begins to decipher could mean the difference between saving or eradicating humanity entirely.\n\nThe renowned astrophysicist and author, Carl Sagan once wrote \"The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.\" This is a theoretical topic that courses throughout Villeneuve's film and, at one point, even referenced directly. \n\nBased on Ted Chiang's \"Story of your Life\", Arrival is not overly concerned with being a big-budget science fiction film. It certainly has these elements (and they are very well executed) but it's more concerned with mood, atmosphere and exploring the very nature of our existence through language and our relationship and understanding of time and space. In doing so, Arrival has much in common with Robert Zemeckis' 1997 film Contact (which itself was based on a book by the aforementioned Sagan). Both use the form of extraterrestrial communication as a device to understand ourselves and it's this communication angle (and the reveal that results from it) that eventually turns Arrival on its head. It's an angle that has split some viewers; is it too clever for its own good? Does it disappear up its own wazoo? Or is it a clever sleight of hand that questions our linear and literal perception of events? I'm siding with the latter but these questions are better left to the individual viewer. \n\nWhat can be said, is that Villeneuve has done his homework on this. Much like Christopher Nolan's approach to Interstellar, Villeneuve extensively ensured the film's scientific ideology was accurate by enlisting the help of renowned scientists and tech innovators who advised on all the terminology, graphics and depictions. As Villeneuve is in no rush to tell his story, he demands a patience and a willingness to open up to the films theories and possibilities. It can often be a bit weighty and does occasionally tread a fine line between absurdity and suspending your disbelief but there's much to ruminate over and Villeneuve is aided immeasurably but his cast and crew; Bradford Young (who previously impressed me with his work in A Most Violent Year) delivers some stunningly captured cinematography and J\u00f3han J\u00f3hansson's score perfectly accompanies the mood and imagery. At the forefront, however, is a quietly effecting performance from Amy Adams. She brings such subtle emotional depth that she contributes hugely to your ability to buy the films premise in the first place. It's a performance that I'm very surprised has been omitted from this year's academy awards. \n\nI struggle with the 'masterpiece' label that has been thrust upon Villenueve's film but there's no doubt that Arrival is a delicate, thoughtful and accomplished piece of work. If he applies the same level of intelligence and challenging material to his Blade Runner 2049 then the continuation of Ridley Scott's master of the genre may well be in good hands. \n\nMark Walker",

The sci-fi, while interesting and thought provoking to say the least, is just a backdrop for the story of Amy Adams character.\n\nI don't want to give away any spoilers beyond what's been said, but I can tell you that if you like your sci-fi to go beyond laser cannons, space ships, and your typical fare... this is your movie.

Amy Adams wasn't bad, but comparing with Meryl Streep if like comparing a turtle with a horse in a ride! Meryl Streep was a lot better. But this is a review about the movie not about Meryl Streep. This movie is a garbage. (Spoiler Alert after here). The story basically consists in a teacher that is recruted to try comunicate with aliens, she can do it. The conclusion about the movie is that her visions that we think that are about the past are about the future. I was hoping for some good material, because this has a nomination for best picture. What I have was a boring movie, with a poor script and unoriginal story (we have a lot of extraterrestrial movies that are better than this),. So if you are considering watching, warning: this is a overrated movie and a waste of time).",

This is a genre which I call sentimental scifi. Meaning that we have a scifi film which is really just genre that tries to garner empathy for a character. I have to say I was not convinces with Amy Adams' role in this movie. She is too one dimensional, and by the end her character along with the whole story does not make any sense. \nThe plot is about language and communication. Therein lays the problem. Spielberg already did it with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and that film was genius. Spielberg did not need to over complicate things. He shared the concept that music is a universal language that could be used to communicate with the aliens. The main character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an every day man who is chosen to experience something far beyond his imagination. Arrival uses a know it all scientist with amnesia to try and translate circles. The aliens use her memories to convey a message, ie Interstellar, and the movie Contact. The dialogue is cliche military talk, and stuff pulled from movies such as Contact, and Independence Day. The only thing great about this film was Jeremy Renner's acting. He is awesome in just about anything. The music is really good. The special effects and cinematography are top notch. This film would look excellent in 4k. The main problem is the writing. It's been done way too many times. I give Arrival a 6/10.",

Arrival (2016) certainly fits this category. Not only do you really have to pay attention to what's happening in this film, it makes you question how we perceive our world as it is right now. Never before have I seen the topic of encountering alien life forms approached from such a realistic and logical way. It makes sense that we wouldn't be able to understand them, so the first step in establishing an understanding is to establish communication.\n\nMuch like Christopher Nolan, who has done a number of great, \"cerebral\" films including Memento (2000), Inception (2010), and Interstellar (2014), I have recently come to appreciate the directorial talents of Denis Villeneuve. From his previous films like Prisoners (2013) and Sicario (2015), I've seen him deliver powerful messages about who we are as humans and how we deal with evil. In Arrival, once again the enemy is humanity itself, and the angry and violent mistrust it has against anything it doesn't understand. Fortunately, despite its repeated visual motif of black and white, Arrival shows that peace can be found in the gray area of language interpretation.\n\nWhile I don't want to give away the twist of this film, I have to say that the way it was presented certainly makes for a powerful impact once it has been realized. I will simply attribute this to the talent of Denis Villeneuve and the superb screenplay used to guide the audience along to the stunning conclusion. If you haven't seen any of Villeneuve's films yet, now's a great time to start. I certainly will look forward to his next piece, if this is the type of work he's putting out right now.\n\nA fantastic, cerebral, and realistic approach to a classic sci-fi scenario, I give Arrival 5.0 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Arrival is the movie that Interstellar wanted to be. It takes a sci-fi topic, tries to ground it in actual science, and weaves in an emotional core to the film without compromising the science. It's important to mention that Arrival is deliberately paced, and by that I mean it moves slower than molasses. I tolerated the plodding storyline because I was totally invested in Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. They add a lot of heart to this movie and make it work well for me. I loved how the movie explained some of the linguistics and the understated way they handled effects was brilliant (aside from one scene where the effects were poor.) The reason it didn't rate as highly for me as many other sci-fi films was two-fold. For one, they fast-forwarded through a large chunk of the language discovery and that was one of my favorite parts. It was a strange choice, in a movie that had so many slow moments, to rush through anything so intriguing. The other thing that bugged me was the fact that I guessed what was going on well before it was revealed so the second half of the film played out without much surprise. It's not a huge flaw for a movie to be predictable, but in this case I felt like I was missing something when they revealed certain things and I already expected them. Aside from my little complaints, Arrival is a very good movie, and I can see why it was so highly regarded. It's one of those hard sci-fi movies where the ending leads to all kinds of deeper questions that can't really be answered, but you feel like you might be able to puzzle it all out with more viewings. I didn't love it as much as I anticipated, but it also didn't disappoint me all that much.",

If there was a plot, I never found it.  If the gushing reviews of the lead \"actress\" indicate what is now considered an outstanding performance then I must have suffered brain damage recently along with memory loss.  Thankfully, there was so little in this movie to actually consider, my memory has already relegated it to the areas of my memory where pieces of 'My Little Pony\" reside.

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: I don't think you can truly appreciate how different and innovative 'Arrival' is until you see it, because literally everything here is entirely fresh and unexpected, and delves underneath everything we think we know. For a start, the story itself looks below the very essence of the challenges we'd likely face when literally interacting with aliens, which is something I've never seen or even considered in a movie before. In turn, this allows for the exploration of some very fundamental themes that again, tend to get glossed over in film. All in all, this makes it a genuine eye-opener; shining the light on the systems we take for granted, and suddenly making us acutely aware of the very basis of humanity's function - not just communication and time, but also love and life or death. It's all the more despairing and gripping then, to see the world rip itself apart as it tries to deal with these concepts, as you're equally struggling with the monuments level of careful consideration and reflection this movie demands.\nIt could have easily felt void of emotional heart though, and with Villenueve on board that was definitely a big risk, but Arrival actually has huge emotional weight thanks to  a brilliantly layered lead who's arc is intertwined with the overall story to truly invest you, and translate the overall concepts it tackles. Couple that with a very well-realised set of world building aided by unsurprisingly incredible cinematography and visual effects, as well as a very appropriate score - the result is an experience that makes you invest ten-fold and think an awful lot indeed.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The set-up could have been slightly more elegant in its pacing, but at least it cuts to the point quickly.\nVERDICT: From the genre, to humanity itself; 'Arrival' is a film that delves underneath everything we know, and the result is Villenueve's best film. That's not just because its themes are so powerful though; this thing's got soul, too.",

Some had to give it a few shots to get through it all.  Others didn't \"get it.\"\n\n3) Since it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, I had to go see it (to make first hand, informed opinions on what should win best picture).\n4) I've seen just over half (5) of the 9 best pictures and ....\n\n5) Arrival would HANDS DOWN be my pick for best picture!  Without a doubt!   Arrival's intricate, Memento-ish, holistic awe and wonderment builds by implanting questions and \"WTF is going on\"ness for three-quarters of the movie until the completely mesmerizing and \"Are you serious??\" shocking twist happens.  The last 20 to 30 mins is when either your mind gets blown off, out, all over the theatre or you go \"I don't get it.... what just happened?\"\n6) Amy Adams was absolutely riveting and captivating.  So much that she was definitely smacked in the face with her Oscar snub for Arrival.  She was dark and gothic-glam in Nocturnal Animals (the best thing about the film was her).  But her performance in Arrival was flawless.  Whether she would have beaten out Emma Stone in La La Land, who knows.  But she HANDS DOWN deserved to be there (in a category where I've only seen one best actress flick - Stone's La La Land).\n\nA short post disclaimer review:\n\nObviously I cannot ruin the twisty surprise. Which means I can't give too much away or what \"clues\" or \"insight\" to lookout for.  Just keep in mind that Canadian Denis Villeneuve (who - in one of the rare post-movie credits \"Behind the Scenes\" segment - had always wanted to do Sci-fi) jumps into the \"mind\"verse of Christopher Nolan a la the previously mentioned Memento and Inception.  \nVilleneuve's previous pictures have also been psychologically engaging; from the likes of the dark dark but mindducking Prisoners, to the political military insurgent Sicario.   He will also be handling Blade Runner 2049 with Ryan Gosling.  Villenuve's handling of the masterpiece Arrival is no different.  The colours are subdued and toned down.  The camera always seems to be and keeps moving (it's rare a scene is ever stationary).  His Montana landscape shots are beautiful and expansive.  His incorporation of the global alien arrival drop zones with news media footage is seamlessly integrated and provides a greater scope and foundation to the \"us versus them\" political and military phobic terror.  Yet Villenuve's emotional captivation handling of the radiant performance of Amy Adams as Louise is so touching, traumatic as well as eye opening, it fits in so influentially within the international \"big picture\" directorial scope and vision.\nSpeaking of \"fitting,\" I give a standing O to editor Joe Walker for weaving a non-linear timeline into a perfect final product; where scenes that originally made you think \"why is the movie jumping around so much\" or \"what was that scene truly about?\" make you have a completely different revelationary reaction towards the end once the twist is revealed.  The twist ONLY works because of Villeneuve's detailed and \"non\"abstract (in the end) filmmaking and Walker's editing.\nHowever, even the two of them couldn't have made the movie so profound without the masterful contributions of others: such as cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma) and music/score composer Johann Johannsson (who worked on Villenuve's previous films Sicario and Prisoners as well as the Stephen Hawking movie The Theory of Everything).   I would highly recommend to stay around for the behind the scenes doc, as it will truly put you in awe of Young and Johannsson's involvement and contribution in making Arrival spectacular.\n\nEVERYONE on the film deserves kudos and their fair share credit; even down to costume designers (for the quarantine garb) and the special effects gurus (in handling the hetapod aliens; the exterior and interiors of the space ship; and Adams' final interaction scene with the alien).\nForest Whitaker as Colonel Weber is apropos, and Jeremy Renner is also fitting as Ian as his storyline evolves (when he and Adams' have their truck tailgate chat, I was like \"Why is his character even being focused on as he truly doesn't seem to be contributing anything?\") and how it integrates into Adams' Louise.  \nHands down my favourite movie so far in 2017, and my biggest rooter for winning some Oscar gold.",

The movie shows the process of understanding their language and also why they are on earth.\nWhat appealed me the most was the music. It is so well timed and it matches perfectly the characters' feeling. Sometimes it is just a few notes but it is enough to amaze the viewer.\nThe story is told beautifully, the mystery around the aliens fades gently during the movie and the spectator slowly understands the plot and some elements from the beginning. The only negative point is the finale which was a bit too fast for my taste.\nI enjoyed the philosophy around the language. The fact that they think differently because of the aliens' language and also that they can perceive time differently with it. Great discussion subject!\nOtherwise I was pleasantly surprised by Amy Adams's performance, I wasn't expecting much but it was great.\nI highly recommend this movie. Always.",

Neither because it is human to want to ensure our own survival.\n\nIn Arrival, monolith x 12 is here to unify humanity. Personally, I think things worked out because the aliens worked with 12 nations independently. If they only sent one monolith, they would not have had the opportunity to test 12 different approaches. Yes, different people doing different things will create conflict and conflict will create winners and losers at least in the short term. In the longer term, the rival ape men might find a bigger water hole elsewhere.\n\nIn terms of cinematography, I loved every moment of Arrival. So I'm sort of hoping that I misunderstood the message and the film is not suggesting that we all unify around THE RIGHT ANSWER. Otherwise, I think Arrival represents everything that is wrong with the world. When people try too hard to grasp the truth, they find themselves bound by narratives created by others.",

            "content": "Science fiction films tend to stratify into 3 categories, in my mind. The most commercially successful are really just adventure films set in a science fiction universe. These focus on action and fantasy, with futuristic or high-concept elements. They leverage classic story archetypes and superlative visuals to produce enjoyable escapism. Star Wars is the exemplar of this sub-genre, and although Star Trek aspires to greater scientific rigor, it belongs here too.\n \nThe second set similarly uses science as a backdrop for noir. These are the darker films, the dystopian adventures. They may not be as hopeful or as fun, but they tend to be more pointed. These films typically propound on a \"what if\" premise, plumbing the dingy depths of possibility. The best are often imaginative, twisted interrogations of human nature or society. This is Blade Runner, The Matrix, Dark City.\n \nFinally, there are what I like to call \"thinking\" films. They are headier, and explore ideas that fundamentally change reality or alter our perception of it. They eschew spectacle and adrenaline to allow the audience to dive deep on a single premise. These films are typically smaller in focus, slower, often centering around the journey of a single character. Usually less accessible movies, Hamlet might opine that these \"pleased not the million, (but) 'twas caviar to the general\". I would count 2001, Interstellar, K-PAX and others as \"thinking\" sci-fi. Arrival fits securely in this group.\n \nArrival is a big budget take on a small story, focusing almost myopically on Louise, a linguistics expert who is conscripted to help communicate with extra-terrestrial beings who arrive suddenly above the Earth. Her journey of consciousness as she learns to comprehend the aliens serves as the plot, using the events of the story more as context than narrative. Director Denis Villeneuve deftly uses arresting visuals and frank, realistic sensibilities to relate a story that might otherwise be esoteric.

It has a deliberate pace and the learning to communicate with the aliens feels earned rather than easily granted. It's also unsettling in places (with the slightly distorted dreams) and the bending of physics can get a little trippy in the final act so that while the aliens may not appear threatening their representation of the unknown still is. I'd read the short story the film was based on over 15 years ago and feel the executed the language and other revelations pretty well. Villeneuve has gone up in my expectations as a director, showing he's not afraid to leave gaps for the viewer/actor/scenery to fill. Amy Adams is on a roll of late taking on varied work and quickly becoming an actor whose presence in a film has me interested. Renner doesn't really get that much to do which is a bit of a shame but nice to see him do something different from special-ops guy. He's actually pretty good at the everyman role. The film lacks the spectacle of \"interstellar\" but is far more coherent with what at times is quite a similar plot.",

            "content": "It is hard to truly comment on the film without including spoilers, but I will do my best. \n\nArrival is a film that I find I am forced to wrestle with rather than simply appreciate. To be honest, I am still not entirely certain how I feel about it. It is a good film, to be sure, but I remain conflicted about how good it actually is. I count myself among those who were able to predict (at least somewhat) where the film was heading about half-way through, and so my experience with the film became less about measuring the wow factor of the initial surprise of the ending and more about noting the ways in which it manages to piece the narrative together. \n\nThe heart of the film is in the question it poses, and it is the nature of how you respond to the question (which is drawn out of the film's poetic finish) that I think will impact your overall experience of the film and it's characters. Adams plays the professional linguist professor Louise Banks, who gets pulled into an investigation of these mysterious pods that have appear rather suddenly in 12 different locales around the globe. Right from the film represents this investigation as a global concern, an element of the story that becomes increasingly important to the developing tension. What we know of Banks from the get go is that certain traumatic events have played a role in bringing her to the love of linguistics that she is now being asked to give in service to this global push for answers- why are they here and what do they want? \n\nAdams gives a very good performance, really giving herself to the sort of patient unveiling that the story demands. Arrival is an intelligent Sci-Fi that moves slowly but with great intention, and Adams expertly navigates the pacing by making good use of the space the film affords her to kind of linger and play around with different emotions. It becomes very clear early on that this is a personal journey for her, one that is going to pull out some different conflicting emotions, and Adams ensures that, as an audience, we are able to take this journey with her. \n\nThis film has been defined in other spaces as the next \"Contact\". Here is where the tension likely begins and ends for me. I loved that film. I liked this one. And yet what I loved about Contact is the pure sense of awe that it inspired in the moment. Arrival didn't garner this same level of emotion, for whatever reason. What Arrival did do, though, is manage to linger. The more I consider its central question, the more it seems to pull me into the experience of the film. There is something about the way it managed to do this (and continues to do this) that separates it from Contact in a way. The central question of Arrival is far more specific and intimate than the more generalized reflection (of faith and meaning and the expansiveness of the universe) that Contact evoked. And it works to Arrivals benefit. \n\nSo by no means is Arrival a mediocre film. It is a very good film. Does it belong in the best picture category? Does it deserve all of the nominations is has managed to garner? I am not sure. Even though any film is this to some degree or another, it feels like Arrival remains that much more of a specific and subject experience. Which means it should make for some enriching discussion and dialogue (in most circles), but it also might render it somewhat allusive in the realm of that subjectivity.",

Dirigida por uno de los mejores directores de la actualidad, el canadiense Denis Villenueve, es una muestra de ciencia ficci\u00f3n inteligente que no necesita alardear de grandes escenas de acci\u00f3n y efectos especiales.\n El film se centra en la llegada de los extraterrestres a nuestro planeta y los esfuerzos de un equipo encabezado por la ling\u00fcista Louise Banks                       (Extraordinaria  Amy Adams)  que tiene la labor de aprender a comunicarse con ellos para determinar si sus intenciones son hostiles o pac\u00edficas. \n'La llegada' es una pel\u00edcula sobre la importancia del lenguaje, el miedo a lo desconocido y a provocar un grave conflicto por no comprender a nuestro receptor. Del mismo modo que las anteriores excelentes pel\u00edculas de Villeneuve (Prisioneros , Enemy y Sicario), la pel\u00edcula es al mismo tiempo compleja, oscura y misteriosa. (Con muchas ganas de ver ya su proxima pelicula que seria la secuela del clasico de ciencia de ficcion \"Blade Runner\").\n El ritmo de 'La llegada' es deliberadamente sobrio, el espectador recibe la informaci\u00f3n que necesita justo en el momento adecuado para ir atando cabos al mismo tiempo que la protagonista. Como un reflejo de c\u00f3mo funcionan muchos puzzles, la pel\u00edcula se fragmenta m\u00e1s cuanto m\u00e1s se acerca Louise a averiguar por qu\u00e9 los alien\u00edgenas han llegado y qu\u00e9 quieren de nosotros.\nT\u00e9cnicamente, la pel\u00edcula es una maravilla. La pr\u00f3xima comparaci\u00f3n se va a convertir en un t\u00f3pico del que vamos a terminar aburridos, pero tanto la m\u00fasica Johan J\u00f3hannsson (tremendamente emotiva, pero tambi\u00e9n sensorial y oscura, apegada a los espacios que acompa\u00f1a), como la fotograf\u00eda de Bradford Young (rica en texturas y en elecciones muy concretas de la luz, como un gui\u00f3n que subyace entre las palabras), remiten a atm\u00f3sferas y estilos del cine de Kubrick. Arrival, siendo tremendamente realista, contiene misterio, tensi\u00f3n, inc\u00f3gnitas que no son tramposas. En conclucion Arrival es una maravilla, muy merecido sus 8 nominaciones al Oscar, hasta me atrevo a decir que merece ganar el premio a mejor pelicula, la unica injusticia es que Amy Adams se quedo sin Nominacion.\nEn conclucion pelicula imperdible y perfecta, no apto para el publico que esperan solo mucha accion y efectos especiales de peliculas de invasiones extraterrestres.\nCalificacion: 5 de 5 estrellas (Excelente)",

Unfortunately, the narrative of the movie ends up falling apart 3/4ths of the way through when an M. Night Shamylan-esque twist is thrown into the plot. It does pay off in a clever way towards the end, but the line of logic to getting to that point is convoluted at best, shoddy at worst. It took me completely out of the movie, which I was enjoying otherwise. While the other actors in the ensemble (including Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker) are given little to work with in terms of shallow characterizations, Amy Adams is terrific in the lead role (and definitely deserved a spot on this year's \"Best Actress\" Oscar list). Johann Johannsson's rousing score is also a highlight of the movie. Overall though, aside from those criticisms, it is still a solid flick.",

Miedo, asombro, sorpresa, confusi\u00f3n, valent\u00eda y ternura son muchas de las emociones que \"Arrival\" nos deja y en las que nos envuelve. \nLa ciencia ficci\u00f3n ha sido un \u00e1rea tan amplia, tan experimentada y, sin embargo, tan incomprensible que por ende nos hace aclamar y aplaudir este espectacular filme de Villeneuve. Despu\u00e9s de que 12 OVNIs aterrizan en distintos puntos de la tierra, la ling\u00fcista Louise Banks (Amy Adams) tiene en sus manos la labor de contactar con seres extraterrestres. El reto que esto significa es pr\u00e1cticamente inimaginable y imposible, pero el recorrido que emprende junto con Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) nos deja pensando profundamente acerca de lo que somos, de la manera en que hemos asimilado la comunicaci\u00f3n humana de forma tan normal y cotidiana que nos cerramos a que existan formas impensables de realizarla, por ello se nos brinda una experiencia emocional cuya huella puede dejar a cualquiera impactado y pensando por un largo tiempo. La cr\u00edtica que se hace al perfil del \u00f3rgano militar del estadounidense es excelente, aunque los clich\u00e9s de la historia rom\u00e1ntica y de los roles de varios pa\u00edses y su forma de enfrentarse al caos se hacen presentes. Asimismo, el soundtrack pudo haber sido significativamente mejor. Aun as\u00ed, esto no es suficiente para derribar tan impetuosa y satisfactoria obra de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n abundan las excelentes im\u00e1genes y tomas de las que uno puede admirar los distintos \u00e1ngulos, analiz\u00e1ndose desde diferentes perspectivas, creando una obra donde cada uno de sus elementos se fusionan tan espectacularmente que mantiene la atenci\u00f3n del espectador. Efectos grandiosos y ambiente deleitante se pone frente a nosotros, sumado a la m\u00e1s que sobresaliente actuaci\u00f3n de Amy Adams son otros ejemplos del por qu\u00e9 \"Arrival\" merece nuestra atenci\u00f3n, merece ser galardonada y ser vista muchas veces m\u00e1s. 92/100",

In this movie, she carries it.\n\n\" Arrival delivers a must-see experience for fans of thinking person's sci-fi that anchors its heady themes with genuinely affecting emotion and a terrific performance from Amy Adams.\"  That says it there.  There's no action...no weird alien encounters...just a thoughtful exploration of what an encounter would be like and why it might occur.\n\nI found fascinating the breakdown of how to interpret a new language.  The circular nature of the story.  The question of would you change your future if you knew it.  I found it all entertaining and interesting.\n\nI'm a fan of Amy Adams and disappointed that she didn't get an oscar nomination (I think she's had 5 so far).  The only other nominee I've seen this year is Emma Stone in La La Land.  She certainly deserved a nomination.  My guess is that the movie is too cerebral for voters or possibly they just don't like sci fi...which this is, but isn't.  Either way, a great movie and highly recommended.",

            "content": "Between the mistifying production design, J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's blood-curdling score of intense strings and brass, and an overall cold atmosphere shot in a sort of monochromatic manner, Arrival is, in some ways, a horror movie. The way the film portrays an \"alien invasion\" as a sort of spontaneous event, something nobody could possibly prepare for and have no idea how to properly handle the situation, is very much terrifying, mostly because it so effortlessly captures just how true such a situation would be. And as we're thrust into the situation first-hand, led by the pairing of linguist Louise Banks and theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, the shrouded secrecy (which is quite literal in this case: the mysterious beings are hidden in a thick fog) only gets more chilling. Why are these beings here? Are they peaceful? Will they annihilate us in an instant with one single miscommunicated phrase? These tensions grow continuously during the film, as the military grows increasingly paranoid. At one point, an ultimately ambiguous phrase from the mysterious craft is received. Their first instinct: panic. Immediate interpretation of the message as a threat.\n\nThe film comes from Denis Villeneuve, who has continuously established himself as a master of building secrecy and tension, from intense crime thrillers Prisoners and Sicario to the mystifying and surreal Enemy. As a very cerebral, haunting film. Arrival certainly falls in line with those films, and yet also stands as perhaps Villeneuve's most emotionally involved film in his career. At its core, it's very much a film about humanity. Throughout the film, we're greeted with flashbacks to Louise's life pre-invasion, and the way Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer link the flashbacks to the current narrative is truly clever and genuinely heartfelt. In an age where this coukd be a cynical blockbuster where the aliens are instantly relegated to the \"bad guys\" for America to save the day from, it's nice to have a film that, for all of its horrific and unnerving aspects, is ultimately the exact opposite: a film about global teamwork and optimism and hope and, quite simply, life itself.",

I have not seen much of Amy Adams work before this film, so I will not question her overall ability as an actress. I believe this is a case of a weak story and weaker direction.

I'm not one for alien movies, but this is what an alien movie should be. It's smart, realistic, and grounded. It gets you wondering what an alien invasion would truly be like. How would we handle it? Would it bring the world together, or tear it apart? Villeneuve hits the nail on the head.\nThe visuals are near perfect, often jaw dropping. The score by Johann Johannsson is haunting, yet wonderful and sets each scene superbly.\nThe character development is complex, and Amy Adams puts on a performance of the year, if not decade. \nThe ending is as satisfying as any ending I have ever seen. Beautiful, and possibly even tear jerking.\nWhat I like best about the film is that it makes you feel something. It makes you think. It makes you appreciate the good in others, and that finding common ground with others can be ever-important in making the world go round. On a more personal level, it gets you appreciating every moment of life for what it's worth.\nBravo to Villeneuve, Johannsson, and Adams for an exceptional film whose impact could last decades.",

            "content": "Arrival es la nueva pel\u00edcula del aclamado director Denis Villeneuve (Conocido por pel\u00edculas tan interesantes como Enemy, Prisioners o Sicario) y pelea con grandes argumentos por alguno los puestos m\u00e1s altos en el g\u00e9nero de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n.\n\nCr\u00edticos como Roger Ebert han hablado mucho sobre el rumbo que est\u00e1n tomando las pel\u00edculas de terror con ejemplos como \"Babadook\" o \"It follows\", donde se rechaza el modelo del \"jumpscare\" (subidas de m\u00fasica e im\u00e1genes impactantes) por un estudio de personajes y el tratamiento de temas m\u00e1s profundos como la depresi\u00f3n o la angustia existencial. \n\nLa cinta de Villeneuve as\u00ed como Interestelar de Nolan o Prometheus de Ridley Scott son un ejemplo de este mismo modelo aplicado a la ciencia ficci\u00f3n. Arrival o La Llegada (como ha sido denominada en pa\u00edses de habla latina) es una pel\u00edcula que rechaza el modelo de invasi\u00f3n alien\u00edgena de acci\u00f3n y decide realizar un estudio del personaje de Louise, una experta ling\u00fcista que obtiene la oportunidad de intentar mantener una conversaci\u00f3n con los \"visitantes\". Y esto lo realiza dando respuesta a preguntas realmente interesantes como \u00bfDe que modo nos enfrentamos a aquello que nos aterra?\n\nEs dif\u00edcil hablar de Arrival sin correr el riesgo de revelar parte de la trama pero si podemos definir aquello de lo que trata esta pel\u00edcula es probablemente la comunicaci\u00f3n. La cinta nos recuerda la importancia desmedida de esta capacidad y explota este hecho tan aparentemente sencillo de un modo realmente inteligente. ?\nEn el reparto encontramos probablemente uno de los puntos m\u00e1s destacables de la pel\u00edcula junto al gui\u00f3n, y esto es sin duda la actuaci\u00f3n de Amy Adams como Louise. Se trata de una actuaci\u00f3n que esta recibiendo muchos rumores de Oscar a mejor actriz principal y no son infundados ya que de alg\u00fan modo toda la pel\u00edcula carga sobre los hombros de la actuaci\u00f3n de Amy Adams y en lugar de flaquear consigue hacer, si cabe, a\u00fan m\u00e1s destacables algunos de los puntos m\u00e1s interesantes de Arrival. Sin embargo en el reparto tambi\u00e9n hay uno de los puntos m\u00e1s flacos de la pel\u00edcula y se trata de la actuaci\u00f3n de Jeremy Renner que aunque est\u00e1 principalmente correcto, logra que algunos de los momentos de m\u00e1s importancia de la pel\u00edcula parezcan algo cursis y melodram\u00e1ticos. Da la sensaci\u00f3n de que Renner cre\u00eda estar actuando en una pel\u00edcula diferente y con menos aspiraciones.\n\nLa cinematograf\u00eda de Villeneuve a manos Bradford Young es sin duda otro de los puntos absolutamente sobresalientes del largo y nos regala planos que quitan el aliento. Del mismo modo que utiliza planos cerrados aportando un sentimiento de opresi\u00f3n y tensi\u00f3n palpables, tambi\u00e9n utiliza planos amplios con mucho espacio para respirar y empaparse de la imagen en aquellos momentos donde nos revela informaci\u00f3n imprescindible. Juega muy bien con esta dicotom\u00eda que sin duda hace de esta pel\u00edcula una peque\u00f1a y extra\u00f1a joya.\n\nEn definitiva Arrival es una cinta ambiciosa que logra mantener muy bien su tono y sus aspiraciones, y nos cuenta esa historia que hemos oido tantas veces con una perspectiva nueva y fresca que no deja a nadie indiferente. Tiene algunos de los mejores momentos cinematogr\u00e1ficos del a\u00f1o y probablemente la mejor actuaci\u00f3n de la carrera de Amy Adams desde The Master. Villeneuve se est\u00e1 forjando un nombre en el panorama actual del cine comercial haciendo pel\u00edculas con tintes indies que le hacen uno de los directores m\u00e1s interesantes del momento.",

            "content": "2016's Arrival is a science fiction thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) and is based on the short story The Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang adapted by Eric Heisserer who wrote the screenplay.\n\nAmy Adams stars as Louise Banks, an expert in language and translation who is called upon when a number of alien vessels appear on Earth in various locations. The intentions of the aliens, who are attempting to communicate are not known and Banks is brought in by Colonel GT Weber (Forest Whitaker) to attempt to understand their language, and to understand what their plans are.\n\nAlongside Banks as they begin to attempt to communicate with the aliens is Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist.\n\nThe film progresses with both their ongoing attempts to understand the aliens, but also against the backdrop of increasing tensions across the planet. These tensions are taking the form of looting and fuel / food shortages, but also the knowledge that other nations are attempting their own communications with the aliens (including Russia and China) and that these may lead to a different, more aggressive stance towards the visitors.\n\nAmy Adams, who I remain of the view that she is incredibly underrated, delivers another standout performance, in her role through the film with essentially the whole narrative of the film resting on her performance. From the initial entrance into the craft, all the way through the efforts to communicate and interspersed cut away moments, she shines throughout the film.\n\nThe score (by Johan Johannsson)  too stands out with usage of what feels like aboriginal music in some parts and haunting orchestral score (which in part uses Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' at other moments through the film.\n\nVilleneuve direction of this matches the quality of his previous work, which when you look at the work he's delivered, is a significant achievement. Tension builds throughout the scenes (especially those on the alien craft) and he has woven a film together that is thought provoking, moving, and really really smart.\n\nThat, ultimately is one of the main achievements of the film, it doesn't dumb down its content and delivers a very clever film that manages to keep getting better throughout. In the recent series of smart science fiction that Christopher Nolan has been a large part of with Inception and Interstellar, it really stands out as an achievement.\n\nI'd really encourage anyone that hasn't seen it to make the effort. It is easily one of the very best films of 2016.\n\n9/10 (I feel a bit like it could be a 10)",

The story follows a linguist, Louise (played by Amy Adams), and a scientist, Ian (played by Jeremy Renner), who are hired by the army to decipher the language of the aliens that have landed on Earth in their spaceships. I'd hate to spoil anything about the plot and how it all comes to a close, but I'll have to spoil certain things, so I'm putting a spoiler warning here! With that said, this is a brilliant movie, really. From the very beginning it draws you in and it's consistently intriguing throughout. It never becomes dull, too long or even pretentious. It is a slow burn movie, but the story concerning the aliens is fantastic and the ending payoff is highly satisfying and made me think more about what I saw earlier. The aliens are very well designed and their language is the big mystery of this movie. Following Louise and Ian learning their language and teaching the aliens English was very entertaining. I had a lot of fun watching them teaching each other. It felt so much different from any other alien invasion movie I've ever seen. This isn't the kind of an alien invasion movie where the aliens are just attacking and trying to destroy the world, there isn't any action in this movie. It consists the most of conversations with the aliens, deciphering their language, learning their past and it feels much more interesting than just another big blockbuster with aliens. The cinematography is breathtaking. Especially the first time we see the alien spaceship, it felt reminiscent of the scene when we first see humans interacting with the Monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie is visually stunning all throughout its runtime, as is every Villeneuve movie. The soundtrack by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson is sublime. His score is one of the best of the year [2016] and I'm still re-listening to it as I'm writing this review. Beautiful. The characters are very well developed, especially Amy Adams' character. Ian isn't as developed, we don't know anything about his life except that he's a scientist, but his character serves more as an element to Louise's development and when you look at it that way, he served his purpose. Forest Whitaker is also good in this movie, though not a very interesting character. There's not much to say about him. The star here is definitely Amy Adams and her character. Amy Adams delivers an incredible performance and when certain things are revealed about her character, it makes her even more interesting. The ending was powerfully emotional. I'm not going to say what it is, but I will say it's one of the best twist endings I've ever seen. The thing I didn't like about this movie is just one scene. That's it. Just one little scene that felt very out of place and held no real purpose. You'll know what it is, it's quite noticeably unfitting. All in all, Arrival is a fantastic alien invasion movie that will definitely be remembered as one of the best. I highly recommend watching this movie, it's worth it.",

But it is also an intensely cerebral piece of work, transforming Ted Chiang's short story about a linguist who is called in to communicate with extra-terrestrials after 12 space vessels that ominously land in various locations around the world, into an atmospheric wrong-footing puzzle which plays with narrative conventions and linguistic head-scratchers.

Shallow self centered egotistical hollywood puts a few good actors in the movie and expect them to work miracles. The story sucks! No matter who you put in this movie it will suck. It had a foundation to be a great movie, but you can't turn a sci-fiction movie in to a love story and not finish the Sci_ fiction part. what the hell did the aliens want? And where did they go. They just up and vanished like a fart in the wind. All that was left was the stupid love story with a sick kid. They gained nothing from ET. You could tell the same story if you took ET out of the movie. The real thinkers will give this a low score.",

The plot-holes are in their masses, but that's not the issue here - the \"film\", plainly, is just boring, pointless, vapid; to unbearable levels; and on all fronts (the look on Forrest Whittaker's face throughout says it all). None of the characters have any depth, all more cardboard than actual cardboard would permit, and everything is narrated with no soul or verve; unintentionally lifeless; dire. There is no feeling or emotional-engagement - whatsoever. And the film, based on a short-story (which painfully shows), desperately yearns to be dark, meaningful, existential - but there is simply no substance to any of it. You obtain nothing. Gain nothing. Just nonsense. The art of storytelling, gone amiss. And to add insult-to-injury, the underlining \"message\" (if one can call it that) at the end is so naff and inconsequential, that you wonder if a computer or a robot has produced and made the film, thinking it were 'avant-garde'. There is no payoff. Don't bother. Or if you dare to test its (unendurable) shallow waters, on its imminent release, make sure you've plenty of work around the house to do.\n\n(0/5 stars.)",

            "content": "Arrival revolves around a linguist named Louise, played by Amy Adams, who is recruited to assist in confronting an alien species that has landed on Earth. 12 UFOs appear randomly around the world, but humans are finding it difficult to communicate with the aliens in order to find out what they want. Louise, paired with a mathematician named Ian, played by Jeremy Renner, sets out to find a way to talk with the aliens.\nDirector Denis Villeneuve is one of the most exciting directors working today. Prisoners is chilling and Sicario is a masterpiece. Both movies go far beyond their generic genres. Prisoners goes beyond most suspenseful thrillers by studying how its protagonists deal with grief, loss, and uncertainty. Sicario goes beyond cartel action dramas by studying humanity pushed to the brink, beyond boundaries and comfortability.\nArrival carries that tradition by going beyond general science fiction action films. But it also defects from Villeneuve's previous films' focus on revenge by taking on more optimistic motivations, though they're not immediately obvious.\nEvery behind the camera aspect of this movie is spectacular. Villeneuve's direction combined with Bradford Young's cinematography create a chilling, somewhat somber world that's beautiful to look at. And it's all set to a moving score by composer Johann Johansson, that builds alongside the movie in it's scale and emotionalism.\nEven the aspects of the movie I was already expecting moved me. I thought the alien ship reveal wouldn't be powerful since it's presence is the basis of the movie's advertising. It takes up most of every poster and commercial, but it's reveal is built up in a way that it's still incredible to see. Exploring the ship and seeing the aliens themselves is even more astounding. It's a completely new and fresh feeling that most movies don't give you.\nThe story itself blossoms throughout the movie into many different directions, each one extremely interesting. There's the response of the public, who are uncertain and afraid of the aliens. There's the response of other countries, who are interpreting the alien language on their own, sometimes in unfortunate ways. The combination of the fearful public and aggressive militaries put pressure on the US military to get an understanding of the aliens and why they're here before war breaks out. But there's also the story of Louise herself. We explore her past, her experiences with the aliens, the importance of her being there, and the importance of conversation. But it handles it's diverse plot incredibly well. It's as political as it is philosophical. It's massive and at the same time intimate. This is the kind of movie Interstellar was desperately trying to be, but ultimately fell short.\nAmy Adams is devastatingly powerful as Louise. It's a very strong lead performance, possibly the best of her career. She carries this movie and gives us a character we can heavily empathize with. She's smart, strong, and brave. By the midway point we fully believe she can be the hero the movie needs, for the world and for herself.\nJeremy Renner starts off as an alright main supporting character, first getting worse, then getting considerably better. At one point he has this cockiness, this forced fun guy attitude that should be now referred to as the \"Chris Pratt trope\". The lovable bad-ass. A fun character but one who's definitely starting to wear his welcome. But he fleshes out a bit, and we see him start to relate more with Adam's character and become more relatable himself. That being said, his character isn't super useful in terms of story progression. Adams gets most of the job done by herself, and while Renner plays off her well, I feel the movie would've played alright with Adams as the lone protagonist.\nThis movie has a few more imperfections. When Louise is recruited by the military, it's explained that she worked with them before, but how she was recruited for that previous mission isn't explained. And because of that, it's not immediately believable that she is this genius linguist, it feels more like she was picked at random. It was just kind of confusing. Also, the explanation of why the aliens are here wasn't ideal. I mean, it's not bad, and it's different from what I was expecting, but it's reveal was just kind of \"oh\". Also Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlberg are great in the movie, but are a bit underutilized. Though I understand to have more of them would mean to take away from the development of Adam's character, so it's not terrible, but I like those actors so I like when they have more to work with.\nThe one thing that I thought would bother me but somehow didn't is how it is basically Exposition: The Movie. We are forced to learn everything through character dialogue. And most movies don't know how to do it properly, and are very boring because of it. But like a page out of the David Fincher handbook, dialogue scenes are exciting, riddled with tension and importance. We pay attention because we want to, not because we have to. I mean, we have to, but the wanting to is a nice caveat.\nBut there is an event or revelation in the movie, an unexpected turning point, and I gotta say, it kinda blew my mind, and helped me get over whatever issues preceded it. It was a complete surprise and took the story to a new level of greatness. I won't spoil what that is, but I will say don't arrive (no pun intended) to this movie late. Every scene matters and honestly might need re-watching to be fully understood. And maybe that revelation might not be super impressive to you, or maybe you'll hate it for being a departure from the straight-forwardness the movie had built until then, but it can't be argued that it's something different, something we don't get very often in film, and I feel like that deserves to be cherished.\nArrival is held together by its dedication to communication and discovery, introducing us to something new at a gradual pace and that keeps us invested and excited. It's thought provoking, and we are motivated to learn alongside Louise. It's a rare feat for a movie, and I can't wait to see what rare feat Villeneuve pulls off next.",

Overall, Arrival is a deeply thoughtful, profoundly compassionate sci-fi movie that beautifully mixes realism with a sense of wonder, definitely a must see.",

How many alive and how many dead???\nSeems like the aliens already have 'Human' in their vocabulary. If aliens were really back from 3000 years in the future, why aliens didn't prepare something like \"Human Language Dictionary\"? \nI still don't understand whats the non-zero sum up in this movie. I don't see what human wins? Union? No haze (yeah the aliens live in haze so they may control haze as well)? There's no further elaboration. If it's technology, at least say something. If it's just that language, I don't think thats benefiting human anyway. Some may say this language is associated with non-linear timing system, so as long as you control this alien language, you can open time anyway you like. This will be the gift for human. However, in the fact that, in the future, Louise actually told Ian her ability of seeing future, and Ian left her for the reason she had seen their daughter's death. From this we can see that the ability of controlling time doesn't come along with the language. Ok even if it does. An ability that makes anyone can easily change the future and past, i don't really see it as a gift.\nAnother annoying problem is that, who, Louise from the future or Louise in the past, knows General Shang's number and words? Which comes first??? It's obviously a logical question. But the way the story line is pushed seems really weird by asking this question.\nThe whole movie was filmed in basically only three scenes: One terraced house with several rooms for different scenes; One grass land scene; and one in school.\nAlso the BGM really got me annoyed. Probably the director should watch more asian horror and ghost films to see how they control the nerves. It's not gonna work by just playing some randomly picked violent BGM with intensely increased volume.",

            "content": "A deeper and more mysterious sci-fi drama about humanity itself. Not the arrivers.\n\nThe marketing of 'Arrival' was greatly focused om \"them\". But the film takes multiple different steps inwards. It's all about the human perspective and their reactions to the unknown. Humanity is the main character here, not the aliens. It takes time to understand the story, and for some of you; a rewatch might be a good thing, since it's not a pure linear film. It's a slow moving drama that got much to tell about the basics of humanity & morality. If that isn't a thing for you, then pick a different film. Amy Adams as Louise Banks is the major player, and this might be her best performance to date. Natural chemistry and over the top mother-daughter depth is a wow! Character inside might be a lacking aspect in the first act, but the film is heavily focused on build-up, and most of the inside doesn't arrive until in the final act. The character inside develops greatly throughout the film, it follows the non-linear storytelling. Sure even more inside to side-characters would've been great, but the focus lies greatly on Louise Banks for sure and we get a lot of inside to her! But we don't really get that much to Ian Donnelly for example. \n\n'Arrival' got a clear structure and a stunning build-up. The film takes one step at a time and generally never felt rushed nor uneventful. Sure one rushed moment did exist on a personal level, surrounding the understanding of the aliens. I felt that the editors missed an important plot-point. Another nit-picky aspect can be the uneven pacing at several places throughout the film. But it's not a flawed film. No way. The third act is a major part of the structure. It's where the basic plot and characters blend together into a higher purpose. Some aspects of it did however come off as a bit flat -- the film showed several inventive moves, but some lesser ones did appear in the ending. Once the basic plot was revealed; there wasn't that much more to be excited by. The film fights hard ethical and inventive questions, but it does on the other hand have several a bit too simple moments. It's pretty much the same with the expositions -- who the writers integrated very well into this flick, but they were a bit too noticeable throughout the story. \n\n'Arrival' is a huge groundbreaker among other sci-fi films of 2016. It's one of those slow-burners with classical sci-fi elements like time, morality, culture, religion, humanity, who we really are, and what is the nature of humanity really? Who's the real antagonist; them or us? 'Arrival' might take inspiration of previous sci-fi works, but it's one of a kind -- and let's not forget the stunning direction from Denis Villeneuve. Just the visuals alone might bring an Oscar to this stunning sci-fi flick.\n\nPersonal rating: 87/100\nCritical rating: 84/100",

It is NOT that kind of movie. Arrival is a slow-paced mystery drama that touches on the less hostile side of things when it comes to first contact. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker primarily. Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, an accomplished language expert recruited by the government in an attempt to decipher or communicate with the extraterrestrials on their intention of coming to Earth.\nOverall, I would suggest the movie to people who enjoy themselves a little bit of mystery or just simply wanting a refreshing take on the stereotypical alien invasion storyline, which really pays off in droves. The true genius of the movie, is unrealised up until the climax of the movie, and boy is it worth waiting for.",

            "content": "I remember reading Ted Chiang's \"Story of Your Life\" way back when and being completely blown away. It's one of the very best short stories I've ever come across, infinitely memorable and perfectly structured, every sentence in the correct place. It's also one of those pieces of fiction that is markedly not cinematic, something easily described as unfilmable. Yet French Canadian art house auteur Denis Villeneuve has done just that in the form of \"Arrival\".\n\nTed Chiang's story is about a linguist who is given the ultimate dream job of communicating with the first alien visitors to Earth. It's an absolutely enticing depiction of a wonderfully detailed process where a language completely alien reveals its nature. As a reader who doesn't understand linguistics at all, I found this all insanely addictive. We also get memory flashes about the linguist's relationship with her daughter, merging the personal with the scientifically intriguing into a whole that's as stimulating as it's touching. The very structure of the story brings with it mind-bending speculations involving philosophy, ethics and reality itself through peculiar points of view that play freely with temporal mechanics.\n\nReportedly the film project started with screenwriter Eric Heisserer who decided to take on the impossible task of adapting Chiang's ingenious creation. The resulting script seems to me exactly what you would expect a Hollywood adaptation of a brilliant, endlessly intriguing and smart story to be: dramatic, but formulaic and hideously simplified. The linguistic thrill ride has been reduced to tidbits of technobabble and montage scenes. Only the feel of a challenging process has been retained with little of the actual process remaining. All those lovely, poignantly funny scenes of parenthood tracking the maternal experience from a child's birth to adulthood have been turned into dreamlike flashes of the ideal, portraying the daughter mostly in early childhood, mostly angelic. The short story's main premise that allowed for the most ambitious and brilliant ideas on perception has been given the role of a mere twist near the end.\n\nWhat Heisserer adds is the dramatic ticking clock. In the film, all of 12 alien objects land all over the globe, creating an immediate diplomatic crisis. This leads to a horribly clich\u00e9d but depressingly plausible conflict between scientists and government, aka the impatient military, as well. The most depressing thing about the script is that when Heisserer pitched it for the major studios, they still found it too smart and wanted him to dumb down the science even further. Some studio also requested that the protagonist was changed into a man. No wonder Hollywood is in a crisis. \"Arrival\" got made as an independent feature and was a big hit.\n\nIf you look at the script alone, \"Arrival\" seems competent but pretty standard, even forgettable Hollywood fair that doesn't do justice to its source material. Fortunately, the project was taken on by Denis Villeneuve. I remember blown away by the director in 2010 when I saw his completely masterful political Middle East thriller \"Incendies\". The director came to be known for emotionally devastating and addictively complex stories directed with particular aesthetic eye. His move to the U.S. and English films spelled a reduction in complexity, but his ability to visualize psychological experience remains top notch.\n\nIn Villeneuve's hands the \"necessary evil\" of the plot's political ticking clock becomes effective. In the story the scientists' work was more realistic as it took months and was unhurried. But in the film the urgency actually lends its own sense of authenticity. Villeneuve gives his stars- Amy Adams in the lead as linguist Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner as sidekick mathematician Ian Donnelly- an opportunity to portray insecurity and fatigue with devotion. The whole feel of \"Arrival\" is hazy, sleep deprived and uncertain, in one word alien. It's at its very best during a couple of sparsely distributed dream sequences that would feel like simple nightmares if not for their genuinely otherworldly, peculiar atmosphere. Close-ups of the involved actors' exhausted faces ground everything, makes what's going on relatable. Even those clich\u00e9d flashes of Louse's motherhood fit the aesthetic web of \"Arrival\".\n\nCinematic storytelling isn't as resonant with us as the linguistic storytelling of literature, which often makes movie adaptations seem as explanatory in relation to their source text. What is alluded to in text and left for the reader to interpret themselves, has often been underscored and written open in an adapted screenplay. It occurred to me that- if you abandon the dull linearity of time- Chiang's superior short story \"Story of Your Life\" operates perfectly as a really good interpretation of \"Arrival\" the movie. It probably works really well to see the movie first and then read the deeper, analytical short story on top of that.\n\nAs a lover of science fiction I'm often frustrated with how the genre is handled by the movie industry which embraces the visual possibilities of speculative settings but rarely has the courage to utilize the endless narrative and especially thematic potential inherent in them. \"Arrival\" tries and mostly succeeds in this, maybe not in the most ambitious manner, but still. It's good, very well acted drama that feels realistic yet mystical. It has great intensity and aims to challenge the viewer, which is always something to be thankful for.",

The film is an unusual discovery, it starts emotionally, moves in a deliberate pacing, slowly builds up a puzzle of complex paradox and ends up stunningly impactful, amplifying the questions of existential dilemma. It does not need any action sequences, it is all about life, language and unity that bring to the twisted concept of the overall plot development with several hints throughout the entire story, further surprising audiences to view it from different fascinating ways. Amy Adams gains respects for her brilliant performance as a believable thinker and expert communicator while her emotions are handled well in order to engage the entire structure of the film. The theme song \"On the Nature of Daylight\" in both the opening and ending of the movie, as well as scores composed by Johann Johannsson enhance the the atmosphere of the film especially the thrilling suspense of invasions, the horror moments during the contact and the emotional depth on life perception. The arrival of the extra terrestrial amazes viewers on how creatively a science fiction may diverge from its generic aspects and link to life - telling us that life is a journey without destination and to live as if the answer is, even if you have known everything about the future.",

            "content": "One moment is all it takes to change our lives, to define a species. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Enemy, Prisoners) presents this moment with a profound silence uncharacteristic of science fiction. No great battle, no chaos or destruction, just the arrival. Sometimes the most terrifying action is nothing at all.\n\nThe film opens to Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a distinguished linguist traveling to work as a lecturer at the University of Montana. All around her people scramble to see screens displaying news although Banks continues to her lecture hall unaware. Almost immediately after beginning the lecture a phone goes off, then another. The world has just changed, the scale of the change however, is hidden for a few more seconds.\n\nAfter tentively switching a news channel on, they learn of a mysterious object in rural Montana, massive in size and visible for miles around floating just metres from the ground. Speculation suggests an experimental military ship until more objects are found across the world, 12 in total. Villeneuve plants the audience into his world, desperate for any sliver of information but before any possible understanding can form an alarm rings around the lecture hall. The whole state is on lockdown while governments across the world scramble to figure out what is going on. As Banks enters the parking lot we see people rushing to get back to family and jets flying overhead, in a deafening array of sound. \n\nThe next day by contrast is eerily quiet, Banks travels to work as usual although it soon becomes apparent that she's the only one. Here she is approached by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) to join a military task force at the landing site. Working alongside a theoretical physicist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), they must not only establish the methods of communication with the unknown visitors, but decipher it and be able to communicate back. Some nations faced with a landing do not have peace as the primary objective on their agenda. China and Russia mobilise their respective armies to defend the populous from an expected invasion and it becomes a race against time to avert war with potentially peaceful extraterrestrials. Chaos is a persistent threat illustrated through widespread rioting and looting by people under the impression that the end of times is upon them.\n\nEvery few hours Banks and Donnelly travel to the bottom of the spaceship from a makeshift base nearby. Cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma, A Most Violent Year) achieves an almost tangible level of anticipation as the sheer scale of the pebble shaped ship is slowly revealed to us. This feeling is very shortly dwarfed in the sequence following as the team make their way inside. For all the advanced technology of both alien and human design depicted, there was a certain irony in using a scissor lift to bridge the gap between the 2 civilisations. When the aliens are eventually revealed, dubbed heptopods for their 7 legs, Banks is unable to make sense of their whale like cries. With the relations of world nations seeming to crumble around them, failure is not an option and upon seeing words and sentences in a visual form and not noise, a deeply complex and beautiful written language is revealed. The further she plunges into this language, the more her reality begins to shift and in doing so changes the fate of her world.\n\nThe climax of Arrival is both staggering and satisfying as several confusing elements from early on suddenly become crystal clear. With fabulous cinematography accompanied by a soul-stirring score by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, this is truly a first contact film like no other. Villeneuve delivers a poignant message underlining the utter necessity of communication that transcends the screen and resonates beyond.",

Just the fact of receving the visit of people from other space constitute a scientific breakthrough. The implications of communication, etiquette and approach goes down to a single question: are you come in peace?\n\nSeveral directors have portray aliens like friendly, mysterious or a real threat to humanity. James Cameron \"The Abyss\", Steven Spielberg \"Close Encounter of The Third Kind\" Robert Zemeckis \"Contact\" are to me the most influential movies of Dennis Villeneuve \"Arrival\"\n\nLinguistic Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is been introduced in the movie as a mother and wife, she holds her baby, when she start talking, walking and becomes a teenager, until she passed away. She seems to be alone, even visually. Perhaps as a linguistic she knows how the world communicate, but she is unable to communicate emotionally with her love ones. During the emotional scene you can hear her voice over \"But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrive...\" Her nihilistic words are the vehicle to the arrival of a large group of extra terrestrial. \n\n12 spaceships appear across the planet (China, Greenland, Siberia and Black Sea in Russia, Japan, United States, Sudan, Venezuela, Sierra Leone, Wales, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean. All the government of these countries are looking for answers. So they decided to bring specialists in several areas to obtain information about the aliens as well their intentions. Jeremy Renner plays physics professor who also works with Louise to find ways to communicate with the aliens.\n\nVilleneuve develops an impressive environment, where atmospheric sounds are very important for the movie. The story encapsulate Louise character, close ups where she is with her daughter and open spaces when she is alone, in fact when she is in a group her position is always ahead differentiate herself from the rest. To me Louise connects perfectly with Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) in Gravity a smart professional who is grieving the lost of a love one, in the middle of a situation require her to develop a new set of skills and abilities to reach a goal. \n\nThe political tone of \"Arrival\" express how divided are nations in peril, but also able to work together when you take risk on your own. Governments set rules that meant to be broken just to make things right. Like in the The Abyss the government secret agenda presents them as the real enemy, not the aliens, which for the audience are friends.\n\nThe film is powerful and keeps you thinking about the timeline of the story, specifically when are we located. The experimental music by J\u00f3han J\u00f3hannsson is a masterpiece, Bradford Young cinematography is engaging as well Joe Walker film editing.",

This is what Arrival is about: The critical role that foresight plays in harnessing our fears and arriving at those critical decisions which create our future. The film's characters replay this theme over and over as they revisit choices to provide a short life of freedom or a prolonged life of critical illness care, decisions to go to war or not, to be with another or not, and even the approach for alien first contact.  Each choice is portrayed in a certain 'fog' (seen as news blackouts, Louise's confusion, and even Aliens in fog) that represents the lack of clarity we all have in the present of what the right thing is for the future. The aliens' purpose simply was to fulfill the plot's main point by observing that our only 'weapon' (which Louise points out to be a tool) to move past this is to more consciously place ourselves in the flow of time - to truly understand the choices that lie before us and have the foresight to make decisions wisely for the outcomes we seek. As the aliens (real or imagined) stated, 'the gift' they were giving ('the weapon that opens time') that helps us today will help everyone in the future. The ending shows that the real battle with time is in our minds and how we arrive to take control of it.  A good film, though with very nuanced cerebral points left open for a great deal of interpretation and possible to miss entirely.",

Honestly I don't want to ruin it for you, but if you're looking for an alien action movie, please look elsewhere. \n\nArrival is a thoughtful Sci-Fi; more deep and pensive. It peaks your curiosity in a gentle, as well as stressful way. You follow the main character and are sometimes swept away in her memories as she goes through a trying period of time; trying to make sense of the hovering spaceships dotted around the world.\n\nA more human approach to Sci Fi than is typically portrayed. Very enjoyable. Highly recommend. A good movie if you don't want something too hectic, but interesting enough to keep you going.",

            "content": "Like some of the genre's best, Arrival's strength is in framing an effective science fiction story around a seemingly-unrelated topic and intertwining the two until they become inseparable. In this case, we deal with the fabric of linguistics - the desperate search for a communicative first step - and how even something so dry and cerebral can make for great theatrical drama. Amy Adams is quietly empathic in the central role, a frazzled interpreter with a strong sense of personal loss who pours herself into the work. Against the backdrop of your typical plastic-sheeted, pop-up government research facility, she's our human connection to a very clinical, inhuman situation. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are around, and give their roles an earnest effort, but they're too cookie-cutter and predictable to amount to much. As is much of the third act, unfortunately, when we discard the delicate analysis of words (both spoken and written) and give in to more bombastic, military-driven temptations. At its core, the film really has one great revelation, and while that's effective at first, it's then rehashed and hammered until its sharp edges grow dull. I still see a lot of promise here, and while it's in the groove it makes for an authentically strange, different viewing experience. The work of Arrival's sound design team plays a big part in that, and will surely be recognized when awards season rolls around. The plot's blunt, heavy-handed climax, though, can be a bitter pill to swallow.",

Their investigation is accompanied by political chaos and panic which leads Earth on the verge of global war, forcing Banks and her team on a race to find answers.\n\nCinema has considered a wide range of depictions when it comes to extraterrestrial visitors, and we are familiar with the good-hearted kind (familiar with E.T.?) and the aliens-on-an-annihilation-wave kind ('War of the Worlds,' 'Independence Day'). 'Arrival' definitely improves what audiences can expect out of a sci-fi film, and it doesn't settle for the exciting thrills of a blockbuster. \n\n'Arrival' has a lot going on on its mind, honestly speaking, this film isn't about the aliens. 'Arrival' is ultimately a human drama told under the guise of a sci-fi flick. And that despite using the generic sci-fi premise- What are the intentions of the aliens? With certain tweaks and circumstances (as sci-fi films tend to do) it doesn't finish in the generic fashion you expect because it delivers an emotionally satisfying narrative, thanks to Amy Adams. That's what makes 'Arrival' special and unforgettable.  \n\nOverall, another solid outing from Dennis Villeneuve's direction and Amy Adam's performance helps sell the film that's already incredibly executed and ambitious in concept.",

The statement by the aliens, \"We are here to help humanity ended up begging the question, help with what?  Help how?  Those questions were never answered.  The controling idea could have been the future-seeing-ability of the main character leads to first contact.  But, that idea never was developed and led to nothing more than, \"do you want to have a baby.\"  Beyond the fundamental story flaws I felt no emotional connection whatsoever with the main character despite obvious attempts by the screenwriter and director to create the emotional connnection.  The clay figures and child drawings could have been an effective tool in conveying the message of the film, but the director chose to simply point the camera at them to I suppose create mystery but in my opinion only succeeded in creating vagueness.  In the end there was nothing that connected all the vague symbols in a way that was really engaging.  I did like the fact that for once a Scifi film did not protray the so-called aliens as malevolent creatures come to destroy humanity.  For ET officianados, the space ships shape will recall the egg-shaped artifacts many believe are alien in origin found in many archeological sites and referenced in creation myths.

            "content": "Lets starts honest\n\nI really liked Arrival. Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore.\n\nWith a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasn't. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed.\n\nArrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I can't help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped.\n\nThe Story\n\nTwelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner.\n\nAll twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about 'their' pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate.\n\nHere is where it went wrong\n\nIn between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesn't have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesn't follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up.\n\nSay what?\n\nThis is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI suppose we can draw similarities to todays society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp of a global catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other?\n\nArrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path?\n\nIts a powerful message. I just wish they would have found a different way to convey it.",
