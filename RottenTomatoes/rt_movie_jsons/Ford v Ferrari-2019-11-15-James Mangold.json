A memorable, heart-pounding musical score and boisterous sound effects coupled with frenetic editing, electrifying action sequences, and strikingly beautiful cinematography, the film, directed by James Mangold (\"Logan\") is a speedy rock concert of a true story. As if these were not enough of a rollicking joy to watch, the film's epicenter are the masterful performances and undeniable chemistry between Damon and Bale. Although slow paced at times, the film contains equal doses of intense racing scenes shot in gorgeous wide angles and complex ethical dilemmas and human strife reminiscent of the brilliant baseball movie \"Moneyball\".\nAt its core, \"Ford V Ferrari\" is about the relationships that give us meaning, the passions that feed us, and honest friendship.",

The film is really spectacular, the perfect actors for the right roles were chosen, especially Christian Bale for one of the two main protagonists Ken Miles, and Matt Damon for the other leading role Carroll Shelby, these two are in my opinion one of the best two actors there is. In my opinion, the cinematography is also perfect you can always see the cars from the perfect angles during the races, so the film was nominated for the Oscar for best motion picture of the year for a reason. The vehicle sounds in the film sound extremely realistic, this can also be seen in the fact that the film won the Oscar for best sound editing. The vehicles in the film look exactly like the vehicles that were driven in the race in 1966. The film has very entertaining and funny scenes and a surprising ending that few would have expected. It is not without reason that the film won the Oscar for Best Editing, the film is always exciting and already falls into the category of thriller for me. The characters have to deal with an inner conflict, which is immediately noticeable, Carroll Shelby can no longer race because of his heart and Ken Miles has financial problems. The rivalry between Ken Miles and Leo Beebe is very exciting and extremely entertaining. The film features extremely good and well-known actors such as Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, etc.",

            "content": "One of the contenders for the 2020 Oscars is a sympathetic film by the acclaimed director James Mangold about car racing, and which, important to note, fortunately has nothing to do with the \"Fast and Fury\" series.\n\nThe title of the film was changed to \"Le Mans 66\" in most countries where it is shown outside the US, although the original name is more appropriate, because the historical facts in the film have been adjusted and amplified, in order to highlight as much as possible the rivalry between two large factories, different in every sense, and first of all in terms of conceptions and philosophies in general, when it comes to cars and the automobile industry.\n\nEither way, both titles are certainly better than the original \"Go Like Hell\" when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were reportedly considered for potential lead roles. \n\nThis is how we get a very watchable movie, with excellent chemistry between the main actors, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that, once it starts, can easily be turn a blind eye for all its imperfections. There is no need to waste words on the details, the movie is simply fun and recommended for viewing. Wishing only that other films seen in competition for this year's Film Academy Awards are more like that.",

I found myself wishing (while I was watching it) there was a bit more footage of actual car racing in the first half of the film but I suppose thats me being a bit too lazy and hoping for 24/7 action. To be fair, the film does have some good character development and it is pretty insightful about the corporate story, even though it is a somewhat long film at just over two hours and twenty minutes long. I thought its a pretty solid film by the end - I found it quite immersive and gripping. If your a fan of motor racing or like a good biopic (especially a sports biopic) then this film is well worth seeing, yes.",

            "content": "have already reviewed this movie before, but I would like to write another on my second viewing of it after I saw it in the theater 2 year ago. I really can't think of any other racing movie of the 2010s decade or the 21st century as a whole that was so much fun and as riveting as this one. Christian Bale is brilliant at playing the true character of Ken Miles and his unsung story which has been known by very little people until now of how Ford were able to construct the perfect racing machine to rival Ferrari's perfect winning streak on the 24 hour Le Mans circuit\n\nOne of the best things I like the most about the movie is that not just how the racing action is directed and how the vehicle is shown, but also how it feels. The audio of the engine in this movie is impeccable on just how much pressure and stress Miles is putting on the engine and throttle at any given time, and just how he is able to perfectly stress the engine and sustain it for maximum endurance and figuring out just the right moment to push it just a little bit further for maximum performance. I really loved that touch that this movie has and I hope future racing movies learn from it. I also love how Miles explains this in many scenes, especially in one where he explains it perfectly to his son (did I also mention that the writing is impeccable) \n\nMatt Damon as Carrol Shelby is also an amazing supporting character and Christian and Damon bounce off eachother very well and have an equal presence in the movie. Bale's acting is great as always. \n\nI also love the cinematography and look of the movie. The directing of the racing action is incredible. The film visually is dripping with soul and atmosphere of the racing period where you can almost smell the fuming petrol and hot dripping sweat of the drives on the blistering Le Mans day and the cold dripping rain in the following storm.\n\nOverall I think it's a perfect racing flick and it's going to take a long while for another one to tell as great as a story as this one did and also being this much fun to watch all the way through",

Or maybe unsolvable technical problems? Who constantly put spokes in their wheels? Through the mouth of Ken, the authors give a direct answer:\n\"And they're gonna work out new ways to screw you. Why? Because they can't help it. Because they just want to please their boss, he wants to please his boss who wants to please his boss. And they hate themselves for it. But deep down\u2026 Who they hate even more are guys like you, because you're not like them, because you don't think like them, because you're different.\"\n   Naturally, to complete the picture, the authors, through the mouth of Shelby, give a description of those \"different ones\": \n\"But there are a few people who find something they have to do. Something obsesses'em. Something that if they can't do it, it's gonna drive'em clean out of their mind. I'm that guy.\"\n   That's it \u2013 the Idea! Raise the intensity of the struggle, add spice to the 539 words of dry text. The on-screen Leo Beebe, with all his intrigues against Ken and Shelby, is a character entirely invented by the authors. The only thing associating him to the real Leo Beebe is the name. \n\nThe war of talents: a knife in the back or a wrench in the forehead\n    A well-known \"fan\" of Leo Beebe said: \"I felt in them what I called to myself \"sham good nature\", distrust and cruelty hidden under the guise of courtesy. Typical behavior of bureaucrats: they smile in your face, but they will not miss an opportunity to stab you in the back. And in the movie, we can see a knife sticking out of Ken's back. Twice.\n    The first blow was the DQ from the race. The second was the theft of victory. That would break anyone. Not Ken. After all, his goal is not a medal or the roar of an admiring crowd. He only needs one phrase from a tramp like himself (Shelby). One hat removed from a rival like himself (Enzo). Why, what he really needed was just another lap! But \"the perfect lap\" Ken had talked about to his son. He had nothing more to dream of. And no power could take it away\u2026\n    The wrench thrown by Ken at Shelby is also for a reason in the movie. A burst of rage? Tantrum? A quiet storm released? Yes! It's all about them, about the \"different ones\". They even fought each other!\n   Two types of talents are pursuing completely different goals, living on different planets. And they even fight in different ways: some calmly wield a carefully sharpened knife and attack according to a carefully developed scheme, as a rule, from behind. Others rush into a frontal attack with whatever comes to hand. \n   That's Ken Miles as he is, with all his unbroken, rebellious spirit of a warrior - in one rashly thrown wrench. That's why Shelby has kept that wrench.\n   And it was precisely what made Shelby stay restless after the death of Ken. For six months. Only by passing a particle of this Spirit to Ken's son, he found peace of mind \u2026\nAccess to the body. Information as a weapon\n    The episode of the visit of Henry Ford II to Shelby's is based on the funny \"kidnapping\" of the CEO. Thus, with humor, the authors have included in the plot a task from real corporate life, which is not mentioned in any management textbooks. Many of us tried to get \"access to the body\", but hardly anyone went as far as kidnapping the CEO. And all for the sake of fulfilling their direct duties.\n   The duty of any leader is to inform superiors and subordinates. But there is not a word in the textbooks of what can be done with information:\n\uf0fc\tblocking\n\uf0fc\tdosing\n\uf0fc\tembellishing\n\uf0fc\tdownplaying and exaggerating\n\uf0fc\tredirecting\n\uf0fc\tdistortig\n\uf0fc\tinventing and throwing in\n\uf0fc\tleveling\n\uf0fc\thiding behind something more important and loud\n\uf0fc\tholding and releasing at the wrong time\n\uf0fc\tdishing up in different forms\n\uf0fc\tharbor like a grudge\n\uf0fc\tetc. etc. etc.. \n   In general, information can and should be managed. But future managers are not taught this art in any way. \n   This lapse is aggravated by the fact that in real corporate life there are always talents who master it to perfection. There is a Leo Beebe in every organization in the world, but we \"don't know\" about it, because in management textbooks there is not a word about dividing people into types (see above). And not a word about the ongoing war between these types. \n   And no one warns that any leader, sooner or later, has to pick a side in this war. That is, sooner or later he will be forced to give an answer to one question. The question the authors of the film, through Shelby, ask at the very beginning: \"Who are you?\"\nComfort as a goal. Power and influence as a tool for implementation.\n   The fact that the authors have formulated Leo Beebe's goal is of fundamental importance. After all, only if the goals of management coincide with those of the company, one can talk of the success of the latter. And yes, it happens: people hired to achieve the company goals, often formulating these goals themselves, actually implement something completely different:\n\"There's gotta be a sense of give-and-take between you and\u2026 you know.\"\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\"The group.\"\n\"The group?\"\n\"Senior creative, Carroll. Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.\"\n\"Well, I'm confused, Lee. \u2018Cause up until this moment right now I was comfortable.\"\n   It turns out that Leo Beebe is not alone, he is just a member of a \"group\" (informal organization). The goal of the \"group\" and all its members is comfort, a comfortable stay in their chairs. Does anyone know of a company with a goal like that? But the \"group\" is not sitting idly by. It is taking all proper steps to achieve its goal. As in the above dialog.\n   Hence the informal links permeating the entire body of the company and reshaping its organizational structure. Hence the real distribution of power and influence in the company, breaking its formal hierarchy. Simple questions: who was really running the on-screen Ford Company? Who really possessed all the power and unlimited influence? Was it Henry Ford II or Leo Beebe with the \"group\"?\n    Just take another look at the way that always smiling, sweet, good-natured Leo Beebe holds Lee accountable:\n\"Have you talked to him?\"! \n   This phrase can be placed in another movie masterpiece - The Godfather. And no one will notice the fraud! How did it happen that the marketing director of the largest US corporation turned out to be an errand boy?! Why was Lee ordered to talk to Shelby? Why didn't Lee refuse? Didn't he frankly sympathize with Shelby and Ken throughout the film!\n   The answer is obvious: Lee was afraid that the next morning they would find his \"body with a knife sticking out of the back.\" Think it's my fantasy? An extrapolation of the filmmakers' fantasy? Think these \"fantasies\" are far from reality?\n    Let me remind you the evening of September 16, 1985. News agencies reported a terrible discovery: \"a body with a knife sticking out of the back\" was found near the Apple boardroom. It was Steve Jobs. Or have you forgotten the way the American Icon got kicked out of his own company? Forgotten the way someone stole twelve years from the infinitely short time allotted to Steve?!\n***\n   It's not just the film's double bottom that's amazing. It is amazing how much information the authors have managed to hide there! It is impossible to cover this scope in one review. However, I am sure that any competent business school teacher or consultant, having analyzed this film piece by piece (and it consists entirely of such pieces!), in a day or two will tell much more about real management in real corporate life than is written in all management textbooks! \nThe smugglers\n     Today, you can hardly surprise anyone with smuggling of all kinds of things. It's quite another pair of shoes with smuggling of thoughts. I mean those who are able to elegantly and imperceptibly put their thoughts right into your head, while talking about something completely different. Then, while putting things in order in your \"attic\" after some time, you suddenly discover someone's thought. It's like with a surprise hidden away by one of the departed guests. A box of chocolates or a postcard \u2013 just a trifle! Still, it makes your face break into a smile.\n    And I keep smiling each tie I remember the way I was caught with chaff the first time I watched it. You have failed to notice anything too? Take it easy! \n    Even the 10 000+  experienced people working in cinema  have failed to notice anything. The Oscars awarded for best film editing and sound editing is a confirmation. After all, these are the only things lying on the surface. And these are the only things the \"customs officers\" have seen and heard. Everything else, as befits real smuggling, has gone unnoticed. \u2026 \n   Perhaps someone would think I question the competence and impartiality of AMPAS. But suppose I just want to emphasize once again the talent of the smugglers. Well, that is for everyone to decide for himself...\nTouch of Eternity\nYoutube is flooded with videos where someone puts a girl into a charged car and hits the gas. We have all seen the natural reaction of the subjects. And the filmmakers couldn't help but know about it. And yet they took the risk! They took the risk to capture the touch of Eternity in such a \"hackneyed\" scene. \n    The little boy Henry Ford II had spent his whole life in the shadow cast by his father's giant Majesty tree. It isn't so easy, you see: to hear all your life that you are just an offspring of that same Ford, that you are the \"second\". And so, in his forty-eighth (!) year, he approached the edge of this giant shadow, and Eternity itself, taking him by the shoulder, whispered to him about it.\n    Now the virus of the Idea \"... What if the Ford badge becomes synonymous to victory?\", having passed through the bury-pasta-under-the-finish-line mutation, having come into contact with Eternity, has mutated into a clearly visible trace in history, with no shadow of the great father falling on it. \n\"I wish my daddy were alive to see this. To feel this!\" \n   Speed, power, an explosion of emotions richly seasoned with adrenaline. Painful mutations of the Idea virus. The realization that you have finally done something worthwhile, something worthy of a special mention in history. And the quiet whisper of Eternity, its light touch, crowning the many years of attempts to get out of the father's shadow. All this in one scene, in one episode. \n    These guys have captured the touch of Eternity! This guy - Tracy S. Letts has played the reaction of a person to this touch. Perhaps for the first time in the history of cinema. Isn't that what Oscars are given for? At least for the very Idea to shoot this?!\n      And after all, the on-screen Henry Ford II is damn right! The GT40 Shelby drove him in is the only(!) reason we still remember his name. \u2026\n\nBar of History\n   The Ford GT40 was first at Le Mans four times (1966-1969). This is the only victory for American automakers. That is why the GT40 has become a legend. And what happened next? The legendary Toyota Corolla \u2013 an import-killer. The legendary Toyota Prius \u2013 (???). The legendary Tesla \u2014 GM EV1.\n    The legendary GT40 is part of the history of Ford, and therefore an integral part of the history of the American automobile industry. From world domination and greatness to collapse and bankruptcy. And if the latter since 2009 has been lying alone on one scale of Themis, then after watching the film Ford v. Ferrari we know exactly what to put on the other side - the only (!) Victory of the American car industry.\n   And thanks to the brilliant work of the filmmakers, we have learned the main thing. The persons behind the victories and collapse. Those who determine the final result. Creators - Ken, Shelby, Enzo. And consumers like Leo Beebe, \"the group\", the GM guys.\n\n\nP.S. \n    And no tears at the end. Ken didn't want that. For a Warrior, there is no better death than the one that found him in battle. That was the way Ken left. The way Gagarin left. The way few of us left...\n     And it does not matter that one flew into space, and the other drove at Le Mans. What matters is that we have all seen the two \"perfect laps\": around the Earth and on the Le Mans track. And that is magnifiscent!..",

Ferrari is such exquisite movie watching that I'd recommend the film to anyone, not just your local, neighborhood \"car guy\". Christian Bale, for once with a British accent, is our speed-junkie, Ken Miles. Ken is a sympathetic character who pairs well with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a household name for motorheads, who had been a part of the winning team for the insane, 24-hour Les Mans race. Their friendship is a highlight of the movie \u2014 especially when it comes to the stunts (no pun intended) Shelby pulls to put Miles in a position to succeed. Ford II (Tracy Letts) in the car with Shelby was definitely the funniest scene. The movie is full of car porn and motorhead porn, which I still appreciated even though I don't know about automobile minutia \u2014 I'll assume it's very authetic. It's a long movie, clocking in at 152 minutes, but the \"race scene\" never really dulls, to my surprise. The Ford v. Ferrari rivalry was understandable, but the rivalry (or \"hatred\" is really the better word) between Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) and Miles felt forced. At every turn (again, no pun intended) Beebe attempted to sabotage Miles to the point you'd think the racer fucked his wife. It seemed like a forced way for the movie to create a villain. The ending to the race was a jaw-dropper, but not in the way you'd expect. At least real recognized real, when Enzo (Remo Girone) tipped the cap. I had been putting this one off because I don't really care for racing movies, but it also offers a piece of history, a couple of great storylines, and the US of A stickin' it to the Europeans \u2014 something I can always get behind.",

The film can be described as the creative mind vs the suits, which has been seen countless times before. There are also so many cliches in the film from the bad suit men to the kid who is there to show a kinder side of the foul-mouthed angry lead character. The screenplay is so boring and unfunny which really drags the film down. I also thought that Bale put on a really English accent just to cater to the American audience. However, the cinematography and the driving sequences were really impressive and put some life back into the film. The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020 and was the weakest out of all the nominees. The film deservedly won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing and Best Film Editing. Overall, a cookie-cutter film which left me pretty disappointed due to liking much of Mangold's other work.",

            "content": "FvF has some great actors and a story that I normally wouldn't be interested in but that was actually incredibly engaging to me. I'm not much into race cars or racing, but at the end of the day, despite the fact that this movie was based on true events, it's more than just about racing and race cars. FvF is about the drive of competition, what it means to be a team player and what being smart looks like. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances Matt Damon and Christian Bale gave as their characters and loved the dynamic and chemistry the two had. The two had memorable moments that made many scenes of this movie hit hard and be really entertaining. The story and script are also great; the dialogue is really good and the way the movie progresses allows for the characters to change a little bit and develop really cool relationships with each other. The film flows really well; it does have some awkward moments for the characters, but those moments don't disrupt the flow of the movie and more serve to show us who these characters are at their core. The characters have some absolutely savage lines in this movie that show that they have a pair of balls on them and that they aren't afraid to be who they are. FvF is also a movie about being you and not being afraid to stand up to someone or tell them that they're wrong when you know for a fact that they are wrong, even if that someone is a friend. FvF also exemplifies the concept that sometimes the experience can be just as satisfying as the victory, even if you don't win. There is a bigger point here that I'm trying to make, which is this: FvF may be fundamentally about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari regarding the 24 hours of the Le Mans, but it has so much else going on in it that it'll be able to appeal to audiences who, like me, aren't into racing or race cars that much. People can appreciate this movie for a lot of different reasons, which is one reason why it's so good to me and why I was just as entertained watching this movie the second time as I was the first time. I think I appreciated it more when I was able to see it not just for its filmmaking technique but for its bigger themes and messages. This movie may not have won the academy award for best picture, but for me it's a must-see and I strongly recommend it for people even if they don't care much for its premise.",

Some people find ways to insult other countries or attack the movie get this on its characters being too stereotyped, and seemed to be somehow put off because the head of Ferrari was stereotypically Italian.  Gee,  imagine the head of Ferrari coming accross as having traits that you could call stereotypical Italian, what do people expect, that the writer should make all the italians in the movie act like Germans just for the sake of \u2018originality'.\nI have to say i wasn't sure about this movie and it actually took me two viewings to decide what i really felt about it.  When doing a movie like this with great show down of characters facing off against each other almost always only through pure dialogue, it isn't easy to be original anymore.  It really had most all been done especially with period pieces or biographies.  So rather the  focus on trying to feel completely original on the situations or say execs vs engineers etc the writers went instead for not worrying about that Enzo was stereo typical Italian, or Ken had stereo typical english in his manerism. because behind that they laid out some actual interesting character that had to many times be more nuanced on top of that familiar structure and the details of character we original.  Scenes like when Ford is crying after Shelby takes him for a real test of the cars abilities, and the crying was unexpected and switched from joy to fear all together, he was proud and joyful of what his company had made, a true engineering marvel he even brought up how much he wished his father could see this moment and what a truly amazing machine he just experienced.  All the while literally being truly scared for his lif and darn if he didn't play Ford beautifully again in the subtles of his acting, being able to convey this smug man used to 100% absolute authority his entire life.  \nI think Christian Bale always delivers real moments of character and he doesn't fail here again, and though i felt Matt Damon was reaching just a bit during only a few scenes and the rest were great, his strongest moments are with Ken's son at the end, and the subtles of Ken's kid is really wel played and never over stated.  If one were to be judgemental and not really take in the movie enough to capture that nuanced character details i really can then see one missing the best parts of this movie.  And that contrast between subtle character being revealed and them dirty load death machines pushes to the edge of their ability to stay together, and keep the driver safe, i think really did well holding my attention through the movie.  It wasn't perfect, could have probably lost a few scenes but i was left with a happy feeling i had watched it.  Despite the sadness at the end...",

Starring two of the best actors of this generation, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, the film takes us on a journey of friendship, egos, automotive rivalry, and determination. I was unaware of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles and the history that they had in racing. Going into the movie not knowing anything, it made for a great lesson in the history of racing. Both the actors are effortless in their acting, and both actors look like they had incredible fun while doing the film. James Mangold, who directed the excellent Logan and some solid biopics in Girl Interrupted and Walk The Line, directs this film really well. He educates the audience but doesn't shy away from bringing the fun factor into the equation. The racing scenes are loud and exciting. They are shot in such a real and grounded way, and it offers a different perspective to how we see the lives of car racers. Josh Lucas and Jon Bernthal are standouts as Ford executives in the supporting cast. Cinematography is also really splendidly done, and seeing all the recreations of the classic Shelby GT cars is a really great kick for any car lover out there. And for a film that runs at 2 and half hours, you can barely feel the film lag as its paced at a really good rate. The film does go on familiar and predictable grounds at times, but that familiarity works in its favour for the most part. Go watch it once it comes out!",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari is a dramatization of developments within Ford's racing program during the mid 60's.  Matt Damon and Christian Bale star in dual lead roles.  Damon delivers a solid performance while Bale's may be a little lacking.  For his role, Bale must adopt an English accent.  Rather than sounding like a Brit from Birmingham, he sounds like an American impersonating Michael Caine.  The acting chemistry between Damon and Bale is poor.  A really big asset in this movie is the performance of the supporting cast.  Most notable is Josh Lucas as the unlikable, power hungry executive who steps in the way.  Ray McKinnon also deserves high praise.  The film has good production value, with technological advancements over the last few decades resulting in vastly improved action scenes (as compared to older racing films).  Numerous sub-plots exist within the movie to keep things interesting.  A really good film that does not emotionally drain nor intellectually overtax the audience.",

Most people who are interested in a movie such as this are gearheads like myself and pay particular attention to the technical details. Here are a couple of the goof-ups; the scene of an engine running on a dyno without a single fuel line connected to the carburetor; the scene where Ken Miles comes in from a test drive complaining of the car's power and Phil Remington says to rebuild the Holley carburetor throttle shafts, yet fuel injector or Weber carb stacks can clearly be seen behind Ken's head. There are several others but I just wish film makers would pay more attention to the technical details in movies like this.",

            "content": "Directed by James Mangold, Ford v Ferrari, is one of the few modern masterpieces of the film industry. The film tells the true story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles building the famed Ford GT-40 to race at the most well-known race in the world, the 24-hours at Le Mans, France. The film is incredibly skillfully-developed thanks to the production team, the writers, the cinematographers, the costume artists, and the composers for the film's score, Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. It draws you into its world immediately because of this, and even if you do not have that much of an interest in cars, you are suddenly invested in this story. The film is littered with beautiful, truth-filled little nuggets about fatherhood, brotherhood, humility, and familial love. As far as the accuracy of the events, it is altered slightly for the sake of the story-telling, while not degrading the human dignity of the real persons the film is about. Most films to come out of Hollywood these days are over-sexualized in any way they can be, the family is seen as a hindrance of sorts, and just degrade the dignity of the human person in any way they can; so, it is quite refreshing to watch a modern film that does none of these things, but rather promotes the dignity of the human person and the beauty in the relationship between two best friends, a husband and his wife, and a father and his son. I see the film as inspiring to anyone who has ever been afraid to take risks for their family, to stand up to the status quo, which is very difficult to do in our culture today. Because it is a true story, the film is motivated by and relevant to the human experience of these men going up against some of the best race cars in the world while dealing with some very uncooperative executives. In regard to the character Ken Miles and his family, I think the film does a beautiful job of showing the balance he carries between his love for cars and his love for his family. The film spends a great deal of time portraying the beauty of Ken's relationship with his wife and son. There is an attitude awareness about how important the family really is in our daily lives. In the film you get to see Ken share more than a few moments of mutual love and friendship between him and his wife, as well as some beautiful teaching moments between him and his son that I believe (although they are talking about racing) points towards the Divine. I give this film a 5/5 stars! I would highly recommend this film to anyone I meet, and I highly encourage you to sit with the themes it portrays so beautifully!",

In reality, at racing speeds sum total one thing consumes all the racer's visual attention: their path on the racing course.  \n\nConversely, several times during this flick, two racers are side by side allegedly at extreme race speed, with one item being the sole source of their visual attention, staring down their opponent, both heads turned 90 degrees from the race track. \n \nSuch lack of visual focus would in reality result in an almost immediate crash of both vehicles, both flipping, and two fatalities for the vehicles portrayed in this race.  \n\nModern directors seem to be immune to the vagaries of reality in race scenes as described.\n\nThere are several other almost constant fallacies in movie land: in all movies wherein someone wears a full helmet covering the entire head (space suit, exposure suit, under water, etc.), there is always a light illuminating the wearer's face.  In reality, any such light does only one thing, which is to blind the helmet wearer.  Think of driving at night with high beams in your face, not for a moment, but permanently, everywhere you look.\n\nAnother: for all persons occupying a vehicle, for unknown reason the vehicle manufacturer has installed a lamp illuminating that persons face, whether it's day or night time, and especially at night time.  It is just so stupid, imbecilic to see this light.  It makes the movie or TV show seem cartoonish.  \n\nLastly, Re. underwater flicks: in the ocean, unless its tropical and almost crystal clear, the only light below 100 feet is artificial.   Yet the directors often show all this natural light at extreme depths where no natural light exists.",

These scenes are entertaining but such scenes also make the characters of Ford v Ferrari feel more like caricatures than fleshed out personages.  And none of the performances here are particularly noteworthy - Bale tries on a fake British accent that I thought was Australian until I came to write this review and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford is cartoon-like in his reactions.  Nevertheless, the film embraces these characters wholeheartedly and the childish antics of Ford v Ferrari prove quite some fun to watch.  Meanwhile, the racing scenes are superb and really capture a sense of death-defying speed.  Ford v Ferrari is no work of art, but it is a crowdpleaser.  By the end I couldn't help myself - I was cheering for Miles and booing at Beebe - I'd become a fan of Ford v Ferrari.",

Academy Award winning writer Matt Damon and Academy Award winning actor Christian Bale are both very good in their respective roles.  Bale steals every scene he is in as the late Ken Miles.  Watching Bale's scenes of his behind the wheel are nothing short of exhilarating.  Despite knowing the outcome of Le Mans, I found myself becoming very involved in the racing scenes.  Considering the fact that we know how the race would end as I mentioned, that is quite an accomplishment.  The racing scenes in the film are very well done.  Masterfully filmed.  They alone make the movie worth watching.  My only criticism is a few formulaic scenes.  For example, the scenes where Ford executives try to convince Matt Damon's character to replace Ken Miles with a driver who is more fitting for the Ford Racing Team.  That I did not care for.  That aside, \"Ford vs. Ferrari\" is a movie that works on many levels and is definitely worth your time.",

Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motor and Henry Ford II. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a former driver who won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic, and Shelby's best friend. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph (350.8 km/h), on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car has brake fade during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads, \"Ford v Ferrari delivers all the polished auto action audiences will expect \u2013 and balances it with enough gripping human drama to satisfy non-racing enthusiasts.\" Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a 4 out of 4 stars, saying that it \"is what it promises to be, a blast from the past\" and writing: \"Ford v Ferrari could have just been a sports story, dramatizing an interesting chapter in racing, and it would have been fine. But in showing Ford and his minions' constant interference in the dedicated work of Miles and Shelby, this James Mangold film becomes a tale of souls battling the soulless.\" Eric Kohn of Indiewire gave the film a \"B\", saying that \"Ford v Ferrari excels at evoking the sheer thrill of the race\u2014'a body moving through space and time', as one character says\u2014and it's compelling enough in those moments to make the case that nothing beats the thrill of competition.\" Variety's Peter DeBruge praised the racing sequences and the performances of Bale and Damon, writing: \"The best sports movies aren't so much about the sport as they are the personalities, and these two go big with their performances.\"\n\nNot really a car fan nor a racing fan, but this is a quite nice piece of film based on the true story of Ford\u00b4s wish to win the Le Mans race in France against Ferrari in 1966. Biopics are always hard to embrace in my opinion, as you never will know what\u00b4s really the truth, but in the case of \"Ford v Ferrari\" it\u00b4s so well made you simply don\u00b4t think about it. We get great direction from James Mangold and superb photography by the DoP Phedon Papamichael. The 60s comes truly alive down to the smallest details in this film. Christian Bale is great as Ken Miles and Matt Damon is solid as Carroll Shelby. The film has some fantastic racing sequences and scenes that are truly well made with beautiful 60s racing cars. It\u00b4s engaging, emotional and exciting on a high level. Thumbs up for \"Ford v Ferrari\". \n\nTrivia: It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the ten best films of the year, and at the 92nd Academy Awards received four nominations, including Best Picture, and won Best Film Editing and Best Sound Editing. It was the last film to win the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing before the award was combined with Best Sound Mixing as a single award for Best Sound. Bale also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.",

Starring Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, and Caitriona Balfe, the film has a good cast that delivers some strong performances.

Personnellement, j'ai bien aim\u00e9 ce film donc je lui donne la note de 8/10. En effet, ce film est tr\u00e8s concret gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sont jeux d'acteur qui dans certaines sc\u00e8nes fait ressortir toute l'\u00e9motion et la pr\u00e9cision des personnages comme exemple leurs temp\u00e9rament. De ce fait, l'une des sc\u00e8nes qui ma permit de bien comprendre le personnage de Ken miles et son caract\u00e8re fut celle o\u00f9 il balance une cl\u00e9 en direction de Carroll Shelby. Ce moment dans le film ma fait comprendre \u00e0 quel point le coureur Ken Miles pouvait \u00eatre un f\u00e9roce comp\u00e9titeur. Dans cette m\u00eame sc\u00e8ne il finit par courir et sur la piste toutes les paroles ou la gestuel facial de celui-ci nous apporte encore plus de pr\u00e9cision sur l'esprit de comp\u00e9tition de ce personnages historique. L'importance du jeu d'acteurs dans ce genre de film est primordiale car comme dans les sc\u00e8nes que j'ai d\u00e9crites pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment sans ce jeu d'acteur de Christian Bale le personnage de Ken Miles serait plus \u00e9nigmatique et cela nuirais la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l'\u0153uvre. Pour conclure ce film est un vrai chef d'\u0153uvre cin\u00e9matographique principalement pour le jeu d'acteur aussi pour la r\u00e9alisation qui \u00e0 su nous mettre dans la peau des vrai personnages du passer mais le plus important dans ce film ce sont les faits r\u00e9els qui sont rester inchang\u00e9 pour donner le plus d'authenticit\u00e9 au film.",

All this built up , working hard and it leads up to ken milles dying, are you serious bro. This movie could have been one of the greats of 2019 but lost because he died off in the background and also because he lost the big race. At first I was a little disappointed that he lost but I understood why he did that but him dying in the background of the movie ending the movie on a sad note is terrible. Leaving the theater I just felt let down and I don't know what the director intended but this is not a happy movie and I will never watch this movie again. I just wished it ended differently because the first 2 hours and 20 something minutes were flat out awesome but man those last 10 minutes can make or break a movie. If the middle 10 minutes sucked then I could forgive that but the ending nah. Christian bale deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. Academy just give it to bale already.

It seemed by the marketing it was a historical movie that only gear heads would appreciate so it really turned off a lot of people initially myself included a movie about a rivalry in the car industry, yeah and?   Was my initial reaction.  But this movie had many layers that the trailer didn't acknowledge.  The cooperate interference, the disdain that executives had for the rank and file workers, a pitcher battle between college educated businessman and trade educated automobile technicians .  Class war between  the rich (Beebe) and the poor (miles), how the rich will prevent the poor for succeeding.  Cooperative teamwork (Shelby motors) vs individual greed (corporate ambition) friendship, post ww2 life, father son bonds, a reinvention of a race car driver to a business owner(Shelby), European snobbery against American Grit,   had this been the marketing my guess is it wouldn't be in the surface looked at as another gear head movie.  There were so many vs in this movie the worst title they could of picked was ford vs Ferrari.  It starts off slow but the friendship is really what grabs you and the striving for perfection.  The one drawback is the entire movies premise is to increase the slumping sales of ford motor company and all this drama is based on that. Thoroughly enjoyable, characters with fatal flaws, arcs of character development. Overall a worthy 2.5 hours of story telling",

Ford V Ferrari is no exception. The problem lies with the title itself. It would have made more sense to call it \"Ford at Le Mans\" or \"Shelby v The Deuce\". Enzo Ferrari's no legendary feud with the Ford Motor Company and their American bravado takes a back seat to the internal battles within Ford itself. The cumbersome bureaucracy that's laid upon Carol Shelby and team becomes the primary arc while the Ferrari stuff becomes something you almost forget about. It's as if Mangold couldn't commit to one well defined story arc so instead he chose two (even three) janky subplots. Racing fans will also notice the big miss of brushing over the two man racing teams at Le Mans in favor of the Ken Miles going at it alone presentation. Part of the the thrill of Le Mans is how the two man teams feed off of each others stamina - can you even name the second driver in the films climatic final race? Still, if you like powerful acting and Americana history, this is very much worth watching. Just know that it could have been so much better.",

I don't understand them and don't particularly want to do so. Which is why this film had little attraction for me. \n\nBut it was Easter weekend, and it was on cheap to rent, and at wife's recommendation (who had seen it in the cinema), we watched it. I still have no interest in cars and engines, having watched it. There were parts of the dialogue I didn't understand a word of - or more correctly, I understood most of the words, but not the order they were used in. Those parts of the script I did understand seemed often to be lazy and far too much on the nose. Christian Bale's performance is odd to the point of being unintentionally laughable; replete with Mary Poppins-like Britishisms which sound out of place even coming from this British actor, whose accent in this film is hard to take seriously. On the other hand, Matt Damon is quietly brilliant, very possibly his best performance in many years; unshowy, subtle and investing his character with a depth the script never reaches. \n\nThere remain other inadequacies in the film: a ludicrous brawl between the two lead characters, and a pathetic reduction of women to roles which support or prop-up the men, peering through curtains, fetching drinks, adorning visuals. Why are cars always referred to in the feminine? It became more obvious to me here; because it enables the men who drive them and build them to continue to exploit them and shape them around their needs the way they do with women in their lives. \n\nIn the end, this is little more than a genre sports film, following all of the standard story beats of sports films to a conclusion I knew was coming as a sports fan with only a very passing knowledge of motorsport. It's a true story, but no less generic for it. But it does work - motorsports are the most cinematic of sports, not least because we have much of the film grammar of them drilled into us by car chases and the like. The racing scenes are adrenalised, gripping and alarming - the louder your sound system and the larger your screen, the more you'll enjoy them. They are beautifully directed; and throughout the whole film, the cinematography is subtle but strikingly beautiful. There's much to enjoy and entertain, perfect for a holiday weekend. But it will fade from the memory quickly, the only lingering question being why it garnered so much attention on cinematic release at the expense of far superior films from female directors.",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film \"Logan\" but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.\n\nFirstly, the story is very compelling and engaging for a film about racing cars. The human drama between the Ford executives and the main characters is very natural albeit cliche. However, the director manages to balance out the racing with the human drama naturally so that none become too overwhelming or boring. Despite being titled \"Ford v Ferrari\" the film is more about the clash of Miles and Shelby against the meddling executives. The heart and passion of Miles/Shelby with the cold and calculative business choices of the executives is really the heart and soul of the film with some added bonus of intense racing. There are a lot of poignant and genuinely heart warming touching moments but with some funny moments and that is not normal for these type of films. Secondly, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon give great performances with strong chemistry between the two that makes the friendship more believable. The supporting cast Jon Berthal, Caitriona Balfe,Tracy Letts give good performances as well and definitely do well in making the world more alive. Special mention to Josh Lucas who I say is the REAL antagonist of this film by somehow being suave but absolutely detestable. Thirdly, the race scenes are incredibly done and intense with great wide shots and none of the shaky camera garbage. The film really excels at creating exciting and thrilling auto action which is in part thanks to excellent score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The score captures the electrifying race scenes but also uses score and music from the 60s to elevate the era the film is set in.Likewise, the sound and sound editing in this film are done perfectly as I could feel the engine turning or when the gears change. It's just really good.\n\nI do have some issues with this film and the first is the amount of cliches used by this film. The monologue at the beginning being used at the end again, Ken Miles being the typical cliche underdog character from a sports film, the montage with the amount of failures, the main character knowing more than the experts and machines etc. The cliches are done masterfully but it did surprise me a lot about how many cliches were in this film. My other minor issue has got to be the run time which is at 152 minutes. The pacing of this movie is mostly fine but there are certain points in this movie after they build the car where it just kind of drags. These are mostly in the scenes where there are paperwork or meetings where it just feels a bit too long for no reason. \n\nOther than some minor nitpicks, the movie is almost near perfect. The film is carried by great performances with thrilling car scenes but some genuinely touching and funny moments. The movie drives you along a road of contrasting emotions that leads you to an exciting finishing line. Give this film a watch.",

Though there is a lot of  mechanical jargon that went over my head and probably many others, the film's adrenaline-packed and heart-pounding racing sequences are edited nimbly, rendering them ideal for the big screen. There is something satisfyingly American about watching Miles crank up the Ford GT40's RPM and zip past his opponents, even though he is a Rosy Lee-drinking Cockney. It only enhances the experience really.\n\nThe film takes its time setting up its premise, which contributes unnecessarily to its two-and-a-half hour runtime. Once the team begins prototyping the GT40, this is when the film gets interesting. While exhilarating, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is ultimately empty. While there is plenty of time to inject the narrative with more characterization and heart, much of the film is spent instead on Shelby's corporate battle to get Miles behind the wheel. While their friendship is well established, the film fails to delve into Ken and Carroll's backstories.\n\nThese issues are made apparent by Miles's sudden change of heart during his final lap at Le Mans. Why does he make the decision he does? Out of respect for the other Ford drivers? Out of love for the Ford Motor Company? For Shelby? This point seems completely unexplored, but this is really not what the film is about anyway. Despite this one incongruous scene, the film does what it does well. Once the racing starts, the film grips you and never lets go. Bolstered by superb performances from Christian Bale and Matt Damon (and Tracy Letts in one unexpected emotional scene), \"Ford v Ferrari\" is a worthwhile movie-going experience.",

And leaves you right on the edge. James Mangold's direction did it great with its exciting racing sequences which is loud, thrilling, and intense. The drama and story building with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are also great and gripping with its story. The script, direction, and performances are outstanding. The plot follows when Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) wants to try to make the fastest car for the 24 hours of Le Mans race in France. He has Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) try to help and rebuild a Ford GT40 and has a race car driver Ken (Christian Bale) try to test the cars and compete in the 24 hour race. Racing against Lorenzo who is racing for Ferrari. It is a long movie of 2 hours and 30 so minutes. But it goes by fast with its gripping and sharp script. The characters are great. Carroll designs cars and is unable to race from his heart condition. While Ken is a struggling mechanic, trying to support his family. He brings his son around when he is building sports cars. Ken also hates when the executives and bosses from Ford tries to tell him what to do. Which makes their relationship and partnership unstable. The script is sharp with its storytelling. The direction is moving with a building story and thrilling race sequences. The racing scenes are pedal to the metal intense. The cinematography in putting the cameras on the streets of racing cars flying by. Or right in the driver side of the car puts you right into the race. Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered the performances. They are awesome playing the characters. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of the year. It is exciting. The direction, script, and actors did great with the movie. The racing sequences is one of the best put together action scenes. That will leave you on the edge of your seat.",

            "content": "It's not the car that wins the race, but the driver.\n\nJames Mangold's historical action-drama Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a riveting drama with exhilarating car races. You'd think Ford v Ferrari would be an overly macho, testosterone driven, dad film for desperate adrenaline junkies, but it ends up as a moving tribute to race car driver Ken Miles. Mangold pays homage to Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby for their tireless contributions to improving sports cars' designs and engineering. I was worried Ford v Ferrari was going to be a massive ad for Fords, but you actually end up respecting the craftsmanship and class of Ferrari more and Ford looks grossly incompetent, pathetically shallow, and disgustingly greedy. If anything, James Mangold criticizes the toxic masculinity, unbelievable arrogance, and cold corporatism of Ford's Senior Vice President Leo Beebe that cost Miles his Le Mans title. So, Ford v Ferrari is worth seeing for its unreal racing action, stunning cinematography, outstanding acting, and peerless direction.\n\nJames Mangold's direction is breathtaking as he sends cars flying into horrible crashes, while simultaneously filming touching conversations about why people love driving. His attention to detail in recreating 1966 is pretty flawless and impressive. I found Mangold's direction for all the car driving sequences to be creative and interesting, but many of the talking drama ends up feeling lackluster. Overall, James Mangold is a phenomenal director with a clear and compelling vision for Ford v Ferrari.\n\nChristian Bale is really entertaining with a heavy British accent as the abrasive Ken Miles. He plays by his own rules, yet comes across as a genuine family man that just likes to race as a hobby. His brilliant natural racing talent and astounding auto knowledge after just racing a car is intriguing. Matt Damon is brilliant as Carroll Shelby. Damon has a fun chemistry with Bale as they portray Miles and Shelby as having a nice friendship. Their dedication to sports car development, family attention, and sincere friendship makes Ford v Ferrari a great movie.\n\nCaitriona Balfe is wonderful as Mollie Miles. Her chemistry with Bale was really natural and sweet. She seemed like an incredible woman. Noah Jupe is respectful to Peter Miles with his devotion to his beloved father and mania for car parts and tinkering. His best scenes are the ones where he is worried his father could die in a car fire with genuine fear on his face. Ray McKinnon is likable as Phil Remington. His helpful skills aid Shelby and Miles in their quest for Le Mans victory. Enzo Ferrari is played by a stoic and passionate Remo Girone.\n\nTracy Letts is compelling as a gruff and irritable Henry Ford II. Josh Lucas is such a cruel and annoying jerk as Leo Beebe. He makes the Ford Senior Vice President seem like a loathsome fake and meddlesome fool. Jon Bernthal comes across good as Lee Iacocca. His authentic love for cars feels very real, especially as Bernthal admires what Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby are accomplishing.\n\nMarco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' score is thrilling, especially during all the races. Paul Massey, Donald Sylvester, and David Gianmarco's sound editing is awe-inspired with their loud bursts of car explosions and crashes with visceral noises.\n\nPhedon Papamichael's cinematography is fabulous no matter what kind of scene is occurring. The outside night conversation between Miles and his son is wonderful as well as the heartfelt talks between Miles and Shelby. They have beautiful framing. All the sunlight and nighttime shadows are fascinating to look at in Ford v Ferrari.\n\nOn the other hand, any of the corporate scolding from Ford's CEO are the most bland and oddly written scenes of basic grandstanding. Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller's uninspired dialogue is so strange for such a passionate movie. I liked Bale's random British taunts in the car while Miles is racing, but they are not great writing really.\n\nMichael McCusker, Dirk Westervelt, and Andrew Buckland's editing is so slick and exciting that Ford v Ferrari's 152 minutes speed by like Miles in his Ford sports car. They accomplish these hard cuts that soar high above much of their contemporaries. \n\nIn conclusion, Ford v Ferrari is worth a watch for Christian Bale's sympathetic performance as Ken Miles. I truly think that Bale was robbed of acting awards and that Miles should be remembered fondly for his masterful racing ability. Rest in peace, Ken Miles.",

Just that it was marketed inaccurately. When I was keeping myself abreast of this project, it seemed very much that the insinuation was that the movie would be a battle between Bale's and Damon's respective characters. That this would essentially be the run-through of the whole film, and the climax would feature one emerging victorious over the other. In actual fact, the opposite is true. Ford v Ferrari is largely about the friendship and partnership of those two characters. An occasionally rugged, and one occasion even violent friendship, but a friendship nonetheless. Even the title is misleading. I suppose Ford does v Ferrari at a couple of points over the movie's runtime, but it's not what Ford v Ferrari is about. In fact, Ferrari barely features in the movie at all. Here's the kicker though: I actually liked what this thing ended up being, more than I think I would have enjoyed a movie that really did revolve around Bale actually versing Damon, or one about Ford actually versing Ferrari.",

            "content": "If Ford v Ferrari feels formulaic that's because it is, but it works. It has all the elements of a traditional major studio sports movie: based on a true story, A-list movie stars, acclaimed journeyman director, fabulous cinematography, a motley crew of characters challenging conventions, an underdog angle. A more generous analogy would be Ford v Ferrari takes a reliable recipe and uses the best ingredients and best kitchen brigade to deliver an entr\u00e9e so well done it is almost easy to dismiss. That is almost what happened with this movie. After coming and going at the box office just before Thanksgiving, it seems the Academy couldn't dismiss this film entirely and gave it four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. They were right to not let Ford v Ferrari pass without notice because, though it is working with a familiar recipe, this is an excellently done, engaging entertainment.\n\nLike the title directly states, this movie is about rival car companies. Specifically, it is about the nascent Ford racing program in the mid 1960's taking on the dominant force in international racing, Ferrari. Like a lot of sports movies, you could argue that this movie isn't so much about the sport but about the characters and their journey. Ford v Ferrari is certainly about car racing but what is most engaging about it is the friendship between its main characters, racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale). After a slump in sales, ambitious Ford executive Lee Iacocca hatches a plan to revitalize the car company's image by entering the world of international auto racing and winning the prestigious marathon race 24 Hours at Le Mans. Ford turns to Shelby to head their racing program. Shelby, turns to the best driver he knows, Miles, who is the right driver for the job but does not fit the Ford company image.\n\nAt first the accents from the leads are a bit jarring. Damon is using a full Texas drawl and Bale uses a British accent not his own. Accents aside, Damon and Bale settle into the their characters quickly and comfortably. They are A-list stars that give A-list performances with great on-screen chemistry. Damon as the determined no-nonsense Shelby and Bale as the skilled but at times abrasive Miles (he's described as \"not a people person\") are not exactly a mismatched pair; they're more like yin and yang. Their best scene together is also the funniest in the movie: they fight each other with groceries. Shelby has a canned good in his hand, realizes that it would hurt Miles, so he hits him with a loaf of bread instead. Even when they are trying to hurt each other, they are trying not to hurt each other.\n\nThe real rivalry isn't between Ford and Ferrari but with race crew and the Ford executives who don't understand racing and are only concerned with corporate image, namely Josh Lucas as Leo Beebee. Lucas is great performer but there's nothing to his character aside from being petty and obstructing Shelby and Miles. I did not care about the Ford motor company winning a race to gain prestige and sell more cars so rich men could be slightly richer. But I did care about Shelby and Miles succeeding. Watching them and their crew work together to solve the problems of building a state-of-the-art race car, with each member using their individual skills and knowledge, is a total delight. Those scenes reminded me of other film about people working together to solve a problem, The Martian, also starring Matt Damon, and also a Best Picture nominee. So, yes, in a film where the title flat out states conflict and rivalry, the best scenes are of people working together.\n\nDirector James Mangold is not a household name, even among cinephiles, but he turns out solid work more often than not. When directing Walk the Line he gave the concert scenes a distinct look by putting the camera backstage and even onstage with the performers instead of just placing it with the audience. He uses the same approach with Ford v Ferrari's racing scenes. There some shots of the cars zooming by the stands but there are also shots behind and in front of the cars on the track, inside the car with the Miles, POV shots of the racers, or shots where the camera has been attached the door of one of the speeding cars. It is all cut together to thrilling results (editor Andrew Buckland received an Oscar nomination for his work). Ford v Ferrari also picked up Oscar nominations in both Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. Those aren't just throw away nominations. The sound of the roaring engines, zooming cars, and, yes, explosions, are a major part of the immersive experience of the racing scenes. I have never had any interest in car racing of any kind, but the grueling climatic race at 24 Hours at Le Mans, where drivers race in four-hour shifts day and night no matter the weather conditions, had me completely enthralled. That's good filmmaking. I can see Ford v Ferrari being dismissed as a \"Dad Movie\"\u2014the kind of movie an adult child would watch with their dad over the holidays. If that is how you happen to see this picture, you and your dad are in luck.",

The races were tautly filmed and full of drama, and, at the end of the film, you feel genuine loss. This is a truly great and unappreciated film.",

Christian Bale loves the fact that his bottom teeth don't fit in his mouth?? we get it, I'm happy for you, but that's not acting. And Matt Damon talking about 7000 RPM's (90MPH?) like he's Chuck Yeagar breaking the sound barrier is so over the top. Plus this type of enduro racing is not easy to translate on screen. The wear and tear on the driver, the wear and tear on the hardware, it's about pushing to the limit where things should break but they don't. This racing actually takes 24 hours in real life for a reason, I get that it is hard to make exciting for people that don't \"Get it\" - So what does this movie do? (here comes the Hollywood execs) Every time a race car goes off the road it immediately explodes, bursting into flames... A Flat tire = bomb explosion,  And now I'm making popcorn snow angels in a fetal position. Come on guys. The movie is about big business \"Committees\" getting out of the way of the true individual \"Experts\" and letting the people who know what they are doing \"Win the race\" - Why didn't you make this movie with the same philosophey?

            "content": "Each year you will see at least one Best Picture nominee that appeals purely to the members of the Academy who have jobs related to the technical elements of making a film and well, fathers. It is easy to see why a film about a whole lot of men hanging out while trying to engineer a vehicle that will go fast and make the loud noises that appeal to the readers of Esquire magazine hit a nerve with this sort of viewer. I was quietly amazed that I found parts of the film that I really did enjoy and although it remains a film that is not targeted at me I can appreciate the fact that it fulfills a certain need in it's target audience. This is not to say that I think it should be showered with awards but it is a solid, if not particularly original, film that does the things that it does very well.\n\nHenry Ford II, Tracy Letts, decides to purchase the financially struggling Ferrari so that they can use the company's success at the Le Mans races as promotional material for their cars. When Ferrari backs out of the deal they leave Ford incensed and he vows to have his revenge by defeating Ferrari in an upcoming Le Mans race. This requires an investment of a lot of time and money from him and he pushes those who work for him very hard. He employs the services of charismatic American Carroll Shelby, Matt Damon, and tempestuous British racecar driver Ken Miles, Christian Bale, who has lost career opportunities in the past due to his temper. The men almost win the Le Mans race in 1966 as Shelby and Miles form a strong bond and despite the fact that McLaren wins due to a technicality they feel that they are victorious.\n\nSeveral times in the film we hear either Shelby or Miles describe the euphoria and out of body experience that comes with driving a car at over 700 kilometers per hour. The audience should really feel this excitement and understand what drives these men to do what they do as driving seems so dangerous and unnecessary. This is an issue with the whole film as the stakes feel so low with a group of wealthy men who work for a company that's sales have decreased but is by no means facing bankruptcy deciding to invest a lot of money in a competition that exists so that they can boost their egos. Where the concern for the characters should come in is with Miles but his problem feels so contrived and pops up in so many films of this type that we feel ourselves not caring. Add in the fact that this problem is solved thirty minutes into this very long film and you are left with a group of rich men engaging in a competition that has no bearing on their real lives and presents no real threat to themselves, that they have not voluntarily accepted, or their families.\n\nThe villains in the film also literally shake their fists and lick their lips as they size up Miles who is an \u2018underdog' despite his incredible abilities. Josh Lucas takes on possibly the most Josh Lucas role as the villainous Leo Beebe who often pins Miles with his piercing glare and regularly attacks him for seemingly no reason. While the role is poorly written and his motivations seem fairly unclear I do appreciate what a meal Lucas makes of the role as he knows that this is his niche and brings everything he can to the table. Beyond the writing of the ridiculous villains there is some awkward exposition dropped in at the beginning of the film that makes you cringe. We see Shelby looking out at a racetrack and have a supporting character ask him whether \"The rumors are true\" to which he responds \"What rumors?\" and has the other character proceed to explain his backstory. I have never been to a Screenwriting 101 class in my lifetime but I know that this is not how you are meant to provide a backstory for the characters in your film. \n\nThe film also felt bloated as we spend so much time out on the racetrack and this time could have been cut down as the repetitive shots of Bale with his sour face looking out at other drivers and then cutting back to exteriors have little impact on me. I could not be considered a motorhead and my dislike of this film proved that as maybe if I were a car enthusiast I would have cared more and been more compelled by the scenes of racing.",

Doesn't sound very thrilling, but the film has excitement to spare. The racing scenes are directing with panache and intensity, without having to resort to over the top camera work and obnoxious editing, and the off-track drama is just as entertaining. The narrative is essentially rich boys vs good ole boys, which has been done plenty of times before, but the struggle between them is told from both sides, so it doesn't feel like the film is simply pointing fingers. Both parties have clear agendas and goals, and its simply the case that those 2 things don't always perfectly align for both groups. Christian Bale, getting to do a British accent for once, is the performance the film will be recognised for, but Matt Damon certainly isn't slumming it, and deserves a lot of praise for his respectful portrayal of a motor racing legend. It also deserves praise for the way it brings a fascinating story to life, and celebrates a professional relationship that holds a special place in the annuls of motorsport history. Whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari is one of 2019's gems, and will hopefully be recognised a seminal car movie of the modern age.",

Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.\n\nSeveral of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder.",

The noise and the driving experience are showacsed well. Almost everything is done to a very high standard. Both Damon and Bale are very good in this movie however I tip my hat to Damon despite being a massive Christian Bale fan. I think Matt Damon's character was the more interesting character and had better lines to say which tipped him over for me as the best actor in this movie. The writing for Damon's caharcter was superb. There is a good bad guy in this movie. There is something about the ending which ruins the enjoyment of this movie for me just a smidge. That is technically not the movies fault and is more the fault of reality itself. I will watch this movie again but because the story is so specific, knowing the ending means I am not in a race (wink, wink) to watch this movie again.",

I don't know much about him and throughout the movie he kept making these \"smug looks\". I didn't understand why they kept showing him. After a certain point in the movie he didn't do anything.

But now I do.\n\nFord v Ferrari could have easily gone the route of being a simple, crowd-pleasing, unassuming thrill ride. At times it was, but at other times it was much more. It gave me an insight into the fine art of auto racing, and all of the skills, crafts, and knowledge that go into it. It was fascinating to watch the protagonist's sixth sense of *feeling* the car, much like an equestrian can *feel* the needs of the horse. I applaud the film for being both a rockin' good time and an educational and enlightening experience. Much of this can be attributed to James Mangold. I always appreciate directors who can juggle a film in this way.  The raw entertainment moments and the heartfelt and moving scenes fit together exceptionally well. \n\nWhat a stellar ensemble cast. Christian Bale and Matt Damon, playing Miles and Shelby respectively, show extremely well developed characters; The movie wouldn't work as well if either of them had a single flat scene. Tracy Letts gives a memorable performance as Henry Ford II- his scene in the car with Shelby is among the most sidesplitting of the year. Caitriona Balfe and newcomer Noah Jupe also deserve recognition and credit for their believable performances. \n\nMuch of the film's greatness is due to the technical excellence. Before the audience sees even one frame of the movie proper, the title card sequence pulls them in with riveting sounds of speeding race cars. The sound design throughout the film, both the sound editing and sound mixing, is phenomenal. I was completely captivated and on the edge of my seat during all the racing scenes, and thanks to the sound, I felt like I was right there at the racetrack experiencing it all first hand. Also worth recognizing is the editing. An action movie of this nature really demands excellent editing, and Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland sure do deliver. The intensity was very present in all of the race scenes, but there were also more subtle moments of excellent editing. In one scene, the movie alternated between Miles testing a car and Shelby arguing with some Ford executives. As tensions rose between Shelby and the Ford team, there would be quick cuts to Miles on the course, where the sound of the car continued to grow louder and louder, mirroring the rising tensions that Shelby was experiencing. There were several other subtle choices like this that all contributed to a very finely edited film. \n\nAs previously mentioned, I applaud this movie for being more than a generic action film. It has real widespread appeal, and I think that just about anyone will have a great time watching it. \n\n8/10.",

A movie that captures the brutal and unforgiving 24 Hours of Le Mans and the true story of how Ford de-throned Ferrari's domination of that legendary race. Now I must say the only film, of the same subject, that in my opinion ties or slightly edges out Ford vs. Ferrari in the racing cinematography is the 1971 film, Le Mans by Steve McQueen (with no C.G.I. effects and McQueen actually driving a Porche). Although thin on the back-story line, the race sequences capture the actual racing of Le Mans slightly better than Ford vs. Ferrari, which is more about the Shelby/Miles/Ford dynamic. All in all Ford vs. Ferrari is a very good film worth watching.",

It definitely stood out on its own, and I think I'll be able to think of this on a different plain as other car movies I've seen. Attention to detail is put on different things that you'd expect in car movies, and I'm glad for this because they're the most important parts of a good movie (in my opinion). For example, the cinematography. Most car movies use a very close claustrophobic camera with fast cut editing on random parts of the car, and Ford V Ferrari does do some of this, but objectively with a lot more style. I love how the camera cuts from the wheel of the car, and you just see enough of it to see it speeding up- and then to the speedometer, which you can see climbing steadily. So yea- I guess the editing is great too. On a performance standard, Christian Bale is the only one who really stood out to me in this film, everyone else being incredibly mediocre. He really seems like he's playing the role he's casted to, and not Christian Bale, which is I think a problem many actors struggle with. But for the downsides of this movie, there are a few. First of all, the whole movie is definite Oscar bait. Every scene is very cheesy and plays out exactly the way you'd expect it to, and there are of course the cheesy corporate villains, and all that crap...it's just stupid. The whole movie does stand out on its own, yes, but that's if someone else doesn't make another Oscar-baity car movie.",

It skips a lot of the important history on this rivalry with no content about Carol Shelby's own banning as a driver with Ferrari or the Cobra Daytona coupe that won the GT class and was 4th overall at the 1964 Le Mans race.  They do show an unnumbered Daytona coupe in the garage scenes, but never talk about it or the early history of the rivalry.\n\nThere is a key flaw to this movie:  there are many historical inaccuracies in this movie.  Hence take it as a grain of salt.  This starts with Ken Miles drove in the 1964 Le Mans race and was not banned by Ford as presented in the movie.  The movie severely diminishes the role of Phil Remington, only citing his quick change brake innovation.  They gave full credit to Miles when it was actually Remington in the history books who fixed the chassis tuning and engine tuning issues with the GT40 race cars.  The races scenes were extremely inaccurate.  The Ferrari's of that time with their 4.0L V12 engines were not powerful enough to get anywhere near 200 mph, which the GT40's with their 7.0L V8's surpassed easily.   Hence all the side by side racing on the straight was just made up for the viewers.  The early race scenes of the Cobras against the Corvettes were also not accurate and the Cobras dominated the Corvettes at the track when they arrived in 1962.  \n\nBale does a good job with the role of Miles, but Damon struggles to keep his accent.  Tracy Letts does a great job in portraying Henry Ford II.",

Full of itself in every frame, no emotion is mustered; it's a by-the-book biopic about American exceptionalism ... and I kept wondering if Mangold suspected the Americans (with their hired-hand Brit) are the villains.

The races are riveting and entertaining, but it's the beautiful screenplay that gets me. Definitely, one of the movies of the year!\"",

It's the Matt Damon-ness of it all\u2013the American idealism where it's that extra unnameable force that gets the win in the end. Its heavy handed with the Big Bad Corporate evil of it all, especially when it seemed like Josh Lucas just wanted respect from Bale.

This movie focus on the moment when Ford decided they would beat Ferrari at the 1966 24 hour race of Le Man, and they ended up doing it. Christian Bale, my favorite actor, does his usual brilliant job in a performance that complements the main character but truly portrays his real-life counterpart. The racing sequences in this movie are very life-like and feel very authentic. I also appreciated the background scenery in this movie, it is certainly a very 60s esque movie. A lot of that credit goes to James Mangold, who you may know as the director of Logan, as he does a brilliant job as the director in this movie. This movies is very straightforward, is very well-paced, and does an excellent job in showing a real life story. This is an excellent movie and it is definitely worth your money!",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari is an instant classic! The film brings the story to life. The film will entertain anyone even if they don't know much about cars or racing. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are sensational as Miles and Shelby. I love especially Bale's Shelby the way that he keeps moving forward despite the challenges that he faces leading up to Le Mans. He represents the spirit inside all of us that we sometimes forget. Bale has his serious moments in the film but can also be quite comedic especially with his anger. He is so much funnier with his strong English accent. Bale has a great father-son connection with his son played by the amazing by Noah Jupe, which shows the heart of the film. Damon's Shelby is the heart of the film as his performance is exceptional. His optimism is pleasant and well needed in the film. He just wants to get the job done for Ford and doesn't want anything to get in his way. The Miles-Shelby friendship is touching and can also be funny as hell. In the film there is sometimes where they had tension but it was more like buddy banter that at times was hysterical to watch. Jon Benthal is good as Lee Iacocca and was the visionary at ford who kickstarted the idea that Ford needed to change its design and make them more like Ferrari but more importantly more like the future. Caitriona Balfe is great as Miles' wife and is his rock through the challenges he faces while being a  race car driver. Tracy Letts does great acting as Henry Ford ll. He plays a boss and he acts like a boss, at the start you don't warm up to him but you do overtime because you find out how important it is to him to honour his grand-father by revolutionising Ford's cars. Josh Lucas plays Leo Beebe with ease. His character isn't the nicest guy who doesn't like Miles which can be frustrating to watch, as he believes that Miles isn't a team player and shouldn't be the face of Ford. By not liking Beebe it shows Lucas' incredible acting. I believe that the film is a must-see for everyone with an incredible story, humour and heart.",

            "content": "4.5 Star Review: (No Spoilers here) Christian Bale steals the show once again as race car drive Ken Miles. Also starring Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby, Ford v Ferrari tells the true story of the legendary battle Ford waged against Ferrari at the 24 hr racetrack in Le Mans, France back in the 1960's. Directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan) the film focuses on the relationship of Ford engineer Carroll Shelby and his friend/trusted driver Ken Miles. With Ferrari dominating the 24 Hours at Le Mans year after year, Ford Motor Company had a desire to improve their reputation and image with the world and not be seen as a simple car manufacturer. Ford wanted to prove to the world they were just as capable of engineering a true sports car that could compete on the world stage with the best of the best. \nFighting against corporate rule, Shelby and Miles set out to prove to Ford and the world that they could win Le Mans with the new Ford GT40. Matt Damon does a great job playing as Carroll Shelby but it is Christian Bale as Ken Miles who is really the heart and soul of this film. Bale's portrayal of Miles as a brazen, yet highly knowledgeable and resourceful race car driver with a blue-collar work ethic makes you want to root for him every chance you get. Guided by Mangold's directing vision, the film takes the audience through a journey of engineering and design riddled with hard work, blood, sweat, sacrifice, failure and success that makes every race shown to be meaningful for what it took to get there. \nFord v Ferrari is a thrilling spectacle and one worth seeing for Christian Bale alone. Thankfully, however, there is a lot more the film has going for it to make even non-car enthusiasts feel the thrill and excitement of engineering and racing.",

It is possible that someone completely uninterested in racing and cars might find the film boring, but I find this highly unlikely. As the daughter of a NASCAR fan who regularly shut herself in her room when a race was on, this film has shown me the error of my ways. It is unpretentious relative to the subject and allows for any fan of an underdog story to appreciate the narrative regardless of having background knowledge of racing. \n\nBale and Damon are wonderful, which comes as no surprise, and they are well balanced by talented supporting characters that hold their own next to these giants. These days, when watching new films, I often feel that I need to ask myself: why make a movie this white in 2019? Sometimes the answer is simple. Ford vs. Ferrari is a great story in the hands of the right people who happen to be white. Sometimes Oscar bait just works. Sometimes, Ryan Gosling teaches you about jazz while John Legend is sort of, just there? In 2020, I hope to see more Le Le Mans and less La La Land from white actors and directors.

And with FvF, you get a little bit of everything. From the first shot you're in the hot seat, with engines rip roaring high and landscapes flying by. And before long we're introduced to the ensemble of characters that will dominate the screen, lacing the lights with emotion whilst at bay from the race track. Often in car films, it feels like a race to the next race, but with strong performances, a sprinkling of laughs, and these well written specific relationships, we're enmeshed in the world and not left wanting the next checkered flag. Bale is fun to watch; Damon is a natural fit; and Jupe, Lucas, Bernthal, Balfe and Letts (who proves a wonderful scene stealer) are the meat and potatoes to this tale of two. For a Hollywood flick, there's a lot to sink your teeth into, and I came out sure as hell wanting to jump into a Shelby and speed off into the sunset.",

His attention to detail, and love for his automobile, contrast is brash and gruff demeanor. Alongside, Matt Damon, a famous driver, turned coach, Carroll Shelby, they are the perfect team assembled to finally give Ford the dominance they want over Ferrari. Besides some unnecessary \"villainy\" from one of the Ford members, the movie runs fairly smoothly. It reach great heights and of joy, and plunders into even lower lows of grief. The race cars screech and squeal, and drive faster than any human should truly ever go in a machine that could, at any moment, burst into flame. It's exciting and heartwarming entertainment, about a real life story that needed to be told.",

The acting here is great with characters able to show rather than say a lot.  I know the awards season has so far showered the awards on the showy (read hammy as hell) work in the Irishman and Joker...but dollars for donuts four of the best performances by men this year are in this movie. (Bale, Damon in leads and Bernthal, Lusas in supporting roles).  And yes it is a little long...but still 4 1/2 out of 5 stars (and if you get the chance see it on the biggest loudest screen you can)\n\nAnd Darrin Prescot deserves some special oscar love for his work on this film",

            "content": "To start the title Ford v Ferrari is confusing!  The movie introduces Ferrari like an hour into the movie, not literally but in reality the movie title is the most misleading way to market to car enthusiasts.  Even though I don't follow racing, or even a car fanatic, just happened to see a documentary on the Lemans race between Ford and Ferrari. The movie title should be Ken Miles AUTO-bio, or Shelby/Miles v. Ford, or Henry Ford the 2nd dictator or Influencer... no the last one is a joke.\n\n3 ways this movie sucks:\n1) Completely disrespects the Ferrari brand and not telling how impressive the Ferrari race team was and how revolutionary their cars were.\n2) Completely missed on the most entertaining facts and storylines that make Ferrari Ford rivalry that last only what a decade, but still a 2hr 32min movie wasting so much time to make racing look beautiful, terrifying, but tried to captivate audience to actor's emotions.  I can't connect to their great actors when the movie slowly connects to Shelby's history and tries to mix in Ken Miles character without any introduction to how names Shelby & Miles have anything to do with Ford or Ferrari.  Even though movie scenes and action can look good if storyline is confusing or lacks context to connect to characters or WHY THE AUDIENCE SHOULD ROOT FOR THE ACTORS/CHARACTERS, then why try to film a beautiful movie or higher expensive actors.  I see why I haven't heard about the movie from street cred or great reviews popping up on social media, because all character are portrayed to have faults except the wife of Ken Miles.  Let me finish on how the storyline could have made shorter in a 2 hr movie, have simple timeline flashes to show importance of Lemans, how endurance racing races have a triple crown like horse racing and the crown of the 3 races: Daytona, Sebring, is Lemans.  Also, explain how Enzo ferarri was a racer like Shelby, and how Ferrari won 7 out of 8 years in arow 1958 -1965 with only Carroll Shelby beating Ferrari in 1959... not clearly shown in movie that Shelby beat Ferrari.  \n3) Don't waste time showing how great a woman Ken Miles wife is... the Ken Miles family connection great except nobody is really rooting for Miles because Miles aint American trying to represent Ford, he has no agenda to beat Ferrari, but he dies so lets make his death heart breaking, but spoiler his death isn't heart breaking with a Shelby voice over.  Shelby had stated in interviews that he felt he and Miles or his team had overcome Ford 2nd's incompetence or Ford's incompetence he blamed on Miles deathth, yet director or produces make it look like Miles introduced the honeycomb light weight design Ford made and Shelby blamed ford for his death.  To connect with the fears of racing show Enzo Ferrari's son Peiro whom was qouted by saying his dad told him not to get too close to driver of Ferrari racing because how many racers would die back then.  Show Ferrari's allence to italian driver over his own british driver, that could be a way to let audience find a better allegence to Christian Bale's character.\n\nMore time should have been spent on Ferrari being a brand to know and understand their greatness, then the rivalry lets you choose sides or stay independent and root for the driver's who just want to drive... but they would need to add another driver like John Surtees of England.  The movie shows how politics of Ford's flunkie's Leo Beebe didn't like english racer miles for driving Ford cars and how the 2 racing teams even different sizes and markets still have similar prejudices and dictatorships, while Shebly American racing inside of Ford is a more relatiable and rootable team of fun guys... yet none of these dynamics tie strong enough to the great actors.  Each actors character has an arc that falls flat by simply leaving out simple ties to the racing team style and culture \n\nShow how great the cars were just label them on screen so audience sees evolution of Ford car into GT40 Mark 2 into Mark 4 and Ferrari's 330P3 and its own beating of Mark 2 in '66 until the LeMans.\n\nYeah the long stuct movie timeline in 1965 was the wrong direction for this film, should have expanded from 58-65 introducing Shelby to Ferarri, Ford to Ferarri takeover, ford (American power) of",

            "content": "Ford vs. Ferrari is the true story of how legendary automaker Carrol Shelby and British racecar driver Ken Miles turned a stock Ford Mustang into a world class racing machine, and won the Le Mans 24-hour Grand Prix. It is also a wonderful character study, a stylish tribute to the golden age of the American automobile, and one of the year's best movies.\n\nThis is an incredibly stylish movie, from the gleaming racecars, to the slick business suits, to the rollicking sixties sound. It's brimming with confidence and ambition to match that of its central characters. It exudes a level of coolness rarely seen since the days of Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Hell, it even brings a Mad Men level of mystique to the boardroom scenes and makes Jon Bernthal, the Punisher himself, look and sound like Don Draper. \n\nMore than that, this movie makes Matt Damon cool. Not just likable, or witty, but seriously cool. I mean of course they're going to cast Christian Bale as a high strung, quick tempered, prima-donna race car driver, but who would have thought to cast relatable, down to earth everyman Matt Damon as visionary, swaggering auto designer Carrol Shelby? I mean who knew he could even play a cowboy?\n\nSeriously though, Bale and Damon are absolutely perfect in their roles, and their chemistry is even better. I'm talking Newman and Redford level good. Whether they're discussing a mechanical problem or in the midst of a knockdown, drag out fight, they always play off of each other just right, Damon providing the slightly more reasonable and self-controlled ballast to Bale's loose cannon. It's a wonder that two men with such big egos can work together at all, but it's their dysfunctional yet earnest friendship that really drives this movie. (Pun intended)\n\nThis movie is of course just as much about rivalry as it is friendship. And I don't just mean the titular rivalry between companies. Enzo Ferrari and his top drivers make pretty good antagonists, and it's the desire to show them up that drives the whole story. Yet it's the rivalries within Ford- among top executives and between management and the drivers and engineers- that make things really interesting. With so much pride and competing visions at stake it's no surprise that things get pretty cutthroat, but at the end of the day most of these people still have to work with each other.\n\nMoreover, every conflict, every clash of personalities is handled with more thought and nuance than you would ever expect from a movie about car racing. One of the best examples of this movie's brilliance is the scene in which Shelby takes middle aged, overweight company president Henry Ford II for a spin around the track. Any other movie would have played this scene for laughs. This movie makes it poignant.\n\nAnd oh, are the racing scenes every magnificent. Heart pounding, suspenseful, and beautifully photographed, they're almost worth the price of admission on their even. The best parts almost place you in the driver's seat, so that you can practically feel the roar of the engines and the incredible speed. And the fiery crashes at Le Mans are as frightening as the best jump scares in a horror movie. Even if you've never watched a race and know nothing about the sport, you'll be on the edge of your seat.\n\nAll in all, this may be the best movie ever made about automobile racing- even better than Rush. I'll admit that leaving the theatre, it even made me want to take my old, falling apart 2004 Buick Park Avenue onto a long stretch of back road and open her up, just for a taste of speed. It's really that kind of movie.",

FvF is about Lee Iacocca\u2019s vision to change the perception of Ford in the late 60s which included having Caroll Shelby build a car that could win the 24 hours at LeMans and unseat Ferrari as the perennial champion. Shelby knew the only way that could happen was with his good friend Ken Miles at the wheel. The movie is the story of that friendship and the attempt to unseat the racing giant. This was just a fantastic movie. Damon and Bale were both amazing but honestly the whole cast was. Josh Lucas was an awesome slimeball. Beautifully filmed. Should get a cinematography nomination.

The movie takes a few liberties with historical events.   I  am not sure why they opted to make a move \"Ford execs vs.  Shelby & Ken Miles\".   That was not the real story and by all accounts the real Leo Beebe was a very fine human being and a straight shooter,  not a corporate slime ball that the film makes him out to be.   He, indeed,  was the one who engineered the finish that robbed Ken Miles of a win, but he did not do so to maliciously rob Ken.  In fact once he discovered that that was the outcome, he was very sorry.   But despite some of the creative license, the movie works well and is exceptionally entertaining.",

To put it all together, James Mangold directed a movies of A list proportions that strikes the car enthusiast as well as drama loving audiences alike. This movie we done so well that it sparks intrigue into the characters and if you didn't know them before, you will be googling them after the movie because you want to know more about racing, Le Mans, and also Ford Corp of the 1960's.  No, it's not exactly historically accurate but it's not a documentary either. The acting was A plus, Matt Damon transformed himself into Carrol Shelby to portray the man as he was. The best however was Christian Bale as Ken Miles, if you knew of Ken, Bale took the shape and over the top rugged Brit that makes you smile and love  the character so much that the ending makes you understand the loss that Shelby felt. If you had reservations to see this and not a car buff, go against them and sit down for this 2 1/2 hour hit that you will get lost in.",

Jon Bernthal steals some of the show in his gritty performance as a young Lee Iacocca, and Caitriona Balfe (Mollie Miles) delivers an impressive turn as Miles' supportive, unflappable wife. It's an extremely watchable film from beginning to end. The racing scenes are what they should be--tense, dangerous, fast. Though exciting, there is a kind of deliberate, understated plodding feel to much of the film. That's not a bad thing. It's a bit bloated at two and a half hours, but it does not drag. Some of the characters felt a little trope-y or wooden, but since all we really care about are Shelby and Miles, that can be forgiven. It's a wonderful story with a superb cast and truly an enjoyable film.",

I was most impressed by how the two charismatic leads (Oscar winners both) actively worked NOT to glory hog the attention. There's a great fight scene at one point (Batman v.

Roaring engines as well as the labors and innovations behind them are, of course, the central forces thundering this rivalrous narrative forward with irresistible gusto. However, the true heart of the film is in the charisma and relationships of its characters -- the cars are loved, but the people come first here. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are spectacular in their respective roles, leading an overall wonderful cast that delivers a little something for everyone: laughs, tears, frustration, cheers, chills, edge-of-your-seat thrills, and not to mention a sincere, respectful, and moving tribute to both the real people that inspired the film and, in general, the efforts of the \"little\" guys and gals against big-wig corporate screw-heads. The film is an adrenaline kick in all the best ways and is definitely worth seeing.",

            "content": "I'd have preferred to see Michael Mann's version, but this is an impressive and heartfelt study of friendship\n\nBased on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since 1993. Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, and the film could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything original. It is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. But whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is accomplished and enjoyable.\n\nThe film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts) determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) reaches out to Shelby to design a car, but he says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. So, he reaches out to Ken Miles (Christian Bale), one of the best drivers in the world, renowned for his ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with Ford Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).\n\nLe Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali, insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular.\n\nThis thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, the aesthetic design of the races is exemplary, albeit familiar, with Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson crafting some truly intense moments. For the most part, there are no objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see, which creates the sense of being in the car with him, adding a default level of intensity.\n\nIn terms of problems, there are only two of any significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path \u2013 chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. This is seen most clearly in the character of Beebe, the film's token villain (you can't have an underdog story without a token villain). A Swiss army knife character he is a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby, who's one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life. Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer.\n\nAlthough these issues are significant in isolation, Le Mans '66 is so well made, it rises above the clich\u00e9d and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. It doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules, but for all that, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but it's a journey well worth taking.",

            "content": "The movie so misunderstood\nAuthors synopsis - \"High speed's and thrilling bumper to bumper sequences aren't the only things this movie has to offer. With it's touching bromance and charismatic characters Ford v Ferrari is an homage to the truly great Hollywood films of old, as it brings to life a great cinematic representation of one of racings most historical events and truly becomes a must see for everyone.\"\n\nOn the surface, Ford v Ferrari is portrayed as a touch and go film for motoring enthusiasts, but after seeing the film that couldn't be further from the truth. Director James Mangold who's name is widely appreciated after films such as Logan and 3:10 to Yuma has really proven to the audience racing films are no longer just for a certain audience, but can be enjoyed by all in this exhilarating biopic. The movie really stands out through its main characters' bromance between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, delivering some of their best acting yet. \n\nThe movie opens up with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby winning the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959 for the Aston Martin team before explaining that the victory was short-lived, as Shelby's racing career comes to an end due to heart complications. After being forced into retirement Shelby focusses on his vehicle design and sales career whilst at the same time the audience is introduced to the big boss of Ford: Henry Ford II played tremendously by Tracy Letts. This scene sets up the entire drive of the film as the big boss explains to all of his working staff that ford is coming to an end at the hands of bad business and poor vehicle manufacturing leading to Fords diminishing reputation. From here the movie kicks into gear as the idea of buying out Ferrari runs across Henry Ford from the marketing man Lee Lacocca (Jon Bernthal), but goes south and a rivalry is born as Ford wishes to beat Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) at his own game. At the 24 hours of Le Mans, which Ferrari has dominated over the years.\n\nMatt Damon produces one of his best performances throughout his acting career within this film. Showing the audience a very likable, charismatic and enthusiastic Carroll Shelby who will stop at nothing to overcome the challenge laid out to him by ford. Another nice addition to this film is Ken Miles' wife Molly (Caitriona Balfe), who stands out as a badass in her own right as she knows what makes Ken really shiver in his boots, and in one great scene really makes the soon to be famous racing driver crap his pants. This movie holds a plethora of great characters and fantastic acting that will definitely have the academy keep a keen eye out heading forward towards the Oscars.\n\nAnother fantastic outline within this film is its score composed by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders which really captures the feeling of racing, from the intense drumming and guitar riffs to the loud trumpets of victory the score doesn't feel the slightest out of place as it sticks to the instrumentals that you would find in such a time period. \n\nAs much as this film is great there are some flaws that audience members will definitely take away with them. One glaring flaw is this films run time clocking in at two hours and thirty-two minutes. The film at some instances does feel like it begins to drag on a little, but this does thankfully become resolved as once the boredom begins to settle in it shoots back up to a thrilling pace which does seem to be great, but maybe a cutback on some of the more slower scenes would really help this film shine more within the audience. Another glaring flaw I noticed wasn't necessarily the movie itself, but it's marketing. The marketing seems to highlight one thing and one thing alone, and that is it's a car film. I understand yes it is essentially a car-based film, but it is also so much more with a great narrative about true success and fighting for a goal as well as just what it means to show fantastic sportsmanship. However, most of these highlights within the film are overshadowed within the trailers and previews with just racing which leads to only one certain audience really discussing this film, that audience being motor enthusiasts when in reality this movie is for everyone.\n\nAnd finally, we come to the verdict of this film. As much as I enjoy this film I understand that people have differing opinions so instead of giving out a solid number out of ten I will leave a quick overview so you can decide whether to see the film for yourself. This is a high stake sports film with intense scenes and loveable characters that show great development as the story goes on. The film has an enigmatic score and really captures the feeling of racing in the 60's that really puts you on the edge of your seat as the characters resonate with the audience making this experience something amazing. \n\nWritten by:\nIvan Dorich",

When I first heard about it, all I knew was Mangold was in charge, and Damon and Bale were in it and I was already interested. And now that I've seen it...it's amazing.\n\nProbably the best aspect of this movie is the directing. Mangold does a terrific job here and the movie looks and feels superb. There are sequences that'll just move you to the edge of your seat.\n\nThe performances are great as well, especially by Damon and Bale. Both their characters are an absolute joy to watch and the chemistry between them both is excellent. Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is probably my favourite part of the movie. The character is just terrific and hilarious on the screen.\n\nThe start and first act of the movie may be a bit slow for some people (I understood why but still thought it was fine). Other than that, I don't really see a flaw or issue.\n\nFord v Ferrari is definitely one of the best movies in 2019. It's a whole lot of fun, excitement and joy packed into 152 minutes that feels a lot quicker than it is.",

The human drama is engaging, the race scenes are exciting and the gear head stuff piques my engineering side. The bureaucracy of Ford and the egos of the people at the top there and at Ferrari are justly infuriating. The rolls were well cast, and Bale and Damon deliver especially good performances. It does feel it's length part way through, and the ending isn't quite satisfactory, but overall it's an enjoyable movie even if you're not a race nut.",

I love a film that tells a story about this amazing human drama in history that you never new was playing out in people\u2019s lives. This film had a great script, excellent, Oscar worthy performances by a hugely talented cast, and a gut wrenching and wonderful depiction of human relationships and how they impact the world around them. The racing sequences were astounding. I\u2019m a sixty year old woman, and I am a sports fan, but never a big fan of racing. The human drama contained within the pursuit of mechanical perfection was riveting. But of course, it wasn\u2019t the mechanical and the engineering that made the difference. It was a legendary driver and an automobile designer, and the people around them which makes this film so compelling. On the edge of my seat, and with a tissue to my eyes, this was a brilliant film from start to finish line. ",

The lead actors were very good (although perhaps a bit too much jaw-thrusting by Christian Bale) and the cars looked great.  The film felt a bit stretched over its 2 1/2 hours--will they never get to Le Mans?--but it is nicely crafted entertainment.  It is not specifically aimed at car enthusiasts but a general audience and is a good family movie.",

I read that Ford distanced themselves from the production as it portrayed the two Ford principals in a negative light, but based in the way most large corporations operate,  I believe the film captures more truth than fiction.  The elements that were fictionalized for story telling purposes were easily recognized and forgivable in light of the overall quality of the film.  Fair warning it is very loud in volume but it is, after all, a movie about race cars and it is all part of the territory. After viewing I was compelled to learn more about Shelby and Miles. Recommend this movie for both the well-versed and novice race car enthusiast.",

Sometimes they're fighting and sometimes they're collaborating, but it's never uninteresting. And then there are the driving scenes. They are filmed with so much energy and clarity, that it's never confusing or overwhelming in a bad way. It's overwhelming in terms of volume and stakes; the racing scenes have such an intensity that I had two moments where I couldn't breathe and then I finally released. However, there are some moments that are very Hollywood. Bits of dialogue that come off as very clich\u00e9. Yet, it never gets in the way of the fun to be had.",

They are certainly breathtaking and convey the raw, mechanical, angry sounds a race car makes. But race drivers do not downshift in the middle of straightaways, and they don't decide to go faster and pass everybody by finally pressing the gas pedal the rest of the way down. For all the movie got right about the true story and about what it's like in a race car, this was sort of a cheesy, \"Days Of Thunder\" oversight.\n\nMost people won't \u2014 and shouldn't \u2014 care. It's a really wonderful movie about a great American story. I saw it with a bunch of racing buddies, and we all agreed that, even though Christian Bale is braking at the end of the Mulsanne straight at the \"100\" marker (no wonder his brakes melted), we didn't care. We all agreed Ford v Ferrari is awesome!",

Enter legendary racer and sports car builder Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who has a plan to win with  Ford hardware. One problem? He needs his friend, the \"difficult\" but brilliant driver and engineer Ken Miles (Christian Bale, disappearing into another wonderful character) to pull it off, despite some hardcore resistance from Ford's executives.

            "content": "***Spoiler-Free Commentary*** Ford V Ferrari, surprisingly, devoted a substantial amount of nuanced thought on class and Respectability Politics than I had anticipated going in. It was refreshing to see. The film has so much more to say than, 'Carroll Shelby (Damon) was a great contributor to the Ford badge racing legacy' or that 'racing is a sport that's still relevant today despite the push away from fossil fuels.' I can't say I much cared about either prior to watching the mid-60s biopic/drama based on real events. But that the film managed to spark a little combustion of interest (pardon the pun) in me about the sport and its history in addition to relatively unknown motorsport legend and WWII Vet, Ken Miles (Bale), I think speaks volumes. In short, You need not be a gearhead racerboy/ hot-rod guy to apprciate the film. In fact, Hollywood needs to make more quality, old-school films about regular people, just like this. No silly alternative-reality Tarantino cynicism for this guy here. I much prefer reality to his (oddly popular) predilection for fetishism (yes, that is a dig at his latest film which was horribly, horribly overrated). Lastly, for a film that has so much more to say than gratuitous roaring V8 exhaust notes, of which it has no shortage of, I think You'd be hard-pressed to choose a better Thanksgiving movie to watch with family this week than the 3:10 to Yuma Director's latest feature. I was not expecting the emotional involvement in the real-life characters we were delivered in this polished, finished product of a film. Bravo \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f to the creative team who brought this incredibly relatable story to Life; and indeed, to those who actually lived it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

I it's a part of racing, and in those days the money wasn't like the formula one money of today -. the get reason why Ford could come in with a big factory team and win. In those days most of the teams were mom and pop operations, and the money of Ford was deeply resented in the mood 90s.\n\nThe racing scenes themselves were top drawer, although a bit too much focus on the gear shift, not that it matters much in the end. in the days before paddle shifting most overtaking was done on missed shifts, but the scenes would miss that the way the angles were and all.\n\nThe effort, the risks, the team and teamwork, shop are well done, but the movie never loses its focus on the cars. That is so well portrayed, it's part of the don't miss this movie.\n\nMost films focus on the liability is a hero, or the Unlikable executive butt kissing vice president of Ford that the audience comes to dislike, if not feel for for. At least Henry Ford II has some passion. Quite a bit actually, and it comes across very well. The nice thing about Matt Damon as Carol Shelby is that he is shown to have real leadership with his men, something Hollywood rarely understands. it helped make the movie great.",

The movie's core the two main characters portrayed wonderfully by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. These two already powerhouse actors gave fantastic performances and had dynamite chemistry. The movie does have a handful of sensationally exciting racing sequences but there is a real heart and soul behind the wheel that makes the movie memorable. Nonetheless, these racing sequences are so well put together that I found myself holding my breath through them and it really felt like there were something at stake.

The movie is also more then just a racing movie and brings a emotional story of love, friendship and family. When it came to the action James Mangold shots in the film bring a extra intensity that make you feel as if your inside the car making you grip your seat, very beautifully done. \n                   The supporting cast all around was great and I felt everyone brought a strong purpose to the movie that didn't feel not needed or forced. The movie clocked in at 2 1/2 Hours and the pacing was near perfect had me locked in from opening minute.\n           If I was forced to pick a standout of the film it would absolutely be Christian Bale. He brought a raging bull attitude with a comedic charm to Ken Miles that made it so easy for you to cheer this dude on all the way through the film.\n  Overall, James Mangolds Ford V Ferrari is a movie that hits the gas pedal to the floor and fires on all cylinders bringing heart and having a hell of alot fun along the way !",

            "content": "November 15, 2019\n\nAs a sports drama, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is more interesting and informative than emotional and compelling, which is fine, because interesting and informative make the movie just as watchable. The way it handles its genre's usual plot and character developments isn't exactly inspired, but it does excel in the areas where it probably matters most given the subject matter, and that's in the car and racing sequences. They are energetic and convincing without being deafening or over-the-top. These, combined with a particularly notable performance from Christian Bale, add up to an overall solid cinematic experience and, I'm assuming, a mostly accurate representation of a touchstone moment in motorsports history. \n\nBased on an original screenplay by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, \"Ford v Ferrari\" chronicles the Ford Motor Company's years-long quest to win the 1966 Le Mans sports race and ultimately steal the crown from reigning Ferrari, which had captured the title for the past six years. For the prideful old boys' club members of Ford, winning Le Mans was personal after Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) refused a 1963 takeover deal from Ford's Lee Iacocca (John Bernthal) and, according to the movie, said, \"Ford makes ugly little cars in ugly factories.\" He allegedly also called Ford's CEO, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), \"fat.\"\n\nRefusing to go down without a fight, Ford enlists former race car driver and one-time Le Mans champion Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to \"go to war\" and oversee the engineering of a new Ford vehicle that would not only break speed records but also guarantee victory. It's Shelby's personal story that actually opens the film. We see him drift and lose focus during his last race, after which he's forced into early retirement when doctors tell him he has an unstable heart condition.\n\nSince then, Shelby heads a small, Los Angeles-based racing team, which includes the heavy-British-accented Ken Miles (Bale), who loves racing but mostly does it as a side gig while trying to keep his mechanic's garage afloat. Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) is Ken's dedicated and level-headed wife and Peter (Noah Jupe) his enthusiastic, curious son. They stand by Ken through thick and thin as the once unbelievable idea of racing Le Mans slowly becomes a reality.\n\nFollowing a rather routine setup, \"Ford v Ferrari\" starts to gain traction around the one-third mark when it begins to enlighten us on all the planning, testing, mechanics, logistics, etc. that go into designing and building a car, details the movie not only makes coherent but also fascinating, especially when it comes to a race car, the parts of which need to be taken off and replaced at any given moment and where factors such as weight and the type of metal play a very crucial part. We witness all the trials and errors Shelby and Miles' crew endures, including unexpected malfunctions and near-fatal crashes, not to mention the corporate bureaucracy looming over their endeavor, particularly from Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), Ford's brownnosing senior executive VP, who thinks Miles should be replaced by a more experienced driver. \n\nDirector James Mangold (\"Walk the Line,\" \"Logan\") presents this story mostly linearly, and as one conflict plays out after another, eventually culminating in Ford unleashing its GT40 model at Le Mans, the movie has an air of \"then this happened, then this happened\u2026\" It's this safe and straightforward approach to the material that keeps our emotional investment in the events somewhat at bay, because even though the characters are down-to-earth, likable and vulnerable, the machinations of the genre overshadow the potential drama and limit the number of would-be surprises. In the back of our minds, we know \"Ford v Ferrari\" is more or less a standard underdog tale, one that's based on an \"incredible true story\" no less, and so we have a pretty good idea of how it's going to turn out (and if you're already aware of the history of the actual 1966 Le Mans race, then you know for certain). We also know, given the genre, that as the heroes prepare for the race, they will have to overcome the usual hurdles, growing pains, close-calls and run-ins with \"villains\" that characterize so many movies of this type.\n\nThat being said, Mangold and his team avoid letting the inevitabilities of the genre stall the movie's momentum or limit its appeal. They seem so captivated by the pure science and possibilities of auto engineering and the stalwart determination of the characters that their enthusiasm spreads to us. Even though I watched \"Ford v Ferrari\" mostly objectively and more as a history lesson and tutorial on sports car endurance racing (Le Mans is actually 24 hours long, which I didn't know) than as an involving narrative, the details embedded in the script are engrossing just the same. Despite its two-and-a-half-hour runtime, the movie never wavers as we bear witness to the constant physical, mechanical and political battles being fought up to and on race day. We walk away from it having gained a real sense of what auto racing is like.\n\nMuch of this is owed to the film's superb cinematography, special effects, sound and stunts, which blend seamlessly and are rich, vibrant and believable. They don't necessarily feel  overwhelming (like, say, a \"Fast and the Furious\" movie) but still place us in what feels like the real race car driving world. They make \"Ford v Ferrari\" exhilarating at times.\n\nAs I mentioned, one dramatic quality that should be especially recognized is Christian Bale's performance. How accurately Bale resembles or mimics the real Ken Miles is beside the point; what matters is that he creates an original, genuine, and multi-faceted character we truly believe in, root for, and with whom we empathize. Miles is such a force and beacon of hope and positivity on-screen that it's just a pleasure to watch him do his thing, whether it's compromising with his wife, encouraging his son, or self-reflecting before, during and after a race. There's something very real about him and as I watched Bale disappear into the role, I had to remind myself this was the same actor who played Laurie in \"Little Women,\" Patrick Bateman in \"American Psycho,\"  Dicky Eklund in \"The Fighter,\" and Batman/Bruce Wayne in \"The Dark Knight\" movies. The man has range and he reminds of that here.\n \nEven though \"Ford v Ferrari\" didn't move me as much as I would have liked, there's something to be said for what it taught me, and I'm willing to bet more ardent fans of race car driving will find it works on several emotional levels. In fact, this movie seems to have been made for them. It takes the art, craft and skills of race car driving seriously and shows us just how much goes into it and gets us to really think about the minutiae that could either plague or aid racing teams. The movie may not have held heart's attention to the greatest effect, but it certainly held my mind's.",

The director also used his experience with Logan and developed some beautiful car racing scenes. Christian Bale was spectacular! He really embodied a greasy stubborn old ambitious but struggling racer. On the other hand, I saw an old short that the actual Carrol Shelby stared in and I've gotta say, Matt Damon had a spot on performance. Their chemistry was fun, aggressive, and warm. This movie however had barely any Ferrari in it. It's not even a competition film between Ford and Ferrari. The way the movie lays it out Ferrari was the competitor but Ford was fighting its self a lot more. Should have been called Ford vs Ford. I do like that it was more of a Ford vs Ford story because I learned a lot more about two America Sport heroes that I would have other wise brushed it off as another racer film.",

The chemistry between the two main characters is believable, as is the corporate image of Ford as portrayed throughout the movie.\u00a0 Another admirable performance is given by Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles and I liked how the movie explored their relationship.\u00a0 An \"acceptable\" performance given by Noah Jupe as their son Peter, with solid support by Jon Bernthal (The Punisher) as Lee Iococca and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II.\n\nI thought the character development was pretty good.\u00a0 They gave us just enough without going too long to give us the backstories on the primary characters and the situation that led to Ford wanting to get into Le Mans racing. Overall, this is a good movie, period.\n\nAs there are many choices during this T-day timeframe, I get it if this doesn't rise to the top of your list, but if you don't see it in the theaters, I definitely recommend you watch it when it comes out on video.\n\nNo scenes during or after the credits.\n\nEnjoy...",

            "content": "Non-Sports Car Racing Fans:\n\nUnless you hate all autosport, you will at least give this movie 3 out of 5 stars, if not more. Beyond it being the story about the men, not the machine, it's the story about the politics of the production-centric American Automotive Industry.  This is where the US is really different than Europe, and why only a Texan -- the only American (at the time) to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest running endurance sports car race -- could help Ford win.\n\nAnd that Texan knew the British (who really are under-represented) were key, and Miles was the engineer and driver who they needed in the seat.\n\n\nRacing (but non-Endurance Sports Car) Fans:  \n\nYou may or may know know Sports Car, especially Endurance Sports Car Racing, between US popular NASCAR and European popular Formula 1.  But don't expect this movie to teach you anything.  At most, you'll get an intro into why Ford and others don't do it in the US, and no one did until the late '90s (first Dodge, then GM after Dodge).\n\nBeyond that, it's a classic intro into -- again -- the foci and politics of the production-centric American Automotive industry.  It's really at the heart of why Ford have such inertia that is difficult to overcome, executives who make every project about themselves, etc...   Even when they have the direction to do something, they shoot themselves in the foot.\n\nThis movie is about the men, Shelby and Miles.  It should have been called Ford v. Shelby-Miles   It's almost 2 hours and 20 minutes, but you're lucky it's not longer.  They cut out so much and leave things unexplained that those who already know endurance autosport will instantly recognize.\n\nE.g., it could easily be over 3 hours with explanations, let alone had they included all 3 races of the Endurance Sports Car \"Triple Crown\" -- Daytona 24 (Feb '66), Sebring 12 (Mar '66) and Le Mans 24 (Jun '66), which is key to the fully story of Miles in 1966.\n\n\nEndurance Sports Car Racing Fans:  \n\nYou will love this movie, with one exception ... no 1966 12 Hours of Sebring (yeah, they left out that exciting finish.  Since it's not in the movie, I'm not spoiling it -- yeah, running out of gas on the last lap? That's a Sebring tradition that still happens!  And while the 1996 24 Hours of Daytona, it is definitely all about its European Title, \"Le Mans '66.\"\n\nThe movie doesn't spend it's time explaining things like Triple Crown of Endurance Racing or the ACO-FIA sanction-classifications.  While that would be cool, along with Sebring '66, it would be 3 hours.  Yes, we'd love it if it was, but not everyone else.  So put those things aside.  Also, you will hear no references to the GT40 iterations, and the models are limited to the Mk I and II, with the 'J' at the very end.\n\nThat all said, the 'attention to detail' is extremely good.\n\nE.g., you'll recognize the Mk II and even the J at the end.  You'll see how Le Mans looked in the mid '60s and so many other things.  Yes, there are liberties taken, and things missed ... but it's still fun to see them . Because they won't explain things.\n\nSo many things are 'glossed over' or 'mentioned in passing,' without explanation, but we know them.\n\nE.g., Damon (who acting I'm not normally fond of) starts by stating Le Mans is 'country roads' and other things that really just 'delivery the spirit' of endurance racing.  Damon also uses phrases like he's Carol, he clearly did his homework.\n\nThey really come off like genuine constructors, engineers and drivers, end-to-end.  The dynamics between Miles-Shelby is just going to bring a smile to your face, even if it's not perfect, and you don't really care for Damon (I didn't).  That's what absolutely impressed me.\n\nMaybe others will differ on that point, and I'm not a constructor, let alone driver, myself (just an engineer in another field), but it's really outstanding to see such come out of Hollywood.   See it.",

The first half was funny. While also showing you the struggles everyone was facing and how unlikely people came together for a common goal despite getting in each other\u2019s ways. I loved seeing Matt Damon\u2019s character as Carroll Shelby land an airplane. It was interesting seeing the different struggles by everyone in the film. Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles did great performances in this film with great Dialog. You were invested in each character. Director James Mangold did a great job at this film. I loved the speech about need one head running this about how to do a Race car business not a committee. The committee was the reason they were not winning. I loved the 1960\u2019s music and score in this film. I loved the fights between Christian Bale & Matt Damon in this film. The look of the cars and races was impressive. It was great seeing how the characters were developed in this film and seeing the relationship by Christian Bale\u2019s character as Ken Miles with his his wife and son. I liked seeing the differences in car races in the United States vs I think this film showed how great Carroll Shelby was at pitching ideas that convinced people to change their views. I loved the scene with Carroll Shelby driving Henry Ford the second around. ",

Based on a true story, the screen writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, juggle 4-5 different stories to add human drama to the film while eliminating any one of them would have brought the movie in at a reasonable showing time, way less than the 2 hours and 30 minutes it runs.\n\nAt the same time the director James Mangold has one too many race scenes, one too many shots of a foot hitting the brakes, more shots than necessary to prove Ken Myles is eccentric or business owners and their employees can be  underhanded and ruthless.\n\n Caitriona Balfe, though a bit difficult to understand, impressed me playing the wife of Christian Bale, who as driver Ken Myles, has been getting raves for his role, left me cold and also hard to understand. Matt Damon is, as always, impressive in a strong, somewhat silent way, as former champion driver and now designer of race cars. Tracy Letts in the role of Henry Ford II has a 2 minute moving and at the same time funny scene while being solid in the rest of the film. Josh  Lucas as the boss's right hand man is an effective villain even if the role is a bit overwritten and obvious.\n\nThe banter between Damon and Bale tells a lot about both men but one segment, meant to be funny is only funny due to the reaction of Balfe while Bale's scenes with Noah Jupe, just right as his son, shows the man to be a good father.\n\nThe behind the scenes of business life certainly isn't new but the behind the scenes of the racing sport and business aspect of it and car companies is interesting.\n\nThough you may know who the winner is, or will be, in \"Ford v Ferrari\" it will entertain you if you can get through the 30 to 40 minutes unnecessary segments.",

I'm not sure what it was, but it just looked right. The male characters weren't a bunch of weaklings or losers (mostly) like you so often seen in film today. This is the only movie I've considered seeing a second time in theaters. It was good. If you're a car guy, you'll enjoy spotting various cars throughout the film, as well, including some odd-ball, lesser known 60's cars.",

Damon puts in a respectable performance but Bale really steals the show here as the hotheaded \u2018Ken Miles\u2019. There were moments of real tension in the film, especially during the final thrilling race sequence. This tension was enhanced by Marco Beltrami\u2019s minimalistic yet effective score. Cinematography was average but excelled during the final sequence. All sets and cars looked fantastic and breathed a 60s vibe to fully immerse the audience in the era. Overall an enjoyable cinema experience from James Mangold and a fine addition to the movie careers of both Damon and Bale.",

I think the dichotomy of the two companies and cultures would have made for an even better movie and would have made me lean towards 5 stars. Go watch it if you want an old school, fun movie, that tells a great story with style, humour, and emotion.

Most of the racing is saved for the big event, which is masterfully captured and downright riveting. The leads create a compelling duo, but the entire cast is makes this movie work. Director James Mangold keeps the dialogue and conflicts involving, while expanding their personal lives to give extra heft to the drama.

I loved it. \n There were just enough heart felt moments between Ken Niles and his wife and son to remind you that this was based on a true story, real people, real feelings. The shoot of the racing in Daytona and at LaMans really made me feel like I was there, in the car.  I liked the insight of the busines side of building fast cars,  competing, mergers, and the TWA and Panam Jets to really get us into the time period.   Great movie.  I can't wait to see it again.",

Most of us turn on the TV and watch a race with no real understanding of the background politics and posturing that soil auto racing, and this movie gives a lot of insight in that regard. \n\nThe characters in the film are interesting and easy to appreciate. The acting is excellent on every level. The portrayals of well-known historical characters are extremely well done, with details such as period-correct accurate wrist watches and clothing expertly done.\n\nIf I were to pose one criticism of the film it would be with CGI and kit cars replacing the legitimate 1966 fleet that raced at Le Mans, but given that many of the original cars now fetch prices around $30 million, it is easy to understand how we come to have race sequences using non-original vehicles. The only car in the film I am certain was a real car from the 1960s is the Shelby Cobra driven by Shelby (Matt Damon) in non-race scenes. \n\nThis is a great racing film, far superior to Le Mans with Steve McQueen, and I feel it would appeal to both racing and non-racing fans alike. The human stories woven into the racing excitement are not superficial at all. \n\nSo, great acting, good racing scenes, excellent historical documentation and a statement about the strength of friendships and their meaning in our lives.",

I've seen the movie twice. Lots of detail comes out the second time. The supporting actress turn by Caitriona Balfe, who plays Christian Bale's wife, was mesmerizing and sexy and wholesome at the same time -- which made it magical. Caitriona Balfe should be lead actor in something right away. Seeing inside the sumptuous LA Times executive offices now abandoned in Downtown LA and awaiting the wrecking ball --  doubling for the ritzy Ford exec chambers --- was a jolt. How far print media have fallen since the LA Times executive offices were built with the finest woods and architectural details, decades ago.",

            "content": "I'm not a huge racing fan. When I suggested to my wife that we see Ford v Ferrari she said, 'I thought you didn't like racing.' Actually, I do not like NASCAR. ('Rednecks turning left', 'NeckCar'.) I do like watching F1, CART, and Grand Prix (and motorcycles), though I haven't watched a race in years. I currently have an MGB, and I used to have a Porsche 911SC. I like cars.\n\nWe went to see Ford v Ferrari Saturday afternoon. I went for the cars, and I think that my wife went because she likes Christian Bale and Matt Damon. She also tends to like true stories. We both enjoyed it. She enjoyed it so much, she spent the rest of the evening reading about the competition, Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, and others online. Many names were familiar to us. My wife wondered how many of the young people in the audience knew who Lee Iacocca was.\n\nEarly in the film I whispered to her, 'That looks like Willow Springs.' See, we used to live in the Antelope Valley and I'd been to motorcycle races there.  Not being a HUGE racing fan, all I knew about Le Mans 1966 was that Ford fielded a car that finally beat Ferrari. I didn't know the backstory. In the film, I assumed that Willow Springs Raceway was standing in, in a generic manner, for some other track. Moments after I whispered my comment to my wife, they said it was Willow Springs in the film. That was pretty cool both that they filmed the scenes where we used to live, and that some racing history really was made there.\n\nDuring the climactic race, I was surprised to see a Porsche 911. There really was a 911 in the race, a private entry by a French driver, number 35. (Porsche entered the 906.)\n\nOf course I picked out the '70s-model Cessna Skyhawk at Santa Monica Airport. It was just there, in the background and out of focus. It had nothing to do with the movie, but... Pilot.\n\nThe film had several chuckles. There was the 'NASCAR turning left' put-down, the aftermath of the wrench-throwing scene, and others. Both of us liked the scene where Ken Miles's wife started driving their station wagon like a race car. \n\nI need more coffee, so I'll just say that Ford v Ferrari is a thoroughly enjoyable show. Good movie. Nice cars.",

Spoilers ahead\n\nCharacters\nThe primary villain who constantly put obstacles in our heroes' path was Leo Beebe and Josh Lucas knocked this performance out of the park. Very Mad Money marketing is power and he who controls the narrative controls the world.\n\nEnzo Ferrari was a limited antagonist and only stood in the way of Ford Motor. He created an interesting dynamic. There were two conflicts running parallel. \n\nJon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca played the bridge between corporate responsibilities and artistic integrity brilliantly, though he was the only suit to show any empathy he was also the only suit you wanted to cheer for and ultimately showed the intransigent nature of corporate committees always win. \n\nCarroll Shelby played by Matt Damon was a charismatic former driving star searching for his purpose in life once his passion was taken away from him. Damon balances ego and humility perfectly making just enough mistakes to keep the hero flawed yet easy to cheer for.\n\nChristian Bale as Ken Miles gave me flashbacks of the Fighter though Ken's drug of choice was adrenaline. He played the foil to the smart suits at Ford's headquarters brilliantly and put it on full display during his interactions with Lucas and other authority figures. \n\nPlot\nthe plot is based on the true story of Ford's failed attempt to acquire Ferrari and their subsequent investment in a racing program headed by Carroll Shelby with Ken Miles as his choice for their lead driver. \n\nStorytelling\nThis was the fastest 2.5 hour movie I've sat through. It introduced its three main characters off the bat: Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Lee Iaccoca and their immediate struggles. Each fails early and uses it as an opportunity to springboard towards a mutual goal of tackling Ferrari. The constant fight between corporate greed vs integrity of art (because in this movie racing is painted equally as an art and a sport) is the primary theme and fuel for the conflict. A conflict that is impossible to overcome. A conflict that is ultimately won by the villain.",

Don't like the title as it does not fit as well as Shelby & Miles but then of course only the racing community would get that. The 24 hr War documentary is Ford v Ferrari. There were a few stupid things such as drivers speaking or looking at each other in cars that is unrealistic and never happens. Ford II was made out to be somewhat \"hands off\" and he was not.  I've watched numerous documentaries on this and never heard of the VP of Ford so I will have to rewatch to see if his role was fabricated for Hollywood. My racing friends doubted this as well. Shelby & Miles was depicted much more accurate in their personalities and friendship. This story was so big that it was America v Italy but that was too much to convey I suppose in a 2.5 hr movie.  Disappointed that the other Ford drivers as well as the crew were not featured in this but as I said this was a Shelby & Miles movie which was good from that perspective.",

These scenes seem to be copied from Fast and Furious books - a lot of rev counters, pedal close ups, ominous stares exchanged at high speeds... It just doesn't work that way. Nobody presses the accelerator at the middle of the strait - it's already pressed to the floor by then. If you want to show pedals in a movie, go for some heel and toe action in the corners, not straight line accelerator pedal work - I almost expected Jeremy Clarkson to be shouting POWEEER...",

One small but obvious example: they apparently never heard of rev-matching downshifts. Here's another: drivers trying to stare down each other while going over 200 mph side by side! I blame the director, the cinematographer, as well as the foley responsible for the sounds of the cars. They chose to have music (loud music) during the racing, which drowned out the sounds of the engines. Why? Did the suits as Disney think the sound of a 600 horse power engine at full throttle doesn't sound inspiring enough?  Such a waste of talented actors. Ironically, the antagonist in the movie was a marketing guy who didn't know anything about cars, and the marketing guys at Disney don't either.",

All three cars crossing the finish line at the same time.   If he had won the Le mans race (as he should), it would been a unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans.   I love racing history and is a movie that I enjoy very much.  The cinematography was very good. I would say that is very close to the cinematography of Gran Pix the 1966 movie.

            "content": "Do you remember a time when movies were fun? The rush of excitement during the film's climax, the bitter-sweet tears of an emotional conclusion, the laughs of a well-setup joke? You get out of your seat, use the bathroom, get to your car, and talk endlessly with your movie-mate about all the great things you just watched? That's what I experienced this last weekend at the Ford v Ferrari IMAX showing. \n\nFord v Ferrari is directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan), and it stars Matt Damon (Bourne Series) and Christian Bale (Dark Knight series). The film is based on the real story of the Ford Motor Company, headed by Henry Ford II, looking to beat the sales of the seemingly unstoppable General Motors. He tells his workers to come to him with an idea, or don't come back to work. Ford's Marketing Manager Lee Iacocca, played by Jon Bernthal (Netflix's Punisher, The Walking Dead), says that sales are determined by which company wins the biggest races. His idea? To beat the unbeatable Ferrari in the biggest race in the world, The 24 Hours of Le Mans. Iacocca enlists one of the only Americans to win the race, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), to build him a car. Shelby tells Iacocca that it takes more than speed; it takes a good driver. Shelby then recruits his longtime racing associate Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help build and test the car for him since Shelby can't race due to health reasons. What follows is a battle of science, speed, and corporate intervention where all roads lead to the 24 Hour endurance test at Le Mans. Will Shelby risk his entire livelihood on one driver, and will Miles prove his worth to his family and the world?\n\nWhat I immediately loved about this movie is its cinematography. It looks, sounds, and feels like a 1960's garage. You can practically smell the oil and grease. I'm not necessarily a car guy. I love a beautiful car like any other person, and the revving of an engine is awesome, but I don't care what type of engine it is or what shape of headlight came with what model. What might turn a few people away is the almost three-hour run time. Did I have to take multiple restroom breaks? Yes. Did the movie feel like three hours? No. The fast-paced dialogue and action set a nice pace that never felt like a chore to sit through. \n\nWe sat down dead center in the IMAX Theater, popcorn and sodas in hand. From the opening logos, you hear the roaring of engines, and then a hard cut of a first person perspective of a car zooming down a dark rain-covered road with headlights illuminating only a few feet ahead. Immediately I was blown away by the loud rich sound of the IMAX speakers putting you into the driver's seat. Every time an engine revved and a tire screeched, it was glorious and made your heart race. For the sound design alone, this is a must-own. But what makes this movie unique from others in its genre is the characters and realism. Movies like the Fast and the Furious series focus on spectacle and explosions, hot girls, exotic cars, contemporary music. Ford v Ferrari uses visual and audio aesthetics of 1960's America to place you in that time period without using tired conventional methods (Rolling Stones music anyone?). There's almost no 60's music here, only original score, which works in the movie's favor. Too many times do we see period movies focus too much on reminding you which era you're in instead of just telling the story. Thankfully, Mangold is a great storyteller.\n\nWhat really stands out here is the acting. Everyone here nails their performance. The standout being Bale as Miles. Once again he transformed his body after gaining a ton of weight to play Dick Cheney in Vice, and lost it all to play Miles. He claims he's done doing that, but we'll have to see. His relationship with the Ford Corporation and his wife and kid are what tug on your heartstrings. He's so likable all you want is to see him succeed. His pure passion for driving is what brings this movie its fun factor.  He perfectly plays off of Damon's dry southern humor and you can tell Miles loves cars and speed. All he wants is to prove he's the one to win Le Mans. Damon does a great job portraying Shelby, and his arc is the one that drives the relationship between Miles and the suites at Ford.\n\nYou don't have to be a car nut to enjoy this film. Same reason you don't have to be a chef to love the taste of fine dining. It has fun with the source material and leaves you with a smile on your face during the credits. I think the standout here is Bale and awards will surely be coming his way. Is it a little long? Sure, but you're so enthralled with the action that you never think about looking at your watch.",

We saw it for the 1st time yesterday at the movie theatre  - and we're planning to go see it again next week. \n\nI hate to say it, but this movie is S-O exciting that I had to rank it up in the stratosphere with my 1, all-time favorite movies,  'The Fifth Element' - which I saw at the movie theatre 9 times when it came out and Star Wars Ep. I - which I saw at the theatre 19 times when it came out in 1977! \n\nI was S-O excited from 'Ford v Ferrari' that my adrenaline didn't subside until 2 hours after the movie ended.

Extremely well paced and engaging as I was never \"out\" of this movie, or wondering what time it was. The story was extremely interesting, the casting was deserving of praise all around, and the roles were well developed and acted. My one real criticism is that at times the dialogue or dramatic action got a bit cliche or corny, as is often the case in some of these big, mass appeal releases. I also don't know if this is just a case of being over saturated with previews for these big releases, where any scene can come off cliche or hackneyed after you have seen it twenty times prior to the movie. This one is easily in the 7.5/10 range for me and in my more relaxed days would easily have garnered an 8/10.\n*2019 Theater #51\n*AMC A-List #77",

From here he set himself up as a business man, mostly selling cars on the back of his fame.  Flash forward to 1966 and Henry Ford II has set his sites on beating Ferrari at the Le Mans race of that year, something that Ford has never achieved.  Carroll Shelby is tasked with finding the car, engineers and driver to help him achieve this.  In steps British race car driver Ken Miles, a genius behind the wheel but blunt, reckless and lacking finesse in his private life, an image that Ford feels does not fit with the Ford brand.  From here Shelby and Miles fight against corporate interference to provide the win they know they have the power and skill to achieve.\nLe Mans '66 is without a doubt a 5* film, I am certain this one will go down as a future classic.  The tone, style and feel of the movie is spot on.  The races are filmed with such tension and exhilaration, you feel like you're there on the track with them but the true stand out is Christian Bale as Ken Miles.  All of the cast provide great support and fit their roles well but Bale becomes Miles without a doubt, he brings the man alive and is entertaining throughout.  A fun, fast paced and ultimately tragic movie that will keep you entertained for it's considerable running time.",

            "content": "\"Logan\" and \"Walk The Line\" director James Mangold reteams with his \"3:10 To Yuma\" star Christian Bale for \"Ford v Ferrari,\" an easy shoe-in for most deceptive title of the year, as this isn't really a movie about the pride of one man in Detroit, Michigan and another in Modena, Italy, nor is it even really about cars. This is an effective, thrilling, intuitive and enjoyable dissertation on perseverance, friendship, and the neverending battle between creativity and big business, featuring two dynamite performances from both Bale and Matt Damon. Yes, it's a tad safe, and it does tend to play a little loose with certain aspects of truth. However, if I'm being honest, I'm not necessarily sure there's a dire upshot in smoothing over a few edges here and there, especially in a story that bears little to no impact on current circumstances, events, or political movements. It's not as though this is a biopic of one of modern society's formative figures, or even an allegorical exploration into the underpinnings of some of today's issues. We're talking about the difference between cheating during the Super Bowl and cheating in a game of Jenga. That's not to say this movie bears no weight of any kind, though, as all forms of technicality on display (i.e. sound design/mixing, cinematography, stunt work, etc.) help remind you that this at times a life or death pursuit. I'm no expert on automobiles, but I do know a bit about film. And this one's more than worthy of a spin. What a ride.",

It is a solid time period piece about American ingenuity (remember when that used to be a thing?), the ageless conflict between execs and peons, and a timeless reminder of how team players always get shafted in the end.\n\nChristian Bale is his usual brilliant self and should easily be an Oscar contender (but not win, b/c like the Ford suits in this story, Hollywood hates him). It's directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma), so you know to expect characters who wear very large cowboy hats.\n\nThis is a great Dad Movie and effectively a 2.5-hr product placement for Luxottica, Budweiser and Italian stopwatches.

It might not be a great film, but it does hark back to those Hollywood days when films were put together on the back of a good story and a bunch of interesting characters to draw you in. I'm not really interested in auto racing at all but I was generally enthralled through out most of its running time. This film is the story of the Le Mans 24 Hour race in 1966 and how the Ford Motor Company tried to take on and defeat the almighty Ferrari team. Ford at the time was slumping in sales and the idea was to sex up the brand by beating Ferrari. They actually tired to buy Ferrari, but old man Enzo sold out to FIAT. The two men heading the charge were American Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon, who designed the cars after a successful driving career and British driver Ken Miles. Christian Bale plays Miles and he is superb in the role, embracing perfectly the larger than life personality. The film is about power and innovation. There is plenty of testosterone on display with powerful, proud men going head to head. Especially in the climactic racing scenes. They are filmed with great execution too. The film is probably a little long and some of the characters are a little two dimensional. Especially the Ford Motor executives. But overall this is smart big screen entertainment that gives you value for money.",

This is the story of a man who was fan of racing and laid down his life for them.\nThis story is based on real events and the film correctly and accurately shows them. It makes no sense to talk about the plot, the story has already told it, but how it happened is something you must see. James Mangold, who made films such as Logan, 3:10 to Yuma and Walk the Line, delights us with another powerful project. Christian Bale and Matt Damon very convincingly showed their characters: sharp and fanatical Ken Miles and racer and constructor Carroll Shelby. For me, this is Bail's best role.\nThe plot of the film is not built entirely on the confrontation of Ferrari and Ford. No, of course, this is the engine of the film, but the story revolves around Ken Miles, telling and showing through him what big races are and the will to win.\nThis is an amazing film, which undoubtedly claims to be an Oscar, and I hope it will interest you to go to the cinema. 9/10\n*Sorry from my bad English",

This is a really special movie that gear heads and enthusiasts of multiple disciplines will share and enjoy. This is the story of one of the world's most challenging and discipline requiring automobile races that had been dominated by the Ferrari Racing Team almost since its inception. The year is 1966. The race is The 24 Hours of Le Mans in France.\nThe story is a true to life character depiction of what happens when men who might be best identified as Racing Savants - men who were exceptional visionaries in the field of automobile racing - become involved with a corporate world where image is more important then content and skill is subservient to corporate status. This is the story of Carroll Shelby (played brilliantly by Matt Damon), initially of auto racing fame and later as one of the leading designers of vehicles that were extraordinary in performance and reliability. It is also the story of his long time friend and protege, Ken Miles ( another very special performance by Academy Award winner Christian Bale) as a race car driver whose intensity becomes the greatest challenge this partnership must overcome in their effort to defeat Team Ferrari at Le Mans. The always present corporate involvement of both the Senior Ford and Ferrari Motor Car Company management teams will add a dimension of reality to a program where instinct and a racers primal commitment to winning must coexist if success is to be achieved. This is a movie that all will want to see and all will share in the drama of what it takes to be \"The Best in The World\" in a sport where life and death are your constant companions.\nRating: M - S - T - A = Must See To Appreciate",

The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5/5 is the run time. 2h 32m seems a lot longer than it is while watching the film and it may be due to the long racing scenes (which I found amazing but others may find it repetitive).

This story takes place in the middle of the muscle car era, touching on historical notes of automotive and racing legends like Iococca, Shelby, Ferrari and Miles.  Movies are a visual media, and even pushing 170 minutes it is still too short to really get into any true detail.  So it is inherently a distillation, and by those standards this is a really enjoyable movie.  \"FvF\" is a great balance of nods to the true story and historical fictionalization for dramatic and action impact.  We saw it in a three-screen theater, where some of the race scenes are projected on three walls of the auditorium.  I prefer this newer cinema format for it's feeling of presence, rather than any \"Virtual Reality\" effect of being surrounded by the picture on three sides.  I think this mopvie can be enjoyed by anyone whether you know cars and racing intimately or not.  If you just don't like the sound of a combustion engine, stay away. because you will hate every glorious RPM and screaming peel out.",

How they built the amazing GT40 and took it to France to kick ol' Enzo's tail on his turf. Over the years I did a little research here and there and found this story to always be fascinating!! And then someone got the grand idea to make it into a movie!!  I HAD to go see it!! And it was absolutely worth EVERY PENNY to see it in IMAX!!!\n\nThe sights were incredible!! The sounds even more so!!\n\nMatt Damon did a great job bringing Carroll Shelby to life and Christian Bale executed the role of Ken Miles flawlessly. The driving scenes were fantastic, and the cinematography was second to none. Camera placement was perfect!! Track scenes felt extremely realistic and the incorporation of vintage film scattered throughout really brought this 2019 movie back to the 1960's - while bringing the 1960's into 2019!\n\nBut the REAL prize comes through in the soundtrack!! My hat is totally off to the sound engineers!! Is there anything better than a 427 Cubic Inch Big Block Ford spinning at 7000+ RPM on the high banks of Daytona?? Or the 48 valves of a 5 liter Ferrari V-12 doing the same down the Mulsanne Straight in France?? (Hint...The correct answer is no...There definitely isn't!!) From personal experience as someone who grew up with those sounds in real life, the sound editors hit the nail SQUARELY on the head!! (My father was a 427 engine builder. I remember the house shaking when one of those beasts started up in the garage!! He actually worked as a 427 engine builder for Holman & Moody - another GT-40 team that was represented in the movie.) The immersive sound reproduction of the IMAX experience was well worth it!! The engineer should get an Oscar for best Soundtrack for this movie!\n\nIf you're a car junkie, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE!! I promise I will be seeing it in theaters again soon!! And probably in IMAX too!",

            "content": "Ford v Ferrari is one of those few movies based on well-made real events, which means that most of these types of movies concentrate more on telling the event that happened and completely forget about telling a good story based on facts. real with interesting characters, funny moments, visually entertaining scenes, etc.\nAnd that is exactly why Ford v Ferrari is such a good movie, it does all of the above and more, and all that is topped off with the incredible performances of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and the chemistry they manage to do between the two.\n\u00a0\u00a0The film does not lack action or humor, both are perfectly leveled, humor is not silly this is introduced in a good way, something that other films of this genre do not understand, in real life there are comic moments, people laughs, not because it is a film based on real events means that there can be no comedy, of course it can as long as it is within reason, just as the action is great, neither more nor less is not forced or anything like that, and those would be the main elements that make the film visually attractive.\nThe film does well not to put the protagonists aside, it gives the characters a touch of personality which makes them interesting, while telling their story, but let's be honest the real protagonist is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) because the film focuses more on his personal life, than that of Carroll Shelvy (Matt Damon), since it sets him the goal of overcoming himself physically and psychologically, and Ken is a true race driver, to hell with Dominic Toretto I want Ken Miles.\n But despite all that the character of Matt Damon is not far behind he also tries to overcome either because of his health problems overcome that he will not be able to compete anymore, and building a car faster than those of Ferrari at any cost.\nThe film did well by not showing Ferrari as an evil company to win, it is only a battle of companies, even when Ken wins the race at the end Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) shows his respect, one competes against another not because one is good and the other bad, but because of what all companies want money, they want to have the best product to sell, although we support Ford not because they are good or something, but by perspective, we support Ford because the protagonists are with Ford, we would support Ferrari if the protagonists were with Ferrari, in fact the closest to being a villain in this movie would be Leo Bee (Josh Lucas) who is on the side of Ford, and I say the closest because it really is not bad within reason, he just has personal problems with Ken, he doesn't like it, he doesn't want it.\n\u00a0\u00a0And speaking of Ken, I loved his death, I say it moved me, but I say I liked it because it was a great element added to the movie, I think this because it was not something that was removed from the sleeve, the problem of the brakes and of not being able to get out of the car, it had already been used previously in the film, which gives a great touch to Ken's death, it happened once I managed to survive, another happened but this time he wasnt so lucky,\nThe address, although it is not the best in the world, is great, there are several scenes that I can't think of as they were recorded, obviously if there were one with another with special effects, but in other words it is the best part of Mangold.\nActually the only complaint I have to this movie would be Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is not that I did not like the character on the contrary I like it, but the problem is that in the first act you are introduced as 3rd protagonist, but As the film progresses, it loses prominence, taking away its place of 3rd protagonist.\nIn conclusion Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019, which I really think should be nominated for best film, with a good story, interesting characters, epic moments, great performances, a great direction from Goldman and apart from its best movie, I think this movie is a good 9/10.",

The cgi was disappointing, Gran prix and Lemans movies from the 60s and 70s had much more realistic car  racing sequences where this movie had \"fast and furious \" type reality where as an example: racing at top speed, 210 mph at the cars capacity to catch a Ferrari , you inch up on him , slowly, then just as you get next to him you look over, then floor it and pull away. ? Really? How stupid does this director think we are?  Well anyway, other than that it was a very entertaining movie. Only a few well placed swear words so it's a good movie to see with your son or daughter. Great action, makes you hate the ignorance of the corporate side of big companies even more. The scene where Ford tells the line workers to go home because the a Falcon is crap and it's their fault and behind him is the bean counters and lawyers who dictated to the engineers how the car was to be built in the first place.   Ranting again, go see this movie. Very good. Don't wait until video, sound experience is awesome.",

Then you see things from Carroll Shelby's point of view it sets the mood and a bit of foreshadowing of what's to come. \nMatt Damon and Christian Bale each give earthy performances that harken back to Redford and Newman. I could easily see them in a remake of Butch and Sundance after this film. But, why wouldnt anyone want to do that? \nDamon carries himself like the Texan that Carroll Shelby was, with swagger and a convincing edge that made me believe he was who he told me he was. I can say almost the same thing for Bale, who was at his best and he drew me into Miles truth about his passion for cars and his family. \nBoth actors portrayed the men they inhabited with the same kind of passion that Shelby and Miles, at least as the film tells it, live their lives. \nI give Ford v. Ferrari 5 stars out of 5. If I were in the Motion Picture Academy I'd vote Ford v. Ferrari Best Picture because it did what a story is supposed to do and it did in several different ways. \nFord v. Ferrari created strong emotional responses in me. It made me care about the characters and their stories. From the Opening scene with Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby in a car on the road track in La Mons to poignant tentative wave Shelby gives to Miles wife at the end, I cared about these two people and the Miles family. The fact that Shelby and Miles were real-life people makes, what they have accomplished with Ford v. Ferrari, it that much more impressive to me. \nIt is witty, poignant, sad, and inspiring, all in an exciting and thoughtful way. \nI think Ford v. Ferrari is an all-time great film and could arguably go down as the greatest movie ever made, IMHO.",

            "content": "I have anticipated viewing this film for months now, I waited patiently and saw every trailer multiple times, I wanted this movie to be so good, and this movie has exceeded my high expectation, much to my pleasure. I really don't know squat about cars, nor have I ever read or even heard about the feud between Ford and Ferrari in the late '60s, but I loved this movie so much, it makes me want to look up and read the entire real-life story, It was so captivating and intriguing. This movie is never boring and never drags, it is consistently entertaining and surprisingly hilarious, I laughed way more than I thought I would, and jokes are actually very funny. Christian Bale is amazing, the best performance I have seen of his (I haven't seen American Pshyco or The Fighter) and he is so good. He is British racer Ken Miles and he uses his native accent and I loved it, he is funny and still able to be understood. His character is very likable and has a ton of heart, he is grounded and very realistic, he has his own problems and you see them, he also spends a lot of time with his son in this movie, their relationship is explored beautifully and in such a way that it invests us emotionally to Bale's character. Matt Damon is equally as funny and likable, and he gives a great performance as Carroll Shelby. I found him to be caring and he and Bale had such great chemistry together, I thoroughly enjoyed every second they were on the screen with each other, their wrestling scene was comedy gold, it was funny and it also showed how close those two were to each other, it's exactly the type of thing that I want two actors of their caliber to do when they are in the same movie. Caitriona Balfe, who I didn't know before this movie, was excellent, she was so good at her supporting role in this film, she is loving and sweet and feels like a real mother. I found her to be relevant to the plot and extremely effective in her scenes, she was committed and it paid off big time. The scene where she was street racing to get the truth out of Ken was very well done, it was wonderfully acted, it had tons of tension, and it contributed to the relationship of these two characters, it was enthralling. Jon Bernthal was great as well, he was Iacocca, who played a huge part in the real event, a businessman who wanted to help Ford win fairly; he was relevant, and he contributed to the plot very nicely, he is a great actor and I would like to see him in more movies. Josh Lucas played a real douche in this movie, but he was very well acted and you never really felt like you hated him, you see he is greedy and wants to get money any way that he can, but you can sympathize with him because of the desperate situation that Ford was in at the time. Ray Mckinnon was another very good supporting cast member, he really fit the veteran motorhead type who wanted to help younger people find success with cars, he was used nicely in this film. Noah Jupe is turning out to be one of the best child actors in Hollywood, first, it was Wonder, then A Quiet Place, and now this, he is really making a name for himself in some really great movies. He was very realistic and had a sweet relationship with Bale that blossoms during the course of this film, I loved him in this. Every supporting actor and actress in this film was amazing and that is something we rarely see nowadays, the acting in this film is top-notch and I would hope that the academy recognizes that. The racing sequences in this film are spectacular, James Mangold knew exactly how it should be done, we get close-ups every time the car is shifted, we get nice long wide shots that pan over and show us exactly what is going on, and we get to hear out loud what the racer is thinking, I know that I really felt like I was sitting in the shotgun seat right next to him experiencing it, I couldn't be more impressed with how it turned out. As with any film there some flaws, but I only have a couple of them; Jon Bernthal, who I loved in this movie, sort of disappears during the entire third act, most of this act is the Le Mans race and he didn't contribute much there, but we could've seen him in the pits or after the race, I really missed him and wish that he got more screen time. I also thought that Ken Miles death felt very rushed and just a little forced, I know that's what happened in real life so they had to do it, but they could've shown the impact of it a little more, it felt a little bit tacked on because the movie felt no desire to kill him. I loved the length of this movie, it is two and a half hours and I never once felt bored, I was constantly laughing and admiring the amazing craft on display. I also appreciate that anyone could watch this, you don't have to know about or even like cars to enjoy it, and they explain things non-motorheads wouldn't know very naturally and clearly, it never felt like they thought we were stupid or that they had to talk down to us about it, It all flowed very nicely. The script is very good too, the conversations and little banters back and forth were very fun and interesting, I loved how funny it was and how emotionally attached you were able to get because you love and admire every single character in this movie so much, it was very emotionally fulfilling, and I love those scenes as well as everything about this movie. Do not idly pass this one by, this movie needs all of the love and support that it can get and it deserves it, it is a movie for the ages that I know I will constantly go back and watch over and over again. This is easily my favorite movie of 2019 and I hope that everybody gets a chance to check it out.",

The story-line provided four stories within the main story, you have the obvious Ford VS Ferrari but there were also the stories of the friendship between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles, the corporate internal pressures that senior Ford executives exercised on Shelby and then there was the Ken Miles family story. In my opinion, the love and support that Ken his wife and son showed for each other,  demonstrated a great and accurate feel for the sacrifice that all racing families go through in order to compete in the sport that they love.  I highly recommend this movie for everyone even if you are not a die-hard racing fan.",

But it is not the usual mindless racing movie, since it succeeds in exploring the humanity of all the characters supported by the main cast's impeccable performances while also delivering some thrilling racing sequences. It is ultimately a travel in time that accurately depicts the real-life events and which will delight both car enthusiasts and cinephiles. A lot of technical language but it was only expected.

Its color sound and fury and tons of super sexy sixties sheet metal,  growling and shrieking and occasionally exploding into fireballs. \n\nAs for where it stacks up in the shallow pantheon of racing movies, its far more sophisticated  than Days of Thunder or anything in the Gone in 60 fast and furious genre, but it lacks the grit and the depth of Rush. Overall, two hours of quality filmmaking and good family fun.",

The exceptional acting talent sure does help elevate it above similar tales\u2026 as well as the brisk directing style that made those 2 \u00bd hours seem to zip by. I also appreciate the fact that the story itself takes center stage\u2014 there are no in your face politically correct narratives and social justice agendas that only serve to muddle up a perfectly good story. I wasn't aware of the events that transpired during the Le Mans race in 1966, and I think going in blindly made the movie more compelling to me. Even people who don't know anything about cars would appreciate this movie. It's a massive crowd-pleaser, and in our movie theater everyone was understandably cheering near the end.",

This is one of those special movies that's perfect for a father and son to watch together. \n\nVery tightly and well written. There were no boring moments in the movie, no sequences or shots that were used as a filler. The driving sequences, although some moments you could tell were CGI, still made you grip the sides of your seat. While some shots were actually filmed with the actual car. Both very entertaining and a thrill to watch. The cars in this movie were absolute beauties and classics.\n\nThe acting was brilliant. Christian Bale's character was my favorite, sort of playing the underdog in the story. I really fucking hated the villain of the story who was played by that one Fore executive schmuck. Before watching the movie, I couldn't really wrap my head around how it was going to be an entertaining story to watch.

He never\nseemed to run out of gears ) and his ability to slalom around cars at Daytona like\nhe had unlimited grip. Little stuff like this bothers me, especially since this was\nbuilt up as a better racing movie then Le Mans ( fantastic racing, zero plot )\n which it is not, but it's a better overall movie.

This is because the subject can get boring in a hurry for non race fans if handled poorly. This is certainly not the case here as the star powered, sharp direction keeps us moving along the entire way.\n\nWhen a sluggish 1960s American car market, and a business deal gone bad, pin the classic American car manufacturer against it's faster and more stylish Italian counter-part, it's up to car designer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his reckless driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), to deliver a victory in the 24 hour LeMans race in France. Along the way, they'll discover that the infighting inside of their own company is almost as fierce as the competition on the track.\n\nDamon and Bale play off each other really well, and Jon Bernthal (The Punisher), puts in a great third performance as Lee Iacocca, but the real star here is Director James Mangold (Logan), who puts us in the car with Bale during some awesome race scenes, while delivering some great shots of the tracks where our story plays out. The narrative also ensures we love our heroes and despise their rivals, while staying true to it's racing action.\n\nAt just over two and a half hours, the film, like the cars it features is a little heavy at times, catching some drag in the process. The film speeds past a perfect ending to give us 20 more minutes we could have done without.\n\nFord v. Ferarri is still a first place finisher and it should get it's share of attention from the award shows early next year as Damon, Bale, and Mangold all put in notable work.",

Matt Damon and Christian Bale make this a buddy movie of sorts while delivering on thrilling scenes that allow the movie to not be as predictable as one might assume at first glance. I guess I assumed we'd get more time from the Ferrari perspective, but really it's all about how the Ford Motor Company wanted to show up Ferrari and make the best racing car the world has ever seen (well at least in 1966). Additionally Damon may get top billing but really Bale morphs in our real protagonist between the two if I had to choose - I certainly cared for his character more as we get scenes with himself, his son and his wife frequently. These are minor nitpicks though, Ford v Ferrari is good enough entertainment but I can't see myself rewatching it anytime soon.",

The story is dramatic and gripping, has good tension and personal conflict to keep you interested the whole time. A few minor historical details have been changed, but its for the betterment of the story, and doesn't rewrite history completely. The period correctness of the film transports you right into 1965/66. This is a great film even for the non-car enthusiast as you can related to the heroes in the story, everyone has a challenge in their life. For any car gal/guy, you NEED to see this film.

Ford V Ferrari is an incredibly intense & compelling true story of how two men were involved in making history for the legendary Ford Motor Company against Enzo Ferrari & his racing team in the iconic 24-hour long race at Le Mans in 1966. Set in 1963, the Ford Company is struggling with car sales. To boost sales, Ford Vice President Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes to Ford owner Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) that he purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari & start the production of a sporty new Ford that would appeal to a younger generation of drivers. When Ferrari\u2019s owner Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) refuses the offer in rather insulting terms, a furious Henry II orders his racing team division to build a car, the Ford GT40, in an effort to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a former race driver, forced to retire because of a heart condition after winning the Le Mans in 1959, now runs Shelby Automobiles. He is hired by Lee Iacocca to design the perfect car to hopefully beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby enlists the help of his old friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale), an exceptional although temperamental race car driver struggling to make a living as mechanic. As Shelby & Miles are testing the Ford GT4O MK I prototype, they have worked together to create, Shelby is told by Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), a Ford executive, that drivers Phil Hill & Bruce McLaren are going to the 64\u2019 Le Mans instead Miles. Feeling humiliated by all the Fords finishing the race, Henry II is told by Shelby that despite the loss, the GT4O has put fear into Ferrari as it reached 218 mph on the Mulsanne straight & was faster than any Ferrari. Henry II tells Shelby to go kick Ferrari\u2019s ass & Shelby & Miles begin testing the GT40 MK II. Shelby tells Ford that if Miles doesn\u2019t drive & win at Le Mans, he will forfeit ownership of Shelby Automobiles. Now with everything on the line, Shelby & Miles ultimately have 24 hours to do the unthinkable by taking down the Ferrari racing team. Ford V Ferrari is directed by James Mangold from the screenplay written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, & Jason Keller. Ford V Ferrari is a true underdog story of overcoming personal demons, corporate meddling, & fierce competition. The race scenes were riveting. The performances from the cast were excellent. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Ford V Ferrari getting some award consideration. Ford V Ferrari is a MUST-SEE FILM for those who are car-lovers & anyone who wants to learn about the war between these two major car manufacturers & the iconic race that redefined them.",

He didn't have or need the range to show with family. \n\nWhen you see it this good, I can't help but want to see a limited series and spend more time with the characters...especially Phil; if any character got shorted, it was his. Would be great to see more of his underrated character but where would you put it and what would you take out? \n\nTbh, previews had me expecting Bale to ham it up a bit over the top and Mollie to be a prop and scenery. Happily, those fears were unfounded. Bale truly disappears and lands perfectly.  Mollie was a true supporting character. And what a film season for Noah Jupe! I hadn't realized he plays Bale's son, Peter, and he stars In Honey Boy. \n\nTotally recommend ESPECIALLY if you're a car or racing fan, but even if you're not. You're gonna root for the good guys. You can't help it. I second what a reviewer said about the Ford Marketing Exec having a \"totally punchable face\" - Hate that guy with the EQ of a gnat. Kinda fun to see Lee Iacocca younger and cool.",

The characters are lain out for us, they're all very on the nose and a bit boring, it feels like we've seen stories like this before and the racing element only just about keeps it afloat with well orchestrated set pieces. I found the dialogue to be a little stilted and cringey, it all seemed a bit generic and lifeless. The film sort of nicely rolls along for the first 2 hours and a bit and then it becomes a little tiresome. I did enjoy the way they tried to intertwine the human elements in with the racing and I believed in all the relationships on screen.

The first 30-45 minutes were just uninteresting to me. It was well acted but there was nothing that was keeping me interested. Once we get to the point where they are modifying the car, it gets pretty great. Christian Bale and Matt Damon do great jobs but Bale steals the show. Bale is perfectly cast and is fantastic as this angry race car driver. Both Damon and Bale have perfect chemistry and play off well with each other thanks to a pretty good script although not a perfect one. Most of the other actors did a pretty good job also. There is also some good chemistry between Bale and Noah Jupe who plays Bale's son. They also have some genuinely touching moments together. The only character I didn't like was Jon Bernthal's character. I thought he was extremely one dimensional and irritating. I thought the racing sequences in the film were fantastic. They are incredibly well shot and paced. Even though the film is based on true events, I still felt exhilarated and was on the edge of my seat. The Le Mans sequence was one of the best sequences in film that I saw so far this year. The sound mixing is pretty great also. It immerses you within the races which makes those sequences so much better. I felt the last 10 minutes of the film was pointless. I thought the film was gonna end after this desert scene that I won't spoil but it kept going on. The music was also pretty bland. Even after just seeing the film, I don't remember any of the music. Some of the other technical aspects that I liked was the cinematography. During the racing scenes, it was great and during the rest of the film, it was pretty good. The film has a couple visual effects scenes that I thought looked pretty good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a pretty good film with great racing sequences, great acting, and some good cinematography even if the first 30 minutes and last 10 minutes were generally uninteresting.",

            "content": "Showdown in France.  So in the 1960s, the Ford Motor Company decided that in addition to pumping out car after car on the assembly line, they wanted to develop a racecar that could beat Ferrari at Le Mans, which is the French city home to an annual race that lasts for 24 hours straight.  To make this happen, they have to put together not only the right vehicle but also the right team.  Now I may not be a huge fan of racing as a sport, but I do go wild for a good racing movie.  If you can put together a well-made film that can get my pulse pounding with cars going excessively fast, I'm going to absolutely be in your corner.  The trailers looked terrific, so I went into this just wanting something that is comparable to 2013's Rush, and while this is not Formula One, it is just as good in quality.  Now, this is directed by James Mangold, and while he may not be the first name you think of during award season, he's not exactly a lightweight.  He has put out some damn fine movies throughout the years, and he most certainly knows how to work with Christian Bale, who turns out yet another terrific performance as the crusty mechanic/racer savant Ken Miles.  He purposely rubs people the wrong way, so even though he is unparalleled in his field, you can 100% understand why people have it out for him.  So much of this is the relationship between him and Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon).  Because Shelby is the only one that can see past that difficult personality to the raw talent, he is the only one who knows that Miles is the right person for the job.  What I appreciate the most about Ford v Ferrari is that it takes time to build characters.  Racing is almost secondary until you get to the last hour, and let me tell you something; this is a two and a half hour movie.  I know long runtimes tend to steer audiences away, but I'm hoping that doesn't deter here because this is probably the fastest moving 150 minutes you're going to see all year.  You get a full movie filled with great performances, funny dialogue and good pacing, and then it tops everything off with two really well-executed races.  By that point, you care about these people, so you are invested in the outcome of how these cars finish.  Everybody loves a good underdog story, and this has underdogs within the overarching underdog story.  It works as a period piece and the racing is as exciting as can be; it is shot in such a way that you feel like you are right there on the track, and you can always tell exactly what is going on.  These are roles that are fun for everyone to play, and the jokes land every time comedic relief is called for.  If this movie ever pops up when I'm flipping through channels in a year or so, I will probably slip in and watch the whole movie.  Go check this out, you won't regret it.",

There are at least three scenes that show the two men as something more like brothers than just friends. One, towards the end (don't worry ... no spoilers) of the race at LeMans will stick with me forever. It is THAT good.  The supporting cast is superb as well. Finally, I saw this in an AMC Prime theater and it was worth twice the extra money I paid for the ticket for the racing scenes, which are stunning. Definitely a must-see even if you're not a fan of racing movies.",

            "content": "A great little bio pic about how Ford entered into the world of international racing by building the legendary Ford GT40 to compete with Ferrari during the 24 hours Le Mans race in France. The movie opens with Ford trying to actually purchase Ferrari (who recently had just gone bankrupt), but Ferrari backs out when Fiat gives a much better deal. Realizing that Ferrari never intended for Ford to buy them and had just used them to get more money from Fiat, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) instructs his inner circle to find the best engineers and designers to make a car that will beat Ferrari. In comes Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon). Shelby owns Shelby America who makes custom cars as well as competes in smaller races. Shelby himself is the only American to ever win the Le Mans several years back, but had to quit because of a heart condition. Shelby signs on and brings with him the best driver he has Ken Miles (Christian Bale). Ken is kind of a wild guy that is very much a talented driver, but has a very strong opinion of just about everything. He's not really the ideal \"Ford\" driver and therefore clashes with the suits in charge of Ford. Together Shelby and Ken have to somehow overcome the suits of Ford picking at everything and still develop the best car the worlds ever seen. So, yeah I liked this one a lot. The movie has a cool story and although I knew the outcome already ahead of time I enjoyed how it's told. The characters are interesting and the two leads in Damon and Bale do a great job here. The racing scenes are really well done as well. It creates very high tension moments and it seems like a lot was done practically. I will say the movie is very long at 2 and a half hours long, but I enjoyed the pacing and didn't think it was slow at any time. The film is a great story and I liked especially how it's not just a movie that is glorifying Ford. It shows that Ford and Ferrari are both companies and have money and fame on the mind. Ford itself seems to only be doing it because they feel embarrassed, but Henry Ford II seems like a joke. While Ferrari is in it because of the passion of racing and their own pride. The main focus here is Miles and Shelby and it succeeds in that. I would highly recommend checking this one out!",

            "content": "Racing could be considered an art form in the same vein as movies. And Hollywood has taken notice. Over the past century, Hollywood has managed to churn out quite a lot of films with the subject of racing being involved. And one of the newer films to feature racing in a rather addicting entertainment form, is \"Ford v Ferrari\", the historical feature about how the Ford Motor Company built a car fast enough to beat Ferrari at the famous Le Mans raceway. Directed by James Mangold, and starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, the film explores the lives of two professional car enthusiasts, who want to earn that fame and glory alongside Ford. While there are some factual errors as this is a film, they are only minor, ad the rest of the film is a great and amazing thrill ride; especially for the ears. \"Ford v Ferrari\" is a movie that only people who enjoy cars and racing will enjoy.\n\nThe story focuses on two very different individuals: Carroll Shelby (Damon), and Ken Miles (Bale). Shelby is a former racer that now sells racecars to the general public. Shelby is a mechanic going through some financial difficulties. Shelby gets approached by the Ford Motor Company to build him a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, With the help of Miles, Carroll and Ken decide to make racing history by proving that the Americans are better racers than the Italians.\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" is a great and spectacular film.\n\nThe story is engaging, and keeps the viewer interested throughout is nearly two and a half hour run time. Everything that happens on the screen is fascinating, This is all thanks to the editing by three individuals: Andrew Buckland, Michael McCusker, and Dirk Westervelt. These three guys managed to create a truly exciting film for people to view.\n\nThe cinematography by Phedon Papamichael looks absolutely amazing. The movie looks like it was from the 1960s, and it feels like the 1960s. Phedon did a really great job making this movie look good.\n\nWhat really sells this film is the sound. Everything, from the sound mixing and sound editing, is really perfected here. All of the mechanics and noises are heard. And the racing. Every little detail that goes into the racing is implemented here. It feels like one is actually in the car while the driving is taking place.\n\nThe cast is great as well. Both Damon and Bale deliver great performances. But it is Bale who truly shines. He may not get top billing, but this is definitely one of his best performances ever.\n\nFinally, the direction by Mangold is absolutely stunning. He manages to create a great deal of tension between the characters presented here. And all of the scenes are blocked perfectly. Plus, Mangold directs the actors with sense of realism, and there is a sense of friendship being delivered within their performances. Mangold is truly rising up to become one of the best directors of all time.\n\nThe only criticism that the film brings up is with its history. Yes, this is a work of fiction, but a lot of the stuff presented here is fictionalized. But this the only major criticism that I found while watching the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is a racing fan's dream come true, and will definitely bring out a lot enjoyment from anyone who enjoys a little fast speed with their entertainment. Step on the gas, and see this movie for yourself.",

            "content": "The definition of \u201cidyllic\u201d is spending childhood summers in the 1950s and 60s at a small Sierra Nevada logging town in the remote outskirts of Fresno County. Unless I wanted to spend three months swimming, fishing, building forts and roasting marshmallows by myself, whoever emerged from the cabins scattered around the mill were my new best friends. And those best friends were all boys from Central Valley towns where car racing reigned supreme, mostly NASCAR but formula, drag, off-road, touring, sports\u2014if it involved four wheels, it commanded attention. Add in stacks of Motor Sports magazines and raging Ford vs Chevy arguments while passing greasy wrenches back and forth, tinkering with a Willys Jeep and you have a good flavor of mill life. Watching Ford v Ferrari was a throwback to those times. I could practically feel the grease and smell the burnt rubber! A life lesson on power and the powerful unfolds as we sit, students of history watching two international titans clash, America\u2019s proud yet ruthless Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) taking on Italy\u2019s regal yet derisive Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Two renown automakers stake their brand and their reputation on winning Le Mans, a 24 hour contest for man and machine, the \u201cGrand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency.\u201d In 1966 it becomes the ultimate match race between perennial winner Ferrari and upstart competitor Ford. Loyalty and brotherhood, treachery and deceit, it\u2019s all there. Win. Just win. Shifting Team Ford into high gear is talented, passionate, straight-shooting expert car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) always strutting around in his black cowboy hat, matched with cocky, hotheaded, confident, driver par excellence Ken Miles (Christian Bale), forming an entrepreneurial and fearless duet who, curiously enough, are making their first paired film debut in this rip-roaring true story. The Shelby/Miles bromance works perfectly in ratcheting up drama interspersed with comedic exchanges including a hilarious fistfight that so amuses Ken\u2019s wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) that she unfolds a chair to better watch them roll around on the lawn, until she graciously fetches them cold sodas while they catch their breath lying side by side in the yard. The chemistry between Damon and Bale hold the movie together from the starting gun through the checkered flag. Their on screen relationship, although tumultuous at times, is deeply defined by mutual respect. Two mere mortals, one Brit, one American, share rare membership in the elite \u201cperfect lap\u201d club, who understand 7,000 RPMS as a spiritual experience. \u201cThere\u2019s a point at 7,000 RPMs where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It disappears. All that\u2019s left, a body moving through space, and time. At 7,000 RPM, that\u2019s where you meet it. That\u2019s where it waits for you.\u201d The film runs long at 2 1/2 hours and could have been shortened while not losing a beat by cutting out Mollie and Ken\u2019s young son, Peter (Noah Jupe). Their roles are undeveloped and unnecessary to plot development. Carroll and Ken offer enough of the family feel. Ford Company executives Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) try to muscle in between Carroll and Miles to no avail. The Iacocca role holds up as an insider ally to Carroll but Beebe as the story\u2019s contemptuous villain is a loss leader to nowhere. He can go. Men dominate the screen at least 98% of the time reflecting the industry and era. Probably still holds true. The racing sequences drop you directly into the drivers seat at track level with thundering decibels and breathtaking speeds. When I drove away from the theater I revved my 4 cylinder Honda into high gear and blew right past a Toyota! The thrill of victory and all that heady stuff. Ford v Ferrari is an instant classic. If you are a racing fan, you\u2019ll love the energy of this film. If you are a connoisseur of cinematography, you\u2019ll enjoy the technical savvy. If you are an observer of human behavior, you\u2019ll appreciate the intuitive depth. Ford v Ferrari may be the racing movie equivalent of the perfect lap. As Ken Miles asks, \u201cDo you see it?\u201d Seeing this movie may be the closest way of answering yes",

The scene stealer, though, is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, a hardened business mogul who at his core, wants to produce a truly great car.  Behind the camera, director James Manigold delivers an epic but surprising fast paced story (despite being 2 and half hours, it never drags) with some great racing sequences and human drama.  Most interesting is how the creates a conflict, as the film is essentially about two rival car company's, by focusing on the mechanics and drivers who made it possible.  The end result is one of the best and most entertaining movies this year, and one I fully expect to be represented at Oscar season.",

I loved the acting and i do think both actors must have like each other greatly to pull it off & exude the warmth they portrayed and humor.  My fiance is a huge classic car fan and we been to tons of car shows & of all t he cars i always just adore the Cobra .. This is a movie i'd buy so that gives it my 5 star rating, and also i like the underling message.. that you can see what 2 great men's passion for what they love.. gives such pleasure and success in comparison to the coldness of corporations and greed or money making .. Passion is what gives happiness and fulfillment that money can't buy. Love the relationship of Miles and had wondered on Shelby's lack of partner in the film & as a little side.. i read a synopsis of his life that he married 7 times!!",

            "content": "Do you remember a time when movies were fun? The rush of excitement during the film\u2019s climax, the bitter-sweet tears of an emotional conclusion, the laughs of a well-setup joke? You get out of your seat, use the bathroom, get to your car, and talk endlessly with your movie-mate about all the great things you just watched? That\u2019s what I experienced this last weekend at the Ford v Ferrari IMAX showing. \n\nFord v Ferrari is directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Logan), and it stars Matt Damon (Bourne Series) and Christian Bale (Dark Knight series). The film is based on the real story of the Ford Motor Company, headed by Henry Ford II, looking to beat the sales of the seemingly unstoppable General Motors. He tells his workers to come to him with an idea, or don\u2019t come back to work. Ford\u2019s Marketing Manager Lee Iacocca, played by Jon Bernthal (Netflix\u2019s Punisher, The Walking Dead), says that sales are determined by which company wins the biggest races. His idea? To beat the unbeatable Ferrari in the biggest race in the world, The 24 Hours of Le Mans. Iacocca enlists one of the only Americans to win the race, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), to build him a car. Shelby tells Iacocca that it takes more than speed it takes a good driver. Shelby then recruits his longtime racing associate Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help build and test the car for him since Shelby can\u2019t race due to health reasons. What follows is a battle of science, speed, and corporate intervention where all roads lead to the 24 Hour endurance test at Le Mans. Will Shelby risk his entire livelihood on one driver, and will Miles prove his worth to his family and the world?\n\nWhat I immediately loved about this movie is its cinematography. It looks, sounds, and feels like a 1960\u2019s garage. You can practically smell the oil and grease. I\u2019m not necessarily a car guy. I love a beautiful car like any other person, and the revving of an engine is awesome, but I don\u2019t care what type of engine it is or what shape of headlight came with what model. What might turn a few people away is the almost three-hour run time. Did I have to take multiple restroom breaks? Yes. Did the movie feel like three hours? No. The fast-paced dialogue and action set a nice pace that never felt like a chore to sit through. \n\nWe sat down dead center in the IMAX Theater, popcorn and sodas in hand. From the opening logos, you hear the roaring of engines, and then a hard cut of a first person perspective of a car zooming down a dark rain-covered road with headlights illuminating only a few feet ahead. Immediately I was blown away by the loud rich sound of the IMAX speakers putting you into the driver\u2019s seat. Every time an engine revved and a tire screeched, it was glorious and made your heart race. For the sound design alone, this is a must-own. But what makes this movie unique from others in its genre is the characters and realism. Movies like the Fast and the Furious series focus on spectacle and explosions, hot girls, exotic cars, contemporary music. Ford v Ferrari uses visual and audio aesthetics of 1960\u2019s America to place you in that time period without using tired conventional methods (Rolling Stones music anyone?). There\u2019s almost no 60\u2019s music here, only original score, which works in the movie\u2019s favor. Too many times do we see period movies focus too much on reminding you which era you\u2019re in instead of just telling the story. Thankfully, Mangold is a great storyteller.\n\nWhat really stands out here is the acting. Everyone here nails their performance. The standout being Bale as Miles. Once again he transformed his body after gaining a ton of weight to play Dick Cheney in Vice, and lost it all to play Miles. He claims he\u2019s done doing that, but we\u2019ll have to see. His relationship with the Ford Corporation and his wife and kid are what tug on your heartstrings. He\u2019s so likable all you want is to see him succeed. His pure passion for driving is what brings this movie its fun factor.  He perfectly plays off of Damon\u2019s dry southern humor and you can tell Miles loves cars and speed. All he wants is to prove he\u2019s the one to win Le Mans. Damon does a great job portraying Shelby, and his arc is the one that drives the relationship between Miles and the suites at Ford.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a car nut to enjoy this film. Same reason you don\u2019t have to be a chef to love the taste of fine dining. It has fun with the source material and leaves you with a smile on your face during the credits. I think the standout here is Bale and awards will surely be coming his way. Is it a little long? Sure, but you're so enthralled with the action that you never think about looking at your watch.",

American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. First of all, Matt Damon and Christian Bale sharing the big screen together makes the movie itself so funny and exhilarating. They really have great chemistry. The film is 2hr 32min, credits included. You will not feel its runtime; the film\u2019s editing and pacing is so good, thanks to Mangold\u2019s directing, screenwriting, and editor\u2019s Andrew Buckland, Michael McCusker, and Dirk Westervelt. The editing is very Oscar-worthy and so is the film\u2019s sound design and Bale\u2019s performance. The racing sequences are really one of the film\u2019s most fun with the beautiful shots by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael. Also, I can\u2019t wait to listen to Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders\u2019 musical score, it\u2019s really good (particularly, during the climactic Le Mans race). Like I said, Bale\u2019s performance, editing, and sound design are definitely Oscar-worthy. This is another big win for director James Mangold. One of the best movies of 2019! 8.2/10.",

Ferrari is a retelling of the Ford company's attempts to compete with Ferrari in building racing cars and win the Le Mans race and the designer and driver behind getting the tasks done. This is just a really well put together, well written movie that looks at the passion for something in contrast with the constraints of the business world.\n\nThe direction on this is tight. It looks nice and the pacing is pretty smooth for a two-and-a-half hour movie. Director James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) really knows how to make scenes visually interesting, throwing in little stuff. Though there isn't really that much racing in this, the race at Le Mans really pays off your expectations.\n\nMatt Damon and Christian Bale are the leads in this, the former being the guy who tries to work within the system and the latter being the guy who can't. Matt Damon gives a fine performance, but it's Bale who steals every scene he's in. The famously versatile actor completely sells the character of driver Ken Miles, both brash but charismatic. I'll be very surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination. To be honest, the casting even to the smallest characters is pretty darn good. Props should be given to Tracy Letts as tough, intimidating boss Henry Ford II.\n\nThe only weak spot I found, and it's more of a knitpick, is that they could've cut down on the scenes of Miles interacting with his family. It's good stuff, but it can be a little repetitive.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this.",

            "content": "Ford V Ferrari is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. It's an absolutely thrilling film that fires on all cylinders.\n\nFerrari dominates the annual 24-hour race at Le Mans for much of the 1960s. Ford decides to throw their hat in the ring, in hopes that a victory at Le Mans will raise their struggling sales. The former racer turned car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt Damon) and his difficult, but passionate racer pal Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are both brought on to help Ford craft a car to get to the finish line.\n\nBeneath the technical polish and gloss of Ford V Ferrari, the friendship between Shelby and Miles is the heart of the film. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are a large part of what makes this film work so well. This is their first movie together and yet, they interact with the ease of old friends. Their performances complement each other. You get really invested in this on-screen duo with an absurd amount of charm exuding from the screen.\n\nWe all love a good underdog and this film is a classic underdog story. Ford V Ferrari isn't just about the race at Le Mans, but more about the human struggles encountered to get there. Pride and jealousy constrict Miles and Shelby at times, but the rigid corporate system of Ford Motor Company poses a greater challenge. Ford V Ferrari is an expansive, mesmerizing real-life story that feels perfect for the cinematic medium.\n\nFord V Ferrari puts you in the driver's seat with the racers, but not in the way I was expecting. The stellar sound design and mixing are some of the best and extremely transportive. They give the racing sequences not just an immersive quality, but a transcendent one. James Mangold's direction is excellent. He gives you sequences that put you on the edge of your seat and capture your gaze. More so, Mangold has a strong grasp on pacing. The film knows when to slow down and emphasize character and emotion and when to boost its engine and hightail it to the next scene. In a film this long, it's remarkable that it feels as breezy as it does. Even if you know this story start to finish, the skill, technically and narrative in which it's told make this ride one easily worth taking.\n\nI recommend Ford V Ferrari for ages 7 to 14 for language. Even if you're not a race car fanatic, there's a good chance you'll love this film. I happily give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is easily one of my favorites of the year.\n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst.org",

            "content": "Christian Bale's newest acting transformation shocks by not shocking this time around as the English actor retains a natural physical look and instead captures Miles' character from the inside out. Miles' love for the sport, and more notably his family comes across marvelously through Bale's performance, especially when in conjunction to his onscreen family of Noah Jupe and the excellent supporting Caitriona Balfe. Though Matt Damon also does a solid job as Shelby alongside a good secondary cast, it's Bale's performance that elevates the film with a greater emotional resonance.\n\nMangold also cranks up what's otherwise a fairly standard sports underdog movie with a visceral directing style that does the vicious rush of the racing track exhilarating justice. With blaring sound design and Mangold's heart-pounding cinematic vision relentlessly pushing eleven, the line between athletic glory and life-ending disaster furiously oscillates without ever letting up\u2014I was consistently hitting the brakes of my imaginary car throughout my screening of the film.",

The perfect male lead actors to portray these real life characters and the young boy is amazing. The only weak link in the acting is the female lead. She simply is not up to the level of her co-stars. The movie itself does not feel over 2 hours. In fact I felt so connected to the characters and got to know them, that I wanted even more. I found myself hiding my tears as I felt their emotions and how passionate they were about cars and their friendship. Go see this movie. We need more like this. And it has an incredible amount of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Movie making at its best. More please.",

One perfect lap.\n\nFord V Ferrari\n\nThe director James Mangold is deservedly and in my case surprisingly in the lead in the Oscar race for the Best Direction trophy. And I am including the best of this year's most controlled films. There are many indie films that packs a linear, safer and comforting punch than this at-times-commercial-yet-fully-artsy drama. I have never seen him so confident and empowering on screen. And not to forget his large chunk of the film spends time on the road, in the run, at the face of Bale's snide-y looks that resembles to me with that mysterious Alfred Borden way of scanning out from The Prestige.\n\nWith a whoosh the film goes by like the Ferrari(!) and speaks mostly, structure wise, a pretty standard tale. Not at all biography but sports alike, the film feels. You are aware of where and how things would go and yet Mangold insists to you to experience these moments with this incredibly rich cast. Those tiny moments where it flowers you with flood of imaginative thoughts and ideas that scares and educates you, is the best asset of the film.\n\nThe nuanced performance then and then only emerges up, visible to the naked eye, teary eye by then. The helps that Matt Damon provides, the rejoicing moment between a husband and a wife after landing a well paid job and Christian Bale's performance staged, framed, mostly around his face, are the moments where you go through a religious experience of discovering cinema in a nail-biting match about patience. Another thing about Ford V Ferrari that caught me by surprise was how both the lead roles were actually underdog characters. That doesn't happen everywhere. No one dares.",

            "content": "I don't care one lick about cars and I was greatly entertained by Ford vs. Ferrari, a thrilling look back where the gear-heads at Ford wanted to build a new model of racing car that could challenge the seemingly unbeatable Italians at the Le Mans raceway. The smartest move the movie makes is placing this as a character-driven story with a group of big personalities solving a puzzle and trying to prove the arrogant suits wrong. It has such winning elements that it's got crowd-pleaser DNA all over it, even if you'll likely predict every step of the story. Even if you know nothing about the history of racing and motor vehicles, you can suspect that designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) will, through grit and confidence and outside-the-box thinking, overcome their obstacles to win the 1966 Le Mans race. The movie even realizes this, and that's why the climax of the movie isn't whether or not Ford will triumph but on a very personal dilemma and choice. It's less about the mechanics of cars and more about simply solving problems with innovative solutions, and there's a great satisfaction in watching characters we care about get closer to solving a puzzle that has outwitted the masses. As the characters get excited, we get excited because the personal is what is felt most. Miles is an arrogant, disgraced driver that Ford doesn't want being the face of anything for the company. Shelby is trying to transition from being in a car to the head of a company, and he's the heat shield for his team, taking the corporate ire and laying more and more on the line for their experiments. Damon is great, and sounds uncannily like Tommy Lee Jones, but this is chiefly Bale's movie and he is fantastic. He once again just disappears into a character, this time the lanky, cocky, hard-driving family man, and the scenes with Miles' wife and son actually provide important dimension to all the participants. They aren't simply there to express concern or admiration. The screenplay by the Butterworth brothers (Edge of Tomorrow) and Jason Keller (Machine Gun Preacher) have opened up these characters, their fear, anxieties, hopes, and dreams in a way that feels genuine and considerate. They hook us in with the characters early, so that the rest of the film serves as a series of payoffs for our investment. The racing sequences are thrilling as director James Mangold (Logan) has his camera career around the cars, placing the audience in the middle of the RPMs and feeling that immersive sense of speed. I never knew that the Le Mans race is 24 hours long, and the scene of these 1960s cars, with 1960s windshield wiper technology, driving in the rain and dark at 200 miles-per-hour is starkly terrifying. I still don't care much about cars or their history, but you present me engaging characters and Oscar-caliber performances to boot, and I'll watch those people anywhere. Ford vs. Ferrari is a bit long (150 minutes) but a well-crafted, potent crowd-pleaser with exhilarating racing and strong characters worthy of cheering.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

At the end of the test drive that Ford II takes with Carroll Shelby (Damon), Letts breaks down in a hilarious but completely believable way.  Everyone in the audience burst out laughing at this great piece of acting!\n\nThe POV scenes from the race car driver's perspective were illuminating, powerful and frightening (at least for a +5 speed limit driver like myself).  The sets were believable and made you feel as if you were in the 1960s.\n\nDon't let the subject matter keep you away!  This is a great movie!",

This movie is good 100 percent up until the last 10 minutes of the movie which isn\u2019t the movies fault but the history of this event and some actions that happened in real life and I know the direction of this movie is supposed to be historically accurate but man it\u2019s just a huge disappointment. All this built up , working hard and it leads up to ken milles dying, are you serious bro. This movie could have been one of the greats of 2019 but lost because he died off in the background and also because he lost the big race. At first I was a little disappointed that he lost but I understood why he did that but him dying in the background of the movie ending the movie on a sad note is terrible. Leaving the theater I just felt let down and I don\u2019t know what the director intended but this is not a happy movie and I will never watch this movie again. I just wished it ended differently because the first 2 hours and 20 something minutes were flat out awesome but man those last 10 minutes can make or break a movie. If the middle 10 minutes sucked then I could forgive that but the ending nah. Christian bale deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. Academy just give it to bale already. He was hands down the best part of this movie and brought the character to life and made it so special. ",

            "content": "From James Mangold, the director of Logan, comes a biopic based off of the Ford company competing against Ferrari in the 1966 Le Mans race. With a cast like Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Josh Lucas, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe and a young talent in Noah Jupe, my excitement was at an all time high for this film. I'm happy to say, this was one of the best films I've seen all year. \n\nI have not had this much fun at a movie in such a long time. I had a smile on my face just about the entire run-time. This is a charming, exciting, and often hilarious story brought to the big screen. Christian Bale may have given his best performance ever as Ken Miles. He has so many hilarious lines of dialogue and the way he delivers them was just the icing on the cake. Matt Damon was also terrific like he usually is and also had some hilarious lines. The racing sequences were just flat out exhilarating to watch and were filmed in some beautiful wide-shots. There was a great father and son relationship dynamic that was established and it really worked and made for a very emotionally satisfying arc throughout the film. I absolutely loved the song choices chosen for this movie. It wasn't the cliche songs we've heard a hundred times in every mediocre film nowadays. The editing was fantastic as well. You have to hand it to the editing crew for really making the race sequences flow naturally and in a way to not confuse viewers as to where the racers are in the race. I also found this movie surprisingly touching in the end. No spoilers of course because I was unaware of the real events and how they turned out but when this film wrapped up, there was definitely an emotional feeling in me. \n\nI have but one issue in this movie and it's just the pacing in the second act jumps ahead very quickly and unexpectedly. Usually films use title cards when going back to a certain year or date but this film didn't which made it a little confusing for me and it made the movie move a little too fast. \n\nAll in all, I had an absolute blast watching this movie. I cannot wait to see it again and if Bale and Damon aren't nominated for Oscars for this movie, I won't be surprised, but I'll be mad at the same time. Definitely check this one out and I'm going to give Ford v Ferrari, an A",

I guess they couldn't find a cat that would do that in front of the cameras lol.  \n\nGreat movie!  Go see it in theaters so you actually feel the slight rush of speeding down a race track in a GT40.  \n\nIf you happen to live in Colorado, go watch the movie and then go see the cars in Longmont at the Shelby American Collection Car museum.

It was very good about car racing, which has always bored me as not much of a sport.  Hard to believe a 24 hour race.  I learned much more about it.  And now want to look up more, especially to find out about what was true, because some of it must have been made up.  I mean, who punches somebody in the nose like that, & then they have a nice little scuffle and they're still friends.  And was that driver really such a jerk?

He made probably the best X-Men film when the franchise was exhausted and got me enjoying a Western (2007's 3:10 To Yuma), a genre that's nowhere near my favourite; and now, re-teaming with Yuma's Christian Bale, he's done it again with a motor-racing film. Charting the origin of and the events leading up to the titular race that defines the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari (hence its US title), I was surprised as to how engaged and thrilled I was, despite not being part of the Top Gear/sports film crowd it'll indubitably appeal to. Perhaps it's because I'm practically superglued to the edge of my seat watching racing sequences that's executed in a visceral and cinematically intelligent manner, while their sound mixing engineers are surely frontrunners come Oscar time. Or perhaps it's the rather moving and affecting bromantic friendship between American car designer Carroll Shelby (a solid yet charming Matt Damon) and British driver/mechanical genius Ken Miles (in another uniquely immersive performance by Bale, who's English but locked in a battle with an unlocatable English accent here). The 152mins literally flew by for me, aided by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders' light and jazzy score that gives it a breezy caper movie feel as we watch Shelby and Miles gallantly fending off the suits from Ford to stay true to their artistry. Co-written by Jez Butterworth, the script is smart and authentic yet remains accessible to an audience unfamiliar with the jargon (even if sometimes dialogue recapping or stating the obvious in case some audience got lost can feel a little jarring). There's no doubt the film is at its most adrenalin-fuelled best during the racing sequences but this slick and technically proficient film also has a big heart beating underneath it all.",

I don't exactly like most racing movies, I usually can't get into them, and this one was no different.  I still haven't even seen Days of Thunder so, needless to say, I am probably not the target audience but I am a Michigander and Detroit, Dearborn, and even Ford Motor are all kinda ingrained to my soul.\n\n- 1/2 point(9 1/2 of 10) because no movie is perfect until it convinces me it might be.    \n\n- 1/2 point(9 of 10) because it's just not as good as the one racing movie I truly like and hold in high regard - Rush.\n\n- 1/2 point(8 1/2 of 10) for the title and the way the story is portrayed.  It was titled Ford v Ferrari which implies there is a \u2018good guy' and a \u2018bad guy' but it was more like Bad Guy vs. The Bad Guy's Bad Guy.'  If you are expecting a movie that casts Ford in a positive light then you will be disappointed.  I left the movie thinking, wow, Ford Motor... what a bunch of stupid assholes.  \n\n- 1/2 point(8 of 10) because there is no one likeable in the movie.  You don't want to see Ferrari win, you don't want to see Ford win, you don't want to see Caroll Shelby win, you don't mind seeing Ken Miles win but... well, I guess you'll just have to see it for yourself.\n\n- 1/2 point(7 1/2 of 10) because I felt the leads were miscast.  Ken Miles was almost as annoying as the cackling hags sitting a few rows up, and both his wife and child could have been featured far less.  This is a very niche story and movie that they tried to make appealing to broader audiences with those other characters, and the big names they cast, and other elements of the story that had a fairly good amount of Hollywood spin on it.    \n\n- 1/2 point(7 of 10) because the final race was a letdown.  I was really expecting more from the race scenes.  If you're expecting a racing movie you will be disappointed.  This is more Tucker: The Man and His Dream than it is Rush.  \n\n- 1/2 point(6 1/2 of 10) for the soundtrack.  At this point I think they're just trolling people.  You think something good is about to start playing in the background to give the film some pop or evoke some emotion but then it just drops straight off a cliff and becomes some lesser known riff.\n\nI did not find this movie enjoyable and probably never will, but... like I said there are elements of it ingrained to the fabric of my being.\n\n6 1/2 of 10(3 of 5 for RT purposes)",

The tension this movie gives you with out it being forced is without a doubt the ride a car movie should be giving you and Ford v Ferrari delivers that and more with an absolutely stellar performance from Matt Damon and Christian Bale.\n\nNow of course no film is perfect and I am known for nitpicking a movie to death however this movie I only have one problem. There was not enough Ferrari there should have been more focus on the arrogance of Ferrari and how they did not respect Ford (the company).\n\nThe movie with that missing comes off as a Trojan horse to what the real title of the movie should have been and maybe it was their real intention to show this which is \"Shelby/Miles v Ford\" these two men used passion and drive (no pun intended) to make a car that would beat Ferrari and win the 24 hours at Le Mans despite the fact that ford (the suits) could only think of image. Truly inspiring\n\nThe moral take away from this movie is that pride while can be a driving force should not be used 100% of the time or it will ruin you. The engine that keeps you running will take too much pride and blow out. (Okay no more car references).\n\nThe rating ( 9/10 )",

With his latest feature, Mangold has crafted an exhilarating dramatization of the Le Mans car race. Using gorgeous cinematography, Mangold crafts the most exciting car race sequences of the year. Shot with precision and an eye for detail, the car race sequences are arguably the highlight of the movie. Each sequence keeps viewers wound in a state of suspense and tension. Aside from excelling behind the camera, Mangold draws excellent performances from his leading stars. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are sensational in the lead roles, creating a real-life friendship that feels utterly believable. Bale is one of those actors that commits every ounce of his energy to his roles, and here he proves it. Intense, charismatic and passionate, he excels in the role of a committed race-car driver. Damon, on the other hand, delivers one of the best performances of his career. Charming, comical and witty, he creates a compelling portrait of a real-life businessman. Although \"Ford v Ferrari\" is undeniably entertaining, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. At nearly two and a half hours, it is really long and suffers from a lengthy running time. Director James Mangold keeps the film moving at an engaging pace, but it does drag at times. For a car racing movie, it takes an unusually long time to get to the finish line. Nevertheless, fans of car racing will definitely enjoy \"Ford v Ferrari\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment this fall season. Even if it is slightly long, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is an immensely enjoyable film that is worth seeing for its car racing sequences alone.",

Shelby is the inspired engineer.  Miles is the irascible wildcard.  Henry Ford II is the cutthroat Man of Industry \u2026 and they even give him a sniveling bulldog lackey.\n\nThe second half of the film picks up the pace and is considerably more engaging.  Mangold does a fine job filming the racing scenes, choosing just the right balance of different viewpoints and cuts.  Beyond that, he thankfully spares audiences from the awful \"shaky camera effect\" that some filmmakers would've used anytime they wanted to ramp up the action on screen.\n\nGiven that the \u201824 Hours of Le Mans' race is indeed twenty-four hours long, Mangold also excels at keeping an even pace down the final stretch, not relying too much on either the racing or the off track drama, but rather striking an even balance between the two.",

Shelby is enlisted by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to create a car that could end the domination of Ferrari at the iconic French 24 hour race. It's a classic \u2018mine's bigger than yours' battle he has with Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) that's complicated by his efforts to, as Shelby tells him is the wrong way, win a race by committee. Simply put Ford's team of goons doesn't like Miles. The 155 minute running time is a stretch but thankfully it doesn't drag and the film is aided by a masterclass from Bale. This man is a freak of an actor! And the rapport he has with Damon is important. You can see it in the scene where the two scuffle. Great quality film, a good mix of serious and light moments and very enjoyable too. Well worth seeing.",
