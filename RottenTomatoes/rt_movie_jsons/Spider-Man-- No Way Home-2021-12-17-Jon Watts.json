Un excelente elenco y toda una avalancha de buenos efectos especiales y escenas de acci\u00f3n, esta pel\u00edcula logra cumplir las expectativas de los fans de Spider-Man. El punto m\u00e1s fuerte de esta pel\u00edcula es sin duda la nostalgia de quienes crecieron con las pel\u00edculas de Tobey McGuire y Andrew Garfield. A ellos se les ha otorgado una nueva oportunidad y muchos de los actores de los villanos han logrado mantenerse fieles a sus personajes despu\u00e9s de a\u00f1os. El guion puede ser cuestionable, pero eso deja de tener importancia alguna. Esta pel\u00edcula es una experiencia emocionante que solo los verdaderos fans de Spider-Man o Marvel saben apreciar. Mi calificaci\u00f3n final para esta pel\u00edcula es un 10/10.",

Make no mistake, I didn't hate the previous actors and their turn as the web-slinger, quite the opposite. I just feel Holland's natural persona and charisma fit better for the character. So... (I figure the cat is out of the bag by now) the inclusion of the previous iterations of Spider-Man in No Way Home, something ripped straight from the comics, was a no-brainer. DC and Warner Bros. have used actors to reprise roles in TV projects for years now, so the concept isn't new, but seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back in screen as their versions of Peter Parker/Spider-Man felt special. But they didn't stop there. They also brought back Molina, Foxx and Defoe to reprise their iconic villain roles and even Charlie Cox to reprise his role as Matt Murdock Netflix's Daredevil. With this many cameos, one could be forgiven for letting the story fall by the wayside, but actually, the movie benefited from their inclusion. So, if you haven't seen the movie, I recommend it.",

            "content": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home is a thrilling and emotional conclusion to Tom Holland's trilogy as the friendly neighborhood hero. The film picks up where Far From Home left off, with Peter Parker's identity exposed to the world by Mysterio. Desperate to undo this mess, Peter turns to Doctor Strange for help. However, when Strange's spell goes wrong, Peter must face five deadly villains from other universes\u2013the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Electro, Sandman and Lizard\u2013while also trying to protect his loved ones and his future. In the film, we see Peter Parker (Tom Holland) teaming up with previous Spider-Man versions played by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire to stop villains from other universes.\"\n\n\"The film is a spectacular showcase of action, humor and heart, with stunning visual effects and a brilliant cast. Holland delivers his best performance yet as Spider-Man, showing his growth as a hero and a person. He is supported by Zendaya as MJ, Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, and Marisa Tomei once again stealing the show as Aunt May. The cast members have great chemistry and moments with each other. The film also features the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as their respective versions of Spider-Man, creating an epic crossover that fans have been dreaming of. The three Spideys share a wonderful bond and camaraderie, while also bringing their own unique personalities and experiences to the table.\"\n\n\"The film also does justice to the villains, who are more than just CGI monsters. Willem Dafoe steals the show as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, reprising his role from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). He is menacing, manipulative, and tragic, posing a serious threat to Peter both physically and mentally. Alfred Molina also shines as Dr. Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, who gets a chance to redeem himself after being corrupted by his tentacles in Spider-Man 2 (2004). Jamie Foxx has a more prominent role and personality as Max Dillon/Electro than he did in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), while Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans reprise their roles as Flint Marko/Sandman and Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard, respectively. Additionally, the film's stunning visuals bring the various Spider-Man universes to life, with the special effects being particularly noteworthy. The pacing is also well done, with the film's action sequences being expertly choreographed and executed.\"\n\nDirector Jon Watts has done an excellent job in crafting a film that will please both die-hard fans of the comics and casual audiences alike. The film's themes of responsibility and redemption are well handled, and the inclusion of characters from previous films adds a sense of nostalgia to the proceedings. The film's finale is particularly satisfying and leaves audiences eager for more.\n\nOverall, though, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is an ambitious and satisfying finale that pays homage to the past while looking forward to the future. It is a must-see for fans of the franchise and superhero movies in general. The film is masterfully crafted, expertly balancing action, emotion, and humor. It will leave you feeling exhilarated and emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The movie balances fan service with storytelling, delivering surprises that are earned rather than forced. It celebrates what makes Spider-Man such a beloved character: his courage, compassion, and responsibility. It also reminds us that being Spider-Man comes with a price \u2013 a price that Peter must be willing to pay if he wants to be true to himself. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is a film that has truly resonated with me, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great cinematic experience.",

            "content": "Tom Holland's third and potentially final outing as the webbed hero is the epitome of fan service that takes Peter Parker on an emotional journey of loss and sacrifice. Jon Watts provides Marvel fans with a multiverse-sized event that manages to inject intense emotion into a high-octane franchise.\n\nContinuing from the end of \u2018Spider-Man: Far From Home', \u2018Spider-Man: No Way Home' opens with the aftermath of Peter's identity being revealed and accused of murdering Mysterio (played by Jake Gyllenhaal in previous instalment of the Spider-Man trilogy). Peter now must deal with the fact that his identity is out in the world and the ensuing legal problems, and it's not long before the people around Peter soon begin to be affected by this. But when the troubled teen decides to turn to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help, what follows is an explosive, emotional chain of events that will affect Peter forever.\n\nJon Watts (Cop Car) brings fans of the titular hero a well-paced film that brilliantly ties up three generations of this well-loved hero. The slightly muddled plot spans over 148-minutes and allows Tom Holland to show off his abundance of talent, giving a brilliant performance that puts \u2018Spider-Man: No Way Home' up there with some of the actor's best work. Even though the film's villains are ones we've seen on the big screen before, Watts manages to present them to viewers in a new and exciting way that doesn't make the film feel overstuffed and overcrowded. Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino returns to the Spider-Man franchise to provide the film with a magical score that takes you through every emotion alongside Peter.\n\n\u2018Avatar' and \u2018Southpaw' cinematographer Mauro Fiore supplies \u2018Spider-Man: No Way Home' with impressive visuals that take viewers on a visual journey from New York City to the geometric mirror dimension. Fiore's cinematography works hand in hand with the film's incredible visual effects, but the effects that can't help but feel like there's a bit too much. In classic Marvel fashion, \u2018Spider-Man: No Way Home' ties into some of the studios previous projects as well as the future of the expanding universe. Watt's gives audiences the first look at the multiverse in action after it was first introduced in Kate Herron's \u2018Loki' and Byran Andrews' \u2018What If\u2026?'. The film then sets up upcoming projects like \u2018Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness' which also stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nThe film sends Peter Parker on an emotional rollercoaster, forcing him to deal with themes of grief, sacrifice, and relationships. It also reiterates the struggle Peter faces as he tries to balance being a teenager with being a world-saving superhero. Despite being the darker, more emotional film in Holland's trilogy, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers manage to keep the comedy consistent throughout. What follows the chaotic opening scene is 148 minutes of mind-blowing action and heart-wrenching emotion that makes the long wait for the film completely worth it. But even though the film's action scenes feel slightly repetitive, intense hand-to-hand combat puts an exciting twist on Spidey's normal fighting style.\n\nThis film will be a welcome addition to the previously small amount audiences have seen of Peter and MJ's (Zendaya) blossoming relationship, and even though the ending may put the couple's future into doubt, subtle glances and awkward encounters will make viewers feel optimistic about Peter and MJ's future together. The ambiguity that surrounds Tom Holland's future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe makes the film's ending a perfect send off for the character but also a perfect place to pick up from in future projects. Because by the closing scenes, we are introduced to a new Peter Parker, a version of Holland's character that feels more mature and tough.\n\nThe third film in MCU's first Spider-Man trilogy is a powerful affair that sends the friendly neighbourhood webslinger to hell and back as he tries to fix the mess he finds himself in after the events of \u2018Spider-Man: Far From Home'. Jon Watts creates a film that lives up to big expectations and even goes one further. Featuring an incredible performance from Tom Holland, terrific cinematography from Mauro Fiore and great direction from Jon Watts, \u2018Spider-Man: No Way Home' is a spectacular film that makes it one of 2021's most exciting projects.",

Spider-Man: No Way Home is my favorite movie and what I liked the most was the appearance of the \"old Spier-Mans\" as I call them. I found it very nostalgic and exciting to see them all fight together. Also, one thing I love about this movie is the beautiful romance between Peter Parker and MJ and especially how each one plays their character. It's amazing!\n\n In conclusion, I think it's a very good movie, not only because of the incredible actors it has, but also because of the fantastic special effects, the quality of the movie, and the wonderful plot. When I finished watching it, I quickly searched for when the next movie was coming out because the ending left me wanting to see more and see what happened, especially for the two of them. I highly recommend this movie as you can find action, romance, fantasy, comedy and even intrigue in it.",

The creative (ahem) team behind this film doesn't seem to realize that animated camera moves, CGI action sequences and the clunky, militaristic propaganda of these formula movies actually just showcases VFX digital art sequences without a soul or a memorable story to tell. The cinematic equivalent of Christmas lights, glitter and chrome.\n\nFor whatever reason, Downey Jr doesn't really pick up tens of millions for appearing (in surprisingly short connecting sequences) as Iron Man's alter ego. The absurdly titled Benedict Cumberbatch of the Cumberbatch slavery dynasty appears again as Dr Strange. He went to RADA, darlings, a \"true thespian\" etc etc etc.\n\nWhatever love or at least recognizable appeal these Marvel characters once had has been drained of any relevance or impact long ago; this is post-production intensive digital TV masquerading as Blockbuster Entertainment. Lastly, Rotten Tomatoes (conveniently owned by Fandango ticketing company) should be ashamed of pretty much \"100 percenting\" this sequel of many sequels, given the highly punitive and exploiting nature of Marvel's VFX subcontracting history.",

I haven't been real interested in the MCU since Endgame concluded but this had great reviews and it's Spiderman so I figured i'd give it a shot.\n\nWhat the hell? This movie is the dumbest movie in the MCU. It has a plot that is so unbelievably stupid and hamfisted that I can't believe I haven't heard anyone call it out yet.\n\nIt seriously feels like every single character in this series got transformed into a complete idiot with the end goal being that MCU wanted to figure out a way to force the Multiverse into the story line because that's apparently where we're going to go after Endgame wrapped up. Doctor Strange particularly draws my ire. Really Victor, you're going to create a complicated world altering spell with massive cross universe complications potentially so that Peter's friends can get good college recommendations? Are you serious? This plot seems like it was ripped out of Rick and Morty, I'm just waiting for Rick to show up with a  \"I just wanted you to see how dumb and stupid the idea of going to a \"prestigious college\" was.\" It literally seems like a comedic gag and yet this is the plot that is supposed to set up the rest  of the direction of the MCU? The absurdity of this convoluted plot is interspaced with fan service throwbacks to old Sony characters (who also act like complete idiots in this movie) and even I'll admit that I'll never grow tired of Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborne but they serve as little more than distractions to get you to not think about how stupid everything else is in the movie around them.\n\nThe action scenes are all standard Marvel fare. The stakes being so totally ridiculous and unbelievable completely drew me out of them if I'm being totally honest. I honestly just wanted to  fast forward through them so I can see what the next unbelievable turn of this windy circus show was going to be. I think this is the one area where \"franchise fatigue\" might actually be a thing because I just couldn't be bothered to get excited about yet another CGI fest intersperced with little witty one liners as is the MCU formula these days. Without actual stakes,  this all just felt like it could have been copy paste out of Thor Ragnarok and nothing really would have changed.\n\nI went into this movie with pretty moderate expectations. I'm already divested from the MCU as it is, but I figured I'd give this movie a shot since it's the one that is pretty universally agreed to be a fun time and I cannot believe how disappointed I am with it. This was a VERY dumb action movie even by comic book movie standards, that feels insulting to the characters, and is a giant red flag that whatever Marvel is trying to do with the MCU without RDJ, Chris Evans and the rest in severe disarray.",

By the end of this film, viewers are left with a lot of questions and hypothetical scenarios of how else the multiverse characters/storylines could have affected what actually happens, and the movie, unfortunately, doesn't bother to address these questions in any way. Regardless, it remains an entertaining movie, with a lot of heart and an insane amount of character development for this Peter Parker, and most definitely one of the best projects to come out of Phase 4.",

No way home is the best ending for Tom Holland's Spiderman. It is the perfect way to end a trilogy. It fixes the flaws of MCU Peter Parker. Tom Holland's Spiderman hasn't had that big of a emotional sacrifice in these movies. but the ending is so good. One thing I will say is that since we have had the best villains against MCU Peter Parker there's is no other great villains to carry another trilogy of movies. I like the fact of how John watts makes his character make good character decisions during action sequences. There are some cheap moments like tobey getting stabed and of how strange escaped and how aunt may gets exploded and she's still conscious only to say the line. The fact that Ned can use doctor strange magic just like that is flimsy. There are some continuity error like how electro knows Peter Parker is Spiderman even though he doesn't. But other than that the movie is great. I really like the conversation between doc ock and Spiderman. Willem dafoe is so committed to the role it's crazy. The stakes gets larger and larger and of course the dynamic between the spidermen is great. So yeah i have nothing else to say other than #maketasm3 9/10",

All the\u00a0small\u00a0details\u00a0was impeccable like the scratches, the special effects like when they had flashing lights and the way bounced off the villains, not only that, things like the\u00a0stitching\u00a0on the clothes, like the beanie, the\u00a0wrinkles\u00a0in the clothes when Peter was on the highway, everything looked\u00a0amazing, what really impressed me was\u00a0the sound, the previous Spiderman movie has alot of\u00a0bass\u00a0making the\u00a0battles\u00a0sound very hard hitting so even if you watch at home you get that theatre\u00a0quality\u00a0sound, and this movie was absolutely\u00a0amazing\u00a0in terms of sound. I stand by my high rating because this\u00a0story\u00a0is so strong that it didn't matter it was cameos, it was such an\u00a0emotional\u00a0story that made Spiderman feel\u00a0Larger than life, the cinematography was one of the best I have ever seen and the sound aswell and it had such an emotional end that gave\u00a0closure\u00a0to the previous\u00a0chapter\u00a0and opening a whole\u00a0new\u00a0one.",

This maybe a hit but in all honesty it is only a hit because of what Tom Holland and original story telling brought to the franchise. If it reverts to the same old same old with Doc Ock etc. and no longer has the strength of character that  Holland brings to the films, along with a renewed poor influence of Sony I feel the franchise will degrade once again to the point where fans will not be flocking to the film but contemplating if they should even bother watching it when it comes out for streaming.",

Don't get me wrong, I think the last hour of this movie is near perfection and Tom Holland's Spider-Man definitely feels like Spider-Man at the end, but the first half of the movie is kind of a slog to get through. Dr. Strange was straight up incompetent in this movie and Peter risking the whole multiverse because he wanted his friends to get into MIT was really dumb. The humor was really dumbed down, but that's a problem with most Marvel movies nowadays not just this one. Every villain besides Green Goblin felt like they were there just to be member berries and didn't serve the story that much. However, the returning Spider-Men and Green Goblin and the third act in general was perfect and complemented Tom's Spider-Man really well and by the end, he truly felt like Spider-Man and not Iron Boy. Tobey and Andrew truly felt like their own iterations of Spider-Man and the banter between the three Spider-Men was just awesome. I also like how they don't overshadow Tom's Spider-Man even though they were in a significant part of the movie. Overall, I do think this movie is an improvement over the last two MCU installments, but it's still not as good as Into the Spider-Verse and the first two Raimi movies and it could've been so much better given the source material at their disposal.",

            "content": "2021 ends with the Marvel Cinematic Universe having started its post-Infinity Saga which included three phases that ended gloriously. Though it cannot be said that phase four has done as well as the other three. Make no mistake I enjoyed this year's MCU movies Black Widow and Shang-Chi but was utterly disappointed with the Eternals. I felt I was in for a world of disappointment despite the epic response to the movie's trailer. As was said in this movie, expect disappointment and you will never be disappointed. But I am BEYOND grateful to say that I was not disappointed.\n\nPeter Parker in his previous adventure ended what was probably a great vacation and a return to a new version of normal with a beautiful girlfriend, and a new costume but that is if you discount the film's mid-credits and sadly you cannot. Quentin Beck, a mentally disturbed former Stark Industries employee envious of Tony Stark set a plan in motion to make himself a superhero by tricking former SHIELD director Nicholas Fury and Iron Man's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Spider-Man, obtaining their trust and regaining a special set of technology that once belonged to Tony Stark, technology that he played a part in creating. But Peter found out who he was and put a stop to him but unbeknown to him, Beck created a plan in the event of his death by making it look like Peter was envious and used the Stark tech to make it look like Peter killed him as well as exposing his true identity. \n\nNow the world knows that Spider-Man is Peter Parker and the life he wanted for himself has been turned upside down, becoming a pariah along with family and friends. While not charged for any crime, his name is dragged through the mud, and what he wants more than anything is to change it all back to the way it was. Thankfully he knows someone who could do such that, fellow superhero Dr. Strange. Strange works a magic spell that can make people forget he is Spider-Man but they didn't talk it through and in mid-casting created alterations that end up nearly breaking the universe, causing a multiversal breach that brings forward men through time and space. Men who are hunting Spider-Man, but not the Spider-Man they know, for these men come from alternate universes where Peter Parker is Spider-Man but not the Peter Parker of this universe. Dr. Otto Octavius, Dr. Curtis Conners, Max Dillon, Flint Marko, and Dr. Norman Osborn are dangerous men who must be dealt with, but the Peter of this universe cannot do this alone. So, he involves his friends and family with disastrous consequences. But just when all hope seems lost two men come forward to remind Peter Parker, that With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.\n\nI got to admit when Tom Holland started working the role of Spider-Man he was great in Captain America Civil War and his other MCU appearances. But when it came to his movies, Homecoming and Far From Home, they weren't bad, but they weren't great. Average. But this one was phenomenal on the level of other great Spider-Man movies from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, who we can happily say are now MCU movies. Drawing inspiration from comic book stories as well as other great movies, Tom Holland ends his epic film franchise on a high note, living up to his predecessors with great glory. There were many great nostalgic moments, but they didn't completely dominate the story which was marvelous in its own right. Everyone did great from Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Favreau, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans, Thomas Haden Church, and Willem Dafoe. This was great to see in theaters and truly the best movie of the year. Marvel should take note, this is how all its movies should be made, by listening to its fans.",

I honestly thought this film would just be a fanservice fest which it is but in a good way Tobey & Andrew don't just show up to have us audience lost our mind but to help Tom grieve the passing of Aunt May since she died because of him since he tried to do the right thing by curing all the villains & he paid his due for it like Green Goblin said \"No good deed goes unpunished\". It was also a good story for Tom since it brought him back to basics by the end he no longer is affiliated with The Avengers, he has no help from Tony stark which people really didn't like for some reason & now since no one remembers him he can finally be the Spider-Man we are all familiar with he is poor, has a shitty home made suit & now he can do his own thing without getting involved with other superheroes. I can not wait for the next trilogy I hope it feels different than the home trilogy so I don't want to see people like Ned, MJ, Happy, etc for a while this should be a new beginning for Tom he should make new friends & enemies that aren't connected to the home trilogy in anyway.",

The movie was a great mix of action and story. The fan-service didn't feel forced, but it felt earned because they did it right. They also reset this version of Spider-Man to a more comic accurate version which was much needed. I grew up with Tom Holland as Spider-Man and seeing his movies helped shape my personality as I went on and to see him with the other two who i still see very fondly was literally a childhood dream come true.

            "content": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is probably the best film featuring the character to date and it should be no surprise at this point that the film is extra-special as it brings back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield from Sony's previous Spider-Man franchises. The film really reminds audiences why Spider-Man is Marvel's most popular superhero ever created and I respect the MCU for trying to tell new stories with this character. It's just bittersweet that Marvel co-owns the character with Sony, all due to unfortunate financial woes in the late 90s that forced Marvel to sell the rights to many of their characters, not only Spider-Man and the bulk of his supporting cast. Meanwhile, the MCU will underutilize the character across the entire franchise due to Sony's greed. You can't help but feel watching \"No Way Home\" that this is the \"real\" Spider-Man and he is truly where he belongs in the MCU, especially when he's playing alongside Maguire and Garfield. It leaves a bit of a sour taste knowing that Sony will continue to milk the franchise with subpar Spider-Man-less spin-offs no one is asking  for. This is the price we pay, but I digress. Tom Holland and Zendaya are adorable both on screen and off and you really root for this relationship to work out, despite their very relatable difficulties. Marisa Tomei is very touching and this is probably the best we've ever seen Aunt May. The cast is rounded out by its returning villains all who deliver what you'd expect including Willem Dafoe who serves to prove why Green Goblin is truly both Peter Parker and Spider-Man's nemesis.",

That said, No Way Home still achieves the impressive task to not feel overstuffed and to maintain their allegory about being a teenager (here it is focused on leaving your family to start university) which gives heart to the film. All the characters and returning characters from other franchises seem to have a blast in this movie. There is a lot of chemistry there and everyone has their time to shine. Bonus point for Green Goblin as terrifying as ever. They clearly didn't want to spoil the legacy of those characters and you can feel how important it was for them to stay true to the characters and to not use them as a gimmick. Outside of that, it's easy to say it's among the very best Spider-Man movies, a nice conclusion to three series at once. It's highly recommended to watch all the Spider-Man movies before this one, mostly because it is SO exciting to catch Easter eggs about past movies and some jokes only work if you know the background behind. It's there any bad point?

The movie's plot is a bit unrealistic, with Doctor Strange even considering Peter's plea, which is out of character. The acting was good, mainly DaFoe's return to his role of the Green Goblin but the others (Holland, Zendaya, Cumberbatch etc.) also did good. There were also a lot of plot holes which bugged me a bit. The whole \"Magic Ned\" thing was also the worst aspect of the film, just for a cheap laugh which I was disappointed with. Overall it's probably my 2nd least favourite Spiderman movie across Maguire, Garfield and Holland's films, with TASM 2 taking #1. It's certainly enjoyable, but it lacks so much that all the others had and those plot holes didn't help.",

I like that these films don't entirely take themselves too seriously, although some people may disagree but I feel that's the case, with some of the tongue in cheek comments between different characters in the script.\n\nObviously if your a big fan of Marvel films in general then this will mean more as you'll know the back stories to at least some (if not all) of the numerous Marvel characters present in this film but even if not, its still a pretty fast paced and entertaining film regardless. There's plenty of CGI and its quite tense throughout. \n\nThis is a very entertaining, amusing and sometimes quite gripping film that I enjoyed and I would happily recommend to others, yes. If your not a fan of Marvel films in general though, this may not be for you but most people should enjoy it, if only in part. I give this a solid 8/10.",

Yet the opening sequence seemed to promise a good, solid storyline if trailers are not considered. Even the direction loses its effectiveness in some moments while the soundtrack is very well done and also takes up the themes of the villains of the other two franchises. The only things that are saved from the cinematic side are the musical theme, as already mentioned above, the technical part with GCI and well-made location and finally the characters that are beautifully characterized, both the villains and the protagonists. Moving on to the emotional side, however, the film can be considered a masterpiece since seeing characters from films from many years ago is very exciting as well as noticing references and links between the franchises. Finally, my judgment unfortunately leans more towards the emotions it gave me despite the plot, which is almost non-existent, is submerged by the excessive fan-service on which the film is based.",

Though the studio says there's more to come, this could also be the last, and that would sad, though understandable.  If so, the series would go out with a strong and memorable showing that other renditions will be compared against. That may be better than doing what the rest of the MCU is doing, which is racking up quantity but not necessarily quality of their showings (at least as Phase 4 comes to a close) and damaging the good will built around some of their IP until this phase (Dr. Strange 2, Thor 3).",

Especially because I have seen them in other movies. And, even if they did make those choices, the solutions to the problems raise way more questions than they possibly could answer. MJ is going to scroll through her phone and be like, why do I have so many phone calls from this Peter Parker person and pictures of this stranger.  We are not told Peter Parker doesn't exist, people just forgot about him but there is so much evidence of him and of him being Spider-Man. Happy remembers Aunt Mae, he remembers Aunt Mae is connected to Spider-Man, does he remember that he had to shelter Aunt Mae at his place because the media was hounding her? Shouldn't Spider-man go to Doctor Strange, introduce himself as Peter Parker, explain the problem and the two of them figure out how to get Peter's life back to normal? \n\nThen there is the villains, what does curing the villains actually accomplish? They are not from his universe so the results won't actually be seen, and several of the villains were about to die when they came to the new universe, so they will still die, but be cured...great job seems worth the pain and effort.  \n\nThese are just a few of the problems that I have with this movie, the plot is all over the place, the characters are not believable and the resolution is ridiculous. It seem like the filmmakers focus all their energy on the concept and ignored the details like, how and why. This movie only exists to set up future movies, that's not really good enough.",

Instead Parker thought the easiest solution would be to alter the universe, and Dr Strange knew it was dangerous but did it because Parker asked nicely. The moments, with Garford, Maguire and Holland are fun, and MJ and Ned are good again.

The nostalgia trip was impressive in terms of the casting list and the fan service  was as bold and shameless as a 80 ft blinking neon sign. However, if you didn't care much for the old \"non Tom Holland\" movies then the nostalgia doesn't hit hard enough to distract from wondering why this movie exists in the first place. The writers basically had to change the personalities of established characters, especially Doctor Strange ,  to convince us to buy into the premise of a plot just to take a trip down bad memory lane. This could have been a good movie but sadly it was dragged down by its past. I was surprised that everything was so predictable given that the plot doesn't make much sense.  Here is a easier description of what this movie is. Let's say your favorite beer is Guinness. So you pour yourself a cold Guinness into a frosty mug. Now dump a budlight and Campbell's tomato soup into that same mug and mix it up. Enjoy!",

It feels a bit too much like a Marvel cash grab (albeit one of their best) to be a modern classic, but is still a good conclusion to this Spider-Man trilogy for fans of the superhero such as myself.",

And being a long-time MCU fan, I can say that with the utmost confidence.\n\nThe perfect conclusion to one of the most prevalent characters in Marvel, and not a single minute wasted at all. Let's get the elephant out of the room first - the characters. Before the movie even came out, there were already rumors spreading wild and I mean, REAL WILD. Well, it was really just about the other two Spider-men coming over to the MCU and that is pretty wild. But that OTHER character was not expected at all (at least, from my POV). And the way they introduced him was nothing short of MARVEL-lous, honestly. The fact that these characters were not only used as background items but also played significantly major roles made an even huger impact in the story and the character growth of Tom Holland's Peter Parker. The choices, sacrifices, and responsibilities he had made this far and the challenges that he needed to overcome presents a great foundation for the character's development. \n\nBeing the end of the trilogy would normally imply the end of a character, but this movie does the opposite and it does it beatifully. By not only ending the chapter of Peter Parker as Spider-man and vice-versa, it opens a whole new book of Peter Parker's and Spider-man's unity as one. A sweet cherry-on-the-top ending for sure. Hats off to Jon Watts for the masterpiece story-telling and heartfelt ride.",

I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this na\u00efve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\n\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\n\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\n\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\n\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\n\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\n\nInstead they just piled on the childish, na\u00efve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",
