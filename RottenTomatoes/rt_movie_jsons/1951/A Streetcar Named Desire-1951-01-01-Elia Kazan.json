Ostensibly about lies that protect and heavily freighted with sexual tension that can only find release in violence and truth, it is superbly performed here by its original Broadway cast, led by Vivien Leigh (who played Blanche in London) and the great Marlon Brando. But the acting is incomparable from the entire cast - indeed, my favourite scene is the awkward riverside sequence between Karl Malden's insecure Mitch and Leigh's desperate and needy Blanche. Elia Kazan's sensitive direction and Alex North's sad jazz score are the cherries on the cake.",

The film does look beautiful, the photography is very skillful especially. Alex North's music is nice and authentic, while the story is always gripping and the direction very good. As I have said already, the script and the acting drive A Streetcar Named Desire. Like with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the homosexual references are cut/not as prevalent, but I still cannot deny that the script was superb, dark, witty and tense. The acting is excellent too. Karl Malden is indeed great, but Marlon Brando gives one of his finest performances ever as the brutal Stanley, while Vivian Leigh also excels in a difficult role as Blanche and the pair while together sizzle with sexual tension. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

His brilliant new school method acting is accentuated in scenes where he plays opposite Vivien Leigh, who very much embodied old school methods and is dwarfed by Brando's presence – Leigh's overacting hurts the film.

            "content": "Wow, Marlon Brando really is as good as everybody always says he is. I was impressed by his work in On the Waterfront (1954), The Godfather (1972) and Apocalypse Now (1979) but here I understood why he is so iconic and influential. This film too is tremendous as it is directed by the esteemed Elia Kazan and based on a play written by Tennessee Williams who also produced Sweet Bird of Youth (1962) and The Rose Tattoo (1955), both of which I really liked. The only drawback for me with this film was the performance of it's lead actress, Vivien Leigh, who is hurt by appearing next to the modern Brando and the relatively subtle Kim Hunter and who appears comparatively over the top in her role.\n\nSouthern belle Blanche DuBois, Vivien Leigh, has lost her family mansion Belle Reve and has left Auriol, Mississippi to stay with her sister Stella, Kim Hunter, and her poor Polish-American husband Stanley Kowalski, Marlon Brando. DuBois and Kowalski immediately clash due to his abuse of Stella and her superior attitude towards him and his friends even as her past remains mysterious. Eventually it is revealed that DuBois was both a prostitute and a teacher in her previous life and was fired for having an affair with a young student. This puts an end to her relationship with Mitch, Karl Malden, and causes her to descend further into madness which eventually propels Kowalski into raping her. The film ends sadly with DuBois being sent off to a mental hospital as Stella appears to be in denial about her husband's actions.\n\nThe film flirts with some very dark subject matter which I think is part of the reason why it holds up so well when compared to other films from this time period. Watching a woman sink into a mental illness as she projects all of her desires onto the rather undesirable Mitch who really doesn't understand what he is getting himself into is oddly compelling and the film is very cleverly able to talk around several issues while letting you know about rape and underage sex. The whole film exists in Tennessee William's odd version of the world where all of the women are essentially drag queens or slaves to their desire for brutish, sometimes abusive men or using mild mannered men who turn out to have evil desires too. This world is an interesting place to spend time in even as you are horrified by how much debauchery and terrible actions are being committed behind the façade of regular people living normal lives that slowly unravel.\n\nWhat makes this film iconic is the performance of Brando who is shockingly alive and modern when compared to other actors of this era and whose performance still hits you hard all of these years later. We quickly realize that Kowalski is a terrifying monster of a man as we witness him beat a pregnant Stella in an early scene but Brando helps us understand what it is that would allow this character to manipulate the people around him. He is served well by an excellent Hunter whose restrained performance allows him to really let loose in his role and give a big, physical performance but without Brando I don't think the film would be nearly as good as it is. Has an actor ever been as essential to a film's success as Brando is to this film? I can't think of any better example.\n\nUnfortunately Leigh is not fantastic in the leading role. Where Brando is employing a more modern, cinematic style of acting it appears that Leigh is giving a performance for a theatre audience not those sitting in a cinema. It's partially unfair to blame her for this because were the two other actors to have given performances that were similar in style I could have forgiven her more hammy moments. I love Leigh's performance in my favorite film of all time, Gone With the Wind (1939), but I have to admit that I don't think she deserved her Academy Award for this performance and I would have awarded Best Actress to Shelley Winters in A Place in the Sun (1951) instead.\n\nYou should absolutely watch this monumental film in cinema history because it is not only impressive as a technical achievement but it still entertains today.",

There’s a bit more going on in A Streetcar Named Desire than I found in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, so I appreciated the exploration of all the different relationships, but there is still a lot of the film devoted to bickering. I always find it tedious to listen to all that arguing, and it makes the characters less sympathetic to me. I had trouble caring about what happened to any of the characters in the film because they constantly made awful choices, and then spent hours squabbling about the bad things that came as a result of those choices. I know there is a question of mental illness brought into the plot, and that certainly changes my perception of the choices that character makes, but there are still stupid things being done by every other character. Of course, you have to feel some sympathy for anyone who is dealing with abuse, but it’s hard for me to watch because I know the tragic truth is that they will probably be back at it again right after the credits roll. However much they want you to believe this will be the last time, historical evidence shows that abused people will return to the relationship an average of 7 times. This is a statistic I’m very familiar with as I suffer with someone close to me who is dealing with this problem, that makes it harder to endure in a film. The actors are all high-quality performers, but everything in this film felt a little too melodramatic. The script is partially to blame, but they take the performances over the top most of the way through. Vivien Leigh in particular annoyed me a bit with the way she played Blanche. Unlike Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, I wasn’t actively annoyed by A Streetcar Named Desire. I could see why people who enjoy this type of story might be enthralled by the drama, but for me it fell a little flat and left me somewhat cold.",

Attracted to Stanley's friend Mitch (Karl Malden), she glosses over the less savory incidents in her past, but she soon discovers that she cannot outrun that past, and the stage is set for her final, brutal confrontation with her brother-in-law.

            "content": "Undoubtedly, the intensity and themes of the play by Tennessee Williams are responsible for the power of this film -- but there is also no doubting the fact that the acting craft on display heightens that power yet further.  Vivien Leigh plays Blanche DuBois as pathetic yet somehow noble, deluded and debauched but worthy of our pity and sympathy.  As the only central member of the cast not to step straight from the Broadway production into the film, she was thrust into the web of Method actors, led by 25-year-old Marlon Brando (and also featuring Karl Malden and Kim Hunter).  Brando pulls out all the stops in showing Stanley Kowalski to be a thug, pitting his raw unbridled style against Leigh's more composed acting (and this contrast meshes perfectly with the dynamics of the drama).  Of course, the play was sanitized when it was refashioned for the screen but it isn't too hard to read between the lines.  Blanche DuBois arrives in New Orleans to stay with her sister, Stella, and brother-in-law Stanley in a small seedy apartment in the French Quarter. Tensions erupt between Blanche and Stanley.  She begins a romance with his friend Mitch (Karl Malden) which is dashed when Stanley investigates Blanche's past and reveals all to Mitch.  Then, when Stella is in the hospital having a baby, Stanley does the unthinkable to Blanche which causes her to lose her grip on reality (which was already tenuous).  Director Elia Kazan (who infamously named names to HUAC the next year) translated his Broadway success to the screen by breaking it out of the small apartment and including other locations (sparingly); one innovation was to keep shrinking the set so that Blanche's growing claustrophobia becomes real to the audience.  To his credit, Kazan doesn't get in the way of the play or the acting but instead manages to create the perfect environment for both to flourish. The result is gripping but deeply unsettling.",

Elia Kazan perfectly directs the passionate duel between two magnetic actors, Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando, set in a scorching, noisy French quarter in New Orleans. Moreover, this confrontation between the sophisticated Blanche DuBois and the vulgar Stanley Kowalski, at the heart of this magically written play offers a variety of emotions all equally dense, and the piercing, poetic dialogues provoke numerous reflections. Therefore, 'A Streetcar Named Desire' not only is an intellectual delight, it's a heart touching work of art which is also always exhilarating in terms of entertainment.",

I have an inveterate hatred of movies overflowing with speedy, relentless dialogue, and since it focuses on a character of such mental instability, we get plenty of that. Silent moments are essential for the audiences to catch their breath and process what they're hearing and seeing, and for the characters to emote through facial expression and body movements. I felt no connection to the characters, and had a hard time caring what they were talking about or what was going to happen to each of them.

            "content": "I've heard of bringing a play from the stage to the screen, but if anyone was involved in a major production of this Tennessee Williams drama around this time, then he or she is involved in this film, although this particular interpretation of Blanche DuBois may be a little too recognizable even to people who didn't see this play during its early runs. Vivien Leigh returns to being an abused, somewhat disturbed southern belle in \"Gone With the Wind II: The Oppressive Man Strikes Back, Because the Only Way He Knows to Settle Issues is Through Violence\"! Man, this film's actual title is awesome, but that title I just made up better fits the obvious feminist themes about this woman who... doesn't so much stand up for herself, as much as she tries to figure out a way to run away when a man is allowed to walk all over her. You know, come to think of it, this is closer to being the ultimate fantasy for husbands, because, come on, fellas, which guy hasn't thought that his sister-in-law is crazy? Yeah, with a statement by that from someone who has watched this film, I guess it's obvious that the feminist themes of this film aren't quite that obvious, and it doesn't exactly help that this film made Marlon Brando a sex symbol, and about all he does throughout this movie is abuse a woman. Hey, the chicks dig the bad boys, which would explain why Brando ended up with 16 kids, because he did turn out to be a bit of a jerk in real life, although that might just be a reflection of just how committed he was to his method acting in this film. Yeah, well, whether it be as a sexy man, or as an actor, Brando is awesome in this film, but the film itself, while plenty decent, is not quite awesome, or, well, tight.\r\n\r\nRunning just over two hours, and being minimalist in its being so intimate and dialogue-driven, the film manages to sustain a fair bit of momentum and intrigue through plenty of smart scripting and engaging performances found on and off of the screen, but it is still too long, losing a lot of momentum and getting to be repetitious with its great deal of chatter, much of which may as well be about a whole lot of nothing, if it's not going to bring much to the expository depths. There's not much in the way of immediate development in this intimate drama which drops you right into the story of characters who you get used to amidst all of the dialogue, and get invested in through good acting, but who still have something missing in their exposition, feeling like types whose circumstances feel rather unconvincing, at least in the wake of histrionics. As a southern gothic, this drama has the potential to be both fresh and realist, and it betrays both of the those aspects by conforming, to melodramatics, exacerbating a sense of somewhat unconvincing thinness to the characterization with improbable happenings and turns, made all the worse by sentimental dramatic atmospherics and some theatrical aspects. Marlon Brando and a few other performers are right on the money, and Kim Hunter is solid for the most part, but Vivien Leigh, often bombing in a way only a 1950s film starlet could, joins Elia Kazan's overdramatic directorial touches and Tennessee Williams' and Oscar Saul's aforementioned lapses in written genuineness in reflecting the dating and staginess that really does a number of the full effectiveness of this film. To make matters worse, although the subject matter and certain other elements of this melodrama are very weighty, there's not much one can do with a basic story concept that is so reliant on dialogue and an almost claustrophobic scope, which could be better embraced as intimate if it wasn't for the shortcomings that extend beyond the natural. There are a number of rewardingly engrossing attributes in this melodrama, and the final product at least manages to come to the brink of rewarding, yet momentum gradually sinks under the overwhelming weight of natural shortcomings that you grow more aware of the more dragging, histrionics and dated staginess set in. I find the final product rather underwhelming, but it would have been more so if there weren't a couple of elements that hit fairly hard, including aesthetic elements.\r\n\r\nConsidering the black-and-white palette and a lack of spectacular visuals in this minimalist, very 1950s film, cinematographer Harry Stradling finds his abilities held quite a ways back, but when he is given the opportunity to deliver on visual style, he sure knows how to take it, delivering on a handsome, almost noirishly bleak emphasis on shadows and subtle lightings in order to give this drama a sense of taste and intimacy, capitalized on by thoughtful direction. Mind you, thoughtful direction is a bit of a rarity, for Elia Kazan's storytelling is mostly overblown, with some sense of theatrical bloating and staginess, although it does manage to keep up a decent pace which entertains sufficiently, until those thoughtful moments come into play, molding scenes of dramatic punctuation that shine a light on what could have been. The minimalism of this drama seems to hold back a dramatic scale when the direction doesn't entirely work, but when tensions mount, that minimalism feels intimate, maybe a little fittingly claustrophobic, drawing you into this southern gothic, and selling the weight of its subject matter. The overall plot concept of this film is minimalist, and coated in melodramatics, but the thematic subject matter at its heart is almost remarkable in its audaciously, if not realistically studying on a woman's instability, brought to a breaking point when she is exposed to the abusive nature of flawed men, and to the vulnerability of fellow women of sophistication and potential. Oscar Saul's and playwright Tennessee Williams' script does not have the sophistication or edge to live up to weighty subject matter, being superficial, melodramatic and often unconvincingly thin, and yet, for every misstep in writing, there is a strength, whether it be within memorable, if occasionally melodramatic dialogue, or within distinguished, if rather lacking characterization that is mostly brought to life by the roles' portrayals. Upon hitting the scene, Karl Malden initially offers plenty of charm, and comes to sell a good bit of intensity as a seemingly good man with deep dark sides, yet this is all about the leads, and although Vivien Leigh falls flat in her sometimes embarrassingly dated portrayal of an aging and unstable woman, Kim Hunter, as an oppressed woman who may have to face much danger and uncertainty to find a better life, is fairly dramatically effective, even if she doesn't convince quite like the show-stealer, Marlon Brando, who has a smooth charisma that endears you to the Stanley Kowalski character's masculine charm and intimidating presence, until Brando showcases near-groundbreaking dramatic acting sensibilities, which utilize a devastating emotional range, and project vulnerability, power and passion to sell you on the depths and layers of the antagonist much more than the script, often engrossingly. Kowalski may be a brute, but he is more compelling than the female protagonists, almost strictly because of the effectiveness of Brando, a powerhouse who is among the most compelling attributes of the final product, which slowly, but surely loses too much momentum under the weight of its problematic pacing, histrionics and natural shortcomings, yet hits enough highlights along the way, on the back of adequately inspired direction, writing and acting, to at least border on rewarding in its engagement value.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the film often drags its feet to not have enough exposition to entirely sell you on character types, let alone on conventional melodramatics and a staginess which in turn make it hard to disregard the minimalism of this story concept, which gradually loses momentum, until the final product stands as decidedly underwhelming, yet still on the brink of rewarding, thanks to the fine cinematography, sharp heights in direction and writing, worthy subject matter, and generally decent acting - the strongest of which being by a show-stealing Marlon Brando - that secure Elia Kazan's \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" as a seriously improvable, but generally effective and sometimes moving melodrama.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

        {
            "content": "A Streetcar Named Desire is a touching film.\nIt's not hard to see why it is considered a classic, because its material is very original. A Streetcar Named Desire is an exploration of many characters in the context of Mississippi in the mid 1900's which doesn't hold back the dark and dramatic nature of Tennessee Williams' play as it respects its viewers enough to confront them with it, and this is partially thanks to Tennessee Williams himself who teamed up with Oscar Saul to adapt it to the screen with his intended visuon.\nThe style of A Streetcar Named Desire follows a style close to the stage version so it maintains the original dramatic heart of the theatre production that the film was based on. Even though its story is rather thin and rests most importantly on the characters, it is still a source of serious entertainment because of the gritty nature of the themes that it covers.\nDirector Elia Kazan reveals what his strongest nature as a film director is all about in A Streetcar Named Desire, because in his wisdom as the film director who brought the Tennessee Williams' classic play into cinema, he maintains a grip over the entire play and a sense of knowledge which reveals where all the importance of it lies, making it a memorable dramatic feature as well as a good visual experience.\nA Streetcar Named Desire reminds us of the dark nature of humanity and the violent underside of married life without going melodramatic, and it stays within it's the appropriate territory. It's a dark film, but not too dark, and it is unpredictable and has no way to reassure viewers that things will be ok because that is how life naturally is, so A Streetcar Named Desire succeeds as a realistic depiction of the life viewers lived in when it was originally released.\nA Streetcar Named Desire is easy too feel for, because it is an atmospheric film thanks to the dedication of the actors and the musical score which is beautifully composed and reaches for the heartstrings of its viewers well enough to tug them from time to time. The film is very convincing thanks to its production design and scenery as well as its beautiful cinematography which captures every visual inch of the film very well. A Streetcar Named Desire is a gritty film, but thanks to all its storytelling features and emotional atmosphere it is easy and pleasant to watch, as well as sufficiently entertaining over the course of its two hour running time.\nThe characters in A Streetcar Named Desire are the main source of interest because they are all very complicated, and the drama all grows from what is rooted inside them by the cast that A Streetcar Named Desire has to boast.\nVivien Leigh's performance is a beautiful effort on behalf of her. In what is arguably her greatest performance since her first Academy Award winning performance in Gone with the Wind, Vivien Leigh takes on the role of Blanche Dubois, a fading southern belle with a lot of beauty left in her. And in the role, Vivien Leigh proves that not an inch of her talent has faded in her many years as an actress and that she is still as beautiful as ever. Her dedication to character in A Streetcar Named Desire is unflinchingly excellent and it is difficult for viewers not to feel sympathy for her. Her character is a very lovable one and it is hard to see her suffer so much because Vivien Leigh makes her out to be the wonderful woman that she is, caught up in a world that is complicated and merciless\nMarlon Brando's performance in A Streetcar Named Desire is unforgettable. Although the only films I have seen him in so far are The Godfather and his post-1972 films, he proves that his talent was no lesser in his youth than it was in his later career in A Streetcar Named Desire. In the iconic character Stanley Kowalski he shows off his youthful ferocity and dedication in a performance which is arguably one of his best. He completely embodies the role of Stanley Kowalski with a fiery passion which shows just how strong Marlon Brando's desire to act burns within him. A Streetcar Named Desire is unforgettable because of acting legend Marlon Brando, and his interaction with the universe the film is set in and the surrounding cast makes it all too convincing. He is excellent in A Streetcar Named Desire.\nKim Hunter gives an arguably career best performance in A Streetcar Named Desire, because in the role of Stella Kowalski she has to play the character who experiences the most direct contact with both Blanche and Stanley. Yet she grips the drama with her tenacious talent and gives a performance almost as effective as Vivien Leigh's. Her performance in A Streetcar Named Desire grabs all of the emotional dramatics that Stella Kowalski faces and then runs with it, giving a performance where she holds nothing back and shows off just what her talents as an actress are all about. Her chemistry with the surrounding cast is excellent as well, so really it is easy to say that Kim Hunter gives a performance that succeeds in every area that she reaches for.\nKarl Maden's performance also makes him a powerful addition to the cast. The actor who later worked later with both actor Marlon Brando and director Elia Kazan on the Best Picture winning film On The Waterfront exhibits a lot of his greatest talents in A Streetcar Named Desire, enough to win him an Academy Award. While his performance isn't as notably effective as the other 3 lead actors, Karl Maden gives a strong supporting effort to A Streetcar Named Desire which leaves the cast bereft of any failure whatsoever.\n\nSo A Streetcar Named Desire is clearly a classic, a great film adaptation of a famous Tennessee Williams play. And without flinching it dives into the dramatic nature of its story and pulls it right out to the screen, bringing an excellent cast with it and making it an achievement in storytelling.",

            "content": "This movie is certainly not a classic for nothing.  The acting is stunning (although, sorry Marlon, you weren't the best), the plot riveting and suspenseful, and the sights, sounds, smells and music of New Orleans in the 50s, brilliantly captured.  Adapted from Tennessee William's screenplay, it has almost a 'musical' feel about it and one keeps expecting Stanley, (Marlon Brando), to jump up on the kitchen table and burst into song (sadly this doesn't happen as he's too busy glowering menacingly or destroying things). Stanley and Stella (Kim Hunter) are a working class couple living in a seedy part of town but not in the least bothered by the incessant noise, hustle and bustle and habitual punch ups that pop up throughout the film.  Stella's somewhat fragile and slightly mad sister, Blanche, (Vivien Leigh), comes to stay with them after being told (or forced?) to take a break from her 'school teaching job'.  From the very start, Stanley is suspicious of Blanche and thinks she is hiding an inheritance from the former family estate.  Leigh is nothing less than brilliant as the neurotic, flouncy, age-obsessed Blanche, who appears to be living in a by-gone age/fantasy world and, rather mysteriously, has arrived with trunks and trunks of expensive gowns, wraps, stoles and jewelry (which pisses Stanley off even more) and leads him to 'investigate' Blanche's life prior to her move to New Orleans. Although Brandon certainly looks the part in Streetcar - the muscly, attractive, sweaty, working class, 'man's man' - I found his acting just a teeny bit stilted and over-dramatic at times; I'm sure some people will want to kill me for that statement, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. In any case, as the movie unfolds, Blanche's neuroses, fears, desperation and longing for her former youth escalate - as does Stanley's temper.  There are no shortages of slanging matches and physical violence between the two (or, for that matter, between Stanley and Stella).  Blanche is horrified that her sister is married to such a brute and tries to convince her of his 'commonness'; \"He's like an animal!\", \"there's something sub-human about him!\" but, all to no avail; Stella loves him and seems to rather enjoy their rough and tumble relationship - this really irks Blanche.  As Blanche tries to convince herself that  she's still young and eminently desirable, she descends further into a dream world.  Meanwhile Stanley, through his ambiguous 'research', has 'discovered' that all that stuff about Blanche being a schoolteacher and carer to her elderly relatives was a bunch of hooey and becomes convinced, that in reality, her life was much seedier......MUCH seedier.  At this point, he ramps up his 'brutishness' and even though Stella tries to stop him, he continues to terrorize the ever-more loopy Blanche.  I shan't give away the ending  but let's just say the 'truth' about  Blanche's former life could open to interpretation - and that's always a good thing in a classy movie.  I recommend Streetcar for its authentic New Orlean's ambience, remarkable and creative cinematography and, above all else, Leigh's no-holds-barred characterization of a woman slipping into the abyss of complete and utter madness.  You'll be captivated and impressed, that I promise.",

This was to be the first young Marlon Brando film for me (the earliest film of his I had seen before this was from 1972), and I have heard so much about his method acting that I was excited to see him in a role where I could actually understand him when he spoke. I was also already familiar with this American Classic written by Tennessee Williams, so this was a film I always knew I needed to watch, but just hadn't made the time for.\n \nThe film opens with Blanche DuBois (Leigh) arriving in New Orleans and trying to find her way into the French Quarter where she plans on meeting her sister Stella and her husband Stanley (Brando). Immediately she begins berating her sister about her manners and living situation, and expressing her disapproval of her \"polack\" husband. Stanley and Stella's relationship is abusive, and only adds fuel to Blanche's fire to interfere. But as Stanley's suspicion of Blanche's stories grows, it becomes clear that the reasons she came to visit and all her proper behavior and lifestyle may not exactly be truthful and only causes further conflict with everyone she is involved with.\n \nIt is interesting that the entire cast of the film was actually the original cast of the Broadway play (minus Vivien Leigh who was in the London production). I think this was very smart on the director's part because everyone was spot on in their portrayal. The acting was absolutely amazing. I think it probably even worked better that Leigh was the \"outcast\" on-set because that was an essential feeling that her character had.  Everyone was so good and it really did feel authentic. I had only seen one other film with Vivian Leigh (Gone with the Wind) and it was not surprising to find out that this film was her second Academy Award. \n \nAlthough Marlon Brando was nominated for the Oscar, he lost to Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen. Well I'm sorry, but the Academy got it wrong. Brando should have won. His screen presence was unbelievable. His character was a force to be reckoned with - and so was he. I've seen both films and this by far was a better performance. I was quite taken with Brando. Everyone knows he is a great actor, but this being his second film role, it was unbelievable how great he was. And did I mention how gorgeous? I have never thought so in the past - but I definitely do now.\n \nI really enjoyed the movie. Solid story. Great acting. Wonderful music. I was a little disappointed that it was black and white only because they reference things being specific colors and you can't really tell that, but it wasn't so big that it took away from the film. One thing that I did love was finding out the reason for the title. At the beginning of the film, Blanche is told \"Take a streetcar named Desire, transfer to one called Cemeteries, and ride six blocks and get off at Elysian Fields.\" With the overall theme and how everything turns out, it is a beautiful way to sum up the story of Blanche's life.",

            "content": "\"I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.\"\r\n\r\nMarlon Brando revolutionized the term acting, inspiring such future actors as James Dean, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, and Clint Eastwood. His first huge role in Hollywood was A Streetcar Named Desire, based on the famed Broadway play that Brando also starred in and directed by Elia Kazan, who would later reteam with Brando in the Best Picture winner On the Waterfront. But as for Streetcar Named Desire, it's disturbing and brutal... but filled with powerful and compelling performances that it's hard to turn away from the screen.\r\n\r\nBlanche Dubois (Vivien Leigh), a Southern belle with a very bad reputation, hops on the streetcar named Desire and heads to New Orleans to visit her pregnant sister Stella (Kim Hunter), who's married to the drunken and violent Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando). Stanley believes Blanche to be an annoying girl who's only involved in using other men and is convinced that she has some inheritance money that truly belongs to Stella, especially when a baby is on the way. Trying to forget her troubled past, Blanche falls in love with Stanley's friend Mitch (Karl Malden), but eventually realizes that the past cannot be forgotten and the film leads to a disturbing and tragic ending that will never be forgotten in Hollywood cinema.\r\n\r\nA Streetcar Named Desire is one of the most controversial movies ever made, and it had a hard time with the film censors of the day, especially with scenes of implied rape and talk of implied homosexuality and romantic scandals between a teacher and student. Due to the censors, these scenes were cut and left some audiences puzzled. Later on, the scenes were added back in, making A Streetcar Named Desire one of the most powerful films ever made.\r\n\r\nWhile it's a great movie, I cannot recommend this film to everybody. Some will be disturbed by the disturbing and brutal performance of Brando (it's probably why he lost the Oscar to Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen), while others might find the film too long, slow, and depressing. But for me, depressing or not, A Streetcar Named Desire is a film that remains powerful after over 60 years of release.\r\n\r\nThe moody atmosphere of New Orleans is stunning, with black-and-white cinematography that stuns to the limit. There's also a super jazzy score that also delivers in the romantic tensions and powerful story.  The direction by Elia Kazan is strong for a drama like this. \r\n\r\nBut what really makes A Streetcar Named Desire the great film it is is the powerful acting in the film. Vivien Leigh, who received top billing over Brando cause at the time, she was the more famous star, gives a performance reminiscent of her Scarlet O'Hara role in Gone With the Wind, but it's more chilling, disturbing, and insane. Leigh won an Oscar, and it was well-deserved. Kim Hunter, who played Stella, also delighted in the acting abilities as well, and also won an Oscar. When I first saw Karl Malden on the screen, I was unimpressed. I kept thinking he was in the wrong movie. I just kept thinking that's Patton's friend, and not Mitch. But as the film progressed, I could see why he won an Oscar for his role, cause his character goes from a used bum to a crazy and disturbing soul. But it's Marlon Brando as Stanley who really brings the acting down. I can see why he delighted the ladies of the day in this, with his tight T-shirt and good looks. My favorite moment with Brando, and it's the most famous, is where he goes out and hollers \"Stella. HEY STELLA!\" with his ripped up shirt making him look like Tarzan. But his brutal and disturbing expressions was a little too much for some, and he lost the Oscar to Bogart in The African Queen. For me, Bogart is always the better actor, and he deserved the win for that film. But is Streetcar was released in a different year, then I would have gladly given the award to Brando.\r\n\r\nLast thing I have to mention is the ending. It's said that old films always have a happy ending, but it's not the case for Streetcar. Some characters end the film on a depressing note, particularly Leigh and Brando. The ending also leaves you to  think, and those are sometimes the best endings. In the case of Streetcar, this thinking ending works and I applaud Kazan for not Hollyoodizing it to make it a happy note.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend it to everyone, but for those who enjoy compelling and brutal dramas, then ride the streetcar and enjoy one of the most powerful, compelling, and controversial movies ever made.",

            "content": "A Stranger's Just a Friend You Haven't Met  \r\n\r\nOh, I can keep going.  Actually, the list of potential titles for this review was sadly long--\"White Hot Grease Fires of Pure Entertainment,\" for example, or \"Their Hellish Rondelet.\"  I won't say I have the entire episode memorized, or even the entirety of its in-episode musical.  (\"I think that represents her descent into madness.\")  However, I have sadly large amounts of it memorized, and it has come out at extremely inappropriate times.  Like when I was stranded in Poulsbo, Washington, with only enough money for bus fare home, and a guy bought me ice cream from Dairy Queen, across the street from the bus stop.  Or when I saw this movie in class--in college, mind--and the entire class was singing along in our heads when we got to the big climax.  The truly sad part there is that I'm pretty sure the professors were, too, and they were one and all old enough to have seen the movie first.  Or even the play.\r\n\r\nBlanche DuBois (Vivian Leigh) has come to New Orleans to be with her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter), who is having a baby.  Also, Blanche really has nowhere else to go, as the family plantation has been foreclosed on.  Stella is married to one Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando), a rough-and-tumble sort whom Stella initially dismissed--rightly, in my opinion--as common.  Stanley dislikes Blanche right away, seeing that she is unlikely to change [i]her[/i] mind about whether or not he's common.  He also thinks that Blanche has cheated him out of money that rightfully belongs to Stella and therefore to him.  Blanche starts a hesitant, sweet relationship with Stanley's friend Mitch (Karl Malden), but Stanley goes digging into her past and ruins it.  He and Blanche circle one another warily, each disliking the other and each wanting Stella to choose them.  Then one night, Stella is away having her baby, and what happens that night can never be changed or taken back.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me that Stella is coarser than her sister.  Not in the sense of more vulgar, but in the sense of less refined.  Less delicate.  In the long run, however, I think that's better for her.  It is Blanche's delicacy that ruins her.  She is, among other things, still trying to be the genteel Southern plantation lady that she was raised to be, and there's no place for that in her new life.  She has no money, no reputation, not even a home that hasn't been given to her out of the goodwill of Stanley, who doesn't have much.  Staying with Stanley--as happens in the play--is bad for Stella, but she has to be tough in order to leave.  Tougher than it is possible, I think, for Blanche to be.  She accused her husband of being weak (because you couldn't accuse him of being gay under the Code), but she is just as weak herself.  She is also selfish in a way I doubt she realizes, because there was a time when it was reasonable of her to expect people to pay attention to her in that way.\r\n\r\nThe trivia section on IMDb expresses astonishment that Marlon Brando claimed not to like Stanley Kowalski, but let's face it.  Stanley is an inherently unlikeable character.  He is supposed to be.  Okay, it's reasonable of him to be less than thrilled about the swanning, pretentious sister-in-law who has descended upon him, but he does also abuse Stella both physically and emotionally.  If he didn't like the fact that she'd looked down on him when they first met, the better bet was to not marry her.  Better for them both.  And while I'm sure he can justify to himself what he did to Blanche, there's really no valid justification.  I'd say about the only character Tennessee Williams wanted us to truly like was Stella.  We were supposed to be betrayed by Mitch, I think, and we were supposed to feel pity and disdain for Blanche.  But we are supposed to be disgusted by Stanley, because Stanley is a disgusting person.  Our sympathy for Stella should be strained because she puts up with him.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that Vivian Leigh won two Best Actress Oscars, and both times, she won for playing Southern belles.  It's almost impossible to imagine a Scarlett who turns out like Blanche--in many ways, she is closer to Stella.  Coarse.  But I think Blanche thinks of herself as being rather more like Scarlett than she is.  I've also read that it was hard for Vivian Leigh to distance herself from Blanche, because Leigh was bipolar.  Just as Marge has difficulty with Blanche because of her relationship with Homer, Vivian Leigh had difficulty with her because her own demons were ever so slightly too near the surface at all times.  I think one of the great unifying fears of the mentally ill is getting worse--at least until we are too far gone to worry about it anymore.  Unless, that is, we are in denial about our condition.  Blanche was in denial.  Vivian Leigh feared becoming Blanche.  It is perhaps why her performance is so great--there is a note of truth that rises out of it.",

By that I mean that the supporting players, Kim Hunter's Stella and Karl Malden's Mitch do a fine job as well. Tennessee Williams' plays are all the same, in a way- it's all a few rooms and a lot of claustrophobia and drama, but this is what makes them so engaging. In the hands of anyone else, Miss Dubois' extended flowery monologues would become grating but Vivien Leigh completely inhabits the character in a way that doesn't overwhelm the picture. Elia Kazan must have really understood what he needed because here is a film in perfect balance. Brilliant.",

Her spiral into insanity is wonderful as she is dominated physically and mentally by Brando's character. This is on my list as one of the best films in cinema history.",

            "content": "It's harsh, it's unforgiving and it's reality. \r\nThat sentence sums up the classic adaptation of Tennessee William's play \"A Streetcar named Desire\". It also reflects the mentality of the film's main character, Stanley Kowalski. No other film in history has truly captured drama and real-life in such a prolific way. Southern belle Blanch DuBois (Vivien Leigh) stays with her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter), who lives in New Orleans. Little did Blanche know about the big, buff, barbaric brute that Stella married named Stanley (Marlon Brando). Stanley, who is curious about Blanche's fidelity, goes out of his way to tear her life apart and shatter her illusion of fantasy in contrast with his gritty realism. Such a serious and topical film should not be avoided. Vivien Leigh gives her intentional over-the-top performance for such an over-the-top character. But, it is Brando who steals the show and bursts out the most famous line of the whole film: \"Hey Stellllllaaaaa!...Hey Stelllllllaaaaa!\". \r\n\r\nPros: Great script, famous performances, great atmosphere, great direction.\r\n\r\nCons: I suggest reading the stage-play before watching the film. You will grasp some ideas about the film better that way. \r\n\r\nOverall: \"I've always depended on the kindness of strangers\". A must see.",

Furthermore, the film won four Academy Awards, three of which were for acting. It is impossible for me to dispute the power of this film. Academy Award Winners Marlon Brando (On The Waterfront, The Godfather Part 1), Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, and  Karl Malden band together to form an unforgettable cast of acting dominance. Blanche DuBois (Leigh, award winning in this role) is a Southern belle who has been run out of her town of Auriol. Her delusions of grandeur and alcoholism are evident from the exposition of the film, but it is Blanche's older, pregnant sister Stella (Hunter, award winning in this role) who sees the good in Blanche. Be that as it may, her husband, Stanley (Brando) does not see such good in her. His distrust and ultimately hatred for her causes his forthcoming downfall. Blanche also continuously finds herself slipping into a worse mental state, but finds refuge with Stanley's friend from work Mitch (Malden, award winning in this role). Blanche uses Stanley and he leaves her, subsequently as Stanley and Stella have their baby. Stanley returns home to get some rest with only Blanche there. She lies to him, and fueled by alcoholism and rage, he rapes her. Afterwards, Blanche has a complete nervous breakdown, and Stanley has her committed to a mental institution. Mitch realizes Stanley raped Blanche, and hits him before they take her away. At the end of the film, Stella realizes that she cannot stay another moment with Stanley, and she seeks refuge, with her baby, in her neighbor's home while Stanley calls her name. The film was nominated for twelve Academy Awards and, in my opinion, is one of the great American classics.",

One problem is my expectations. I expect to be blown away by them, I want them to change how I think about certain genres. And second is the acting back then. Especially the women. The female characters in these 50s-70s movies are so unbearably melodramatic. Its so irritating. They arent realistic emotions, and they arent even fun; they are just annoying. The male characters have their faults as well usually, particularly with their boring attitudes. I suppose it was the style back then to have these two complete opposites of the emotional scale on camera, but today, most of the interactions in these 50s-60s \"classics\" feel contrived. This movie partly suffers from the same thing. Vivian Leigh is really annoying and stupid in this film. It doesnt matter if shes trying to act out the \"craziness\" of her character; her performance was a huge problem with A Streetcar Named Desire. I seriously can not even comprehend how she won an oscar for this film. Kim Hunter completely overshadows her and she wasn't even that special!  On the other hand, Marlon Brando is awesome. His performance is the polar opposite of Vivian's; cool, calm and most importantly, believable. The whole crazy romance story is alright I guess, but then again I don't really like romances so maybe I'm not the intended audience. I would say this movie is good, but was disappointed since it is nowhere near a classic.",

Being very draggy and stagey, I would not be able to sit still in my seat. The actors mumble very fast most of the times, esp Vivien Leigh. It would be impossible to catch the dialogue without the subtitles. \n\nBefore Marlon Brandon became a whale, gee, he was so hunky and handsome back in 1951. He was the '50s' Brad Pitt. There is some kind of raw eroticism in him. There is a reason why they put him on the cover of DVD even though he is not really the main star. \n\nThe story is very morbid; there are hints of casual sex, prostitution and even incest. The director's version restores some of the scenes deemed unfit back then. \n\nI fear classics because they can be too serious and dull. Sadly, this movie falls in that category. \n\nRating: B-",

If you listen to the radio performance of extracted scenes that Tandy gave on the occasion of the Pulitzer Prize award, it will reenforce the perfection of Leigh's inflections and innate understanding of the role. This inner and complete understanding is what Brando praises Leigh for in his autobiography. He agrees that she plays this Hamlet of female roles better than anyone because he felt she was quite like the character...sadly.\n\nIf anyone is interested in great acting check out \"Streetcar\" for Vivien Leigh's Academy Award winning performance.

The main quality of the movie is shown in the brilliant performances by Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando and Kim Hunter. Actually, the whole ensemble cast is perfect. So sorrowful, full of anger, tormenting and haunting story about a great tragedy, loss of innocence and degradation of love. Ella Kazan directed this movie based on a classic play with a great attention to details, showing every aspect in an utmost shocking manner. While the disaster seems inevitable, the final scene and its horror are still more powerful than anyone could've imagined. A legendary movie, so distressing and depressing in its clarity, that it makes it unable to be forgotten.",
