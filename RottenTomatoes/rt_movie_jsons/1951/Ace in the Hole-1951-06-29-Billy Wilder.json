    "summary": "With flaws that outweigh his talent, reporter Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) has bounced across the country from job to job. Winding up in New Mexico, Tatum gets work from the local newspaper, but finds that there's not much in the way of pressing news. However, when Tatum catches wind of a treasure hunter (Richard Benedict) trapped in a mineshaft, he turns the story into a media sensation. Soon Tatum is using unscrupulous tactics to draw out the situation, an approach that comes back to haunt him.",

Winding up in New Mexico, Tatum gets work from the local newspaper, but finds that there's not much in the way of pressing news. However, when Tatum catches wind of a treasure hunter (Richard Benedict) trapped in a mineshaft, he turns the story into a media sensation\n\nThere is something so special about Billy Wilder's films, the way that he manages to capture you in the movie from the first second of the movie, is always so special and something I can't get enough of. The screenplay written by Billy Wilder and his team is so great, there is always tension and the characters feel like they are always developing in every scene. Technically the movie looks gorgeous in black and white again, especially with the wide shots of the whole area and sets, because that set was enormous. The shots in the mountain were incredible as well and felt very challenging and psychically to shoot, the way that Billy Wilder shot it. Kirk Douglas was of course the highlight of the movie, with a performance that I will not forget soon. The rest of the cast is great as well, however they definitely don't reach the same heights that Kirk Douglas reaches. The story is gripping from the first moment and ends with an iconic shot and one that will leave you thinking about the whole movie a second time. Ace In the Hole is not my favorite work by Billy Wilder, but certainly one that is worthy in his filmography!",

            "content": "Wilder's take on the literal media circus hangs just out of range of mainstream classic territory, lacking the name recognition of similar scathing social morality tales like 12 Angry Men. However, Ace in the Hole is a towering accomplishment that only gets better with age, an unsympathetic look at media sensationalism and its inherent amorality, but touching upon deeper, universally human flaws - opportunism, the absence of empathy, and base greed. Intensely cynical and introspective, the film is not pleasant viewing but it is of exceptional quality. If there is a complaint, it's the willingness to give Tatum some benefit of the doubt with a morose, drunken regret at the results of his actions when there may have been a greater poignancy and foresight in ascribing the same level of callous opportunism that Sterling's Lorraine Minosa did, pocketing the profit and hitching a ride out once the meal ticket ran dry. Douglas is note-perfect as Tatum, don't let his popular acclaim take away from the real capability of his performances; as a macabre ringleader, Tatum orchestrates a frenzy of interest in a rescue attempt for his own gain, and as the cars roll in what was originally intended to be a mildly profitable sideline finds itself corrupting the intent of the enterprise, tacking on days to the schedule so that more papers, burgers, and tickets can be sold. And when it's all over, the tents are packed up, the cars filter away, and only footprints and garbage are left, as the circus moves on for a new source of sustaining entertainment. Fully deserving of a renewed widescale appreciation, not just among film buffs. (4.5/5)",

All of the acting is brilliant and the perfect character arc Kirk Douglas' character who goes from an ambitious reporter to using the trapped man for his own financial gain, there are no heroes in Ace In The Hole and that is what makes it so interesting.

Having made a few enemies out East and desperate for any work, he gets a job at a small newspaper in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  He figures that one day a big story will come along and this will be his ticket back into a big city newspaper.  However, after a year nothing has happened and he is very frustrated.  Then he stumbles across the plight of a man trapped in a cave, and he turns it into something big, and ongoing...\n\nGreat drama on the manipulative power of the media.  Chuck Tatum personifies all that is wrong with the media - the lies, the over-dramatization, the influencing of the story when they should just be observers, the lack of ethics.  Also shows how easily lead and herded the average person is, and how people are happy to treat life-threatening danger to others as something for their amusement.\n\nWonderfully written and directed by Billy Wilder, with some great detail that lesser directors would not have thought of (the escalating prices of admission to the park always made me laugh!). While Tatum's actions are reprehensible, his Machiavellian manipulations are so brilliant that you admire him, in a way, and this is due to Wilder's script and direction.\n\nGreat performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role.  He imbues Tatum with a bravura and conniving charm that is difficult to resist. \n\nNot a perfect movie though.  Was headed for it at one stage but loses focus a touch towards the end.  A few things feel contrived and the final scene is quite tame.  If Wilder hadn't changed tack with Tatum's character it would have made for an incredibly powerful conclusion.",

            "content": "I love the darkly sweeping orchestral score at the beginning. Forewarning us of the impending consequences that will ensue. You can already tell that Kirk Douglas' character is a rotten one. An amoral low level scum that's willing to do anything for a shot of glory. Sarcastic and disrespectful the way he greets the Native American inside the newspaper office by saying, \"How\". Omg lmao! The director of the Albuquerque newspaper wears both a belt and suspenders lol! It's scary to think that there's people out there similar to Tatum, and worse. Reporters and journalists willing to twist the news and milk a story/idea in order make a sensation out of it, especially if it means scaring or putting people into fear or panic. Like he said, \"Good news is no news\". \n\nI like the locations they picked to film in this movie. They're really showing off the beautiful parts of New Mexico. That cave dwelling looks really interesting to go and visit. Damn Tatum is clever, I do have to give him that. The way he decides to volunteer to bring the blanket and coffee to Leo who's stuck in the cave so that he can get more information for the story that he's going to write. I like the scenes inside the cave. Definitely atmospheric and eerie. See this is why you don't go messing around with dead people's things, you should leave them alone. Leo was taking Native American pottery and belongings from within the cave to sell them and it seems the spirits of the dead had enough of him taking their belongings and punished him by trapping him inside the cave where their dead bodies rest. \n\nIt's crazy the way Tatum is orchestrating the whole situation to benefit himself. Not giving a care in the world towards Leo's wellbeing and health. The way he's pulling the strings so the story can keep going, keep being relevant. Now instead of getting Leo out through the cave entrance, they're going to dig through the top of the mountain because it's going to take longer to get Leo out. I can't imagine all the psychological damage and trauma that it's going to cause Leo - having to listen to that incessant pounding all day and night. That'd drive any man crazy. That's pretty selfish of Leo's young hot blonde wife to want to abandon him and leave now that he can't chase after her, since he's stuck and all.\n\nThis movie kind of proves how dumb Americans can be and how willing they are to eat up a story as long as they make a big sensation out of it. It's disgusting to watch how they've made a whole event out of one man's misfortune. As if it's some kind of carnival or circus where everyone can come congregate and have fun. It's so stupid. Wow, I can't believe Leo contracted pneumonia. All thanks to Tatum's idea of wanting to drill from the top. If Leo dies, I don't see how Tatum can live with himself for the rest of his life. The amount of guilt that he's going to have to carry with him will be psychologically destructive. The way he gets the priest into the cave in order to bless Leo before he dies. It seems Tatum's already feeling guilty for what he's done. Tatum kinda deserved to get shanked by Lorraine and lose his story in the end. And that final shot of him falling to the ground with his cold dead eyes inches away from the camera really left an impression on me. What an ending. \n\nA masterclass of cinema. This is how you make a hard hitting and impactful movie. Kirk Douglas really nailed it out of the park with his gritty and visceral performance as Chuck Tatum. Regardless of its dark themes, it's a pivotal, essential and forever relevant film that warns us about the dangers, critical impact and influence that the media/news can have on its people - especially Americans. This is a damn good fantastic movie that should be watched in one's lifetime. I'd definitely watch it again.",

Highly entertaining noir, with the heel and the blonde - but the heel here doesn't let the blonde get in his way.\nThe blonde is played by Jan Sterling in a performance reminiscent of Shelley \nWinters. And the heel is played in his typical energetic fashion by Kirk Douglas. But it is Billy Wilder's film - producer, director and co-writer. Genius.\nThe authentic use of outdoor photography, even in black and white, adds hugely to the movie's effectiveness.\nSPOILER ALERT: \nI would have liked the film to continue on to see the sheriff get his comeuppance. And the late Chuck Tatum's fellow newspapermen (esp. his editor Boot) could have written it all up to our satisfaction.\nOf course since the 50s, the media have been exposed for their corruption or subservience over and over.",

A society become paradigm of a world gazing at success' mirror. Billy Wilder was so predictive as he didn't run into critics favors because of his brazen exhibition of a herald falsification realm: that is journalism.\n\nIt's journalist Charles Tatum's arrogant face that fills up black-and-white scenes of this sublime tableau Billy Wilder sketched out in 1951. He puts in the foreground the black soul of a reporter dumped from all the American biggest newspapers, expelled for his deviances (he's a conman, a drinker, and a playboy), and forced to beg for a job in a suburban newspaper in Albuquerque.\n\nA proud man who has known footlights and now doesn't accept to remain in the backstage; a man longing for a payback that takes on revenge's violent connotations and it makes Wilder's Chuck Tatum one of the meanest characters of the cinema history: an overbearing, selfish, ruthless man. He is a journalist who knows how to profit by chance - e.g. Indians' graves looter Leo Mimosa trapped inside the cave - and how to turn it into his personal opportunity to come back in the Press circle, under spotlights of the whole world.\n\nAs a handy poker player, Tatum pulls out the ace in the hole: the case becomes a story, the story becomes a scoop, the scoop becomes a hit. And he is the factotum of the game, the fire-eater calling the shots of the show he sets up with an arriviste sheriff and a dissatisfied woman (Leo's wife) in the arid dusty Escudero. So, where there was nothing but a wretched lodging in the center of nothing now there is a crowded carnival, and from every quarter it comes people to attend Leo Mimosa's rescue; Tatum surreptitiously protracts this intervention in order to boost a story on which he had imprinted his brand name.\n\nHugo Friedhofer's grave soundtrack sharpens the echo of overwhelming oppression used upon everybody by the reporter till to crush Leo's wife (Jan Starling) not to run away and to trap her in his bogus gimmick (but she will injure him not far from the tragic epilogue). In fact, his plan screws up because Leo (Richard Benedict) starts suffering from pneumonia under the landslide. The hole puncher try to get to him while time flies out (and his life does the same). The man who had to be saved is dead: \"Leo Mimosa is dead\", Chuck Tatum shouts out from the top of the mountain: he cries out to the public gathered down in the dusty plains and to the journalists arrived from all over the Nation to take notes on the story. And he also makes the cry roaring inside himself as though he can atone for his petty plan.\n\nBut it's too late: tragedy's completed. And Tatum's alcohol-deformed face fills up the last shot: he lies down on the Albuquerque newspaper's newsroom pavement becoming the dark side of the show. He stands for the emotional desert of a show created at all costs. He stands for a society dazzled by evanescent things, a society eager to chase the twinkling excess and unable to recognize the goodness of truth.",

Perfs generally great, but this in purely Kirk Douglas's show...and it's tough to imagine it working as well with someone else in the role...he plays a despicable bottom-feeder - but, hey! - he's Kirk Douglas! - so his natural charm and confidence are almost as seductive to the audience as to the characters.

            "content": "Ace in the Hole is the story of a reporter played by Kirk Douglas who has to settle for working for a small town newspaper after burning a lot of bridges in the big cities. However he dreams of working his way back by turning the simple story of a man trapped in a mine into national news. Along the way he makes a lot of questionable decisions to keep the story going, and that's where the movie really gets interesting. Some of the conversations that Douglas has with other characters about how the media can manufacture a news story is very intriguing and still relevant today. I was totally impressed by Kirk Douglas's performance. He is the most intelligent guy in the room, and certainly takes control of most situations. Yet he still manages to be someone I was rooting for throughout the film. It's not easy to play someone with extreme ego and determination, but also show some heart and conscience behind that, but Douglas has the talent to do that. Jan Sterling is the heartless wife of the trapped man, and she is absolutely despicable (which is exactly what the role calls for, so this isn't really a complaint.) Porter Hall was exceptional as Boot (the editor of the newspaper.) He becomes the physical embodiment of truth, and plagues Douglas as the character who represents the conscience of the movie. Finally I should mention Richard Benedict as the man trapped in the mine. He is so nice and friendly that it's hard to watch him suffer. His slow descent into despair is played amazingly, and almost brought me to tears later in the movie.\n\nThat emotional core is what I was most impressed with while watching Ace in the Hole. I was totally invested in the story, and found myself running the gamut of emotions throughout. I was so strongly affected that I sat in silence after the film ended, until my wife asked me what was wrong. The performances were great, but the script is what really drove it all home. There were a lot of lines where people were saying one thing while clearly meaning something different, and they trusted the audience enough to follow what was going on without holding our hands. The look of the film was good for a black and white film, they used some really creative camera placement, and the interior of the cave felt very authentic. It's worth mentioning that I watched this on the Criterion DVD, which has brilliantly restored the video and audio. I could easily praise this film all day, it was one of the best films from the early fifties that I've ever seen. Also the themes are still poignant to this day despite the fact that newspapers are dying. Ace in the Hole takes a real look at how the media executes a story and can indirectly influence events so that they can make it as big a story as possible. Add this to the list of films I highly recommend you watch, it's a winner.",

As bad as he is, Lorraine (Jan Sterling), wife of Leo, the man stuck in the hole, is even worse. From her first appearance on the screen, she's more than ready to leave with her husband stuck underground without a second thought, because she's not getting what she wants. She represents the absolute worst in people, and Douglas barely has to do anything other than make her stay to milk the 'grieving widow' role.

Familiar at taking a swipe at societies idealized institutions which is obviously reflected through his body of work: From the degrading of Hollywood's idealized commodities in \"Sunset Boulevard,\" the dark side of human nature within \"Double Indemnity\" and the cynical characteristics of the business corporation in the fifties within \"The Apartment,\" Wilder was most definitely a man that contained audacity. Besides such films, Wilder continued such wondrous efforts with the Kirk Douglas vehicle \"Ace in the Hole.\" A film   that continues Wilder's challenging efforts on exploring human nature - 'Human interest' - and its relations to the media.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the cynical down-and-out journalist Chuck Tatum who finds a small-time job within Albuquerque. However, Tatum exploits the trapping of man (Benedict) to gain his way back to fortune through a journey of morality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Tatum's world is that it's filled with not one likable character. Each individual is motivated cynically rather than democratically. Wilder constructs it beautifully as we watch each individual gain a sense of luxury on the behalf of Tatum's exploitation of the trapped Leo (Benedict), which ultimately makes us question the nature of human morality. Tatum's comments highlights such themes \"Bad news sells best. Cause good news is no news.\" Besides Wilder's thematical brilliance, Douglas is mesmerizing. From his cynical nature and uncompromising motivations (slap sequence), it's quite astonishing after watching Kubrick's \"Paths of Glory\" to notice Douglas' chameleon ability in switching from the moral to the immoral.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, \"Ace in the Hole\" has aged beautifully within it's relation to the media and its cynical nature, but the theme ultimately seems tiresome. Nevertheless, I personally love directors that are willing to challenge the norm - especially within the conventions of the superior Hollywood - by making a film that succeeds as a moral statement towards the human condition.",

            "content": "A brilliant, dark satire that features a top-notch performance from Kirk Douglas. There are two separate stories that inspired Billy Wilder and the writers for Ace in the Hole. They were both about people who got stuck and the reporters that blew up the stories in the papers. Sadly enough, neither of them survived. What's explored in Ace in the Hole is the question as to whether or not journalists have too strong of a hand in the way things can be played out. They have so much power. If you can get the public to read what you have to say then you can sway anyone high enough that could possibly want something from you. Chuck Tatum's a nasty man. You can see it in his eyes: he's willing to do anything for a big story just to get back to New York and get out of his crummy new job. Of course he went in basically on his hands and knees trying to get this crummy new job, even though he plays it up like he's only doing the paper a favor. After a year of staying where he doesn't want to, Tatum is sent out on a job with a fresh college graduate. They are going to travel and cover the story of a snake hunt (or so I believe that's the original story). On the way there they discover a man has been trapped in a mine. No one else knows about this yet and Tatum realizes what he's got on his hands: a story he can turn huge and get people's attention. But he can't simply give the facts and let the story play out. No, it can't be that easy. Instead he tells the rescue team to drill from the top to take more time and they only listen because Tatum already has the corrupted sheriff on his side. He's told the sheriff he will give him praises in his paper and not talk about his absence as long as if he gets him what he wants. Plus, the longer he's down there and the more they look like they're working hard, the better it is for the both of them. Then there's Lorraine Minosa, the wife of Leo, the guy stuck down in the mine. She's ready to leave and never come back because he promised her a life that she didn't get. Of course Tatum stops her from leaving and shows her how much money she can make by the travelers coming by to see what's going on with Leo. She starts to charge people to come around the mine and she even gets tons of service in the restaurant. She's making thousands of dollars. A carnival even comes to set up outside of the mine. It becomes a huge event where everyone hangs around, excited to be on television and see what's going on. The first couple to arrive after reading in the paper about Leo make a second appearance when they go on TV to state they were there first. As if anyone really cares. Is the news really something that should bring out thousands of people? Especially news of a man who might die? The second act mainly follows the slow descent of Leo's situation and Tatum making more sleazy choices. Lorraine starts becoming attracted to Tatum, and we see her try to come onto him and he tells her to stop smiling because it's bad for the story. When she tells him to make her stop smiling in a flirtatious way he smacks her in the face. He tells her to keep that upset look and tears because that's the way she should be. No matter what, Tatum continually beats down Lorraine just so his story can have the humanism of a wife who cares for her husband. Everything turns when Tatum discovers that Leo's actually sick and might die if he doesn't get out of there soon. The only problem is that they are too far in drilling to do anything else. He begins to help Leo take steps towards his death, like getting a priest and listening to him tell about the gift he has for his wife for their five year anniversary. Tatum finds the gift and gives it to Lorraine, hoping that she will finally feel guilty like him. But she doesn't. She doesn't even like the gift. She can buy a better and real fur scarf herself because of all the money she's made. Perhaps Leo was a greedy man, but he didn't deserve to die, which is why it's so heartbreaking when he does. We can feel the pain inside Tatum. The guilt keeps swelling without a hint of disappearing. Tatum continues to search for redemption but no one will listen to his confession. They don't care. His story's ruined and everyone's sad that Leo died. It's all over now. The twisted ending consists of Lorraine stabbing Tatum for beating her down so often then him going back to his job and saying a similar line to the beginning, he's worth $1,000, before he collapses and dies. Billy Wilder knew what he was doing here. Not only is there a deep meaning to his story, but on the surface level you get interesting characters and none of them are good people. It just goes to show you why Billy Wilder was one of the best masterful filmmakers there ever was.",

This is a knockout for several reasons. It's a film noir, so you know there's cool, mysterious characters that will do anything to end up on top. Second, it's a Billy Wilder, and if you've heard of him, you know that he's a master of his craft. Third, it stars Kirk Douglas. Now he may not look like much today, since he's 95 years old, but the dude is a legend, and was a stud 61 years ago. It also stars Jan Sterling. Now I had no idea who that was, but turns out she's a damn good actress! The film is an excellent social commentary on journalism. Another similar film that's equally fantastic is Sweet Smell Of Success. Both of them use journalism to exploit people/events, and both use very tongue-in-cheek dialogue. I was lucky to get to see this at Nick Digilio's Chicago Film Club (Rosemont's Muvico). By the way, the theater was 21 and over, alcoholic drinks allowed, huge seats, and a 4k digital projectionâ¦niiiice. But wait, there's more! Nick introduced the film and held a discussion after, so yes, I was smiling the entire night haha. In the discussion, he explained that if this movie has a counterpart, it would easily be Network, for its portrayal of a television network (also brought to you by another film icon, Sidney Lumet). So if you're a film nut like me, definitely do not miss this oneâ¦err, even if you have missed it for the last 60 years.",

Its scenes in the caves manage to convey how we would feel if we were in the predicament that the unfortunate Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) finds himself in, but they come across as slightly repetitive and ultimately, the film is better during the scenes where Tatum gets into arguments with his colleagues and rivals. A bit more focus on the satirical side of the film might have improved as well as giving a more complete analysis of the relationship between Tatum and Leo's wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) would have helped, but this still gets the thumbs up on the fact that it never stops making us not care about how the film ends.",

Much like how The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is the pessimistic John Ford film, Ace in the Hole is Wilder's. This is a cynical look at how just depraved we can become with the influence of the media and those who exploit the less fortunate. There is a lot of darkness surrounding this film and it brings out the worst in all of us. In addition, it shows just how gleefully we're willing to go along with the crowd even though we know someone is in dire need of help; we simply don't care, we just go along with the carnival. However, this is one of the most impressive films made, it doesn't make light of the situation and it presents it's characters as honestly as possible. It doesn't get any truer than this, and this film speaks volumes.",

So he engineers the story, extends it, fakes it.  And the story builds from there.  Kirk Douglas has rarely been better, and though this film was under-regarded for a long time, it is slowly gaining critical respect.  It deserves it.  This is a very modern story, even more relevent in the 21st century and the corruption of British journalists bringing down a newspaper - worth tracking down, worth seeing.",
