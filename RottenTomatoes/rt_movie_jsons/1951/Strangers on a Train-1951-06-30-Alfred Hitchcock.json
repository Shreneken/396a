I stayed 'til the end and for a Hitchcock film found it very disappointing; as there's no twist or reveal.   Was the audience supposed to swallow that merry go-round on steroids?  Sorry, but anyone would know that machinery wasn't capable of reaching high RPM.  Alfred really needed to have the script writers do a plausible revision - as in \"Get Me Rewrite - NOW!\"",

The darkness Vs light from the very beginning with shoe colours were artistically made by Hitchcock.\n\nFirst few seconds of Tennis match felt boring but it soon got tensed with 'lighter inside drain' and Guy running out of time. The whole Tennis match was filmed okay.\n\nMy main problem will be the climax, it gets too comical for a whole noir setting, some character decisions felt doubtful at the end.

            "content": "Strangers on a Train is classic Hitchcock, a film noir thriller that sees an innocent man dragged into a spiralling nightmare beyond his control following a chance meeting on a train. It's a gripping movie with a pair of excellent performances from its stars, but it's also a textbook example of Hitchcock's technique as a director.\nThe story sees tennis player Guy Haines encountering stranger Bruno Antony whilst travelling by train and engaging in what proves to be an ill-advised conversation: realising that Guy hates his wife as much as he hates his father, Bruno proposes that they swap murders and promptly dispatches Guy's wife Miriam without waiting for Guy to agree. Naturally, having done so, he expects Guy to complete his side of the \"bargain\" and decides to frame him when Guy refuses. The plot follows the story: there aren't any real surprises, but it nevertheless remains gripping seeing how Guy deals with his newfound nemesis.\nA large part of the success is due to the leads: the underrated Farley Granger is very convincing as Guy Haines, bringing both vulnerability and strength to the role in equal measure, whilst Robert Walker is magnetic as charismatic psychopath Bruno, playing the character with restraint but still making him seem totally unhinged, for example when he's discussing how to commit murder with Mrs Cunningham and nearly strangles her when he has a flashback to his murder of Miriam. The performances of the guest cast members are solid if unremarkable, with the exception of Hitchcock's daughter Patricia who gives a wonderful turn as Barbara Morton, the younger sister of Guy's girlfriend Anne who perceptively and bluntly points out just how guilty Guy might seem to the police following Miriam's murder.\nBut as with many of Hitchcock's films, the real success of Strangers on a Train is down to his direction. It's an object lesson in cinema-craft, as he takes the themes of the screenplay and uses them as the basis for a whole range of motifs. One of the most obvious is the theme of doubles, which leaps out at the audience whether you've read about it or not: early in the film there are tennis doubles, drinks that are doubles, and Hitchcock carrying a double bass in his customary cameos. Granger and Walker are physically similar in colouring in build and of course the script plays with the idea of them being doubles of a sort, or at last mirror images: both men who might gain from murder, one willing to commit it and one not. This is made subtly obvious through little details, for example Guy wears black shoes, whilst Bruno wears white ones: our first shot of the characters is of their feet colliding under a table. Dimitri Tiomkin's soundtrack, which has specific themes for the two main characters, and juxtaposes them at key points, serves to emphasise this.\nThe idea of Guy and Bruno as opposing figures is reflected in the lighting, for example when Bruno appears from the shadows opposite Guy's home after he's murdered Miriam. Robert Burks' cinematography seems to have been inspired by films noir, and there are some memorable shots, for example when Bruno is seen in the distance, standing on the steps of the Capitol. And at its most basic level, the film simply benefits from Hitchcock's usual flair: Guy's struggle to win his tennis match is intercut with Bruno's struggle to retrieve the cigarette lighter after he drops it down a drain, whilst the climactic fight between the pair on the out-of-control carousel is shot in ways that capture both the claustrophobia and terrifying speed of being entangled with the wooden horses. \nHitchcock reportedly wasn't entirely satisfied with the final edit of Strangers on a Train, nor with the so-called \"British version\". But whilst Hitchcock may have been unsatisfied with the finished film \u2013 and whilst it isn't as near-perfect as his finest movies \u2013 it remains a rollickingly good demonstration of the master at work.",

            "content": "A gripping murder plot with silly antics.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's suspense thriller Strangers on a Train (1951) is thoroughly entertaining, but not one of the legendary director's masterpieces. Strangers on a Train takes a dual murder scenario based off a chance encounter, then flips it into a tense framing plot.\n\nThe problem with Strangers on a Train lies in the sheer coincidence of that the narrative relies on in every scene. It all fits too nicely to just work itself out. The two leads happen to meet on a train, witnesses happen to see the couple fight in the store, a man happens to witness the murderer leave the carnival, and finally that the murderer would try to replace the lighter he took from the victim's husband. Too many pure chance moments are relied upon for Strangers on a Train to work out the way it does, so I just wish Hitchcock had ironed out the script more.\n\nThere are many just ridiculous moments in Strangers on a Train. First of all, that any man would sit there and listen to someone suggest a double murder \"criss-cross\" plan even if he were to dismiss is hardly realistic. The merry-go-round could not possibly go that fast. The police shoot the operator that makes it spin fast non-stop too. It's all kind of awkward and contrived just to get to some fun scenes.\n\nFarley Granger is a great sympathetic lead. His vigorous tennis match is a highlight of Strangers on a Train. I like how he displays paranoia as the killer follows him around. Robert Walker plays a psychopathic murderer that is an apathetic rich boy with a lust for the eccentric. Walker eats up the scenery and appears charming at first, if too friendly, then he delves into hatred and revenge.\n\nI do love Dimitri Tiomkin's paranoid score that rises with the tense sequences.

Now, it's true both the book and the movie are fiction.  But after reading Patricia Highsmith's brilliant book (about an alcoholic gay man, \n Bruno) killing Guy's wife and then laying trap after trap in which Guy (a straight architect) is pulled deeper and deeper into Bruno's web is a sensational psychological thriller.

And just like its opening sequence, Hitchcock has you hooked from the first footage and similar to it, the storytelling is fluent and gripping. The conversations are pragmatic and are brimmed with humor and ironic drama that is imputed smoothly without any compromise on the track. The concept is very amusing and yet convincing through brilliant execution, and has the potential to boost off the film for the entire feature. Hitchcock uses the props and creates an arc out of them like a character where the entire feature ends up hanging on it.\n\nWisely, the makers aren't confined on delivering the rudimentary process of investigation along with the usual cat and mouse chase. Instead, the screenplay is quite fast paced and is always ready to evolve with a smarter script that keeps the audience on the brisk, with its gritty ideology and metaphorical cinematography that helps view this tale with a more brighter and clearer lens. The performance isn't extraordinary or eye popping but as far as cynicism is concerned Walker's body language does give you the chills.\n\nAnd on the other hand the victim of the film, Granger unfortunately doesn't have much range to factor in effectively especially since his character is basically a scaredy cat for the most part of it. This meticulous novel is adapted with smart editing and crispy cinematic sequences bubbled up (especially the followed up or the aftermath of the crime that is wound up in one big scene) from it that remains the highlight of it and stays with you even after you leave the screen.

The story dips its toe in the murkiness just enough for you the audience member to still identify with the protagonist (I'm looking at you \"A Place In The Sun\"), whilst still feeling the heat from the dangerous place he keeps drawing closer towards. The irony and intrigue is played up to tremendously entertaining effect, often resulting in the unmitigated gasp or jaw-drop. And the ending is just the right mix of everything I love in a Hitchcock climax: intense, action-packed, and unnecessarily, yet somehow still necessarily (?) zany and hilarious all at the same time.

I also didn't have any idea how it would end, which kept me interested all the way through. \n\nFarley Granger was good as the protagonist, but this movie works because of the oily charm of Robert Walker. I absolutely loved his performance as Bruno and wondered why I've never seen his name as one of the greatest movie villains of all time. The rest of the cast is also solid, especially Kasey Rogers who is perfectly sweet-looking and yet wicked as Guy's wife, which is exactly what that role needed.\n\nI would have adored this movie if it weren't for some issues in the third act. There's a long sequence where it seems that the movie is just stalling and that bugged me. I think the intent was to increase tension as everyone approached the climax, but by delaying both parties it started to feel pointless. I was almost annoyed waiting for things to finally resolve. The idea was good, I just found the execution lacking in that section of the film. \n\nThe other issue I had was with the carousel sequence at the end, which seemed a little over-the-top and almost ridiculous. It had some exciting moments and certainly was shot in an interesting way. But the sequence was just odd, and perhaps a bit far fetched. I was satisfied with how it ended, though. By the conclusion of the film, I was satisfied with Strangers on a Train, but not as wowed as I expected after the way it got started. It's a solid Hitchcock film, but one I won't revisit as often.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies - it has a fantastic premise and cast, and also one of his very best murder scenes (and that's saying something!)    Hitchcock uses great economy in the first half of the film; right out of the chute two strangers meet on a train, and one proposes the 'perfect murder', one in which there is no apparent motive because the two simply 'criss cross' murders for each other.\n\nRobert Walker is absolutely perfect as the sociopath who proposes this scheme to the straight-laced tennis player, played well by Farley Granger.  He wants his overbearing father out of the picture, and knows that Granger wants a divorce from his wife, having done his homework.  Granger politely declines, and while his motivation increases when his adulterous wife (Laura Elliot) manipulatively tells him she no longer wants to split from him in the next scene, he still wants no part of murder.  However, in the very next scene Walker goes forward with his 'end of the bargain' anyway, stalking Elliot at a carnival in an outstanding sequence.   She's aware of him staring at her and even flirts with him a little bit, and as he follows her through the Tunnel of Love out to 'Magic Isle' it's seriously spine-tingling.  Hitchcock shows her getting strangled in a reflection from her glasses which have fallen to the ground.   These first few scenes, from the train to Magic Isle, are a masterpiece.\n\nGranger is of course horrified to hear about this, and while he intends to move on to woman he's already been seeing (Ruth Roman), he doesn't intend on committing a murder he never agreed to.  Walker begins stalking him and putting pressure on him, and there are fantastic scenes at the Jefferson Memorial (him staring down a distance and high up on the stairs), as well as at a tennis match (the crowd following a volley, turning their heads back and forth; Walker staring straight ahead at Granger).   \n\nIt is true that the film slows down slightly in the second half, but it's by no means 'slow' - there are several other great scenes, we feel real tension as Granger finds himself mired in a creepy lunatic's fantasy come to life (channeling Hitchcock's 'wrong man' theme), and it has a thrilling climax, but I won't spoil it any further.   I have to say I loved the spunky character played by Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, and it's a shame she didn't get more work as an actor.  It's also a shame that Robert Walker died at age 32, shortly after the film's release.   He certainly lives on in this role, and this film more than stands the test of time.   Excellent.",

Merry-go-round scene still spectacular but plotting a bit cumbersome, with police behaving like plods in the background almost the whole time.\nI agree with Bosley Crowther in the New York Times when the film was originally released that \"the story does not stand\". Hitchcock with his scriptwriters had drastically altered Patricia Highsmith's original story so that in major ways the plot hardly bore any resemblance to hers.\nWatch the English version/release which has extra final scene involving a clergyman. It helps the movie enormously.",

Master director Alfred Hitchcock builds the tension well and creates a seemingly inescapable web for the  victim to break out of.  The Hitchcock signature tricks are all there: the camera angles, zoom in/outs, the drawing out of seconds into minutes, the race against the clock.

This film would have been good without Walker, but it is exceptional because of Walker.  His eerily calm manner and piercing eyes convey his character's lunacy brilliantly.

            "content": "\"I have the perfect weapon right here: these two hands.\"\n\nIn my opinion, Hitchcock's Golden Age was definitely the 50's when he released some of his most beloved classic films: Rear Window, North by Northwest, and Vertigo. I'd include Psycho on that list as well which was released in 1960. But in 1951, the Master of Suspense directed a wonderful thriller which could've very well been considered among that group if it weren't for some minor flaws near the end. Strangers on a Train hooks you from the very beginning as the camera follows the footsteps of two separate men getting on a train. Their feet bump into each other and the camera reveals who they are: Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Antony (Robert Walker). Bruno instantly recognizes Guy, an up and coming tennis player who is currently dating Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), a Senator's daughter. We hear this from Bruno's mouth who tells Guy everything he's read about him in the papers. Bruno introduces himself as a wealthy socialite and despite his psychotic behavior, Guy listens to him patiently while he waits for his next stop. The conversation serves as a very practical way to introduce us to the backstory of these characters. He claims to know that Guy is married to Miriam (Kasey Rogers) who has been unfaithful to him many times over the past and is waiting for a divorce settlement to be able to marry his new love. Bruno goes on saying that it would be much easier to simply murder his wife and he gives him the perfect solution: they can cross murders. Bruno wants his millionaire father out of the picture and believes Guy could do him the favor. Guy thinks Bruno is simply kidding and gets off at the next stop, but what he doesn't know is that Bruno is serious about his offer and plans to stick with his own made up plan.  \n  \nWatching the film today, the plot sounds very familiar to dozens of thrillers that have been released since, but I can't say with certainty if in 1951 this was a unique idea. The screenplay was adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel and it is perhaps one of the greatest strengths of the film. What I can say is that Hitchcock handles the suspense in a very engaging way, building interesting characters and tense situations. Farley Granger and Ruth Roman play a believable and likable couple who the audience easily can identify with, but it is Robert Walker who steals the show. Walker plays his psychotic character to perfection, and during the first half of the film he is portrayed as a very clever and disturbed person that will keep you guessing as to what he might do next. His proposal during the beginning of the film is delivered in a very tempting way and he succeeded at creating an uncomfortable atmosphere on that train alongside Granger. The scene where he follows Miriam through a fair ground is also very memorable. Hitchcock set the perfect thriller during the first half of the film, but unfortunately he put too much effort in the climax making some of the suspense feel forced at times instead of letting the story unfold naturally. It is a shame that Walker passed away shortly after the film was released because it would've been interesting to see what he could do next working alongside Hitchcock. Bruno is one of the best psychotic characters I've seen on screen, but the ending did leave me unsatisfied.  \n\nStrangers on a Train doesn't only deliver clever thrills, but it also has several moments of dark humor as well. His daughter, Patricia Hitchcock, plays Anne's sister and she has some of the funniest scenes of the movie. The relationship between Bruno and his mother, played by Marion Lorne, is also full of dark humor especially during the first scene in which they are shown together. That is what I enjoyed the most during the first half of the film which managed to set an interesting (although familiar by now) premise and balance the suspense with Hitchcock's sense of humor. That dark humor disappears during the second half and everything centers exclusively on the suspense where I believe Hitchcock tried a bit too hard to force things. Even Walker's character loses some of his psychotic charm here and the film takes a much more predictable turn. Strangers on a Train is a very entertaining movie, but that first half had so much potential that this could've been one of Hitchcock's greatest films if that balance weren't lost in the second half.      \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Most of them wide shots, but it gets to the point where the villain just being in the same room brings a tingle to your spine. Something bad is going to happen everywhere he goes and that's what makes a villain. Farley Granger plays a rising star thrown into the clutches of a madman who has schemes that would make any sane person cringe. Perfect for Hitch. He gets right in and causes chaos. First a chance meeting on a train, and then a downward spiral into places one would rather not venture. Like North by Northwest, Hitchcock sends his character's where they don't want to go, taking their lives and sense from them. Robert Walker is near brilliant and the rest of the cast deliver in one of Hitchcock's strangest love and death triangles. Worth the watch, it will not fail to unveil something new and haunting every time.",

The moment that the crazy dude decides what his final act of revenge will be the movie pulls a Tony Hawk style 900. The tennis match was disgustingly long. It was clear that they were trying to build suspense but they failed miserably and instead bored the shit out of me. The part with the lighter in the sewer is a horseshit close-call that they threw in to basically make the movie longer. The ending was nothing other than bad. I hated every moment of the last half-hour. This movie was FUBAR at the midway point and if you dont know what FUBAR is then go watch a good movie like Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. 4.5/10",

            "content": "\"Strangers on a train, strangers on a train, into this house we're... um... named... or something.\" I could have really evoked some sighs with a \"Snakes on a Plane\" reference, but this film is even way too old for The Doors' \"Riders on the Storm\", and that is old. Of course, it's not too old for \"The Lady Vanishes\", so I reckon you could call this second Alfred Hitchcock train thriller \"The Lady Vanishes II: Keep Myself Riding on This Train\". Oops, there's an anachronism that's even more embarrassing, because I'm not even particularly crazy about Kasabian, you likely don't know Kasabian's \"Underdog\", and this film is by no means as British as \"The Lady Vanishes\". Yeah, I don't know about you guys, but I feel that Hitchcock needed a serious break from Britain after \"Stage Fright\", which kind of showed that Hitchcock was by no means getting any less rusty with British filmmaking after \"Jamaica Inn\". Well, Hitch, you were never a stranger in Hollywood, so I hope you enjoyed the ride to your new true home, and didn't give a stranger the idea of committing a murder or anything like that. Jeez, at this point, I figured that's how he most enjoyed his train rides, and I can't say I can blame him entirely, because he sure made these kind of train rides interesting, at least to a certain extent.\n\nBoth consistently compelling throughout its length and, well, not really all that lengthy to begin with, at only a notch over 100 minutes, the film still outstays its welcome on occasion, or at least seems to, as it meanders along certain areas in material, until it seems to lose its focus, in addition to yours. Of course, the somewhat lazy plotting within Raymond Chandler's, Whitfield Cook's and Czenzi Ormonde's script isn't helped by those moments of excessiveness which get the film to an unreasonable, if still seemingly tight length, which isn't to say that the structure of this drama is the only overblown attribute to storytelling. Further bloating is found within the dramatics of this thriller, whose histrionics' sting is compensated for enough by inspired storytelling for you to take the drama's meat in its context, yet can be obscured for only so long before you begin to question the logic of this thriller, whose most distinctly Hollywood tastes in dialogue and tensions prove to be kind of bland in their being so overblown. If nothing else feels rather lazy about the Hollywood histrionics, it's their simply being tropes, though not the only ones, as this film follows a formulaic path that is watered down enough by the aforementioned aimlessness, let alone by the familiarity. Even the flaws just mentioned are formulaic in an Alfred Hitchcock film, and yet, don't take that as a reflection of the degree of conventionalism which plagues the final product, because at this point, the usual Hitchcock missteps are easier to forgive, and it helps that they're actually pretty limited here, even if they do still stand. No, what most threatens the film is natural limitations, which are themselves limited, as opposed to the strengths that carry the film as pretty decidedly rewarding, yet perhaps could have carried the final product even further if it wasn't for the boundaries set by the minimalism of this do-little subject matter, reinforced by questionable areas in pacing and dramatic storytelling that keep the final product from really standing out. The film starts out pretty promising in its subtle intensity, but as things progress, momentum dips, yet not so deeply that compellingness isn't salvaged time and again, from the depths of a small-scale, though still pretty worthy idea.\n\nA traditional story of a murderer dragging an innocent man into a major criminal situation upon misunderstanding his intentions in regards to a burden on the innocent man's life, this film's narrative may have only so much to its scale, but thematically, its ideas as a study on the dark depths of criminal investigation and, for that matter, humanity itself offer plenty of dramatic potential that, if well-explored by the storytelling execution, can transcend the natural shortcomings. The natural shortcomings are ultimately pretty palpable, as screenwriters Raymond Chandler, Whitfield Cook and Czenzi Ormonde don't seem to be inspired enough in the long run to obscure limitations to depth, and only make matters worse through the repetitious, melodramatic and conventional material, yet what they do right is done very right, with most dialogue being pretty clever, and certain dramatic set pieces being rather audacious in their tight attention to intrigue. There's a lot of wit and guts, even on paper, and that draws you enough into this intense drama, with well-rounded characterization that offers memorable leads securing the script's value, brought to life even by this character drama's driving forces: the characters' portrayers. Material is a little stale in retrospect, but for this time, the acting is pretty solid across the board, and that especially goes for the leads, with Farley Granger carrying both charisma and the dramatic depth that sells the anxiety of a man who fears that he might be at blame for a crime he didn't intend to be done, while Robert Walker, as the murderer, has enough subtle intensity and, if you will, charm to his presence to nail a sociopathic sense which defines the disturbed Bruno Anthony antagonist. When the performances really shine, they're revelatory, but they're never less than compelling throughout this film that is so heavily driven by its human factor, thus, a colorful cast carries a good deal of this drama, yet perhaps couldn't have done so if they weren't so well-orchestrated by a certain other talented performer. Indeed, the final product's engagement value is truly secured by Alfred Hitchcock's direction, whose style utilizes airtight framing and cinematographer Robert Burks' haunting plays on shadow-heavy lighting in order to chill, both aesthetically and in the context of biting substance that Hitchcock's quiet meditativeness treats with enough subtlety to steadily, but surely, immerse you into the full depths of this thriller. The well-done, but still pretty Hollywood script could have shaken the subtlety, grace and overall effectiveness of the final product, but Hitchcock's inspired performance as storyteller overshadows enough shortcomings to grip time after time, with enough style and substance to reward with yet another classic thriller.\n\nBottom line, there's a certain minimalism to this story concept whose emphasis through moments of questionable pacing and dramatics, in addition to conventionalism, threaten the final product, whose story still has enough meat - brought to life by clever writing, solid acting and inspired direction - to make Alfred Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\" a slickly clever and biting, and altogether rewarding dramatic thriller.\n\n3/5 - Good",

There are two incredible shots, one involving a murder as seen through the victim's fallen eyeglasses and another of Bruno sitting still in the middle of the tennis stands as the rest of the viewers are moving their heads left and right. Hitchcock uses objects like a lighter, a name tag, and glasses as plot devices to move the story forward. Robert Walker as Bruno easily has the best performance of the cast. The story in abstract is very intriguing and exciting, I just wasn't incredibly attached to the actors playing the characters or even the world compared to the other, better works by the director. And I kind of know what's going to happen in the end during most Hitchcock films as I am watching them or they're not particularly surprising, even if they are precisely crafted.",

            "content": "Two total strangers, one a tennis player named Guy Haines (Farley Granger), a man who wants to divorce his wife Miriam (Laura Elliott) in order to marry a senator's daughter (Ruth Roman), while the other stranger is the wealthy Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), who hates his rich father (Jonathan Hale). Bruno has the idea where the two exchange murders of the two they hate so much so there would be no connection and everything would go as normal. Guy, believing Bruno to be a sick psychopath, wants no part of it. But when Bruno murders Miriam anyway, Guy gets the blame, and Bruno does everything in his path to get Guy to murder his father, even if it means stalking.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock makes a memorable cameo as a man carrying a bass instrument onto a train, while Hitchcock veteran Leo G Carroll plays the Senator.\n\nDuring the 1940's, Hitchcock was on a roll, making hugely popular and suspenseful films, such as Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, and Notorious. But in the later part of the decade, some of Hitchcock's films were viewed as disappointments, with many considering that Hitchcock was losing his touch. But when Strangers on a Train was released in 1951, people changed their minds, and Hitchcock spent the rest of the decade making some of his most famous works, such as To Catch a Thief, Rear Window, Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and North by Northwest. But how does Hitchcock's comeback film turn out? The answer is a big, fat yes.\n\nStrangers on a Train shows how pure genius Hitchcock really is and proves to Hollywood and all of America that nobody can make a pure suspenseful ride quite like The Master of Suspense. There's a clear reason why a film involving a double murder works so well, and it would have to be the fact that Hitchcock was once accused of murdering someone, even though he was innocent. He used his own experience to make a richly drawn film involving a similar story.\n\nThe cast is excellent. Farley Granger is well done as the tennis player who wants to forget the crazy plan, Ruth Roman is attractive and entertaining as the love interest, and I'm surprised that she wasn't blonde like some of Hitchcock's other female leads, and, even though she was only in the film for 10 minutes, Laura Elliott as the other woman was just spectacular. The scene where she gets murdered in an amusement park is a huge highlight of the film.\n\nBut the real star of the film is Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony. Like in many Hitchcock films, Walker is menacing, sick, twisted, and just plain evil. From his murder scene early on to the crazy, insane climax on a merry-go-round, Walker is a highlight and the reason why a film like this works, along with Hitchcock's direction of course.\n\nStrangers on a Train proves without a doubt that Hitchcock is a talented director with a passion for making suspenseful films. There will never be another director like him and I wish he was still around to show the world who's still The Master of Suspense.",

            "content": "Strangers on a Train is yet another great psychological thriller from director legend Alfred Hitchcock. The film might not be among Hitchcock's most famous and recognized thrillers but it contains all of the director legend's trademarks; excellent directing far ahead of its time and a story filled with mystery, intensity and suspense.  \n\nStrangers on a Train tells about a chance encounter on a train which entangles two vastly different character's and their destinies' together. Guy Heines (Farley Granger) is a promising young tennis player in love crisis with his blackmailing ex-wife unwilling to allow him to pursue happiness with another woman. On a train ride Guy encouters a seemingly harmless gentleman, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) who has a morbid solution for Guy's problem. As Guy shrugs off Bruno and his crazy plan to commit a perfect murder, little does Guy know that Bruno in his delusional mind  is fully committed in going through with his homocidal plan. \n\nI liked Strangers on a Train especially Robert Walker's portrayal of mentally unstable Bruno made a permanent impression and would go as far as to say that he is the highlight of Strangers on a Train leaving other actors completely in his shadow. Story wise the Strangers on a Train is quite typical Hitchcock film as the director has always been master in creating suspense out of ordinary characters who find them in most unordinary situations. This is especially true with Strangers on a Train as it begans slowly with seemingly unengaging story and characters but in no time the viewer is fully immersed and engaged in Hitchcock's mystery. There was a phase around middle of the running time where I felt that the story made no real progress and the intensity dropped somewhat, but thankfully the film managed to pick up the intensity towards the end climax.  \n\nIn the end Strangers on a Train in my books is not among Hitchcock's best thrillers, but it is still a very good film and I doubt anybody who enjoys a good psychological thriller would say otherwise.",

Strangers on a Train is just another piece of his greatness. Featuring an utterly fantastic performance by Robert Walker as the man who 'accidentally' bumps into tennis player Guy Haines (played with a great deal of vulnerability and just the right mix of innocence and guilt by Farley Granger) on a train and tells him of his plan to commit the perfect murder.\nWithout giving much away, lets just say, this is a fantastic film that could be redone today and be just as relevant. It's a shame Walker died that same year (1951) as his performance here seems to be the template against which many should model their flamboyant psychopath with their own twisted codes of morality. In many ways this is the first 'stalker' film (though I suppose you could also consider 'Night of the Hunter' one as well) and Walker's Bruno has similarities to Robert Mitchum's Harry Powell with their relentlessness.  There are many very impressive visuals here, including the startling one of Bruno watching Guy at a tennis match, from the steps of the Washington Monument, and the thrilling conclusion at a carnival. Suffice it to say, this is a masterpiece among many by Hitch, and if you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do.",

He will kill the tennis player's unfaithful wife and Guy in turn will murder Bruno's domineering father. Bruno goes ahead with the plan while Guy brushes it off and soon forgets it.

I was blown away by many things in this film, and enjoyed it to say the very least. Like every Hitchcock film, in order to gain from the cinematography, this one demands to be watched at night, in the dark. \n\nStrangers on a Train has a fairly simple plot: two people meet on a train, and \"plan\" two subsequent murders. When one of the murders is followed through, the other murder is not. causing more than a feud between the two main characters.\n\nFarley Granger plays Guy Haines, a tennis pro and the protagonist of the film. At the beginning of the film, he meets Bruno Anthony, the antagonist played wonderfully by Robert Walker. Granger is innocent in his role, and the viewer can connect and feel bad for his position in the film. On the other hand, the audience can greatly enjoy the screen presence of Walker playing a very psychopathic character. Bruno Anthony is a very fun villain, who is creepy by just standing on top of some stairs. As an honorable mention, Laura Elliot is excellent playing the mean, cold-hearted Miriam, Guy's wife. The audience tends to like Bruno, while despising Miriam, making her more of a villain than he is, even though we know they are both bad, one more than the other. \n\nAlfred Hitchcock and Robert Burks produce one hell of a film. Burks' cinematography is the best I've ever seen, other than a select few films. The use of shadows, askew camera angles, and a dreary, foggy atmosphere gives this film a Fritz Lang/film noir feel to it, and looks a lot like Carol Reed's The Third Man. There are also many interesting camera manoeuvres, including the killing of Miriam where the camera zooms in on her glasses and we see the crime as a reflection. There are tons of memorable shots in this film, like when Guy is playing tennis and we slowly zoom in on the audience of moving heads until we stop on Bruno, the only head not moving as he stares at Haines. Also, the long shot of Bruno on the top of the Jefferson Memorial stairs is really suspenseful too. Everything about the way this film was shot was for suspense, and boy does it work. The opening shot is also something to marvel at. It shows two people, Granger and Walker, walking onto a train, but only Hitchcock would think to make it interesting and suspenseful by showing only their feet walking until the two lead characters meet. \n\nThis film is very good, all the way up until it's cheesy special effects ending. I would recommend this film to anyone because it is very entertaining, and suspenseful too.",
