I think the brother would have worked much better as a red herring if his motivation was just to make her lose the trust fund. That suit would need to be charged, right? So if he gets himself locked up in the asylum with her, wouldn't that have been an issue? Just a lot that bothered me about the way the plot played out. I think it would have been way more interesting to leave us guessing if maybe it was all in her head and she really had lost her mind up until the last second then show us like a quick flash of him or something right before the credits roll. But I guess I get wanting the payoff of her taking him out. It was just the safe play to me. Atmos track was great on the 4k blu ray.",

            "content": "Leigh Whannell director of 'Saw' and 'Upgrade' and Blumhouse Productions brings a new vision of one of the classic Universal monsters the trailer made it seem like this was another generic stalker film and it reminded me a lot of 'Hollow Man' starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue but it took me to learn afterwards that this was actually a remake of the black-and-white 1933 movie 'The Invisible Man' where the Mummy reboot starring Tom Cruise failed to establish a universe this one could actually have life to have others of its kind follow in its footsteps because it feels very fresh Elizabeth Moss stars as Cecila, a young woman caught in an abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Adrien when the movie opens she flees in the middle of the night to escape once and for all; little does she know that sometime later he commits suicide and it seems as if she will be getting her freedom back but the horrifying truth of it all is that Adrien may not actually be gone somehow, someway he has found a way to make himself invisible to the human eye but how though? did he take a formula, is it science, did he turn into a ghost? now Cecilia has to find a way to stop him from continuing to overtake her life, hurting the people around her, and putting her paranoia to rest this is a great blend of suspense, toxic masculinity, gaslighting, and trying to escape the cycle of abuse it's every woman's nightmare not being able to sever the bond from their controlling significant other but what makes it more frightening is that we can't see him as well as her this is Elizabeth Moss's movie with some solid acting on her behalf, the film emulates real monsters in our world, too in terms of spousal abuse, socio-pathic behavior and it's pretty bloody to boot with fun action scenes this version of the classic monster is more of a slow-builder and it's a bit long (maybe the last 20 min could've been shaved off), and it would've been nice to see how the abusive relationship came to fruition in the first place but they do play around with a lot of the uneasy camera angles panning left to right unsure of whether or not this invisible man is standing right next to Cecilia, in the corner, or several feet away striking at any moment it's another worthy addition to our #metoo era with a scary subtext involved Moss completely makes this remake work along with a sinister, sneaky antagonist she cannot spot here's hoping Hollywood can take notes re-introducing the other classic Universal monsters for years to come",

            "content": "Everyday there are monsters around the world that anyone can see and live to avoid. What if however, no one could see the monsters all the sudden. In The Invisible Man by Leigh Whannell, we get a clue as to how it would be to fight off the monsters without seeing them. Only, in this movie it's Elisabeth Moss playing as \u2018Cecilia' who is shown in the opening scene packing away a bag of supplies in a hidden closet space. Elisabeth's monster in this film is Oliver Jackson- Cohen. His character Adrian Griffin is portrayed as an abuser. As Elisabeth moss executes her escape plan, taking her hidden bag with her she runs to the nearest highway where she is met by her sister who is picking her up in a getaway car. As they drive off, we see Adrian angrily punching the car then causing blood to trickle down his hands as he watched the car driveaway. This scene was very symbolic and representative of the attitude and feeling behind this movie. It gives a clear understanding from the jump of the feelings between the two main characters. Aside from the movie itself, Elisabeth Moss' acting gives extreme feelings and knowledge towards the intensity of the movie. This movie isn't a light movie and covers heavy subjects behind all the action, and Elisabeth gives a great understanding of that truth. The Invisible Man isn't the only movie that Elisabeth Moss starred in that had critics blown away. She has a total of eight awards for acting from movies including Mad Men, Top of The Lake, and the Handmaids Tale. Above everything The Invisible Man conveys an important message about domestic abuse and the tribunes' victims go through trying to get their stories out to the public without their abuser making it difficult. Watching the difficulty from the other side of the screen gave a new perspective to the movie itself. The message, the powerful acting, and the heartfelt ending kept the movie suspense move forward. Throughout the whole thing it never felt like the movie was being dragged out or overplayed, and left the audience wanting more.",

This adaptation brings fresh new ideas to the Universal studios classic Monster using a new inventive take on the villain. In the 1933 version the invisible man was an almost ghostly presence, himself haunted somewhat by the affliction of invisibility. In this version The Invisible man is an aggressor, a human monster hiding behind technology to abuse and destroy anyone he can't control.\u00a0\n\nAn abusive toxic relationship falls apart with Cecilia ( Elisabeth Moss ) desperately trying to escape from her wealthy controlling partner Adrian ( Oliver Jackson-Cohen ). After numerous fights and psychological abuse Cecilia finally regains her freedom when Adrian commits suicide. With a large part of his estate left to Cecilia the ex scientist and tech mogul seems to have financed her future. Unfortunately the Suicide was just faked and Adrian can now use new technical advances he has developed to embark on a sadistic form of revenge.\u00a0\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" is a fun new take on the old Monster story with a horrifying message regarding abusive relationships. Sometimes when trapped in such a toxic environment what others don't or can't see is far worse than what they can.",

There are some issues reflected on the main character, for example, she was suffering abuse from her husband, and also, while the movie, there are a lot of murders, and at the end, there's no consequences or repercussions for all that things that happen around. Sometimes this kind of things aren't that noted as they have to, but it is always important to think about it.",

What's great is that this film is entrenched in technology, this isn't some mad scientist with a serum (though I do love Hollow Man). It's modern, it could be real considering current technology and more importantly it works.\n\nIt's a great film which is left with the teaser of a potential sequel. Yes please! Even with a minimal budget the special effects are spot on throughout. A triumph for practical effects as well.\n\nIn fact if I was Universal I'd hand over their 'monsters' and let Blumhouse run with the Dark Universe idea. The films don't have to overly connect or connect at all but I'd love to see their modern take on the Wolfman, Dr Jekyl & Mr Hyde etc.\n\nMake it happen Universal, I can get behind it!\n\nMaybe don't watch it alone because who knows who's sitting on the chair across the room from you!\n\n8/10",

Who does not love a movie where somebody is getting hunted by a person, it brings up the interest, and entertainment, and makes it enjoyable to watch. The move is a literal manhunt.\n\nThe ways she escapes, tries to prove that she is being hunted by a person you can't see, etc. is entertaining to watch. The performance and plot are amazing and it is an elaborate movie. The protagonist running away from the antagonist in the movie can keep interested and entertained.\n\nI have never seen a movie like this before and I am glad it exists. The Hunt is different from this movie because even though they are both getting hunted, The Invisible Man does it differently.\n\nThe Invisible Man is just trying to stop Cecilia and does bad things and makes it worse. It does give entertainment to the audience and does connect with the plot.\n\nI do recommend this movie to you. You can feel an awesome experience watching it and seeing a movie you have not seen before. It is a different experience.\n\nThis movie is a different experience and film.

Taking her pills, letting the dog out the electric collar and through a vague timeline finding it later in the story! All being signs and components of a story thoroughly touching attachment theory aspects! Issues ranging from a patriarchal social system to the biochemistry of relationships, internalized hegemonies! Tapping on ideas of passive aggression and actual harms of existential misalignments! \n\nThe steady growth of the character is deeply inspiring! Although judging if her taking revenge was her highest evolution is debatable! Maybe the journey has brought her to a deeper understanding of the cosmos or she might have chosen a different path!\n\nThe visual effects, especially the scenes containing the suit technology is second to none! Great navigation of light, colour and texture! \n\nThe frames were well chosen, and the timeline and rhythm had a cool long wavelength to it! The kitchen scene was clearly a loss of power in speech!

It's a great short film in itself. It shows Elisabeth Moss' character smart, fearful, strategic and empathetic almost to a fault, while setting up key plot elements organically. Keeping her character just like that would've been key to succeeding in telling the overall plot that follows. And who could mess that up, right? Well: Mr. Whenell did. During the rest of the running time, he dumbs his main character down unneccessarily, he dumbs every character down unnecessarily, he dumbs down the internal logic to flashy scenes that disconnect you more and more from any suspended disbelief. There is nothing wrong with all the major beats until the finale. It's their execution that disheartens. There is a German word 'verschlimmbessern', which means that you make something worse by trying to elevate it. This is what happens here: In the feminist context of the movie, natural beauty is putting on so much make up, that any sort of character vanishes behind it. It's a shame when you watch a filmmaker find gold and then make nothing out of it. Should've been a classic. Now it's not. What a shame.",

The basic story of invisibility remains the same here, but everything else has been changed and in some ways for the better too. The focus of this particular iteration is not really on the invisible man, but on a different character. Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is the girlfriend of a talented optics engineer, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) who treats her abusively and from whom she wishes to escape from. She does so one night and subsequently finds out that her Adrian has committed suicide as a result of her exit. However, strange things start to occur and she becomes convinced that her beaux might not be so dead after all.\n\n'The Invisible Man' in its 2020 form is very much a departure from its former incarnations. But, it's a smart update that has its own reasons for existing and isn't just another remake that only stands on the shoulder of a former giant like so many remakes and reboots do. There's enough here that makes it its own story and in that respect there's a lot to recommend it. It's also helped too by a great starring performance by Elisabeth Moss, whose physical expressions are a definite boon to the production over all. But, while she is sympathetic as a put upon unfortunate, she doesn't drown in a pool of her own victimhood, but instead becomes a heroine worth getting behind as she takes it upon herself to tackle the situation that presents itself to her.\n\nAs a fan of the 1933 film, which is the best movie adaptation of Well's story, I was a bit hesitant about this modern update. But, after a while, it won me over. It's not perfect by any means and it's probably a tad over long, but it's still a decent film in its own right. However, whether it revives the flatlined Universal \"Dark Universe\" attempt at a franchise remains to be seen.",

            "content": "I read H.G. Wells' \"The Invisible Man\" when I was a kid, and I saw the 1930's film on TV a few years later. That film spawned several spinoffs in the 1940's. I don't remember a lot of the details, but I do remember being intrigued by the premise. Wouldn't it be cool to be invisible? You could sneak into people's homes, eavesdrop on their conversations, steal money with impunity. \nBut I never considered trying to convince others that an invisible person was stalking me and setting me up for murder. That's the focus of filmmaker Leigh Whannel's updated version of the story, and man, is it effective. The sense of paranoia in this film is overwhelming.\nElizabeth Moss plays Cecelia, married to an abusive but brilliant scientist Adrien (Oliver Jackson Cohen) who specializes in high tech optics. She drugs him with Valium, escapes from their house in the middle of the night, and seeks refuge with friends. Shortly thereafter, the news reports that Adrien has committed suicide. What a relief, right? \nNope. Things start happening. Very weird things, like people getting hit by invisible assailants, kitchen fires starting, and in a horrifying scene, Cecelia's sister getting stabbed to death in a restaurant, leaving Cecelia with a bloody knife in her hand.\nNext thing we see is Cecelia trying to tell the cops she has discovered that husband has invented a suit that makes him invisible, and he is the killer, and he's setting her up as revenge for leaving him.\nObviously, nobody believes her---not the cops, not her friends. They reasonably believe that she's lost her marbles.\nMoss is perfect in this film. She looks bad, with dark circles under her eyes and a deranged look on her face. Of course, she's going crazy. And her performance, along with Whannel's confident direction, makes us feel like we're going crazy right along with her.\nThere are numerous scenes earlier in the film where Cecelia hears strange noises and she creeps through her friends' house trying to figure out what's happening. It's typical horror movie stuff, and it tends to drag a bit. But like a roller coaster that has a few small hills before you hit the big one, the movie amps up about halfway through. You'll jump out of your seat more than once.\nThe special effects are marvelous. In one scene, the invisible husband grabs Cecelia, lifts her off the floor, and drags her around the room. I'm assuming it was done with a green screen and some CGI, but it looks absolutely real. \n\"The Invisible Man\" succeeds greatly as a horror movie, but it's more than just simplistic scares. It reminds us that the unseen can be just as creepy as things that are seen.",

            "content": "The Invisible Man is a big step up for Leigh Whannell from horror films he's worked on previously, namely the Insidious and Saw franchises, and is probably my favorite film from him to date. The title may be a bit cliche and revealing of the premise of the movie, but everything else about it is great. The acting, directing and writing are all really good and it's almost surprising how good they are considering that Whannell wrote Insidious: Chapter 2 and directed Chapter 3. This film is for Whannell what The Conjuring is for James Wan. Elizabeth Moss gives a fantastic performance as her character which is bolstered by the supporting cast and capitalized on really well by Whannell. He makes great use of the chemistry between the characters and does a great job of shifting the tone of the film quickly via interactions between the characters. In an instant we go from sad and sympathetic to serious and dark, and the script doesn't forget to incorporate some fun and lighthearted moments too to balance out the scary parts of this movie. TIM bases its horror in what we can't see and has a presence throughout it that grips us with fear and anxiety as much so as it does for Moss's character, allowing it to be a bit unique as a horror movie. Unless you're really good with horror movies, this isn't one you'll want to watch alone in the dark cause you'll get freaked out just sitting there. A lot of horror movies make you not want to look behind you or in the mirror; with TIM, it doesn't matter where you look or what position you're in, and that alone makes this a very effective movie. In addition, Whannell, like with Insidious 3, makes great use of camera movement and position, light and sound to make this movie even scarier and hold viewers the whole way through. TIM is packed with emotional moments that make you smile and sit there with your mouth open, so it's a bit of a rollercoaster. TIM also flows really well and makes sense the whole way through, with scenes that are very realistic of what would actually happen in the situations that occur and how regular people would respond to them. Whannell gives us real world horror since it's feasible that something like this could actually happen in the real world, which is slightly freaky but also a nice breath of fresh air from other horror franchises that are more founded in the supernatural. The end is also smart and satisfying for both viewers and Moss's character and is something you likely won't see coming the first time around, giving viewers a bit of a surprise. Overall, TIM is an intriguing and effective horror film and I'd strongly recommend it to fans of the genre and of Whannell.",

I mostly know Moss from Mad Men, a little bit of The Handmaid's Tale, Us, and Get Him to the Greek, (no, I have not viewed nor plan to view The Kitchen), none of which even come close to showcasing her full-potential. Cecilia escapes from her boyfriend's wildly modern and expensive house overlooking the Pacific Ocean \u2014 think the house from Parasite, but much larger and with even less character\u2026 While I knew going in that the film concerned domestic violence, I had assumed it to be much more allegorical and therefore psychological, but I was wrong. It came out this year, so I'll refrain from spoilers, but there is very literal violence and a moment that will take your breath away. Upon escape, Cecilia seeks refuge with her friend James (Aldis Hodge), an SFPD officer, and spends the remainder of the film battling seemingly unnatural and telekinetic forces \u2014 or is it just the trauma of her abuse? The Invisible Man poses plenty of questions, but makes sure to answer them all before wrapping up an entertaining movie.",

Instead, it's the story of a woman desperately attempting to escape from an abusive, controlling, manipulative, gaslighting, and rich and powerful partner. The actual commentary it provides is that of the subtle and relentless ways someone this controlling and aggressive can manipulate your life, to the point to where it can feel like they're right next to you, cloaked in invisibility, keeping tabs and a hand on everything you do. Overall, there's nothing too exceptional about this film, but it was engaging and worth the watch.",

The little girl gets her absolute shit rocked by the the invisible man and some how thinks it's the girl who shmacked her even though the lead actress didn't even raise her hand at her.\n\nSecondly why tf would she leave the room with coffee grounds on the floor to go check the attic where she believes to be. She had a perfect security system and decided \"hey let's risk my life to go see if he's in the attic\" not to mention she then left her weapon down stairs after going through the Trouble of getting it. \n \nThird let's talk about how this Mfer washed a shit ton of paint off his suit within like five seconds and wasn't dripping water. Not to mention I'd think paint would be a lot harder to get off then just that. \n\nFourth WHY THE FUCK CANT ANYONE HOLD A GUN PROPERLY IN THIS ENTIRE MOVIE\n\nlastly when the house is getting boarded up and cleaned cause everyone thinks he's dead why does no one take the dog why is it just left in the house to fend for it's self and how tf did she change outta that suit so fast in the end.\n\nSorry for typos and shit grammar I'm mad and this movie fucking blows",

The film is also greatly assisted by Benjamin Wallfisch's incredible score, something he does very well. So we have all these top notch assets, and still the movie doesn't go far enough. The plot twist wasn't very confusing, but lacked elaboration. The question that comes with all twists is left unanswered. How? How did they do it?

However, as the story plays out, it becomes repetitive: Cecilia says her abuser is not dead but is still terrorizing her and since no one can see her, they victim blame her and make her feel as if she's losing her mind until she finally outsmarts him and proves to everyone she's not insane.

The script is also, mostly, a highlight, with the first two acts as compelling and well paced as they come, even though the ending comes off as a bit rushed. Whannell's social agenda for gender equality is admirable, if not too subtle, mainly due to a strong woman in the central role, finding her power in the face of her husband antagonist, Oliver Jackson-Cohen's eponymous invisible man whose menace is exponentially more present precisely when he is absent, the proof that sometimes the idea of a villain is more powerful than the villain himself.",

Spoiler: It was the brother of Griffin. It was very anticlimactic how he was killed because the brother was messing with Cee's life and he dies because he was shot by Cee. It just felt very anticlimactic. The fighting choreography is really good. If I study film I would look at this film for it's fighting choreography. This movie was directed very nicely by Leigh Whannell. Spoiler: Cee kills Griffin and that was expected especially since she had one of the Invisible Man suits. James played by Aldis Hodge is very good. James did get a new ladder which was very good for him. I liked this movie it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, it was just entertaining and enjoyable. It is worth a watch at least once.",

And it doesn't stop there: We got fake deaths that are not only unrealistic but barely seem to have any purpose. The main character remains completely flat because all we really get to know about her is vague hearsay about her terrible ex-boyfriend. And to top it off, you get an ending that is actually completely vague and unsatisfying, but pretends to be something else. We now definitely know: Nothing. Moral of the story: If u cant get to admit somebody your not crazy --> kill him. Great. We're sure you'll find somebody else to makes you feel crazy. \n\nI have to lower my rating the plot-holes just keep piling on the more i think about it.

The dread that Cecilia felt (portrayed by an outstanding actress) was insurmountable and the physical interaction of the invisible man's presence being real, but her concerns being treated as craziness was outstandingly portrayed.\nI docked a half-star only because of the ending.  While the whole movie was spot-on and true to reality, the ending left me feeling alienated and bitter; bitter that I was supposed to feel relieved with Cecilia's overcoming of her challenges in a clear, tangible way.

            "content": "The 2020 film The Invisible Man is not a remake of the classic 1930's Universal Monster movie starring Claude Rains and directed by James Whale, or even a new adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel. In fact, aside from sharing a title and the basic concept of a sinister man that is invisible, this film has nearly nothing in common with the H.G. Wells novel. This frees up writer-director Leigh Whannell to create a wholly fresh approach to the story of a mad scientist that makes himself invisible. Unlike the Wells story or the film Hollow Man, this story focuses not on the scientist but on his victim.\n\nElizabeth Moss stars as Cecilia, whose partner, Adrian, is a controlling and abusive tech genius. In a suspenseful opening scene, she makes her escape from his luxurious compound-like West Coast mansion. She is hiding out with a friend (Aldis Hodge) and suffering through PTSD when she receives news that Adrian has killed himself. Cecilia finally begins to feel safe and free when unusual and suspicious occurrences begin. Adrian's research was in optics, so it does not take her long to realize that he has somehow made himself invisible to continue to control and torment her.\n\nThe Invisible Man was produced and released by Blumhouse, the dominant production company in modern horror, which likes to keep budgets low (to keep profits high). The visual effects involving the invisible man are sparse but effective: floating objects, footprints appearing out of nothing, a human shape appearing when covered in paint or water. There are big scare scenes but also plenty of lowkey creepy moments to make your skin crawl. Disembodied breath on a cold night appearing behind Cecilia is a quiet but frightening moment. Maybe the simplest and scariest effect is the camera panning over to an empty corner or staying put after everyone has left a room. As a director, Whannell is smart enough to know that the best way to scare us is not with special effects or blood and gore but to put us right in Cecilia's shoes. We are as certain of the invisible man's existence as she is and as uncertain of where he is or what he'll do next as she is. His attacks on her are not only physical. When she is at a job interview and her portfolio is empty, we know what happened, but the interviewer just thinks that she is forgetful and unqualified. Adrian isolates her from her family and friends just as he did before, sabotaging the relationships that are holding her up, just as real life abusers physically and emotionally isolate their victims.\n\nElizabeth Moss gives an outstanding performance that drives the movie. Through her performance and the stylistic choices of Wharnell we really feel Cecilia's paranoia. That is the major reason why this movie is so successfully frightening and suspenseful. She begins to come undone because of the stress and anxiety of her situation, but she knows she is not losing her mind. Scene after scene of her of not being believed has a deep significance beyond the plot. Any number of women could unfortunately relate to being not believed and left vulnerable by those supposed to offer protection. This movie easily avoids the male gaze and any lascivious scenes you might expect in a modern era movie about an invisible man: there are no scenes of Cecilia in the shower or getting undressed. From beginning to end this is an excellently crafted, scary film. This isn't art house horror or elevated horror. This is just great horror. I wish more horror films were like this.",

The film might be considered aimed to a feminist movement group, but you cannot possibly say that since anyone has and can experience emotional and physical abuse from their partner.\nAlthough this is considered to be a horror film and we expect a lot of killings, the real horror is how the main character is psychologically tormented. The people around her not believing what she says and beginning to think she is going mad. The film does a great job at capturing the deteriorating of the main character based on what she is experiencing and how people around her don't seem to believe her. As the viewer you get taken into such a journey that you feel for her at times and at other times you wonder if she is actually going crazy. When the action scenes come up they are not over the top it is great execution on how they are done that helps keep the movie interesting.\nI do not have a negative point to say about the film. I didn't go with much expectation of it, which might be the reason why I loved it. I just feel overall it did a great job at capturing a Psychological horror film, with mystery, suspense, and stellar performance by Ms. Moss.",

Elisabeth Moss gives a stellar performance, and convincingly skims the line between a woman just wanting her freedom from an abusive man, and unreliable narrator who may be going mad. Hitchcockian in moments, and slasher film in others, The Invisible Man is an entertaining and important modern thriller that says a lot about our society- sticking to the trend of modern Blumhouse films.",

I enjoyed this film and was engaged throughout the entire movie although I find Elizabeth Moss's acting to be a hit and miss at times and catch myself thinking she seemed detached from the dialogue. I don't know why but she always seems underwhelming in roles to me. The film had a good story and was shot well, I liked how they didn't get try to wow us with incredible amounts of computer graphics and kept it straightforward and somewhat interesting. There were  times I was thinking don't just stand there or let go of the knife, but that's par for the course in thriller films, and there were some unexpected moments that did surprise me. The action sequences were great and wished there were more of them. Overall it's a well rounded film and I'd recommend it.",

She's certainly good enough to pull it off, so it's not a downside of the movie, it's just part of a note that this movie is very much a slow-burn suspense.  On the premise alone, the first 2 acts are going to be that way as it is established that she is / isn't crazy and there is an invisible man stalking and sabotaging her.\n\nMy biggest problem with the movie is that there has never been a more plausible and clearly reasoned explanation for the events, to include camera footage and dead bodies, than she has in this story.  If someone finalized a version of a wearable inviso-suit, then this is exactly the type of nonsense they're going to get up to, especially if no one knows about it.\n\nIt is a little irritating how they handle him once he's been exposed as well.  Mostly it's because of the premise that no one believes her, but you'd think people had seen a ghost movie, or would have a clever idea.\n\nIf the movie sounds good to you at all, then I really think you'll enjoy it.",

My only major scruple is the ending, the circumstances that allow Moss's Cecilia to turn the tables on Griffin, thus far characterized by his ruthlessness and extreme capability, should not really have come to pass. If the film allowed for a darker or more ambiguous ending, I feel that it would have been virtually perfect. Still, Moss puts in a great performance, and the majority of the screenplay is top notch, with a villain whose real power is warping people's perceptions for his own ends. (4.5/5)",

I also did not know until after watching that the movie was written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who also wrote Saw and Insidious 1 and 2.\n\nI am a fan of the acting ability of Elisabeth Moss. Just like in The Handmaid's Tale, in this movie she demonstrated a brilliant ability to show complex emotions through her facial expressions and without even needing dialogue. Her acting carried this film, and was its only redeeming factor.\n\nAfter an attention-grabbing opening scene, the movie became slow and frustrating to watch. Although the main character made smart choices (which is a rarity in thrillers imo), there were a lot of times when the other characters reacted in frustratingly unrealistic and/or flat out stupid ways.\u00a0\n\nI also felt that the movie only scratched at the surface of its characters, without going into any depth as to their backgrounds or motivations. I couldn't find myself able to really care about any of the secondary characters.\n\nThis movie had a few plot twists / WTF moments, but not enough that I would classify it as a \"scary\" movie. If you're a person that is easily frightened and looking for a thriller that is not going to keep you up at night, this movie would be a good choice.\n\nOverall - 5/10.\nWorth watching? Only if you are a fan of Elisabeth Moss, or if you are looking for a thriller that is not overly thrilling.",

Makes it seem so murky that even when they're outdoors you can't really tell what people are doing.  Anyway it was well done, the invisible mechanic wasn't even really the heart of the movie.  In downplaying the \"invisible\" gimmick, it made it seem more realistic for some reason.  And is this woman really being stalked by the invisible specter of her supposedly dead abusive boyfriend, or is it all in her mind?  That gets answered about halfway through and then it becomes about her fight to convince others that she isn't crazy.   Yet she does at the end become a tool of her violence herself, so in a way, the abuser still wins.   So the ending is ambiguous at best.   A subtle and not over the top movie, with good performances and a subtle twist to the invisible man genre.",

The story follows Cecilia who is haunted by the ghost of her ex abusive boyfriend that no one can see, not even her. For a low budget horror film, this is just shot beautifully. It has Really great set locations and cinematography to keep a high level of suspense. There was a few times I actually closed my eyes because It had that much suspense built up. Moss does great work here and really conveys the feeling of no one believing her while shes being hunted. The effects look pretty great as well. There\u2019s so many scenes that you need to rewind and watch because objects are moving in the background and you miss half of them on the first watch. It really creates an awesome reviewing factor.

So I was fascinated to see such a wonderful fresh take on the idea. This movie holds up as a great suspense thriller, with such a simple concept. It\u2019s clear that Leigh Whannell knows how to manipulate the audience to have us holding our breath and sitting on the edge of our seats. There are a number of great quiet and still moments in this movie where I found myself searching every inch of the frame waiting for something to move. Whannell truly puts us in the mind of the victim. I also appreciate what this film is doing with the allegory about the real-life abuse of women. It\u2019s such a smart way to address our culture\u2019s struggle with believing women without making a movie that is overtly about the Me-Too movement. I wouldn\u2019t say the way The Invisible Man addresses those themes is subtle, but it fits perfectly with the plot of the film, so I appreciated every minute of it. Elisabeth Moss does a marvelous job of playing that constant fear, and when she starts to turn a corner and begins to fight back it feels like a realistic character progression, rather than an unlikely personality shift. I like that the film doesn\u2019t take much time to address the mechanics of The Invisible Man, since the science is ridiculous. However, there were times when I couldn\u2019t stop myself from thinking about the logic problems this all creates. I start to wonder about how someone sees and breathes when invisible, and many more little nitpicky problems about the technology. Likewise, this movie uses one of my pet peeves, where we see a bad guy caught/killed and then every other legal issue for our hero magically goes away. Thankfully, the film doesn\u2019t slow down much to let me contemplate any of that nonsense. It\u2019s an intense thrill-ride from beginning to end. It\u2019s also worth mentioning how well they handled the effects in the film. I don\u2019t know if they had a guy in a green bodysuit, but when people were grappling with someone who was invisible, it felt real. The Invisible Man is a great example of what Universal should be doing with their classic monsters. Instead of desperately trying to manufacture some pointless cinematic universe (like they did with The Mummy,) you just make a solid updated version of the story as a standalone film. This is a great example of modern horror, and I\u2019d love to watch more movies like it.",

Even though the pacing was good for the most part I did feel it was a bit too long.  I also wish the ending hadn't given the answer to the main question the movie asks us.  They also could have ended it earlier and left a huge cliffhanger and made a sequel out of it.  \n\nHighly recommend this one.",

            "content": "A mature and intense ordeal that will emotionally drain you.\n\nLeigh Whannell's psychological paranoia thriller The Invisible Man (2020) is a suspenseful update to the classic with Claude Rains. Whannell's direction is captivating as you are holding your breath, clutching your chair, and focusing your eyes on every object and corner in each scene for any clue to where The Invisible Man is hiding. Whannell's nerve-wracking direction leaves you paralyzed with fear and an intense gnawing paranoia. \n\nAndy Canny's editing doesn't cut away too often in shots that linger so you can observe the situation. So you are subjected to 124 minutes of paranoid terror. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is gorgeous and arthouse by appearance with a sleek modernity to his style. His harrowing still shots of rooms force a limited perspective to keep you frantically looking everywhere for the invisible villain. Alex Holmes' production design gives us sparse rooms where a killer could be anywhere. It's quite scary and the violence is remorseless and chilling. You feel great empathy for the protagonist's struggle as you right in her scenario. Leigh Whannell is a director to watch for after this artful adaptation of H.G. Wells' horror classic The Invisible Man.\n\nWhannell's script is interesting as he provides insights into trauma, victimization, abusers, and criminal pathology that feels strikingly modern and reflective of our society that believes abusers over their victims time and again sadly. Whannell's writing had plenty of suspense, scares, and twists to keep you engaged and guessing. I had a lot of fun looking around quiet backgrounds for any sound or sign of movement through The Invisible Man. On top of Whannell's frightening direction, Benjamin Wallfisch's score is unnerving with pulse pounding blasts of noise. It's a clever gimmick that works wonders through the convincing acting of Elizabeth Moss.\n\nElizabeth Moss is outstanding as Cecilia Kass in her grounded transformation into an insecure woman victim of abuse, who is constantly in fear for her life. Her eyes darting back and forth, furrowed brow, quivering lip, nervous hand gestures, and other signaling body language are startling warning signs of abuse that feel realistic due to her phenomenal lead actress role. She is powerful and cunning with creative solutions to obvious problems that will have the audience cheering for her.\n\nMichael Dorman is creepy as the shyster lawyer with conflicts of interest named Tom Griffin. Oliver Jackson-Cohen is scary as the deranged control freak and The Invisible Man named Adrian Griffin. His ranges from brutal killer instinct to subtle displays of power dynamics with his creepily cold and detached voice. Emily Seresin and Elly Kamal's costumes are refreshingly contemporary with a killer modern invisibility suit for the titular villain with black spherical cameras everywhere.\n\nAldis Hodge is so warm and likable as James Lanier. He's a very nice addition of realism to The Invisible Man. Storm Reid is wonderfully believable as Hodge's young daughter Sydney Lanier. Harriet Dyer is pretty stalwart and standoffish as Cecilia's sister Emily Kass in a genuine way. The entire supporting cast is excellent and bolsters Elizabeth Moss' absorbing main role. My only complaint is it seemed weird how few police officers fired immediately into the target once they saw The Invisible Man in action, but maybe that's my jaded sense of authority with all the police brutality we are endlessly aware of now.\n\nIn all, Jason Blum has delivered us another instant contemporary classic of the horror genre. Cinema has been blessed with another artsy indie horror film with Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man. You have to witness Elizabeth Moss' pain stricken performance!",

His efforts are greatly enhances by Elisabeth Moss' acting. She does amazing in this movie. The story is simple, a woman is terrorized by an invisible person. It is so simple, but simple stories do not always equate to good movies. However, \"The Invisible Man\" adds depth to the story and makes this horror movie an all round good movie. Moss' character, Cecilia, is in an abusive and manipulative relationship with Adrian who is a powerhouse in the optics industry. She runs away and hides at a friend's house. She is too scared to leave the house due to not wanting to be seen by Adrian. News comes that he is dead and that she has been awarded a large sum of money in his will. Things seem to be going great until strange things begin happening. Her life gets turned upside down and she knows it's Adrian, but she can't see him! Nobody believes her, and they think she is crazy. Things keep happening that place her in a position to be thrown in a mental institution. Things proceed from there, but I do not want to get into spoiler territory. Moss plays her role perfectly. She has to act as if she is sane, but at the same time be slightly convincing that she is insane. She does great. The pacing of the movie is perfect. It is slow enough that we can get the full development of Cecilia's tortured persona, but quick enough to keep us on the edge of our seats. It is not a \"scary\" movie, but it is thrilling and suspenseful. As for R-rated movies, this is a fairly soft-R. The language is not too rough, and there is a bit of blood. They could have made this PG-13 really easy and appealed to a wider audience. Overall, I give this movie an 8/10.",

Characters immediately fly to the worst possible assumptions at a moments notice with no other reason than moving the plot forward. For example, the writers spend quite of bit of time in the beginning developing the relationship between the heroine and her best friend and best friends daughter, only to have the entire relationship shattered when the antagonist makes it seem like the heroine slaps the daughter. This happens in the middle of a wholesome conversation, and no one takes even a second to question why the heroine would do something so out of character, for no reason, during a bonding moment. The movie is filled with such contrivances.\n\nAnother issue I had was that there are several scenes where it appears like the writers wrote themselves into a corner, and instead of rewriting, they instead brute force their way through it by either inaction, or glass jaw syndrome. For example, there is a scene where Invisi-guy is beating on Heroine while heroine has a knife, and she just...doesn't stab him. Or the serious pandemic of Glass Jaw Syndrome. There are so many instances of people being knocked unconscious from a single punch to the face. People like Psych Institute/Prison Guards, whose very jobs are to not get knocked out in a single punch, yes, even sucker punches.\n\nAnd I won't even go into the inaccuracies of the Psych ward/unit, because I don't have all day. Suffice to say, I've seen a lot of inaccurate portrayals of Psychiatric Wards/Treatment Facilities in my time, but this was one of the worst.\n\nWorst of all though, is the restaurant scene. The first kill of Inviso-Bill, and by all accounts the most ridiculous and stupid of them all. I won't go into to many details, but generally speaking, most people don't just let their arms be controlled, or close their hands around things involuntarily. But ignoring all that, WHERE IS THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE?! In this day an age, most places have CCTV, especially high end restaurants such as the one where the scene takes place. And this is an issue through out the movie! Mr. Invisible does things in front of people and in places that REQUIRE security cameras and it's never brought up!\n\nThe one star I gave this film is purely for the Main Actresses performance. Elisabeth Moss is an amazing actress, and she really does portray that of an abused girlfriend very well. However, one person bailing out water doesn't keep a ship from sinking. The performance of one actress can't save a movie as poorly written as this.",

Instead of going for the unoriginal jump scare tactic and cheap jump scare that isn't a real scare tactic like movies usually do, this one is more of a slow-burn thriller. Instead of showing us at all times where the Invisible Man is, it makes us wonder and question where he is, which is far more terrifying than knowing exactly whats going on and what's going to happen. The cinematography in this movie was really good as well. Not only did it have a nice white/grey color scheme which was right for the movie, but it also showed us the perspective of the Invisible Man at times too. This was great because it shows the audience that danger is always lurking even when you least expect it.

I saw the police & fainting scene and thought they were similar to Upgrade (one of my favourites from 2018). I later realised the director and cinematographer were the same duo for both films. Will be eyeing for more of their films.\n \n(Spoilers) \nElizabeth Moss shines in the role, she carried the whole film with her fantastic portrayal of scared and at the same time, strong feminine. She had some guts to escape and later getting into the same house.\nAdrian felt charming and innocent, fantastic delievery of a psychopath. The other side characters were good at what they were given.\n\nThank God I haven't watched the trailer, I stopped watching trailers for non-blockbuster films and wait for reviews or high word of mouth. The movie shocked me so many times.\n\nThe movie kept me griping, a well crafted thriller indeed. There were some jump scares but they weren't cheap. I loved that the movie kept us with the protagonist and we were discovering with her, I even felt she was the one seeing all this ghost in her head and that was ganna be the last twist. Even with sci-fi elements this movie is highly grounded.\n\nThe final twist was great, the other twist with sister were well earned shock value. Adrian died poetically just like he killed her sister.\n\nI rewatched some of the scenes, I discovered many things, like Adrian's phone wallpaper being hexagonal, invicible gun shaking just like in the end Adrian says. There were many respectful homage to the original version - hat, bandage. The movie sets up many key points in the background which comes into play later.\n\nFor a few moments in the film, I felt it draged. There were playing with the same substance for too long. The 3rd act felt much quicker but first two acts were hella thrilling. 1st act did a great job of setting up the tone and characters.\nSome of Cee's decisions fell into the horror cliche.\n\nI hear universal is planning on doing a sequel, The Invisible Woman. A lot of potential. Hope quality stays high with grounded realistic setting like this one.",

The story is based around the protagonist (played by Elisabeth Moss) fleeing her abusive boyfriend and later being told that he has passed away,  yet feeling like he is somehow watching and observing her at all times. Using invisibility as a metaphor around physical and emotional domestic abuse creating a constant feeling of dread made this a powerful and weighty theme. Gaslighting that can occur within such relationships was greatly illustrated, where no other characters believe in the sinister happenings inflicting our main character making her feel ever helpless and stranded. Horror films can work best when they have a strong message to explore, and The Invisible Man achieves this by carrying its resonant underlying theme to substantially increase the fright factor. Its first half was especially suspenseful and really put me on edge, producing a constant feeling of unease. Latter parts lean towards more action/thriller oriented territory, which were still entertaining but less hard-hitting than the tense first half. Some moments had me uttering my dismay and shock at what was unfolding before my eyes. A perfect example of how horror should be done. Plus Elisabeth Moss is ridiculously good as always.",

Whannell had his hand all over this production, taking over the producing & the screenwriting, while also directing. Let me just say, I'm not the biggest horror movie guy, but Leigh Whannell can make a damn good horror movie! His direction had great lingering, rotational camera work, with great camera suggestion. With the concept at hand, it leaves you thinking \"did I just see something?\"\n\nThe story line was very focused, while having a few open ended re-writes, with some great twists. He sharpened all the classic sci-fi/horror/thriller genre tools, creating this edge of your seat thriller. Whannell had you guessing at all times, while the audience is trying to connect the pieces that just don't seem to fit. The way Leigh Whannell wraps everything up, is nothing short of genius! He makes you rethink everything that's happened, leaving great conversation for after the film.\n\nThe very talented Elisabeth Moss KILLS her performance as Cecillia. Her emotions are beautifully sold, making it easy to be able to get behind her. James Lanier, played by Aldis Hodge came out of no where at first, but ended up being a decent addition, being kind-hearted, and somewhat funny as well. His daughter Sydney, played by Storm Reid, was really nothing more than another plot device, but she made the most out of her screen time, showing believable emotions and reactions. Adrian Griffin & Tom Griffen, played by Michael Dorman & Oliver Jackson-Cohen, we're basically cut from the same cloth. They were both diabolical, sly & mischievous. They both put on good performances, making you definitively feel some type of negative way towards them. My only issue with the characters; it seemed like they came out of nowhere, leaving us to infer where they came from, for the most part. Essentially it works, but I just would've liked a little more on all of our characters, besides our lead, because she gets more than enough enjoyable character development.\n\nThe cinematography by Stefan Duscio had a very deep and dark tone to it. Not only was the CGI done very well, but their practical effects felt so real, it made you feel like you were in the movie, backed up with INSANE sound mixing, and a creepy and dark score.\n\nThough I really enjoyed this movie, I did have a few mentionable nitpicks. It's inevitable to have convenient scenes, and imbalances, especially with a horror movie, but there was just a few too many, leading into a few plot gaps, with the logic that you needed to buy into. For movie that talks about cameras for a decent portion, some things could've easily been solved by security cameras.\n\n\nOverall, if you take this film too seriously, you may not enjoy it in it's entirely, but I found it to be a blast, with decent scares, a solid narrative, and a great ending. If you needed another kicker to see this film, with an overall budget of 14 million dollars, including marketing, The Invisible Man is already profitable, with box office sales of 50 million dollars just in the opening week!",

He kills a woman in a crowded restaurant by slashing her throat with a butcher knife and putting the weapon in Cecilia's hand who for some reason doesn't drop it. How did the big knife make it into the restaurant without anyone seeing it. Adrian is invisible while wearing his suit, but how does he move around soundlessly? And what a his smell? You should be able to detect an person's odor, whether good or bad. How does he get into locked buildings? How does he get around so quickly? When Cecilia insists Adrian is still alive, why not just mention that their dog was still in their house. If Adrian was really dead, who was taking care of the dog? \nA film should not have this many holes in the plot if you want to find it plausible. \nHopefully Whannell will have better luck with his next film.

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n3/4/20 \n\n\nThe Invisible Man Review \n\tThe 2020 reboot of The Invisible Man is loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel of the same name and the 1933 James Whale directed horror classic The Invisible Man starring Claude Rains as Jack Griffin a/k/a the invisible man. The main focus isn't even the title character the invisible man in this film whose name is Adrian Griffin, it's his ex-wife Cecilia Kass.  She ends up becoming his main victim of his violent rampage after she's left him due to being in an abusive relationship. The Invisible Man has loads of twists, turns, and scares and gives many respectful nods to the 1933 classic of the same name.\n\tThe Invisible Man enables you to see it in many different ways. The film can not only be seen as a reboot or remake but also possibly a sequel with the fact that the antagonist of the film has the same last name as the protagonist and antagonist of the original film, and takes after him in many ways. \nTowards the end we find out the invisible man turns out to be Adrian's brother Tom. Then it's found out that perhaps Adrian faked his own death and kidnapping so it was his brother who was the invisible man but only towards the end of the film so in other words Cecilia believes that Adrian has set his brother Tom up. This gives the audience different perspectives as well makes them think maybe Cecilia is right and Adrian did set his brother up or maybe it really was his brother all along who was the invisible man or maybe both brothers were in on the invisibility, and there were times where Adrian was the invisible man and times where Tom was the invisible man. \n\tThe 2020 Invisible Man is an improvement over its 1933 predecessor in that it's a more effective horror film because it enabled me to cringe in fear at many of its scenes. I did not cringe in fear at any of the scenes when I watched the original invisible man. \n\tThe 2020 Invisible Man gives plenty of acknowledgment to the 1933 original with combining science with invisibility, and also with combining the power that comes with invisibility.",

I have seen other versions as well including the forgettable TV show starring David McCallum, but this is the best of them all.  \n\nIt is tense and scary from start to finish with no let up along the way.

She bounces between the 3 seemingly at random, typically choosing the wrong one for the moment.\n\nOliver-Jackson Cohen is similarly awful, with the saving grace that you only see him in person in the first and last 5 minutes of the film.\n\nThe CG is passable, though the movie never offers the needed detail of HOW the invisibility tech works so well, or why the military has no involvement with a guy inventing the perfect invisibility suit. In fact, the film in general leaves out almost any backstory whatsoever, and necessary ancillary characters are conspicuously absent.\n\nIn one stunning moment of cinematography, Moss asks her Uber/Lyft driver to wait for her while she enters her former home, saying she \"could be 2 minutes, could be 20\". It's the middle of the night.\n\nA few cinema moments later, it's now broad daylight, and the Uber/Lyft driver is still waiting to take her back into the city.  While fake night-to-day changes in movies certainly weren't invented with Invisible Man, adding the Uber/Lyft NPC who waited 8 hours for the fare to return is beyond even the strongest suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe movie ends as it started, abrupt, and with her pal cop having to now explain how he got on the scene of an apparent suicide mere minutes after it happened, while Moss's character just walks away.\n\n2 hours of my life I'll never get back.",

But it's so lazy at the details that put you on the check. Love and hate all the same time.\n\nI know I know, every horror/terror/suspense got that logic fails. Like, having a gun and not use the time you can and only try to when they can't. Or you got a phone that's your way out of things, as evidence and to call for help, ok? But you don't use it or even bring with you because you.. surprise surprise... Got your own aaand still don't use it. Come on people, it's 2020, there are cameras everywhere. Every single restaurant got a couple and none is used for solving anything but one on the street, is? The movie tried too hard to make it credible with the tech but let mistakes like those get on the way of this good movie ger an A+ grade or a 5 stars review.\n\nDamn, there were times that I couldn't even breathe of the tension. And then you got some guards that are seeing the same as you and do nothing against the problem but focus on the victim? And again, tons of cameras at the hospital and none of them works? Or even got check after a goddammit bloodbath? Sorry for my language. But dude, that's too much.

Blumhouse Productions, is a film studio that is known for presenting curious ideas and taking risks for them, personally the only good films they have made would come from being \"Whiplash\" (2014) and \"BlacKkKlansman\" (2018), but then comes \"The Invisible Man \".\nIn a few words The film is about how Cecilia ran away from her husband Adrian who was an abuser, after a time she finds out that he committed suicide, but she discovers that it is not so and that he is now invisible and is going to do the hell life.\nThis begins with a scene in which Cecilia is escaping from her house, and this secuence seemed to me well accomplished because thanks to the details you understand what kind of man her husband was, so that he wants to flee from that life full of luxuries, You can understand why he is doing all that, then we are introduced to the people close to Cecilia who would be victims of Adrian's plan.\nAdrian or the Invisible Man could have me a well-written villain, I admire how the writers managed that the film did not need flashbacks for you to understand what kind of man he was. The way in which Cecilia is tormented despite the fact that at certain times it is more comical than terrifying, seems creative to me, the film makes, in certain scenes, feel the discomfort that the protagonist feels that she is being watched, harassed, what Which manages to generate tension, all this is reinforced with the convincing performance of Elisabeth Moss.\nPart of the bad of the film would be involved in act three, since it is the one that brings more conveniences, and things that are the opposite of real life (Apart from the action scenes, the special effects are somewhat bad ), for example those who have already seen it will know what I mean when I say that it is too much strength that they gave to the invisible man, nowhere in the film do they give you a sense that this trajectory gives superhuman strength, I know being invisible is a more difficult opponent to fight, but the way Cecilia's friend James defeats him is so unreal, the only thing you can say is \"So much muscle for nothing\", there are also the typical Cliches that the villain is going to kill someone important to the protagonist but due to his slowness salvation comes just in time, this can be applied in the scene where the invisible man is going to kill to kill Sidney the daughter of James, since although previously l or we saw mercilessly kill a group of guards at once, it does not do with Sidney and surprise comes salvation just in time.\nThe end of this movie is interesting because of the way it is executed, but I find certain time contradictions in the way Cecilia kills Adri\u00e1n, if it enters what they were trying to tell us, it is that Cecilia acts acting through the This rules because I knew you would never admit to being guilty, after all he's a manipulator, but how could he get to the trajectory and then shut it down so quickly? Maybe fans will start to come up with theories that someone else was actually wearing the suit, but I'm sorry I won't swallow it.\nAlso, despite the fact that I said that the film manages to create tension at certain times, to be honest, it ended as fast as it could and never came back.\n\"The Invisible Man\" is not a smart movie with a complex plot, but it is a movie that manages to create tension at certain times and is perfect to see if what you are looking for is above average entertainment.",

I found myself checking the time and begging to move on from the current scene.\n\nThere were parts in the characters' development and relationships I didn't find believable. There was one attempt to show bonding between Cecilia, James, and Sydney in which Cecilia gifted Sydney generously with a college grant. There was a little objection from James, Cecilia says \"nah, it's okay\", then everybody's cool and starts rough-housing. I didn't get it. There was a lot of that in this movie. I felt many of Cecilia's discovery sequences were believable, but the interactions between characters just wasn't there.\n\nOne very big gripe I had with the film is that the antagonist was apparently invincible against an unlimited number of trained police officers, but was often bested by his weaker victim in some of the most implausible ways. Smashing him upside the head with plates as she's pinned down, struggling, then miraculously getting away? Didn't buy it.\n\nSome sequences had very, very loose ends. Cecilia catches a Lyft directly to her ex-husband's mansion where she discovers his secret invisibility suit. When she escapes Adrian in another questionable attempt, she apparently meets up with her sister at an upscale downtown restaurant in whatever she happened to be wearing. I don't really understand the point of this setting, and it appears to do nothing to support Cecilia's reconciliation with her sister. There seem to be too many loose ends in this scene to discuss.\n\nOverall, \"The Invisible Man\" was a fun watch, but it left me scratching my head.",

Well when not trying to launch \ud83d\ude80 a massive cinematic universe, with no overly produced action scenes, dealing with Narcissistic actors and studio executives, and just focus on a simple story of a woman \ud83d\udc69 being stocked by her Sociopathic husband who has made himself invisible to make her look \ud83d\udc40 crazy \ud83d\ude1c. They may just finally come out with a half-decent product and this is definitely more than half-decent in fact it's the best thing that Universal Studios has managed to crank out. I already mentioned the story so let's about the Horror aspect and how they do take full advantage of the concept of invisibility and how far they can and will go to use their power over others. Although being a Blum House \ud83c\udfe0 Production and even if you have seen any of there other films you can pretty much predict almost every single jump scare usually accompanied by a loud screech to add a fake surprise. The acting is really good across the board to say for a few extras that kinda gave a flat tone delivery \ud83d\ude9a. The cinematography and shot composition to make it look like there's more of a creepy presence like the kitchen frame were it starts off suddenly but dose aggressively gets more dangerous is all really well done to add more Alfred Hitchcock levels of suspense. Overall this was quite a good watch and recommend for any classic monsters with a great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb for shadowing at the end if you want to know what it is DM me and I'll tell you and I give it an 8/10",

Only managed to finish it for Elisabeth Moss, whom I will still love, but hoped she had at least reviewed the movie. [Spoilers ahead]\n\n1) If the main antagonist, Adrian who by the way is a millionaire, committed suicide, did no one investigate or find a body? Nor have a funeral? Yet the reporters wrote that? So fake news much?\n\n2) For a woman believing that her ex was somehow invisible, shouldn't she be more prepared. Even baby powder could do the trick, and when she saw that paint could 'illuminate' the villain, why didnt she just carry more. Its like a brainless move.\n\n3) The part about Adrian's phone in the attic. It had incriminating bedroom photos. And it somehow found its way to the attic though. At the very least Cecilia could have shown it to James to get him convinced. But no.\n\n4) With the movie almost literally starting off by showing the prevalence of CCTVs, how did such an upmarket restaurant not have CCTVs. I fail to see how no one would have looked into it, saw a floating knife that floated to the sister and float back into Cecilia's hand. \n\n5) For a woman who was so gungho and prepared, she was awfully lazy and decided to watch the guards getting shot. And they were actually shot slowly. Surely the guards who were killed first had guns she could have taken.\n\n6) When the villain cornered her at the ambulance, then left to take out another guard, yet again what was she doing? Just chilling and waiting it out? And she had a gun, and they didnt show the villain wrestling the gun away.\n\n7) How did Adrian, after everything, also not notice that the 2nd suit was missing? Surely when everything blew up and his brother got caught, he would have rushed to check the other.",

The new version of \"The Invisible Man\" that promises more than delivery and more or less that. The script that is quite inconsistent fails at crucial moments in this film that is not as horror as we expected but we can probably call it mystery and suspense. Director Leigh Whannell even tries and does a good job directing his own script adapted from the work of H.G. Wells but he ends up making a mistake in this process and makes banal mistakes that in a simple edition could be solved and adjusted in some cases.\nPlot: Cecilia Kass (very well played by Elizabeth Moss) has an eccentric manipulator and millionaire boyfriend Adrian Griffin - that is, a potential perfect husband as most women in the audience think - who is also an optical engineer but above all has an obsession with Cecilia - that we never understand why if he has so much money wouldn't it be easier to find another girlfriend? Apparently no! In the first scenes of the film she manages to put drugs to sleep in the water and while he sleeps she manages to escape from his house. Finally her sister comes to the rescue\nIt is never clear why she did not stay at her own sister's place; instead she stays at the home of her great childhood friend Detective James Lanier who lives with his daughter Sydney. Too scared to even go to the mailbox in front of the house Cecilia lives in fear of almost everything including sleeping alone. Two weeks pass and the news comes that Adrian has committed suicide leaving $ 5 million of his fortune through his lawyer and brother Tom. She then tries to go about her life normally but unexplainable facts start to happen in the house as soon as the Invisible Man begins to approach only to Cecilia who begins to distrust Adrian's own suicide. Going ahead with even a few good scares the story is more like a cliche because since only Cecilia feels the presence of the Invisible Man everyone thinks she is going crazy or simply because she is traumatized she is having illusions. \nIn a scene after being completely alone and abated by detective Lanier and his daughter Cecilia, who can't even sleep properly in fear, she decides to call her ex-boyfriend in the middle of the night and surprise!! His cell phone is in the attic of the house ... she then takes a ladder and goes up to the attic to investigate ... and I wonder ... if she was scared to death a few minutes ago how is she going to go up in the middle of the night in the attic alone? Earlier scenes shoed that she was afraid to get the mail\u2026 from where all this courage came from? Anyway\u2026 In another scene more in the middle of the film, in which Cecilia is interned in the sanitarium in a completely sealed cell and the Invisible Man also enters the cell. Why would he do that because if I were the Invisible Man this would be the last place I would like to be in if I became visible. Another scene in which she escapes and the Invisible Man attacks the guards of the sanatorium in a process of quick escape one of the policemen leaves a gun on the side and within Cecilia's reach she has time to stay on the floor watching the Invisible Man fight with more than three guards shoot two run away to escape and only then does Cecilia take that same weapon and go after him through the garage and then she goes out shooting. For what?\n I will not comment on how the film ends but I can almost guarantee that \"The Invisible Woman\" is coming. For these and other gaffes in the plot of this film, I still stay with my faithful friend from 1933 starring Claude Rains who at least makes me laugh with pleasure and happiness for a film that is becoming more and more classic. But Elizabeth Moss does very well in this film and for the director Whannell I do prefer his previous 2018 film the smarter \"Upgrade\".",

The fact the invisible suit is sound proof, fine you can't see him, but why can't anyone hear 200llb man walking around in the same room as them? Did I miss the part where the suit granted super strength? Why is he, or they, so strong? What material is the suit made of that paint comes off so easily, varnish exists because paint is impossible to get off. Clearly Adrian did it, right? Okay, how did he tie himself up? Where is the grown-out facial hair, bad hygiene, rope burns and other clues that would tell the cops he was really trapped by his brother for weeks? Remember that cool restaurant scene where the sister dies? Watch it again and see where the knife starts and where it ends and then imagine how someone could do that. Also, where did the knife come from, does the suit have pockets? When one of the invisible men is stabbed repeatedly so much that it damages the suit, why does he pop up immediately and feel no pain? Was he Hulking up and no selling? Why does the dog bark at the invisible man, isn't he the owner, the one feeding and taking care of him this entire time? What was the suit made for, the government, the military? Maybe they would want to get their hands on it after he died? Did his company, partners, investors, tech people, any of them have any interest in invisible suits, or did they think once he died the suits died? The suit that Moss hid, how did he not notice it was missing, did he make so many he couldn't keep count? How many armed guards do you need in a mental institute? The young girl is attacked in her bedroom and in the hallway implying that Adrian and his brother were in the house at the same time, so does that mean there was a third invisible man at the hospital? Are these suits one size fits all, because Moss is significantly smaller than the invisible men. What powers these suits, imagination? Finally, the third act was very paint by the numbers down to the suit glitching only when it was convenient for the movie and stopped once the hospital scene was done. This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch, but it is the most nonsensical movie I can remember seeing.",

When Cecilia escapes her abusive ex and later finds out that he died, she believes she is being haunted by him because of the scary and dangerous events that she goes through. As the events escalate and begin to affect those around her, Cecilia fights to prove that her ex, Adrian, is still trying to hurt her and manipulate her. This movie is really cool because it always makes the viewer question what they are looking at on the screen. By making the antagonist invisible during the majority of the movie, the viewer is likely to question what they're looking at and what's coming next. Is there someone else there, or are the characters alone? It also allows the movie to be scary without jump scares. There's a few, but not too many and they're usually really good and deserved. The camera work is also excellent from what I remember. I think the music is really good too and it adds to the suspicious feel this movie has. For as good as this movie was, there were a few plot holes that I didn't like too much but don't really take too much away from how excellent the movie is. I also didn't really enjoy some of the graphic and gory parts of the movie, but that's just because I'm squeamish and throw up when I look at blood haha.

The guy in the movie was hinted to be evil and cruel but we as the viewer does not see any of that. Maybe the first scene but that could be disregarded with the suit ( if the suit can make people invisible, it in movie theories should also be able to do that ). Plus, it's weird that individuals wearing an invisible suit is able to gain super strength yet easily hurt with the slightest jab and push.  All in all, there are way too many inconsistencies in the movie, and demonizing one faction for the benefit of another isn't my cup of tea.

The film score was enjoyable; I feel like the music could make any movie that isn't this one feel tense.  This movie seems to be more realistic than other  horror-related films I've seen in the past, but instead of feeling tense and frighteningly real, the whole thing just feels childish and confused, like the filmmakers couldn't quite decide between sci-fi or realism.  The supposedly \"scary\" moments are just halfhearted attempts to grasp some feeble moment of entertainment.  The buildup is lacking and the \"shocking moments\" are just downright predictable and meh.  The overuse of blood makes it seem like they were trying to make a horror movie, but that's the only thing that really suggests the idea.  And, if this is supposed to be a horror movie, that makes this even worse.   I don't find this movie scary, stressful, or hardly even entertaining.

Since it is inspired by the famous novel of the same title by H.G. Wells, it was one to remember.\nThe story revolves around a woman, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), whose boyfriend, Adrain Griffin (Oliver Jackson Cohen), is working on the technology which enables one to become invisible. The movie starts with Cecilia waking up at midnight and tries to run away from the captivity of her boyfriend at an isolated house. She becomes successful in doing so with the help of her sister, Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer), she then stays with her sister's friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter, Sydney Lanier ( Storm Reid). While coping with her past she gets the news of Adrain's suicide, but soon she starts to feel the existence of someone you can't see, but can hurt you!\nWatching this movie was a wholesome new experience for me. I even did not remember the names of the star cast. the acting of Elisabeth Moss is worth seeing. She has done a fantastic job. Other supporting casts have also done their part honestly. Direction and screenplay were also good. I can't judge the dialogue delivery since the movie was available in Hindi at my cinema.\nOverall, it was an average movie and I would say it to be a one time watch. What didn't impress me was the storyline. I think it is a reboot of the novel storyline and I miss the invisible man wrapped with white bandages all over his body. But still, if you are free this weekend, you may watch it out.\nI would give this film two & a half stars.",

The abuse she endured during the relationship is not explored in the film; however, that detail is not missed, as the level of abuse she endured is made clear in escape attempt and the subsequent torment she endures afterwards. \n\nThis movie is a lesson in the common tactic that many abusers impose on their victims: gaslighting. I was honestly focused less on the visual trickery and optics, and more engrossed in the story of an abused woman whose crazed ex-boyfriend would stop at nothing to cause her to question every ounce of sanity she has left. It became clear that there were few options for bringing the abuse to an end, because he was never going to stop. \n\nThis is a movie that is definitely worth watching, especially if you want to understand what many survivors (or those who do not survive) of abuse endure.",

But rather to use our imagination as the driving factor in the fear without spending thousands on special effects. But to really sell the scares, you need a great cast, and this movie delivers big time. The stunning acting by Elizabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid and Michael Dorman leaves you completely immersed in the world of Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss). Though Oliver Jackson-Cohen is seen rarely throughout the film, he still manages to turn in a great performance as Adrian Griffin in this remake of James Whale's The Invisible Man (1933) film and adapted from the classic novel by H.G Wells.

            "content": "Whoever thought that a reboot of the corny, yet iconic Universal monster would lead to one of the best horror films ever made. Yes, I'm trying to say that Leigh Whannel's thriller-esque take on \"The Invisible Man\" is a shockingly tense, well-acted, visceral and terrifying achievement for the genre. Led by a terrific and empowering Elisabeth Moss, this flick not only takes thrillers to the next level, but it also injects more than enough hints of #MeToo to get its point across. The camera-work is astonishing, and the most impressive thing is, the movie was made on a scant seven million dollars. Whannel's technical talents have made this low-budget film look better than any expensive, run-of-the-mill action movie, and that's something to boast about. The score is nothing short of excellent, and the somewhat feminist allegory marks a significant change from its source material. These factors also make the movie a lot more unique than the traditional reboot. And instead of copying the source's story it invents something new, which is a rare thing to come upon.\n\nThe movie starts right in the thick of it, with Cecilia Kass (Moss) attempting to escape from her abusive and controlling husband Adrian Griffin (a stellar Oliver-Jackson Cohen). After Cecilia successfully runs away with the help of her sister Emily (Harriet Dryer), she then finds out that Adrian killed himself in his own house. Now trying to close the door on her past demons and staying with cop James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a sequence of unexplained events begin to occur. When Cecilia suspects that Adrian may have found a way to become invisible and stalk her, she must try to prove that not everything is what it seems. This premise could have been hilarious, a joke for all I care, but I was on the edge of my seat the entire two hours.\n\nIf one thing is guaranteed it is that Elisabeth Moss is a tour-de-force in the leading role. She plays Cecilia, who after escaping from her rich husband, becomes paranoid that something or someone is stalking her, watching her every move. It's darn terrifying all right, and Moss nails nearly everything with a flawless performance. Also, the actress has become yet another excellent lead role in horror, and her film has joined in with all the greats: \"The Shining\", \"A Quiet Place\", \"Halloween\" and more. But Moss's performance outshines those in a typical slasher flick and her co-star Oliver-Jackson Cohen makes for a competent villain that may not be as iconic as Jack Nicholson was, but he's damn good. The supporting cast is also top-notch, Aldis Hodge and Harriet Dryer are both superb in their respective roles. Teen actress Storm Reid has also excelled in her modest role as Sydney. The cast isn't star-studded, which is just how it needs to be, fresh and talented.\n\nRemember the anticipated launch of the Dark Universe in 2017, a cinematic franchise that was attempting to bring back all of Universal's classic monsters to life? Well turns out the first film in that hunk-of-junk had to be the Tom Cruise-starring, ill-fated \"Mummy\" reboot. And after Cruise's \"The Mummy\" hailed disappointing box office returns and lackluster critical reception, the cinematic universe was dead. Shockingly, Whannel has somewhat brought back the attempted series to life with this small, but incredible film. Despite being an R-rated thriller that doesn't focus on big action sequences, this could mean something new will be arriving. Perhaps not a direct sequel to this movie (which I'd be down for), but taking a similar formula from this flick and injecting them into let's say...\"Dracula\". It could work, especially since this movie is a masterpiece.",

So would I recommend it, yes I guess. Enjoy the beginning of the movie. while it lasts.",

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the creative plot line, and the twist ending! Moss's performance was great and so were the supporting characters. To me, this wasn't really a horror but a twisted psychological thriller that came with many surprises that kept me on my tops throughout! As for technical aspects, the long drawn out shots made it dreadful, as I wondered what the invisible man was going to do. Editing was clean and sound was pretty good, so no complaints there. I recommend!!",

It is not scary at all so I'm not sure why it's being said to be and it's a really not that hard to figure out so I do not consider this a \"PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER\" . I wish they would have focused more on her ex and showed his \" bad behavior \" and \"  \"sociopathic tendencies\" maybe with flashbacks of some sort  because it's hard to dislike someone when you they don't show his \"controlling behavior\" and the rest of the movie he is invisible. Then when he appears \n at the end you see a handsome genuine man. You never really get to see or feel the fear from this man in the flesh which makes me not be able to feel as much for the character. Overall this movie was shot well but felt pretty cheesy t me. Only one scene in the movie that was a little gorey and Elizabeth moss plays the same role in like every movie so her acting defiantly didn't leave me impressed. I love scary movies and I love thrillers and psychological thrillers. This movie fell flat and was pretty boring and slow paced. I am by no means a movie snob but this movie will not be memorable to me and I'm the type of girl who still watches and enjoys cheesy 90s movies\ud83d\ude02",

It tells the story of Elizabeth Moss's character escaping from the clutches of her abusive boyfriend, and two weeks later finding out that her boyfriend had commited suicide, but later on she finds out that she is being stalked and harrased by someone that she cannot see. Leigh Whanell has really put his stamp on this project. This movie builds tension, and actual scary thoughts and scenarios, executed greatly and effectively by Leigh Whanell and his crew.\n\nPROS:\n-Amazing cinematography\n-Stand-out performance from Elizabeth Moss\n-Plot twist makes the story a lot more interesting\n-Has that sense of uncertainty of is the Invisible Man there or not, and if Elizabeth Moss's character has gone insane or not\n-A modern take on the old Universal monster Invisible Man\n\nCONS: [Minor spoilers ahead]\n-Some plot inconveniences like how is the invisible man able to catch up to the heroine so quickly, another example would be at the ending like she killed him with a knife right, but then she appears without the suit right after immediately, like I'm pretty sure putting on and removing the suit takes a little bit more time than that, and then when she moans his death, the police officer rushes over, and he sees her all packed up and ready to go, come on how fast does she move? The speed of light like bro come on\n-Some parts of the movie are a little bit stretched out and kinda boring, I had to pause for a bit and do something then come back and finish the movie for a better experience, which I don't normallydo, what I normally do is I watch the movie from start to finish continuously, but just when it's starting to get boring the twist comes in and brings me right back on board with the movie.\n\nOverall The Invisible Man is a good horror Sci-fi flick, that has excellent built up tension, amazing cinematography, a strong female lead in Elizabeth Moss, and a pretty interesting twist to round it all off. I give Invisible Man a 7/10, I did not enjoy it as much, found some parts boring, but it's still really good, and I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for a modern take on a horror classic, or people who are looking for good underrated films that will probably fly under the radar, Leigh Whannell is now on my directors to watch list.",

The tension building is comparable to the best horror films ever made and the jump scares were all original and inventive, they not only made me jump but they all left me terrified for some time after because they all came when you'd least expect them to and all had horrible ramifications. The acting was superb, the character development, complexity and like-ability for the lead was incredible. You genuinely liked her and was rooting for her the entire time, admiring her intelligence. Even the character development of the young girl was better than most film leads. The twists had me genuinely shocked and an ending that could be looked at as unsure of what really happened or you were completely sure. It was one of the best horror thrillers I have seen in some time and that includes all the other great horror films that have come out in the last few years.",

I enjoyed the original 1933 The Invisible Man, and this remake takes a new and original spin into science fiction and mystery, and with more buckets of blood. It also has some echoes on the current feminist movement. From the writer of disturbing classics like Saw (2004) and the director of Upgraded (2018), this movie proves that remakes can be a great result, because this movie is an effective horror pic, and without a doubt one of the best of 2020.

            "content": "Leigh Whannell's \"The Invisible Man\" is an intense, gripping and terrifying psychological thriller that puts a fresh spin on the well-worn horror genre. With his latest feature, writer/director Leigh Whannell has crafted a captivating film about a woman haunted by an invisible entity. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to bring a classic movie monster to the big-screen, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using haunting cinematography, Whannell draws viewers into the life of a mentally disturbed woman. From intimate close-ups to lingering long shots, the cinematography immerses viewers in the film's eerie setting. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Elizabeth Moss delivers one of the best performances of her career as Cecilia Kass. With riveting expressions, she conveys the fear, angst and desperation of an abused woman haunted by an invisible entity. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Aldis Hodge, is also worthy of recognition. Although \"The Invisible Man\" is undeniably terrifying, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At over two hours, it is slightly long and overstays its welcome. Moreover, it builds to an ambiguous ending that doesn't entirely work. Nevertheless, fans of the horror genre will definitely enjoy \"The Invisible Man\" and so will movie-goers seeking enthralling entertainment. At a time when strong female protagonists are rarely seen in horror films, it's a visible reminder of the enduring power of female-led stories.",

At first I thought is was based or remake of Hallow Man (2000) which has the same premise but not as it goes to stand on its own story. The Invisible Man is a proof that suspense and thriller film with old material story could work again given with the right screenplay, acting and direction. The story was refresh and infused with modern takes that we've never seen in other thriller films. Lead star Elisabeth Moss carried the film with her acting from a fearful and vulnerable to a brave and fighter Cecilia Kass. The Invisible Man did not rely heavily on jump scares trope but there are some scenes that you cannot resist but to jump and even scream! It heavily relied on tension and atmosphere to induced horror and thrill which I like on this movie. I had mixed feelings with the ending - it's either needs further explanation or it wasn't an impactful enough to leave the last 15 minutes that way. Yet, The Invisible Man is still one of my highly recommended film of 2020.",

It's a mysterious movie full of suspense which sometimes can get very disturbing to look at, but you'll find yourself having the need to know what's next. \n\nThis science fiction horror film and its numerous unexpected scenes reminds you of a classic original Hollywood horror movie, although, it has its own touch that makes it special. The principal photography of the movie was set in Sydney (Australia); however, various scenes were also shot in Kiama and Gerringong. The film shows the story about a woman who ran away from her abusive and rich boyfriend who apparently committed suicide later, but the problem is when she starts to feel him closer than ever after his death.\n\nSet on Australia in the present The invisible Man antagonist is a crazy businessman and scientist called Adrian Griffin who faked his own suicide and afterward utilizes his capacity to be invisible to threaten his previous girlfriend (the protagonist, Cecilia Kass), who chooses to defy the undetectable man herself after the police didn't trust her story.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"The invisible man\" it's a complete success since it has earned seven time its production budget just in its global opening weekend. It must be mentioned that there are a couple of impeccable good performances, an example, the role played by the only 16 years old Storm Reid who had to dissimulate to scuffle with someone who wasn't even there, she did an amazing job.\n\nI personally think that casting Elizabeth Moss as the protagonist was probably the best decision for this film, is astonishing how she accomplished to make Adrian's presence feel so real when he wasn't even present when filming the scene, its doubtless that this type of work It's  truly requesting and stressful; it's a tremendous quantity of effort that she needs to give.\n\nHonestly the ending was very predictable and kind of clich\u00e9, it ended like every other revenge film , but at the same time there's nothing wrong with a good old blood and scary movie, however it's disappointing to watch a film this well made and phenomenally casted to end up without a transcendental ending.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about this movie is the way it plays with your mind which is very curious since this is the specialty of the antagonist, you spend almost the entire movie wondering if there really is an invisible man or Cecilia is just traumatized and going crazy, this fact makes you think that the problem is not really that Cecilia is not able to see Adrian, the real issue is that people who can't manipulate you tend to manipulate the way other people see you\n\nFinally, I truly recommend for you to watch the movie, learn about the mysteries of science and assure a good time.",

It certainly has its horror elements, such as a seemingly unstoppable killer, a lead who's constantly in danger and several tense fight sequences, but the film is more of a psychological thriller about an abusive relationship and the effects of obsession and control. Elizabeth Moss, no stranger to acting out intense situations, gives us a very competent lead who shows great resourcefulness and bravery in the bleakest of situations, rather than being the kind of screaming, useless idiot these films are usually populated with. The films direction and cinematography create a lot of wide, pulled back shots, forcing the viewer to examine the very edges of the screen for a killer we know is there, but can never see. It's a film built entirely on the unknown, and the terror lies in our inability to see what's truly happen. It's a relief not to be sitting through yet another jump scare fest, which is what most modern horror films are aspiring to be, sadly, but to instead be drawn into a conflict that keeps on escalating. It takes a story from more than a century ago, gives it a modern twist but stays true to its original spirit. Rich in atmosphere and dripping with suspense, The Invisible Man builds a solid foundation for what looks to be a promising cinematic future.",

            "content": "I love the stories of the invisible man, and this is certainly a different take of the story.  Rather than embracing the opportunity for effects and dark comedy, this film limits the effects severely and goes for straight terror.  The brilliant thing about the way it is shot is the sense of paranoia it creates.  I can't remember the last time I've watched a movie this closely.  The film will do things such as move away from frame of a character a little early or a little late, or hold onto an area where there seems to be nothing.  Look closely and you might see a chair or something that's slightly indented.  Other times the camera will move and you won't know if it's a POV shot or just a normal camera movement shot.  It's not established, but this isn't a mistake, it just adds to the sense of paranoia the movie is creating.  There's a few jump scenes, and even a moment when I actually gasped, but for the most part it's all about the building sense of tension and dread and it does so perfectly.  Telling it in a story of an abusive relationship that feels all too real with Elizabeth Moss absolutely killing it as a woman who seems insane but only we know isn't.  If I have a criticism of the movie, it's that once the s*** really hits the fan in the third-act, it does start to become standard monster movie action formula to a degree.  It still holds a lot of the tension, but not as much as it starts to devolve into more violence and action.  Still for how tense the rest of the film is there is a sense of catharsis to this, and in its final moments it does return to form.  Overall this is a great reboot of a classic story.  If this is the way Universal is going with it's monsters now, dropping that Dracula Untold and Tom Cruise Mummy crap, I'm all in.",

It also had one of the most shocking and unexpected scenes that I have seen in a while! The plot was very intriguing and it had a great twist! The pacing was great too; it didn\u2019t feel too long or too short. The cinematography was perfect for a movie like this as most scenes had lots of empty space, making the audience search for \u201cthe invisible man\u201d and wonder where he is hiding in the frame. The editing and special effects were great (I still don\u2019t know how some of the scenes were filmed/edited so well) and so was the score. I loved how the music escalated during the final scene of this film. So great! Elisabeth Moss...damn she was good! She should be nominated for an Oscar for her performance. Everyone else acted very well too, but she really surprised me! Honestly, I don\u2019t have anything negative to say about this one. Leigh Whannel is on a roll! Upgrade was excellent but this movie is on a whole new level.",

            "content": "I was sooo looking forward to an invisible man movie. Cinematography was great, effects are spot on, and the score really helps to bend that physiological thriller mindset. Moss (Cecilia) plays the part of abuse victim convincingly, though she also plays the part of helpless abuse victim very well in other movies. Sometimes infuriatingly so. The plot, however, just pure blows. My eyes constantly rolled to the back of my skull, while my mind quietly screamed \"for fucks sake!\" Who the hell invents invisibility, somehow fakes their own death, and then haunts their ex for pure shits an giggles? Answer: obviously, psychotic alpha dominant males in a #MeToo environment with nothing better to do. Every step of the way the story allows itself gaping holes in order to push this damsel in distress victim narrative, while yet every other actor is too wrapped in their one track mindset to question what's going, which unfortunately robs the movie of any real sense of quality or depth.\n\nSomehow it's gotten great reviews... and on a technical level I'd say, well, yeah! Well deserved. But the reality is, all the director/story writer has done to build tension is to tie up a coherent story with incomprehensible knots that a child would spot, which really only makes for a frustrating viewing, because it's so frustratingly unintelligent, less physiological thriller, and more physiologically demanding for you to sit in your seat and bear out this kind of torture.\n\nIf you're a fan of the SAW movies, fear not... there's a slight peppering of gore and plot twists that might blow your mind. I was too pissed off with how dumb everything was for these lick shots to really pay off, and, really, it just annoyed me even more that these shallow \"plot twists\" were obviously the crux that this entire clusterfuck of storytelling was supposed to hang on.\n\nIt's a shame, then, because technically the thing had merit. But unfortunately the characters were too one dimensional (not their fault), and the whole thing was propped up with a framework made to make the story \"work.\" It didn't, in my opinion.",

            "content": "This is a well-acted quality suspense movie.  However, there isn't anything unique or different enough about it that will keep it from fading into the landscape of mediocrity as it ages.  The biggest oddity about this film was the duality of the special effects (or maybe lack thereof...) To put it a simpler way, there were scenes where it truly looked like someone was fighting an invisible person and others where it truly looked like the actor was merely writhing around on the ground by themselves.  Unfortunately, when the latter moments happen, it deflates much of the tension that was so skillfully constructed up to that point (I'd be interested to know how those scenes were actually filmed--whether an actor was digitally removed, or never there to begin with, or a mix of both...) Another thing I took major issue with was the ending.  While the story really isn't that complicated, it doesn't need to be:  A girl thinks her obsessive and abusive ex-boyfriend faked his death and is terrorizing her using secret technology he developed as part of his job.  So eventually, we find out whether she's right or wrong.  90% of it is largely predictable.  That's OK as long as it's executed well.  For all intents and purposes, it is.  But that last 10%...oh boy.  That last 10% is so arbitrarily tacked on and there's no reason it needs to be there, nor is there anything in the film that the viewer can connect back to and be like \"Ohhhhh...right!  The blue shoelaces!\" (or whatever, just using that as a random example, not as one from the movie).  There were other options they could have chosen that would have been MUCH stronger.  Despite these flaws, it's still a solid movie, but not one that will be remembered for years to come.",
