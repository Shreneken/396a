            "content": "The animated film Wolf Walkers is filled with adventure, fantasy, friendship and love. The film takes place in the 17th century in Ireland, in a small village known as Kilkenny. There is a phenomenon or belief that \"wolf walkers\" are amongst them. In this village lives a young, fiery-haired girl named Robyn, along with her wolf hunting father. Within the forest surrounding the village, lives a young girl named Mebh, who is otherwise known as a \"wolf walker\". The village of Kilkenny is ruled by a man known as Lord Protector, who despises the wolves and wants to terminate them. During this time of the film, the men were known to work and be \"strong\", while the women were known to clean and be \"neat\". The main character Robyn did not like that way of life, instead she wanted to follow her father's footsteps in becoming a wolf hunter.\n\tIn the beginning of the film, Robyn is seeking out her passion for wolf hunting, while her father is trying to keep her from it for her safety. Robyn disregards her father's wishes and continues to try to hunt for wolves on her own. On Robyn's journey to find some wolves she stumbles upon a magical entryway into the wolf's den. She then encounters a young girl named Mebh, who is a wolf walker. At first Robyn was petrified and still tried to defend herself against the wolves and even Mebh. Mebh then showed and explained to Robyn that Mebh's mother is stuck asleep and out as a wolf still. Robyn and Mebh's friendship blossomed from that point and Robyn's new duty was to help Mebh find her mother. In the village of Kilkenny the townspeople believed the wolves were of demonic nature, just as witches. The Lord Protector made sure to do everything in his power to destroy the last pack of wolves amongst his village, from sending out hunters to even suggesting to burn all of the forest down. \n\tOne aspect of this film that should be recognized and spoken about is the soundtrack and editing. The soundtrack within this film is what gave the auidence suspension and the feeling of being \"at the edge of your seat\". From Robyn and Mebh riding wolves through the forest to Robyn trying to find Mebh's mother. The editing in Wolf Walkers is so astonishing, the colors and scenery given were impeccable. The beautiful forest full of magical yellow, shimmery lights, to the sketched movements of the wolves. Even the costume design of the characters suited each of them so well. The visualization of this film showing each pencil sketch was truly unique that not a lot of films show that.\n The way the destruction of culture, nature and independence under colonialism in the 1600s was shown through the village of Kilkenny was super informational. It showed aspects of the story most of audiences may have not seen or even paid attention to. From Robyn working as a castle maid for Lord Protector, to Robyn's father being a hunter and then even a warrior. These times were traumatic and added more compassion to Robyn's journey and her feelings, or even a better understanding of why Robyn said or did certain things.  \n\tI believed this film was truly a masterpiece, the scenery, the plot, the characters, and even that little bird Robyn loved so much. Seeing a film in a time where morals were so different than they are today gave me a lot of respect for Robyn and her journey. This film was full of adventure and suspense, you never knew what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the art behind the film, the sketches of movement still shown, I believe really emphasized the hard work put into each scene. To any viewers who have not seen this film I would highly recommend it due to the beautiful simplicity and power of friendship and love. The story is more than just a 17th century colonized village ran by a \"lord\", Wolf Walkers is a once in a lifetime experience of a film and if I could watch it for the first time all over again I would.",

            "content": "The name of the film is called Wolfwalkers. It features actors Eva Whittaker, Honor Kneafsey, and Sean Bean. The movie takes place in Ireland in the 1650s. This movie is a family friendly animated movie filled with fantasy and adventure for everyone to enjoy. \nIn this movie, there is a little girl named Robyn who wants to hunt for wolves just like her father but he wants to keep her safe. One day while in the forest, she meets a little wolfwalker named Mebh. After meeting the wolfwalker, Robyn realizes that she doesn't want to hunt for wolves and she herself turns into a wolfwalker as well. So she tries her best to save the wolves without the people in town hurting the wolves. \nOne thing I believe was very interesting on the film was one of the main characters: Robyn. Her character started out as this girl who tried to do what her father and stay inside but couldn't do that. She wanted to show her father that she's tough enough to help hunt wolves. Unfortunately during this time, it was harder for that and she was forced to help around with household chores. This movie is a little her coming of age story because it ends with her being able to stand up to not only her father but the town leader, Lord Protector, and trying to help save the wolves and a dying wolfwalker. Also the movie starts of with her having braids on her hair but when she stands up for the wolves, her hair is flowing like it's freedom symbolizes her own freedom. \nAnother interesting aspect of the film was the other main character: Mebh. Mebh is a wolfwalker and is supposed to be the alpha of the wolves while her mother is finding a place for her and the wolves to stay safe and roam free. But her trying to be the alpha is a little from the first we see her, she is like a little puppy. She does know how to give commands but she also very silly about it. She doesn't have much experience with it. Like her seeing her mother in cage made her stage a fight between the people and the wolves. And she was trying so hard to make sure her mother didn't die because first that's not a thing most kids want. Second, she probably knew that she couldn't take care of the pack herself. That's why she kept saying her mom's coming back anytime soon. Cause she didn't want to be in charge. \nHow I felt about this film was that I thought it was a really good film. I really did love the animation. I loved the ending of the movie. I didn't like the character Lord Protector but that's a whole other thing. I did think this film was very good movie to show for kids and teaches women and little girls to speak for what's right or it can lead to destruction.",

            "content": "Wolfwalkers as a Journey of Multiple Lenses\n\"Wolfwalkers\" as an animated film has many easter eggs laid out within its dialogue. Brief recurring themes of historical and religious events. These events are presented in a way intended not to take away from the entertainment value and artistic representation of the folklore. The setting of Ireland in 1650 following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, with insights into the religious and social expectations of Protestant ideas. All while existing in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy. Historical details are dispersed through the lenses of ecology, social economics, feminism, and folklore.\nThe narrative of segregated unsupervised girls, finding their way in a new world. All while making their voices heard is exhibited throughout. Even as the opinions of the girls are dismissed.  The movie has two main characters that suggest feminist thought.  Robyn is an inexperienced hunter of wolves who seeks adventure. Her mother is assumed deceased, and her father is away during the days while hunting wolves. Her father has been recruited by the Lord to remove the wolves from the surrounding woods. Mebh is the alpha of the pack of wolves. She is thrust into this role after her mother has been perceived to have abandoned her. The town is ruled by the authoritarian Lord Protector, who is presented as a figurehead for the church and a relentless leader. The townspeople are fearful of Lord Protector and are ordered to cut down the surrounding forest.  The same forest that Robyn wants to explore and Mebh lives as a wolfwalker. A wolfwalker is the town's folklore of humans who transform into wolves at night.\nThe plot unfolds as Robyn sneaks out of the castle gates exhibiting her independence. During her strike of rebellion against her father, is consequently bitten by a wolf. The wolf, Mebh, tries to heal Robyn with a Reki touch. The injury was unintentional and even though Mebh is the alpha wolf, she is playful and cub-like. Robyn and Mebh bicker like siblings while both exhibiting traits of powerful female expression. Robyn believes her skillset is at the level of her father, even though she is inexperienced in the woods and as a hunter.   Robyn strives for adventure and mostly is ignored when she speaks. Mebh is a wild girl who does as she pleases without concern for repercussions.  All while enjoying her life, eating as she pleases, and howling at the moon. The traits of having an opinion and seeking adventure in a male-dominated sport are contradictory to the traditional ways some women are raised. With the addition of having no concern while being authentic and not taking social protocol in decision-making. Both show feminist ideas. \nAfter being bitten, Robyn is human while awake and a wild wolf while sleeping. Robyn tries to express this to her father and confirm that the folklore is indeed true, but he is fearful of the consequences from the townsfolk, and most importantly Lord Protector. He largely ignores Robyn and speaks of wanting to protect her. He sends her to work with a scullery and assigns her housework. Robyn ignores most of the assignments and only complies when she believes it will benefit her. This technique can be argued as an example of women using what power they have for their benefit, to be heard, and respected. \nThe spread of the legend was first told to be authentic by a townsperson with first-hand experience with wolfwalkers. He was quickly considered insane and falsely accused of spreading false rumors which landed him in the pillory.  In the town square, he is prominently displayed to reinforce the power of the state and align the Lord protectors' structure of obedience. With this fear in mind, Robyn's father either ignores her or silences her, even when the reality is directly in front of him as a tangible wolf.\nThe forests are to be ignited and burnt down as a result of wolves being found in the village. Lord Protector ignores the economic logic and reasoning of the townspeople. The townspeople not only are afraid of injury from the wolves. The ethics of approaching and occupying the forest is whispered among the masses. The ideology of environmental impact and deforestation is questioned by townspeople.  \n The townspeople continue to represent the power of folklore throughout the movie by communicating through whispers and oral traditions. Secretly doubting the leadership of Lord Protector. Their concerns are based on the consequences of such action being discovered. The power dynamics of workers' rights and the freedom of religion are questioned. Most of the oral tradition takes place during times of manual labor, by unskilled workers,\nThe plot allows the viewer to dive as far as they wish into the lens of feminist thought, religious power, and additional social viewpoints. Without taking away from the magic of a children's movie. It is enjoyable to watch and explores the humanities and social issues. This allows viewers of all ages to see a glimpse of still frames of justice. \nWhile watching for entertainment as events unfold you are mesmerized. The conscious choice of the animators to use techniques that allow the images to be observed as brush strokes and pencil drawings. Is placed throughout the movie in a way that is not overwhelming and you forget is present.  As if not only the viewer is in a magical place, but also a storybook. The color choices and animation are beautiful and a joy to watch.  This is layered with the soundtrack of songs that both ring a familiarity of Irish with a splash of what could be mistaken for indigenous. Aurora Aksne's voice is a compliment to the power of Robyn and Mebh. and her song \u2018Running with the wolves' stands on its own pedestal of power. I highly recommend her albums and am delighted to have discovered her while watching this film. \nI recommend this film be used in all the contexts discussed above. Though I suggest focusing on questions like when do we allow ourselves to believe in magic and when to be logical? Who is our inner child? And where do we find them?  I think these questions allow viewers to experience this masterpiece of storytelling and the film that the directors may have envisioned.\nThe directors' Tom Moore and Ross Stewart, have two additional films in this trilogy. With this being the last film, I am curious to watch and observe if the themes and beauty of this film play out over all of them. I am interested in learning more about animation techniques while exploring the choice of music.  If a film can leave you wanting so much more of all the tiny details, if it can provoke the mind to ask additional questions, while still being entertaining, I believe it falls under a must-see. \nPG (Scary Images|Peril|Brief Language Sequences of Violence Some Thematic Elements)\nGenre: Fantasy, Adventure, Animation Original Language:\tEnglish\nDirector: Tomm Moore, Ross Stewart\nProducer: Tomm Moore, St\u00e9phan Roelants, Nora Twomey, Paul Young\nWriter:\tWill Collins\nRelease Date (Theaters): Nov 13, 2020  Limited\nRelease Date (Streaming): Dec 11, 2020Runtime:\t1h 43m\nDistributor: GKIDS Aspect Ratio: Flat (1.85:1)",

            "content": "Disobedience? Stocks.\nNot cutting down trees fast enough? Stocks.\nTalking about wolves? Believe it or not, stocks. \n\nInfusing traditional Irish folklore with a creative, colorful, and angular animation style, Wolfwalkers is an animated fantasy adventure about that most internationally treasured of pastimes - throwing off the yoke of humorless English oppression. \n\nThe premise is nice, the characters (particularly the dual protagonists) have a fun dynamic, and Sean Bean stars as a hunter that is legitimately terrible at his job. There really isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the film, and it benefits quite a bit from a unique visual design distinct to the Cartoon Saloon studio and their slate of Irish-centric animated films. But it's tough to say that the film goes too far beyond that, feeling quite a bit like a soft remake of Pocahontas but with a more explicitly youthful flavor and a series of dream werewolves, though the villain is a bit more fleshed out (or possibly on-the-nose, depending on your interpretation; the Lord Protector is a surprisingly biting criticism of religious orthodoxy for a family film). \n\nOverall very well done for what it is, there are enjoyable characters and the relatively simple story beats are smoothed over by good execution and nice visual flair. Is it worthy of the overwhelming critical acclaim that has been heaped on it? Up for debate, but maybe it was a lack of competition given the drought of decent films being released in 2020. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "It's about time that Studio Ghibli had competition in the world of animation, and Cartoon Saloon, the studio behind \"Wolfwalkers\", is certainly stepping up to the slide. Absolutely beautiful 2D animation drawn heavily from ancient Celtic art, coupled with a fantastical storyline that brings to life both our childhood fantasies and deeply primal fears, creates a film that has certainly earned an eternal place in my heart. The storyline here is fantasy, but it is also remarkably, poignantly real. \"Wolfwalkers\" starkly highlights the forces that threaten to tear apart our world today. The townspeople live in fear of the magickal, natural power of the wolves, and the wolves live in fear of the orthodox, mechanical industry of the town. The dangers of fear-driven hierarchy are sharply contrasted against the deep seated need for open harmonious community, love, and understanding. This dualism, though well known, is not shallow in this film. The audience has the pleasure of exploring both sides of the story, and in the end, it is hard not to have compassion for everyone involved.\n    Twin forces, and the larger ties that bind them, play throughout all of the scenes. This tension particularly manifests in the relationship between Mebh and Robyn. Their connection is seemingly timeless, embodying the power of mature, confident emotion contrasted with childlike devotion and idealism. Stay or go, family or friends, paganism or Christianity, the town or the wolves: their relationship stands as a connecting point between these opposing sides. Robyn's fear of Mebh as a wolfwalker is overcome once understanding and love are allowed to enter the picture. Cartoon Saloon has taken the unending truth of love over fear and presented it in a beautiful, sincere, heartwarming way.\n    Storyline and heartstrings aside, this film is also visually outstanding. It truly would be a shame to discuss only the plot. I am personally a lifelong fan of Cartoon Saloons first film, \"The Secret of Kells,\" and \"Wolfwalkers\" met and exceeded all of my expectations for the artistic prowess and commitment of this studio. Their phenomenal attention to the details of the forest, the swirling and emotive song-long montage of Mebh and Robyn during her first night as a wolf, the brilliantly telling character design and obvious effort put into every aspect of the visual process make this a movie that deserves to stand out among modern animated works. Cartoon Saloon has taken archetypal visual tropes and reimagined them in spellbindingly beautiful ways. It is truly a wonderful achievement, and resulted in a film that is profoundly irresistible. Emotionally and visually, \"Wolfwalkers\" is a display of the storytelling power of modern film. We can only hope that other studios will follow suit along this remarkable and mesmerizing path.",

            "content": "Move over, Disney! There's another animation studio gifting us animated films. If you are looking to be truly captivated by a beautiful world of animation, splendor and lore, then forget streaming Disney+. Consider 2020's Wolfwalkers as your film of choice. Released by Irish animation studio, Cartoon Saloon (notable for having its first four feature films nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards), Wolfwalkers is the final installment of a trilogy of films exploring Irish folklore stories. No actors well-known in American cinema, save for Mr. Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, National Treasure, The Island), lend their voices to the film. Rightly so, as American A-listers are sometimes distracting in their animated voice roles (Seth Rogen in DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda trilogy, for example). While the film is a tad longer than necessary for its story, you can't help but be transfixed by the textural prowess of the animation it offers.\n\nWe enter into the world of Wolfwalkers by meeting a young girl named Robin, voiced by Honor Kneafsey, and her father, a hunter named Goodfellowe (Sean Bean), who have just moved to a newly colonized Ireland village in the 1600s. Robin wants to help her dad hunt as she did in England, but the expectation for her is to be a maid. She immediately defies his instruction to stay within the village and ventures into the surrounding forest and encounters a wolf. Later, she meets another young girl named Mebh (pronounced \"MAYb\"). Despite realizing Mebh is the wolf she encountered earlier, the two eventually befriend one another. As the film unfolds, we explore themes of friendship, freedom, courage, and love. All of what we see is taken to grander heights by the stellar voice work throughout the film, notably Kneafsey, Bean and Eva Whittaker as Mebh.\n\nThis movie may, at first, remind the audience of films that came before it, such as Quest for Camelot, Brave and How to Train Your Dragon, just due to setting, score and tone, but later in the film, you realize the lead in each of these films is struggling under the weight of the same problem: the desire to break away from the oppression of social norms, and the insatiable desire to be free. (Free to be a knight who saves Camelot, free to choose whether or not to be married, free to befriend a dragon, or in this case, free to explore the forest and be something more than a scullery maid). However, it manages to carve out its own story amidst a visual animation style that will make you want to return for multiple viewings.\n\nVisually, it is a bonafide triumph. Wolfwalkers makes you feel as though you are watching a classic storybook come to life. After a mere ten minutes into the film, you will be captivated, perhaps even delighted, by its texture and classic animation style. Though some (few, really) of the background characters were a bit reminiscent of new-ish Cartoon Network-style animation fodder like Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, the true magic and wonder is found in the picturesque landscape of the forest, the extra effort displayed in the animation of our heroine, and the Wolfwalkers themselves. The wolves move like the wind, as if they were a physical representation of the jet streams we learned about as grade schoolers in science class. The color and texture of the forest will make you wish you could enter in to the Wolfwalkers' forest and have an adventure of your own.\n\nWhile the film does its best visual storytelling in the scenes where we find Robin alone, it also does a fantastic job of depicting how some of the greatest friendships are forged by the fires of dissimilarity. There's an eternal message there, in how we never know when or how those we don't understand, or maybe don't even initially like, will one day become our closest friends. Outside of the forest, we spend entirely too much time with the villain of the film, named Lord Protector, and every moment spent forced to watch him spew his inane ramblings makes you all the more grateful for the moments we are able to escape back to the forest.\n\nIt's true the film is a little longer than it needed to be, as it does follow a bit of a formula that makes third act occurrences predictable far before they get around to making them happen. However, it is an absolute masterclass in animation, and completely captivating as a result. So, perhaps you won't mind spending an extra 30 minutes in the world of the Wolfwalkers. I know I didn't.",

The visuals are a delight and styled in a flat dimensional space reminiscent of Medieval tapestries (and Wes Anderson movies). The story brings to life 17th century Celtic mythology in a way that is still relevant today and concerns weighty themes about family identity, female independence, religious persecution, prejudice, colonial occupation and exploitation, and environmental conservation. It's part Miyazaki and Brave and also reverent to its own cultural heritage, and it's emotionally affecting and engrossing as well as being a treat for the eyes. We watch a young girl befriend a wild \"wolfwalker,\" a girl who can transform into a wolf when she sleeps. their bond will push each other to fight against forces trying to dominate the forest and morality. The filmmakers have carefully laid out the rules of their story and the implementation of the special powers so that everything happens through gradual circumstances where the plot feels as if it is following an entirely organic path. The voice acting is excellent and heartrending and perfectly paired for the exaggerated, wood-block-styled character designs. It's a lovely and entertaining supernatural fable with enough thematic relevance, girl power, and visual grace to reaffirm just how magical traditional animation can still be.\n\nNate's Grade: A-",

Sometimes it looks like a painting from the 17th century, which is fitting given the setting, and I love how quickly colours can change within a scene, as if the characters themselves are skirting across an artist's palette. The bond between the leads is very authentic, constantly changing and bolstered by great voicework from the leads. Sean Bean, not dying in a film for once, is predictably great as a concerned father torn between duty and family. The 3rd act gets a bit cluttered, with so many things happening at once, but it builds to a satisfying crescendo, and it leads to a happy ending which feels earned, and not just tacked on to satisfy a test audience.

In doing so, she turns her back on the world of human beings and opens herself to the world of wolves.\nAt this fundamental level, Wolfwalkers can be seen as a story of the conflict between civilization and nature. To this end, directors Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart employ two distinct visual styles. The town of Kilkenny is rendered in flat geometric shapes and dark colors. It is oppressive, solid like a block. Thematically this represents the English Puritanical religious views of 1650, and the embodiment of this is the Lord Protector. When he first shows up, the frame is almost devoid of color: his suit and headgear are black and white, with only a splash of red in the emblem on his flag, which symbolizes the violence and killing of the wolves.\n\nIn contrast, the world of the forest is an enchanted paradise. It looks like a three-dimensional watercolor painting \u2013 it's fluid and loose, filled with energy and life. When we see the wolves running through the trees, they move like liquid. All of this tells us that nature is the space of creativity, the space of liberation. Indeed, Mebh openly tells Robyn: \"Come and be free in the forest. Come and play.\"\n\nWhile the design of the town draws on woodcut illustrations from the period, the forest owes a clear debt to the highly decorative manuscripts produced by Irish and British monks between 700-1,000 AD, known as \"insular illumination\" and perhaps best represented by the wonderful Book of Kells. This artistic tradition used sophisticated interlacing and zoomorphic decoration to represent the complexity of nature, its deep interconnectedness, and its organic wholeness. In a luscious visual vegetation, images grow one into the other while animals lurk enigmatically in the background. Not surprisingly, this form of art is an ideal match for a story where nature plays a central role. Sometimes, the visual complexity and the dynamism of images in Wolfwalkers is so exuberant that we have the impression of entering a new visual world resembling that of the Viennese Secession, best exemplified by the work of Gustav Klimt.\n\nHaving passed from the hard, geometric world of the town into the fluid space of the forest, Robyn meets Mebh, a girl about her age who is the embodiment of the natural world. This contrast between town and countryside is echoed in the design of these two protagonists. Look at Mebh, and you will see that the shape of her hair resembles a leaf; her face is round like a heart. But Robyn, who desperately wants to be a hunter, has a face shaped like an arrow; in certain sequences her cape takes the shape of an arrow, too.\n\nThe world of nature has yet another aspect, because it is also a space of magic and ritual. We first see evidence of this in the inscriptions on the walls of the cave where Mebh resides with her mother and the wolves. These markings immediately transport us back to a time when human beings first felt the need to represent sacred beings through drawing. In this way the cave represents our relationship to the divine world and reminds us that, in order to forge the future, we must first explore the past.\n\nVenturing deeper into the cave, we discover Mebh's mother represented in a way that evokes ideas of a Mother Earth Goddess. This returns us to the sacred moment when humans and animals lived in symbiosis, and again we see this story recounted on the walls of the cave. As we absorb the ancient narrative, we realise we are in the presence of the divine.\n\nEven the shape of the cave is suggestive and full of meaning, resembling as it does female anatomy. In this and many other ways, the movie is a celebration of woman. \n\nFor example, Robyn is an archetype of the woman standing against the oppressive authority of men, just like Antigone, stood against her uncle Creon in order to honor paganism and the oral laws of the gods. There are clear echoes of Antigone's story in Wolfwalkers, where the townspeople are told repeatedly that terrible things will to happen if they cut down the trees. At one point, the woodcutter explains to Robyn's father that Saint Patrick made a pact with the pagan god. As for the Wolfwalkers themselves\u2013 they are the magical gods, the divinities who have existed in the forest since primordial times, since before history began. \n\nWolfwalkers is also a celebration of the senses. When Robyn passes from the hard, geometric world of the town into the fluid space of the forest \u2013 and in particular when she transforms into a wolf \u2013 Mebh tells her not to rely on her eyes. Instead, Robyn must learn to use her other senses \u2013 her sense of smell, or the feel of the earth beneath her paws. Mebh is there to guide her \u2013 and also us, the audience \u2013 into this sensory world.\n\nIn addition, beyond even the power of the senses, Mebh possesses the healing power of magic. Yet she cannot cure her mother alone. In order to do that she needs help. She needs the pack, the community, the collective. The power of the family. Even this heroine, this girl with superhero powers, cannot succeed alone. The ultimate message of Wolfwalkers, therefore, stands in defiance of individualism. If we as human beings are going to heal nature, we need each other.\n\nDr. Maria Elena Gutierrez is the CEO and executive director of VIEW Conference, Italy's premiere annual digital media conference.

The style was not as realistic as in a studio Ghibli film, but it's unique and worked well with the film. \n\nThe characters in the movie were pretty good. The main girl who came to Ireland felt like she was trapped in the town, and felt free when she was in the forest. This was portrayed as difference in color tone between the town and the forest. The town looked monotonous and gray, while the forest was filled with bright and lively color. I also liked the movie showing the people in town as fearful and dangerous by drawing their teeth in a nasty way. \n\nThe main story reminded me a bit of Princess Mononoke as both had a character that met a wild character who could communicate with wolves. However, the story here was still different enough to enjoy. But there were still parts that were predictable.\n\nOverall, a beautiful, heartfelt, and entertaining story, even though I was not surprised a lot. 8/10",

Fortunately, I am yet to be disappointed by Cartoon Saloon's as of now impeccable sense of proper taste, are their stories are as pure as their visuals are, invariably, beautiful. This time they are taking us to the time period between their first and second feature films to tell a tale that I see as a spin on the ones already told by them (except \"The Breadwinner\", as it is something completely different). Yet again we travel with our protagonist to enchanted world that is hidden from the view from regular folk, but this time its inhabitants \u2013 the wolfs and the wolfwalkers \u2013 are actively opposed by the \"normal\" world led by no other than Oliver Cromwell himself, which I consider quite controversial to be honest.

How many times do we hear, \"Robyn you must...\" this, you must that; it's all for the best; it's for your own good, along with all the declarations from or in honor of the less than honorable lord protector? \nThe father is generally a useless simpleton tool. The wolves are largely less than impressive 'beasts' for all the fear and rage they create in the townspeople. \nThe real brilliance in this film is clearly the artwork. The drawing is so often a great example of the difference between simple and simplistic. Less intelligent and specialized animals like livestock or beasts of burden are given very generic looks. As are the one-dimensional human characters like those in the scullery. But Mebh, the town and castle, and especially the Wolfwalker magic and the woods are given very intricate details. Scenes where the wolfwalker characters leave one form to become another are also dazzling, along with the impressionistic style used in showing us the woods and landscape of rural Ireland.\nA little more creative dialogue and/or less repetitious action could've gotten this to a truly animated classic status for me. As it is, it's still pretty dazzling animated filmmaking. 3.8 stars",

This movie disappointed and insulted me on a personal level almost as much as I Lost My Body. The story is the perfect storm of bland, unlikable, and frustrating beyond all reason. It's basically telling the exact same story as how to train your dragon, but done without the any of the layers of depth that made HTTYD so beloved. People consider this worthy of being better than SOUL?!?!? This is an absolutely hollow and artificial dynamic of a movie that doesn't deserve to be talked about in the same BREATH as Soul!

Now going for their fourth, and very likely to realise that impressive achievement, Kells' co-director Tomm Moore returns (this time with Ross Stewart) with a beautifully rendered animated feature set in 17th century Ireland under English rule, in the small town of Kilkenny where a young girl called Robyn live with her wolf-hunter single father. Her encounter with young Mebh, a wolfwalker who lives amongst the wolves and turns into one when she sleeps, kick-starts a mythological story that reflects and explores a plethora of issues including Irish history, religion, environmental preservation and societal fear of anything that doesn't conform to the mass majority. Visually, it continues in the same unique style that the studio has established with its past work, applying a more traditional approach with a rustic natural spirituality to it and the result is classy, joyful and timeless. Whilst I must confess I have a soft spot for the more realistic and uncompromising portrayal in The Breadwinner, Wolfwalkers has a more child-like fairytale quality that skewers a little younger (so it's a real winner for any kids in the audience) and feels a little too neat and child-friendly in the end, but it is the subtle and sophisticated manner in which it handles these mature issues, making them accessible to audience for all ages, that I find most welcoming and remarkable. That and the film's sumptuous aesthetics, of course.",

He is here to assist with a wolf problem in the surrounding forest, but the daughter is about to learn that there is truth behind the myth: wolfwalkers are living amongst the canines.  When they are awake, they are human.  When they sleep, they transform and lead the pack.  Now I have to give credit where credit is due: Apple TV+ has been putting out some decent content during the pandemic.  I'm still working off of a year free trial, but a $5 monthly price tag isn't that steep, and it would be worth that for Ted Lasso alone.  I could see Wolfwalkers going either way.  I only have the studio's previous works to go off of, and while I thought that The Breadwinner was terrific, The Secret of Kells left me cold.  For me, Wolfwalkers falls somewhere in the middle, which ends up being a decent compliment.  If there is one area that you can't take anything away from Wolfwalkers, it would have to be the animation.  This is a gorgeous film to look at, and it is all 2D and hand-drawn.  Cartoon Saloon is a studio that has a unique style, and you can always tell when you are watching one of their films.  If nothing else, you can always rely on this movie to wow you with the visuals, and I do have to award big-time points there.  I think the pacing here works as well, and it never slows down to a point where you get bored with it.  However, I did have a problem with character interaction.  You understand where everybody is coming from, and that part is well-handled, but it is vexing because every single problem in this film stems from characters not listening to one another.  The dad wants to protect the daughter, but the daughter deliberately disobeys and throws caution to the wind.  The daughter has the solution to everyone's problem, but she gets brushed off and told to sit down.  It is problematic writing, and it holds this film back from leaping over the hurdle to that next level.  Wolfwalkers is a well-made movie.  I appreciate the craft here, and I know that this took a lot of time and energy to make.  I was invested in the story because there are stakes, and another positive I have is that actions here have consequences.  I could tell that two of the characters were going to safe, but I was never sure what everyone else's fate would be.  I think this is worth a watch, especially if you are getting Apple TV+ on a free subscription like me.",

One day, Robyn meets Mebh, who turns out to be a wolf walker, a creature who by day is in human form but at night can leave the sleeping body and roam the world as a wolf. This is a really beautiful film. The story is based on Celtic legend but feels very contemporary in the various themes it tackles, such as the ongoing dichotomy of human \u2013 versus \u2013 nature and the power of friendship and family. From an animation standpoint, it is simply gorgeous to watch \u2013 all of the rich colors, every scene looks like a rich watercolor, and the color changes capture the \"locked in, grays and browns\" feel in the city and the richer and more vibrant colors of nature. The music is beautiful with its Celtic melodies. While Song of the Sea is my all-time favorite, Wolfwalkers is quite stunning and powerful and is nearly equal in its execution of animation and narrative. This film gets a big thumbs-up from me. If you loved Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea, you will definitely like this one as well.",

            "content": "The biggest surprise of 2020 for me. I was privileged to watch this before it's released to the general public at the Savannah Film Festival. There's a lot here to appreciate. The animation is one of them. It's simplistic but it still looks incredible. Every character, every building, every tree is different and unique from the next and the way they frame these shots is great. The animation style makes these environments look rich and beautiful. The performances are great too. Each cast meme we did a great job portraying their characters especially Sean Bean and these portrayals made the emotional beats hit much harder and this is all due to the great character development and writing. Every main character has a purpose and an arc they go through like the father realizing that just because something may look dangerous on the outside doesn't mean they are dangerous on the inside. The story here is simplistic and that's what I think holds this film from a 9/10 or a 10/10. Elements of the story feel a little basic but that's okay because it's not geared towards adults. This was an incredible animated movie and I'm thankful that I got to check it out early. Please watch this when it comes out later this month. It's probably the best animated film of the year and I don't see anything else topping it.",

I know the big gun from Pixar is coming up (Soul), but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart's beautifully heartwarming Celtic-inspired tale. Cartoon Saloon continues to prove that 2D animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeous-looking, unique, artistic drawings. Despite Will Collins's generic narrative and cliche messages, every single detail is executed perfectly, without a single flaw to point out. Outstanding voice work from Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker as the well-written, captivating protagonists. However, it's Bruno Coulais and K\u00edla's original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. One of my favorite films of the year, I'd be extremely surprised with myself if it doesn't end on my Top10. Watch it with your family. It's worth it.\"",

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nIf you love all-things-Irish, Renaissance festivals, as well as Studio Ghibli, this Apple Original film looks and feels like a lovely combination of all of those things. Add the voice of Sean Bean. Yes, please! This magical animation is from the Academy Award-nominated makers of The Secret of Kells AND Song of the Sea and based on Irish folklore. It was directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, becoming the first animated feature to be nominated for \"Best International Feature\" at the Gotham Awards. The film is dedicated to Mark Stewart, who passed away this year. Cartoon Saloon continues to pump out beautiful animation films that are pretty close to visual masterpieces.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThis is a perfect family-friendly film that all ages can enjoy.\nWolves attack people. People attack wolves.\nYou might need to talk to young children about magic and imagination.\n\nTHEMES:\nFriendship\nCourage\nTolerance\nHumans vs. nature\nFamily\nFemale empowerment\nThe creators of the film explained that colonialism was the real villain in the story in that it separated protagonists from nature.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nThe concept art is absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. It's refreshing to see two-dimensional and under-appreciated hand-drawn animation. The colors and geometric shapes are extremely enchanting, making each frame a piece of art to be studied. One of my sons is a 3D animation artist at Blizzard and he has taught me to really appreciate the mastery of hand-drawn animation.\nYou really get a sense of Ireland in the 1600s\nYou can almost feel how damp the green forest is in animation.\nVisually, the movie also illustrates the cage women of that day might have felt they were in. There are lots of angles and big black lines that represent society's rules that trapped Robyn, the young heroin in the story.\nHonor Kneafsey voices the enthusiastic Robyn Goodfellowe and does a fantastic job.\n\nEva Whittaker lends her spunky voice to Mdbh Og MacTire.\nThe humor is both visual and spoken.\nThe British and Irish accents of the characters are super cute.\nIf you love the artistry in this film, you might also want to check out:\nThe story features the stark contrast between the magic of nature and that of the Lord Protector's rigid religious fervor. The film's creators explained that the type of Puritan religion that Lord Cromwell brought to Christianity emphasized man over nature, instead of a balance between the two: domination vs. submission. Whenever the story spotlights what's happening in the forest, the colors are light and green; to show the duality of thinking at the time, the city scenes feature grey tones in the color palette.\nClever framing devices.\nThe film knows when to be silent to let the audience bask in the beauty.\nI loved the scene that shows Mebh Og practically melting on Robyn's lap while she gets her hair brushed by her new human friend. So sweet.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThe father shows warmth to his daughter but he never listens to her.\nI hate it when religious people in movies are shown as truly terrible people.\n\nINTERESTING LINES:\n\"Work is prayer, girl.\" - Head Housekeeper (Nora Twomey)\n\"I prayed the whole Bible.\" - Robyn Goodfellowe (Honor Kneafsey)\n\"We must do what we're told.\" - Bill (Sean Bean) \"Why? - Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) \"I'm afraid.\" - Bill (Sean Bean)\n\nYou can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website.",

Seriously, I don't know where to begin. The only thing I will say though is that this is no doubt the greatest animated film of 2020 and most possibly one of my all-time favorites! When you get the chance to watch this on Apple TV+, look and process every shot that is shown in it. The reason why is because every shot that was shown was like artwork in a museum. The design/backgrounds of the old town of Kilkenny, Ireland were very structured. All of the motions flowed very smoothly throughout. My favorite shots in the film overall, have got to be wolf POV shots. The way how the staff animated the wolves' senses to help explain the audience of what makes a wolf a special creature, makes the watching experience a lot more intriguing. Speaking of wolves, I love everything related to them in this film! Their mythology, designs, emotions, the harmonic howls! You name it, I live for it! AWOOOOOO! Ok, I'll stop being my furry-self, lol! So to wrap things off, I love almost everything about this film. The voice acting, story, characters, theming, music (OMG I'm definitely buying that song on iTunes), editing/pacing, and finally the animation. The only thing that I would say the film needed more of was character interaction between Robyn and Mebh before the big conflict. Overall, I'm definitely running with the wolves tonight because this movie was a pure work of art! AWOOOOOOOOOO! 9.5/10",
