Almost every single moment of this movie is complete nonsense. This is the worst movie in the series but also one of the worst movies I have seen recently. Even if you like mindless action movies this movie is so completely devoid of logic and driven by a story that is so ridiculously stupid, it is almost laughable. In fact, if you watch this movie as one of those movies that are so bad it's entertaining, there is potentially some value in it. Even among the terrible Indian movies, I have seen before, this one reaches a true low. We as a society need to stop giving our money to movies like this because the fact that anyone thought this was a good idea is mind-boggling.",

The movie is suppose to be an action thriller but somehow, it turns into an unintentional comedy. I went opening weekend & found myself along with the rest of the audience laughing outloud. Laughing so hard that I was crying! So if you're in the mood for a great comedy, go check out this 3rd installment of Baaghi.",

There were characters that showed up for no reason, made no sense when they were there & disappeared with no explaination. The dialogue was so absurd that the movie would have been better off with no dialogue whatsoever and just the inexplicable action sequences.  When Siya claims that Vikram's being sent to Syria is \"amazing, it'll be like a paid holiday\", then you know that no one writing the script cared how bad this movie would be. I know it's too much to ask that all action movies be as good as the epic Baahubali movies, but do they really need to be this absurd???",

Delivered by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment and Fox Star Studios. \nThis is third film of Baaghi arrangement coordinated by previous choreographer Ahmed Khan. This film has numerous great and awful things. Tiger Shroff is best in real life groupings. A large number of his activity scenes are stunning. Ritesh Deshmukh went about as Tigers senior sibling. A High octane Action Thriller Film. Actually No Words about Tiger's Action and Stunts yet he have to improve his acting office . Shraddha Kapoor and Ankita lokhande were alright however Their exchanges were exceptionally awful . Riteish Deshmukh has worked superbly yet same as his exchanges were so cringy. \nStoryline ought to be all the more better. Film has a few material science however no physical science in Film and As well as rationale resembles maro mujhe maro. Be that as it may, a general Good Action Thriller Film. In the event that you are activity Fans and Tiger Shroff fans go watch for it. Another hit. One star cut for no material science and rationale. One star cut for cringy Dialogs.",
