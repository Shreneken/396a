            "content": "In the competition for the Oscars in 2021, among the films that could all together be described in the mildest and most benevolent way simply as a god-da*n boring, an interesting achievement by screenwriter and director Aaron Sorkin stands out, about the event that was initially known as the trial of eight, but after the dismissal of charges against Black Panthers leader Bobby Seale, became the trial of seven protest organizers in Chicago in 1968.\n\nAside from all the disagreements with historical facts, simplification, polishing and the usual falsification of elements of the story, ostensibly for artistic freedom and greater dramatic effects, the film managed to convey the spirit and mood of American citizens towards the establishment from the described period, remaining dynamic and interesting for watching to the end, something in which e.g. failed a film that is describing the same time period, \"Judas and Black Messiah\".\n\nFor great casting and flawless acting, I have no comments. Unfortunately, there was enough time in the movie for irritating individual lines and retellings of jokes that do not belong to the plot or events that are described, and which are the so-called \"seal\" of the director. Some characters were invented without any real reason, such as a girl who plays an inserted FBI agent and then witnesses in the court, even though the first female agent in the FBI was employed only a decade later.\n\nIs it a big movie? Sadly, no. Is it better than the other candidates for the Academy Award? Yes, for a length of two spears. Only, as someone has already noticed, the film did not bring us as close to the events of 5 decades ago as modern events and democracy have returned to the past for so much. When not well learned, history tends to repeat itself. For local occasions, we in Serbia now already know that very well.",

            "content": "Writer-director Aaron Sorkin at his definite best, peaked impeccably, when not only being a storyteller exposing echoing truths through true colors that radiates relevantly today but mainly a transporter solidly delivering a time capsule. You're not only watching the trial like a compelled filmgoer, but you also become helpless when capably enveloped in the depicted time period whereas greedy corruption and injustice takes over by being pathetically powerful and politically uncaring by disposability. This is the other half of a shared discussion towards the politically problematic Vietnam war with Spike Lee's \"Da 5 Bloods\", both forming a perfect double feature under connected rebelliously stirring commentary, whereas critical exposures come to light and connections finally unveiled. Provocative resonance is the main way to describe the experience as tensions rises amid conflicting morals regarding peaceful revolutionary precepted methods argued when prosecution and police brutality asked for violent opposites, particularly conservative bias running unfairly under supposed repeatedly stated \"impartial\".\n\nWhen we identify with the defendants stressfully at the edge of our seats, it's emotionally thrilling than most courtroom dramas being merely observants with not much provocative rising rather just hopeful engagement by intellectual fascination. (If not, then there's a true color within negatively aligned with abused power). Entirely strengthened by Sorkin's balanced thoroughness of factual deliverance while the brilliant cast performed at their best under energetically gripping perfection that builds up a convincingly immersive atmosphere with interpretive expressions that respectfully adds onto the facts. Overwhelming injustice of spineless unresolve takes up most of the aura, which affected the rating as it deserves higher, but undeniably graded based off on the overall thunderous spirit infecting our inner rebellious sides between the sharpness and exceptionality across all praiseworthy merits.

I really enjoyed Molly's Game, and I think it's a better film than The Trial Of The Chicago Seven. The cast is impressive, and the film is fun, but it feels like a missed opportunity to nail the subject matter to a more serious attempt to put it on screen. Sorkin's screenplays are frequently full of comedy, and he writes it well, but it's an approach that doesn't fully grasp the seriousness of the story here, for my money at least. The performances are generally good, but there's an element of too many cooks here as well, and there are times when you yearn for the court room of an Oliver Stone film, or even something as basic but effective as Runaway Jury (2003). It's an interesting story and it's good fun, but it's a bit too staged, and you're left feeling maybe you need to check out a documentary on the event.",

This is the Hollywoodified recounting of the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests — for a more accurate and nuanced story, read The Nix — that shuffles the timeline of the protest and trial, focusing much more on the latter and its comically ridiculous injustices. I wasn't in that courtroom and can't imagine all of these incidents actually taking place, nevertheless it personifies Judge Hoffman (Frank Langella) as \"the Man,\" the epitome of what \"The Seven\" had traveled to Chicago to protest in the first place. There's a conversation between Abbie Hoffman (no relation to the judge, which is addressed in the courtroom) (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) that represents the Far-Left and the Center-Left, both of which would be considered Alt-Right by Antifa-Progressives today. For example, during Hoffman's fantastic testimony, he admires the virtues of Abraham Lincoln (instead of tearing down his statue), promotes American patriotism and democracy, and quotes Jesus Christ. The \"action\" scenes that take place during the protest flashbacks would've been a fart in the wind compared to the summer of 2020. Cohen steals the show as Hoffman and his performance is worth the price of admission alone. Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin — think Cheech to Hoffman's Chong — also has a stand-out performance as the counter-culture icon whose wiki page reads like so many of these activists': \"[A]n American social activist, anti-war leader, and counterculture icon during the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, he became a successful businessman.\" Womp, womp. The Trial of the Chicago 7 excels as a courtroom drama — more so in the ridiculously unjust procedures and hijinks from the defendants than eliciting damning testimony or smoking-gun evidence — and a snapshot of the tumultuous late-60s layered in Sorkin wit.",

Y otra de las cosas que me encantó de la cinta es el feeling con la que los protagonistas y antagonistas cuentan la historia, ya que cada uno al contar su versión le meten su propia esencia, aunque la historia que cuentan se mantenga en la misma línea, lo que lo hace mas dinámico e interesante.

            "content": "Watching The Trial of the Chicago 7 was as fascinating as it was embarrassing an experience for me. On the one hand, going in completely fresh to the film's true story of the titular activist group made for a bewitching, unwinding, often affronting, always captivating night of cinema I'll cherish for years to come. On the other, my same ignorance to the landmark events surrounding the protests of the 1968 Democratic National Convention left me thoroughly unsettled, especially considering just how unbelievably they mirror those of the Black Lives Matter movement taking place over fifty years later in 2020.\n\nWell, where public schooling failed me (and many others, presumably, let's be real), the great Aaron Sorkin's latest masterpiece has filled in the cracks and then some as a history lesson, social commentary, and riveting political appeal to the American people everyone needs to see.\n\nAs its title suggests, The Trial of the Chicago 7 follows the legal proceedings of the eponymous group after their peaceful rallies and demonstrations against the Vietnam War and presidential candidate selections turned into a disastrous night of unprovoked brutality. With a judge, system, and government already set on their culpability, the condemned set of defendants fight tooth and nail to make their voices heard in a rigged, political statement of a trial.\n\nAny other year, The Trial of the Chicago 7 would be a standout film in its own right. But for the first time in a while, this particular Sorkin film additionally has something important and immediately pertinent to say about the mesmerizing shit show it adapts and documents. Though it's been stuck in development limbo after Steven Spielberg pitched the idea to Sorkin in 2006, the film could not have come out at a more needed time. Crafted with a deft and insightful hand heightened by Sorkin's patented isms, the film dissects and skewers practically every relevant political problem hounding the United States in an ingeniously accessible, step-by-step breakdown of the reciprocating, perpetuating moments of the nation's civil unrest then and today.\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\nEddie Redmayne and the immaculately well-cast Sacha Baron Cohen lead these conflicts as protester leaders Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman. Additionally, Jeremy Strong steals scenes as Abbie's right-hand man, Jerry Rubin. Where Hayden's approach targets the Man's out of touch, putrid old guard with inoffensive, almost ambivalent civil appeals, the Flower Power's Hoffman and Rubin aim towards a big, messy systemic and cultural revolution with no holds barred. Though the two are united for the same cause, it's a fascinating tension that arises between these two sides of the same coin, one to which the film holds up a critical mirror that reflects the same issues currently plaguing the contemporary Democratic Party's political branding.\n\nAt another angle, The Trial of the Chicago 7 chillingly explores the unbelievable breadth of power the American government's claws extend to. With moles, wire taps, press control, and everything just shy of lizard men in between, the film presents an enlightening look at the disparity between the public and its rulers at large, particularly and especially when it comes to the shunning of black voices. In his limited role as Bobby Seale (despite the proposed universality of the law, Sorkin makes a sobering point by abiding to this case's historically white courtroom, down to the film's title), Yahya Abdul-Mateen II continues his streak as one of the best up-and-comers in Hollywood alongside a possibly career-best performance from Mark Rylance as the Chicago 7's idealistic and emotive lawyer, William Kunstler.\n\nAll this comes packaged with the killer zip, zap, POW that's come to be expected from a Sorkin script, and since his directorial debut with Molly's Game in 2017, it's hard to deny one of, if not the best screenwriter around has stepped up his game behind the camera as well. No one knows how to craft a scene like Sorkin, and his electric dialogue leaps off the page and onto the screen with results that captivate just as strongly as any other of his glorious screenplays.\n\nIt all comes to a blood-boiling head in what's perhaps the film's greatest ultimate insight and contribution: surveying and interpreting the machinations of how a riot really begins. Wherever you may land on the political spectrum, the emotional, historical, and critical points that The Trial of the Chicago 7 strikes are undeniable and will for many likely change hearts and open eyes at the political calamity currently coursing through the country. In addition to its merits as possibly the best film of 2020, is an important cultural work spotlighting experiential learning at its best.",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILER ALERT\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 was another \"meh\" movie for me. It was good, there was nothing wrong with it per se, it just didn't impress. It had a good plot, mostly good acting (two stunning performances from Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong), mostly good direction, and some middle-of-the-road dialogue/writing, though very good compared to most Netflix movies. First, I'll go in depth on the acting piece. The best actors were definitely Baron Cohen and Strong as the Yippies. They were funny, infectious, and emotional/serious at the right time. I thought Redmayne did alright, nothing amazing or powerful, but it was exceptional. Rylance was the only other actor worth mentioning, all the others were at the same level as Redmayne, good, but not great. I thought the direction was good for the most part, though I do think that there were things that could've been left out and or changed. For example, I thought the parts where the film cut to Hoffman's stand up was sort of unnecessary and could've been cut. It was annoying because it felt like Sorkin forgot about it for awhile and added it in once he remembered it. The dialogue was the only thing I had a bit of a problem with. It was just a bit corny and then out-of-character at times, as is the case with most Netflix movies. I have to say though that The Trial of Chicago 7 was better than most Netflix movies in terms of writing. The story was the best part, it was exciting and it had a good message that is not confused or defeated at anytime throughout the movie. Overall, it was a good movie, but it wasn't a \"oh my gosh, 5 stars\" movie.",

Originally a film that was originally going to be directed by Steven Spielberg, Sorkin brings his trademark pace and writing skill to deliver a solid film. The trial and the way it unfolds is the crux of the film's story. With a great ensemble star cast, great writing, and great directing, The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is a throwback to the courtroom drama films of yesteryear. Its the acting and the writing that help create this films excellence. Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, and Joseph Gordon Levitt are just some of the standout performers in the film. The writing and way that the dialogue is delivered and presented helps create a film that can be relatable to today's generation and events. One negative (not really a big negative) is that the film could have been a little bit longer. Considering how much info and story that is available, it would have been nice if the film didn't time jump too often. Its a really interesting film, and one that is definitely one of the best Netflix productions in terms of the films that they produced. Definitely watch it now!",

Then it quickly introduces us to its entourage cast of characters, and even more quickly thrusts us into The Trial, catching us up on the events in question through rapid-fire courtroom scenes and quippy flashbacks. It's fun, it's quoteable, it's about 60% historically accurate, and it will get you good and mad. But it's also Sorkin at peak Sorkin, full of walk and talks and Angry White Men on Soapboxes. It's a screenplay that feels like a stage-to-screen adaptation, likely due to Sorkin's past as a playwright. Just once I'd love to see Sorkin try naturalistic dialogue that doesnt feel \"written\".  This is a movie rife with monologues for theatre class. It's also one that never lets you get too close to any of the characters; what were any of them truly feeling? They're shaded in just enough for you to know that Sacha Baron Cohen's The Smart Radical and Jeffrey Strong's the Dumb Hippie and Eddie Redmayne is the Clean Cut Liberal. (If you were hoping for any female characters, look elsewhere.) The main character isn't even a person but The Trial itself. The history of this one is far more interesting (and infuriating!) than the movie itself; this story would have been better served as a series, where the characters could be more developed and some of the more insane plot points could be more deeply explored (like gagging the only Black man on trial for 3 full days in an American court of law, say what?). If I'd watched this movie in any other context, I would have liked it more than I did because it's certainly entertaining and will send you on a deep Wikipedia spiral afterward, but as a Best Picture nominee, it left a sour taste in my mouth that I can't quite identify. Maybe it's just that I'm tired of seeing old white men in Hollywood get awarded for doing the same thing over and over again (telling the same stories in the same ways) while other artists who are taking bigger, bolder creative risks don't get the same opportunities for funding, exposure, or awards.",

This is one of the more complex subjects I've seen (a trial of seven/eight defendants and all the players and events surrounding the case) and while it doesn't always work (the flashbacks are sometimes difficult to follow), the court room scenes are electrifying.\n\nAll the acting is top notch, but the standout for me wasn't Sacha Baron Cohen (he was excellent) but the judge played by Frank Langella and the lead defense attorney played by Mark Rylance.\n\nThis is the last of the eight films nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and for the life of me I can't predict who will win.

No one feels like a human being acting or speaking like people actually do, but worse than that, Sorkin completely fails to tell the audience why the Chicago 7 are important figures in The Civil Rights Movement as well as the anti-Vietnam War protests of the late 1960's in America. I do not recommend seeing this even out of morbid curiosity or if you're a fan of the cast. Even if you liked Sorkin's previous writing like The Social Network, West Wing, or A Few Good Men, skip The Trial of the Chicago 7.\n\nSorkin's writing makes everyone into a joke telling caricature and these famous peaceful protestors with groundbreaking ideas and brave voices, who put themselves out there on all of our behalves get minced down into soundbites and one note personas. The worst aspect to The Trial of the Chicago 7 is no that it's boring, not that it's uninformative, but that it is disrespectful to the Chicago 7. You leave the film learning nothing other than I hope that Aaron Sorkin stops directing and gives his scripts to a competent director, who might elevate his ideas and words into compelling filmmaking.\n\nHis writing is famously dense, but a lot of sound and fury can signify nothing as he has nothing to say here. His infamously centrist politics prevents him from properly relating to these progressive icons or understanding the raw power of their words. Sorkin leaves the brutal police, abusive government, and brave protesters all looking like morons. Only Eddie Redmayne's more centrist figure Thomas Hayden, or at least that's how Hayden gets portrayed, feels like he gets any sympathy or character development. It's astounding just how bare bones the script feels as everything beat feels cliche, every emotional epiphany contrived, and the embarrassing ending laughable. I'm shocked at how amateur Sorkin's direction is, but his lauded script writing skills should have saved this movie, but they only drag it down.\n\nSorkin's direction is dull and uninspired with little to visually look at or captivate. But the real problem is that Sorkin gives no context for what the protests were, who did what, what the riots were, or any actual information. It starts with a poor montage of random political clips from the 60's that give very little context to what was happening, then he just gives the names of characters on screen like the cast for a play instead of introducing them with who they are, what they're been doing, or anything emotional maybe? The Trial of the Chicago 7 should have been a documentary because it might have been informative at least.\n\nI appreciate Mark Rylance's level headed and passionate defense lawyer William Kunstler with Rylance's signature subtle acting. He's likable, thoughtful, and poignantly hits at how and why this trial was a real shame. He's the only character that got an emotional, raw reaction out of me when Michael Keaton's testimony gets denied. \n\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II is wasted as Bobby Seale as he's barely in the movie and you never quite understand his perspective other than from Abdul-Mateen II's serious attempt at moving you as he undergoes America's judicial system at its worst. Likewise, Kelvin Harrison Jr. is wasted as Fred Hampton, who we just barely get a few moments with at all. Sacha Baron Cohen's Abbie Hoffman wisecracks and totally loses Hoffman's intelligence and charisma. He feels like a vague impression at best. \n\nFurthermore, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's supposedly morally grounded lawyer prosecuting the Chicago 7 is ridiculous and culminates in looking like Sorkin is trying to humanize the federal government abusing their power to attack and incarcerate protestors. Michael Keaton's cameo as Ramsey Clark is cool and well acted, but leads to little affecting material. Frank Langella's great as the cruel and corrupt Judge Julius Hoffman presiding over this circus courtroom drama, but his performance ends with an absurdly contrived final moment. Jeremy Strong's Jerry Rubin is actually funny, but gives you no insight into the man at all. \n\nAlan Baumgarten's editing is choppy and doesn't flow at all. He makes Aaron Sorkin's slow, poorly directed, amateurly written script cut into a dreadfully paced feature. 130 minutes feels like 230 easily. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is rough with constantly moving cameras distracting from Sorkin's goofy dialogue and all the weird choices. Papamichael is a legendary cinematographer who shot Ford v Ferrari, Walk the Line, The Descendents, 3:10 to Yuma, Cool Runnings, and W. However, The Trial of the Chicago 7 made me annoyed with the weird sudden close-ups or awkward wide shots where you don't even know where to look. Even his cinematography for Gore Verbinski's absurdist comedy MouseHunt is vastly superior.\n\nDaniel Pemberton's score is forgettable and sounds like anything music from any courtroom drama or standard issue historical drama from the past few decades. Susan Lyall's costumes look like cartoon versions of what people wore to insinuate who people were, but without much personality. Shane Valentino's production design and Andrew Baseman's set decoration is so basic that you never quite place the movie to take place during the 60's until you see the hippies.\n\nIn all, I'm quite disappointed in Aaron Sorkin and his forced emotions, lackluster script, and beginner level direction. You'd think with such an outrageous miscarriage of justice that this trial was conducted by Frank Langella's dementia judge would have been enthralling, but Sorkin just goes through the motions here.",

            "content": "The Trial of the Chicago 7 resonates as much as it does because even though it is a dramatization of events from 50 years ago, it feels like it could have been based on current events. I knew next to nothing about the Chicago 7 before watching this movie, but I also know that good movies don't always make for good history. However, The Trial of the Chicago 7 does the best thing a movie based on an important true story can do: it gives me a strong sense of what things were like for the people involved and it makes me want to learn more. I have never cared much for Aaron Sorkin's TV projects, but I have really enjoyed his film writing (A Few Good Men, The Social Network) and even his work as a director (Molly's Game). As with Molly's Game, Sorkin writes and directs, but it is clear that Sorkin the writer is at the helm. Aaron Sorkin is aware that his forte is writing speeches and debates and that awareness can also be his problem. This based-on-true-events courtroom drama is in many ways what you expect, but it is no less satisfying to watch.\n\nProtests against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned into riots and 7 people (actually 8) were arrested and charged with crossing state lines to intentionally start a riot, though, of course, this was not true. We see dramatizations of the trial, strategy sessions and arguments the 7 have with each other and their lawyer, and flashbacks of the events leading up to the protests turned riots and why that turn happened (it might be unfortunately no surprise or shock to find out that the police, not the accused 7, escalated the protests into riots).  \n\nThis is the epitome of an ensemble cast. Every role, major and minor, is a distinct one and played by recognizable name or face. It is an impressive and slightly distracting cast. When the defense team tracks down an important witness you spend the preceding scene wondering what celebrity will be waiting for them at the end of the hall. The standouts of the ensemble are Sacha Baron Cohen, who has earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance in the very showy role of Abbie Hoffman, Mark Rylance as William Kunstler, the determined lawyer for the 7, and Frank Langella as the prejudiced, frustrating, and incompetent Judge Julius Hoffman. Eddie Redmayne gives a good performance as Tom Hayden, the head of Students for a Democratic Society, but his best scenes are his arguments/debates with Cohen as Abbie Hoffman. I really enjoyed their scenes together; both are on the same side and want to achieve the same goal but are on different paths. \n\nThe 8th person on trial is Bobby Seale, the national chairman of the Black Panthers, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. who was not involved in the planning of any of the DNC protests but was charged nevertheless and lumped into the trial as part of the FBI's campaign against the Panthers. The scenes with Seale are noteworthy not just for the injustice being dealt to him but for Mateen's performance as well. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays the federal prosecutor and does a good job in a pretty restrained role. John Carol Lynch and others also turn in solid performances but in a cast this stacked it is difficult to stand out. \n\nThe story of the Chicago 7 is perfect material for Sorkin. It allows for lengthy speeches, wordy arguments, memorable characters, and declarations about political and moral values. The runtime is just over two hours but for a dialogue heavy movie, it is well paced and engaging. I think Sorkin successfully makes this into something more than just another courtroom drama. The Trial of the Chicago 7 feels like a pageant at times but it is one that needs to be performed and is done so very well. This film doesn't have the at times frenetic feel of Molly's Game—which really feels like he was trying to recreate Danny Boyle's lively aesthetic—or an especially distinct visual style. Here Sorkin lets the dialogue and performances shape the movie.",

It can be acceptable that some aspects are changed in films or series about historical events, for the benefit of the drama, but totally changing actual history basically makes history into fiction. Too many so called historical dramas are pretty far from factual reproductions of what really happened, like it also is with The Trail of the Chicago 7, and this trend makes it advisable to take the authenticity with solid pinches of salt. The trial that this plot is based upon may have been a farse, so it's not necessary to further make it into melodramatic comedy or parody. The activist's discussions are reminding of a family gathering in a mediocre Woddy Allen farse, where every line obviously comes from a diferent mouth but is from the same mind. Nothing here stands out as either sensational, impressing or particularly informative. The only close to outstanding acting performance is from Frank Langella as Judge Julius Hoffman, though even his character flies over the top, as do basically every other. Eddie Redmayne manages to keep it closer to earth but Sacha Baron Cohen is far better in The Spy. This is even discribed as highly relevant to current historical events in the US, and if it's such an important piece of history, it deserves a serious, true and credible dramatization, which this film is not. If it wins any Academy Award it also becomes a tragedy.",

El desarrollo es el de un típico drama tribunalicio y son los flashbacks, a veces en montaje paralelo con las declaraciones testimoniales, los que van reconstruyendo los hechos y su cronología. El lenguaje no es altisonante y aparecen inesperados rasgos de humor durante las audiencias, pero lamentablemente, como película estadounidense no puede privarse de algún momento culminante efectista. También se abordan las disidencias (a veces profundas) entre los acusados en función de sus grupos de pertenencia.\n\nSólo hay dos situaciones de verdadera e inesperada tensión (una de ellas muy dura) durante un juicio que fue planteado desde el vamos como un montaje aleccionador y donde se manifiesta también el racismo de siempre.\n\nA pesar de su longitud, no decaen ni el ritmo ni el interés, sobresaliendo las actuaciones de Frank Langella como un imponente y por momentos iracundo juez y la de Joseph Gordon-Levitt como el solvente y contenido fiscal que cumple instrucciones pero no carece de consciencia.\n\nEn suma, el juicio de los 7 de Chicago es el tipo de película \"basada en hechos reales\" y de \"denuncia política\" que les gusta a los electores de los Oscars pero que dista bastante de ser un gran film.\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\n\n\nA trial with few surprises\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Chicago 7 trial is the kind of \"based on real events\" and \"political denunciation\" film that the voters of the Oscars like, a court-political drama with the Vietnam War as a backdrop, well mounted, well acted (Frank Langella and Joseph Gordon-Levitt stand out), with good dialogue, few surprises and it is far from being a great film.\n………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………\nReview\n\nThe Chicago 7 trial recounts the trial carried out in that city in 1969 in which seven activists and leaders who had attended the Democratic Convention to demonstrate against the sending of troops to Vietnam were accused of conspiracy, a protest that led to violent incidents with the police.\n\nAs is usual in these films \"based on real events\", their introduction exposes an overwhelming amount of information, presenting the actors of the drama before the incidents who were leaders or leaders of various student, political and civil groups: Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), hippies from the Youth International Party (Yippies), Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam (The Mobe) and a chairman of the Black Panthers, among others.\n\nThen Aaron Sorkin (director and screenwriter) proceeds to a successful ellipsis that places us directly in the trial. The development is that of a typical courtroom drama and it is the flashbacks, sometimes in parallel montage with the testimonial statements, which reconstruct the events and their chronology. The language is not high-sounding and unexpected traits of humor appear during audiences, but sadly, as an American film it cannot be without some gimmicky climactic moment. Dissenting (sometimes deep) between the accused according to their group membership is also addressed.\n\nThere are only two situations of real and unexpected tension (one of them very hard) during a trial that was raised from the beginning as a sobering montage and where the usual racism is also manifested.\n\nDespite its length, neither the pace nor the interest wane, standing out the performances of Frank Langella as an imposing and at times irate judge and that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the solvent and fiscal content who follows instructions but does not lack conscience. .\n\nIn sum, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is the kind of \"fact-based\" and \"political denunciation\" movie that Oscars voters like but is far from being a great movie.\n………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………….",

            "content": "In 1968, different groups opposed to the Vietnam War met in a big protest in Chicago, where the Democratic National Convention was taking place - an event that announced the candidacy of Hubert H. Humphrey for the presidency. Things got out of hand, there was turmoil and someone had to pay for it. The government's decision was to accuse a select group of people of conspiracy in a trial that went down in the country's history. This historic event is the raw material for The 7 of Chicago, Aaron Sorkin's historical drama on Netflix, which takes advantage of its stellar cast in a powerful plot that extends beyond the walls of the courthouse.\nthe event started peacefully, but with the shock of the police, it ended up being marked by violence and revolt.\nThese two words permeate the entire narrative - conducted with a good portion of the didacticism already expected within Sorkin's work. The initial scenes, somewhat hasty in introducing all the characters, dictate a false impression that there may be the same dynamism seen in the film starring Jessica Chastain in 2018. However, this does not happen, being just an introductory glimpse of what the viewer would have to focus at all times to capture information based on historical facts.\nIn fact, there is something that can really mark a good script: the dialogues. In that case, Sorkin may even surpass the line of excellence. From this perspective, the films written by him are usually guided, precisely, by the words spoken. Soon, a paradox is created about the power of images, about dialogues being necessary only when the visual cannot speak, something expressed even by Alfred Hithcock.\nThe driving power of the speeches written by Sorkin is so much that it practically does not matter how dense and full of information the story is, because it is possible to follow it without even understanding it in a profound way. It seems to be part of the experience of watching a film written by him. The Social Network (by David Fincher, 2010), for example, no matter how much it is directed by one of the current directors with unquestionable competence and absolute mastery over images, maintains this Sorkinian aura, that none of that would happen with fewer words.",

Per Esquire, the scene is not even how it went down IRL either. I'm all for 'Hollywood endings', just less of the cheese please.\n\nThe rest of 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' is, though, very good. Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie) is the greatest performer, the role is mostly comedic - which he nails - but even in the more serious moments he is terrific. Jeremy Strong (Jerry) is notable alongside him, also. Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Frank Langella, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt merit props, too.\n\nI did enjoy how it portrays the (true) story, one that is very interesting no doubt.

            "content": "Going into a film so steeped in historical events, facts, and undoubtedly some speculation it's difficult to not want to feel both completely educated and entertained on and by the subject come the conclusion of the film. With the second directorial effort from A Few Good Men and The Social Network scribe Aaron Sorkin being based on the violent clash between police and antiwar protestors at the 1968 Democratic National Convention it's even more difficult-given the similar cultural landscape we presently find ourselves in-to not want to first and foremost pay attention to the precision of Sorkin's pen so as to not be swayed one way or another by the dramatization of it all. That said, it's also difficult to not want to abandon the real-life aspects altogether and instead simply escape to enjoy the piece for its expertly crafted dialogue exchanges and period-accurate set decorations with hopes that what is depicted on screen respects the institution of integrity enough that we trust what the film is telling us and what it's trying to convince us of are both genuine and honest. That the film takes the position it does will be an easier pill to swallow for a viewer who stands firmly on one side than the other which raises questions about how those on the wrong side of history now can't see themselves in those on the wrong side of history then, but while this idea might be an aside of Sorkin's it would seem his primary objective is to illustrate the strong foundations of our institutions, but also the myriad of ways in which they can be taken advantage of and the vitality of intent if one cannot find a complete, impartial view of the bigger picture; in essence, Sorkin seeks to create something as close to primary material as possible and in large part-especially for the first hour-you want to believe he has. If The Trial of the Chicago 7 hopes to make you feel any certain way though, it's that type of \"hurrah\" mentality that no matter how evil the bad guys are the good and the just will eventually overcome it. Unfortunately, this take couldn't feel more in contrast with today's world despite the similarities in the challenges our protagonists are up against and the current assault our democracy is facing. Despite the stride towards a more triumphant rather than the more accurately sobering tone in the third act though, Sorkin has pieced together an airtight screenplay with an overwhelmingly impressive cast that executes the material in a substantial fashion giving the project the feel of something genuinely valuable.\n\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

As well as those, the writing by director Aaron Sorkin was flawless and it very much enhanced each characters depth and aided an outstanding story. I really enjoyed this, I was gripped, it was intense but this was also a valuable history lesson about a very important time, not just in American politics, but World politics too. The ending was so powerful and concluded this film perfectly. I would without doubt recommend this film to anyone, it has to be seen, it's a great film. Please go treat yourself.\n\nQuote- 'This is the Academy Awards of protests and as far as I'm concerned it's an honour just to be nominated.' - Lee Weiner\n\nRating - 4.5/5",

There are two characters who are colored like The Muppet Show's Statler and Waldorf and even are given at one point their own balcony.

These included well-known names like Tom Hadyn (played by Eddie Redmayne) and Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen). The movie is very entertaining. I like the way the story is told, mixing courtroom drama and flashbacks that piece together the story of how these seven people ended up in jail together that night. The screenplay is very well written. Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne both are great; I did not expect such a strong performance from Cohen. But my favorite performance is by Frank Langella, who plays the utterly despicable judge who had clearly decided the outcome before the trial even began. He commands much of the attention in the courtroom scenes. There is one scene in which he exercises his own law over one of the defendants that is just stunning. You almost can't believe it is true, but it turns out it is. The film gets a big thumbs up from me. It is entertaining and feels very contemporary at the same time.",

I knew the basics about the 1968 convention and the riots before, but this movie inspired me to take a deep dive and research the actual events and people involved. I think the things that should've been included the most was the fact that Bobby Seale was bound & gagged for days... not minutes, like in the movie. Also, I really wish they included Rubin's nomination of a pig named Pigasus to be the next president, if only briefly and in passing.

            "content": "I’ve always been a fan of Aaron Sorkin’s writing, even if his first directorial effort didn’t wow me. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a decent film, but I still get the sense that Sorkin should stick to the writing and leave the directing to someone else. (More on that later.) This particular film is about a court trial that I had not heard about prior to watching the film, where a group of men are put on trial for instigating a riot in 1968. Any time a story like this is focused so heavily on a group of innocent men fighting against injustice, it’s hard not to get swept up into the emotion of it all. The level of mistreatment that these men endured is highly compelling, and there are many elements that you find yourself doubting simply because you don’t want to believe our judicial system could be that broken. But upon further research you’ll find that many of the facts are accurate and this was a horrible “kangaroo court” situation that made a mockery of justice. If nothing else, I think this film is important to show the flaws in our system, and to remind us of the mistakes in our past. My biggest problem with The Trial of the Chicago 7 was in the structure of the film. It seems like Sorkin simply can’t wait to get to the court proceedings so there’s very little build to the opening and we are dumped into the trial before we are even fully aware what the alleged crimes include. Later on things are fleshed out more, particularly with some flashbacks, but I always felt like the movie was missing a little something. Frankly, it feels like it would have been an easy fix, if it was all edited better. I’ll also say that Sorkin, as usual, can’t separate his own political leanings from his writing. I don’t think that was a detriment to this story, since it’s fairly obvious who was in the right and who was in the wrong in this situation, but he loves any chance to grandstand for the liberals and villainize the conservatives. That being said, I am a sucker for courtroom dramas, and I also loved how The Trial of the Chicago 7 embraced some of the ridiculousness of the situation and allowed for some laughter. It’s not the greatest Sorkin writing, but it’s still worth watching.",

The sheer audacious density of information can be overwhelming, but when Sorkin is able to get into his well-established rhythms, the actors feel like wonderful pieces in an orchestra playing to its peak. The real-life story of the activists has plenty of juicy drama and intriguing characters and intra-group conflicts breaking open, mostly between the divided poles of political leaders Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) and counter-culture prankster Abbie Hoffman (Cohen). Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul Mateen, HBO's Watchmen) could have gotten his own movie and suffers many of the worst indignities as a Black Panther grafted onto the case in order to make the rest of the indicted men seem scarier by association. The consistent interference by the trial judge (Frank Langella) is shocking. It's so transparently biased, racist, and unprofessional that I have to believe that many of these anecdotes actually happened because otherwise they seem so absurdly prejudicial that nobody would believe this happened. For a movie with such a sizeable cast of trial litigants, lawyers on both sides, friends and family, and maybe every Chicago police officer in the state, it's impressive that Sorkin is able to provide so many with great Sorkin moments, meaning those grandstanding speeches, cutting one-liners, and intensive cross-examination. Not everyone is on the same level of importance. Several of the Chicago 7 are more than bodies on screen, two of the guys serve as little more than a quip-peddling Greek chorus. You sense there's more being left out to fit into a crammed yet tidy narrative that plays to our demands for a satisfying character arcs, reconciliation, and a morally stirring final stand. As a director, Sorkin doesn't distinguish himself but he lets his meaty script and the performances of his actors get all the attention. The editing, like in Molly's Game, can be a bit jumpy but it's to serve the sheer size of information being downloaded during the 129 minutes. The political parallels for today are remarkable and a condemnation of our modern times. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an invigorating and, at points, exhausting film going experience that can feel like a retro, overstuffed special episode of The West Wing. It's everything you should expect and want in an Aaron Sorkin courtroom drama, so if you're already in that camp then this Netflix original will be preaching to the overly verbose choir.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

There's a lot of characters involved in the telling of this 1960's true story and a lot of quality actors to sink their teeth into Sorkin's writing. In this respect, the film works very well but where it flounders is in Sorkin's direction.

We are so inundated with information we can't figure out how to make sense of it, and there's a certain refreshing quality that comes with watching the past, its analog recorders, it's seeming transparency. But, of course, that's not what it felt like to be there. Sorkin paints the picture of the frustrations and Sisyphian struggle for these 7 men, their lawyers, Bobby Seale and the individuals willing to not only consider an alternative fashion of rule, but had the courage to get up and walk their talk. Of course, in 2020, the film feels all too topical. The reality is what it's always been, we are where we've always been. As in Abbie referring to the great Abe Lincoln, who would have been shunned and possibly attacked for a speech he made had he made it in that Chicago park in 1968. But today, we applaud and laud Lincoln's ideas and notions, as long as it does not effect us. Sound familiar? When theory is stripped bare and torn from the books and manuals and made plain by action, we have lives lead by ideals, which means they will butt heads with the opposition and idle forces. In this film, we have a small group of fighters versus the system, namely the government, its courts and its cops. What Sorkin does well here, is to present a narrative of facts, loaded with strong actors and enough emotion and cross-cutting edits to keep us surprised and stimulated. The acting across the board is stellar and kudos on casting. The script is poignant without being pedantic. And the filmmaking supports those 2 pillars. The film will invigorate the thoughtful, make the young feel seen and make the old feel remembered. It's a testament to our good fortune to live in a free country where we can make movements and make art. And while the man may want to hold us down, this film at least makes us feel democracy has the upper hand. Next up, a film that details Americans coming together to rise above their shortcomings and the manipulations of capitalism & modern society -- oh, right, we should do that first.",

Aaron Sorkin's narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well. Sorkin's screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure. Maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story. Inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues, never losing steam until the very end. It's also a lot funnier than I expected. Regarding the cast, Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, and Frank Langella are my standouts, but every actor delivers outstanding performances. Daniel Pemberton's score shines in an overall very well-produced film. The first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom, but it's so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyone's names and purposes. Assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move, especially for non-Americans. Nevertheless, this minor issue doesn't affect an otherwise flawless movie. Obviously, I strongly recommend it! Maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing, but don't read too much due to the usual spoilers.\"",

And if it was not for Aaron Sorkins fast moving script that keeps your attention glued with the subject such as police beatings. A person's constitutional rights. And racial prejudice. Also a movie that is relatable to what is going on now with the political stance. The cast ensemble is great. Every delivered with a powerful performance. Eddie Redmayne. Sasha Baron Cohen. Joseph Gordon Levitt. Mark Rylance. And so many others did a great job with there characters. The film does flash back to some brief events with the protesting that turned out brutal. Such as when protestors went charging up the hill towards the police. Or at a protesting event when a character witness another being beaten by the police. Aaron Sorkins sharp direction made this 2 hours and 10 mins drama went by quick with keeping you on the edge.

Sorkin knows how to keep your attention with simple scenes by having long monologues with unique camerawork and interesting framing. The performances here are great too especially Sacha Baren Cohen and Eddie Redmayne. I would say this is probably a career best for Redmayne and one of my favorite Cohen performances but his performance in Borat still has this film beat. The story is engaging and interesting which is weird because a lot of this is court room drama but I was invested for 95% of the time. The riot scenes are sprinkled throughout the film and those scenes are excellent. My issue with the film is its historical accuracy and certain dramatic moments. Like I said in the beginning, this feels like a Spielberg film and sometimes Spielberg tends to overdramatize events and there's a little bit of that here and ties into historical accuracy. They had to take some creative liberties here and there and I really wish they hadn't because this is a fascinating court case that will be looked back on for years to come.

Probably Best Picture 2020.  \nFor those too young to know, the first 20 minutes accurately expresses the vitality and energy of late 60s-early 70s Cultural Creatives.  I was there. \n\nSorkin began writing this in 2007.  In 2020, a terrific amount of writerly thought and creativity is on-screen.  No, not the best FABLE for 2020, that's The Island (2005) by Michael Bay and friends.\n\nI cried at the final scene of \"7.\"  It brought back all the promise and heartbreak of failures-shortcomings of cultural progressives in the era.  As filmed, the ending is more articulate and truthful than what actually happened.  ScreenRant.com runs downs what was actually said by who when.  The real facts remind me how inarticulate we were back then.  The movie is more articulate than we were ourselves back then.  \n\nProgressive Historian at UCI, Jon Weiner (JonWeiner.com) says the movie is inaccurate yet is truthful.  Thank you, Jon. \n\nIn the less favorable pro reviews here, I think what is missed is how much thought went into consciously MODULATING the actual personalities to permit greater contrast--and a greater sense of their unity--than was on display in real life.  This is why Abbie Hoffman is downplayed and other character changes.\n\nI want to congratulate Frank Langela and Mark Rylance for holding the movie down to the ground.  Frank does wonderful villainy here without over-doing it.  He truthfully portrays the \"out of control\" control-freak which characterized many officals of that era and today.  Mark's integrity and self-confidence balances the just-finding-out-who-I-am of all the the younger characters.  \n\nWonderful to see Michael Keaton playing a good guy after so many recent villain roles, a small crucial part.",

To all the millennials out there, this is history, this is STILL now and this is why you will never amount to anything more than Instagram likes. \n\nThe scene in Forrest Gump, when Abbie Hoffman asks him to assuage the crowd and someone ( cop ) unplugs the PA...this movie is the branch line.\n\nBrilliant performances to reinstall the woefully inept justice culture of 60's America.\n\nI hope, though vainly due to the inbred Hollywood Luvvies, that this wins awards...lots of awards.\n\nThank you Netflix, much as it pains me.",

When a peaceful demonstration at the 1968 DNC to end the Vietnam War turned into a violent clash with the police, 7 members were tried with conspiracy to attack the convention and the police. This movie is made for the award season. Very fast-paced with quick and witty dialogues, the movie made you keep paying attentions to the plot. They frequently alternated between the trial and the riot event. Sometimes there were real-footages of the riot, which added more to the realism of the movie. The cast was phenomenal with many familiar faces and all of them played their parts very well. \nThe event in the movie had relevant connections to the recent riots, making the experience more emotional and investing. With this, there were many scenes that were astonishing and outrageous. Creating things happened within the court that were uncomfortable to watch, although there could be some exaggeration. \nMy only minor issue is that the laws and politics were quite a bit confusing since the movie was fast. But that's probably just me. \nThe end of the movie was very satisfying. Overall, an expertly-made drama about one of the most notorious court-case in history. 9.5/10\n\nP/S: I did not know much about the real event. However, it was quite likely that it was loosely connected to the true story.",

Mank might surpass this, but I don't know. ‘Cause I've never watched a film that made me feel the amount of anger this one did. That judge... that f**king judge. Definitely give this a watch.
