Além de discutir assuntos que funcionaram muito bem quando trabalhados no contexto do filme, como vícios e desvios psicológicos (eu diria até freudianos). O timing de humor é simplesmente perfeito, me peguei rindo em vários momentos do filme, que de tão peculiares e despretensiosos, despertam o cômico. Em certos momentos até identifiquei um humor mais \"The Office\", com cenas desconfortáveis e constrangedoras, e que o filme faz questão de prolongar. A atmosfera de tensão e suspense também foi construída de forma exemplar, e o Plot Twist foi a cereja do bolo dessa grata surpresa. A direção do Evan Morgan é muito competente e de um bom nível técnico, e o Adam Brody desempenha bem seu papel (considero-o um bom ator, muitas vezes subestimado).",

I don't know if it's meant to be kid friendly or that the avoidance of curse words and sexual situations is part of the joke. I'm thinking it's part of the joke because some grizzly stuff is referred to. The way my stage persona Sugar never cussed, except when he did, to great effect. Or was the sweet old southernish man that started slow then described extreme sex in terms of an electromagnetic pulse. Actually I told that joke two ways. \nAnyway I may like this movie for the best reason of all, the humor reminds me of me. lol",

As such, this film has a good premise and an intriguing mystery, but it's somehow a little too timid in the way it unfolds, with a somewhat satisfying resolution. Adam Brody is playing the same character he played in Ready or Not only here he is the protagonist and not a supporting player. It's nice that he is not hired to play the nice guy anymore now that he is in his early 40s. When it comes to a film with a private eye as a protagonist, this was not as snappy as Veronica Mars, or as weird as Under The Silver Lake. It's a middle of the road mystery drama that's perfectly watchable in the comfort of your home. That is what I was expecting, and that's what I got, so no complaint here.",

Now the plot is not something we have not seen before, it has a similar set up to Donal Glovers Mystery team movie. Essentially a kid who is an amazing detective gains acclaim and a massive ego by being able to solve trivial \"mysteries\" like who stole the fundraiser money box at the school etc. Until something major happens and he losses his drive. He eventually becomes a pathetic adult who is trapped still solving the same trivial mysteries in his 30's until a real case gets dropped at his feet. This film is extremely funny, dark, and subversive all rolled up into one. Deadpan comedy is extremely hard to pull off, recent examples of good deadpan are the show Kidding staring Jim Carrey, but it is not common a movie pulls it off this good like in kid detective. The film sets up so many things and they ALL get paid off by the end which was refreshing. The lighting and camera work were excellent as well, which is shocking considering this is the directors first feature. The only reason it does not achieve my perfect 5/5 is because like I said the original set up is not something that is new or groundbreaking, but it is absolutely worth your time and one of the best noir style films to hit the cinema since Nice Guys.",

            "content": "The Kid Detective is a clever idea. Considering all the books and TV shows that have been made about young kids acting as detectives, it’s kind of fun to explore what might become of one of those kids when they grow up. In this case it’s a darkly comedic look at a man who never fully matured and failed to move on with his life, because of one particular mystery that he was never able to solve. I was able to connect quite well to the comedic tone of this film. It’s not traditional jokes, but a subtle undertone of dark comedy, and I could see some people watching the movie without even sensing that it is intended to be funny. It plays on a number of the tropes that most of us know from when we were growing up reading/watching things like the Hardy Boys, Scooby-Doo, etc. Perhaps I wouldn’t have as much fun with The Kid Detective if it weren’t for the fact that there was also a solid mystery woven into the whole thing. It would have been easy for them to just play with the concept and then leave it there with a by-the-numbers story. However, I was genuinely puzzled by this film, and had trouble putting the pieces together, even though they do a decent job of slowly revealing clues along the way. It’s a well-written whodunnit with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. I also appreciate that there are layers to the mystery, and we are never completely sure if this kid was ever a good detective at all. Since the flashbacks are stylized in a way to make them feel like his own personal recollection of how he remembers things, we are left wondering if he was as good as his memories made him out to be. Adam Brody did a solid job in the lead role, and he sold all the emotion of The Kid Detective. There are a number of scenes where there isn’t much going on, but you can sense the importance of those moments based on Brody’s expression (or lack thereof.) Sophie Nélisse is his co-star, but she doesn’t get quite enough to do in the film. I was hoping she would play a more active role in the investigation rather than just tagging along. It is vital that she not be around for some scenes, though, and her somewhat hands-off role as “the client” makes sense because this film is also emulating a classic film noir. All these genres meshed quite well, and made for a movie that I found surprisingly entertaining, and will definitely recommend to others.",

Not only does he now hate himself but now his town hates him too. Not fast-paced or obvious, it's a witty exploration of failure in 2020's America. Great performance by Adrian Brody as the clapped-out man-boy and a great cameo by Sarah Sutherland as his emo secretary.",

At a certain point the film jumps out of comedy and goes VERY VERY dark.  For some this jump will make them strongly dislike the film, but I think it works.   The cast is great, but the pacing is a little meandering in the middle.  3 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nThis quirky dramedy blends dark humor, mystery, sadness, intrigue, and profound insight. It's a detective story layered with a coming-of-age story and a surprise gut punch. The movie is written and directed by Evan Morgan. I'm now a fan and can't wait to see more from him. Its unconventional look at murder and humor reminded me of the movie Knives Out.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:\nTalk of a \"concubine.\"\nSome profanity\nYou see a man snort lines of cocaine.\nTalk of inappropriate behavior.\nYou see the naked backside of a man.\nYou see the front of a naked woman wearing a mask that covers her face.\nYou see a bloody suicide.\nMurder\nLots of alcohol.\n\nTHEMES:\nComing-of-age\nEarning respect\nHow it feels when no one takes you seriously.\nThe theme I thought was the most interesting and compelling was one voiced by Adam Brody's character. He said, \"It's difficult to accept who you are in your head and who you really are.\"\nBalance\nEveryone has secrets.\nIs the truth worth knowing?\n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nAdam Brody gives a stellar performance in this role.\nI loved Sophie Nelisse in The Book Thief and haven't seen her in anything else since. She was perfect in her role in this movie too.\nThe subtle humor is hilarious.\nAbe Applebaum's terrible receptionist was funny and should be fired.\nEven the side characters are interesting.\nSeveral surprising twists.\nThere is a fascinating juxtaposition of sweet, upbeat music and a terrible crime unfolding right before your eyes.\nThe ending gives you a chance to exhale and release your own feelings, along with the protagonist. It's powerful.\nThere is a film noir feel to it but with a more modern spin.\nEffective editing.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nIt starts off quickly, then starts to drag as you try to figure out how things are related.\nA lot of people mumble, making it difficult to know what's going on.\nThe last 20 minutes of the movie are jaw-dropping and take the movie in a direction you don't quite expect, leaving you utterly speechless.\n\nYou can watch my full review on my Movie Review Mom channel.",
