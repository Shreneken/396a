            "content": "It was alright. I've seen better work from Guy Ritchie and The Gentlemen felt like a watered-down, dusted-off version of Snatch. The aesthetic is also very similar to Snatch's but seemed to lose the little edge or bite it had back in 2000. Perhaps it is why I was expecting something more from The Gentlemen. The acting is alright, mostly all well-known actors, most of them have worked with Guy Ritchie in the past and are mostly known for gangster-inspired films. Although I felt unimpressed by McConaughey's performance, the stoic-suave-too-cool kind of guy was archetype-y and felt almost hollow. Could also be the writing itself.",

And this film is one of them. I think this is another film that was heed up to be bigger than what it should've been. It was definitely a boring experience that wasted my time.

No role felt like it would have been better with a different actor, even though that may be the case for some of them. Charlie Hunnam has good report with both Hugh Grant and Matthew McConaughey. The acting was done very well and very quick. As for the writing and directing, the quick jumping around through the story can be off-putting or odd on the first watch. However, after watching it a second time, I found it much easier to follow. The film is decent fun if you watch it once. However, I have found the more I watch it, the better it becomes.

I appreciate that the gangster style of the movie is not sickening and overbearing. It's that old school type of gangster that keeps you interested in the plot, trying to figure out where each character will end up in the end. I loved brainstorming ideas trying to figure out what the different plot twists and end might be, but they all failed at being correct. That's what made me love this movie.

For example, it's unusual to see Hugh Grant playing such tricky character but he made me believe that he almost acts the same in real life. So when you're watching this movie you can immerse yourself into a different world.\nThere are many jokes and funny moments in this movie. I can say that I laughed a lot!

This did get a bit confusing at parts mainly the beginning due to the onslaught of information that does start to make more sense as the film goes on but I was able to follow it all none the less. The characters are all very well written and very different to eachother which helps with keeping the audience interested and not getting bored of the movie and I appreciate the subtle humour in scenes to keep people entertained. That's not to say that the overall plot didn't keep me hooked, I can only compare the narration to that of a third person picture book. There is not much description of the scenes from the narration but that isn't required when you are spoon fed the satisfactory visuals and visual storytelling that the movie puts across. One thing I didn't enjoy too much was the overdramatisation of some people, specifically in the terms of the unrealistic way people communicate with eachother and the stereotypical British way of talking and language, this is only some though and the overall generalisation of cast is very well. Each actor does absolutely amazing in their role especially Charlie Hunnam as Raymond Smith, Colin Farrell as Coach and Hugh Grant as Fletcher, that's not to say that the rest of the cast do not do truly incredible in their part. The character of Fletcher is a true stand out and does perfectly as the narrator of this movie and the narration really put this movie together for me and I personally found his and Raymond's part of the story the most enjoying",

I mean, say what you want, but it would have been easy for him to coast doing the same kind of film every time. He didn't though, he branched out with the \"Sherlock Holmes\" films, \"King Arthur,\" and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Now, let's be honest some of those didn't work. Still though, it took stones to risk his career. *********************************************************************************************************************************This film is a return to form for Ritchie. There are some casting issues, but the story is as solid as \"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" \"Rock'N'Rolla,\" or \"Snatch.\" The only fault the film has is it's casting. We all know I'm talking about the \"alright, alright, alright\" \"Magic Mike\" man himself Matthew McConaughey. It's not that he's a bad actor, but just that he doesn't fit in the film. He stands out in every scene. One could only imagine that he was a studio choice. Apparently, he can't do a British accent. It really feels like they rewrote the film to accommodate this fact. On the flipside thought Colin Farrell delivers another low key genius performance. The rest of the cast is just as flawless. ******************************************************************************************************************************What really shines is the writing. Ritchie and Co. are in rare form. This is a screenplay tighter than a nun's box. Sorry, I just watched the film and the dialogue is so infectious it's rubbed off on me. The plot is just as well crafted. Guy Ritchie is also a genius when it comes to instant character development. He really is a writer that makes great story telling look effortless. I do acknowledge that he didn't write it alone, but how many rings did Jordan get before people realized that he carried everything he touched? Guy Ritchie is a great story teller, it's no secret, and this film is just another feather in his cap.",

The rest of the star-studded cast did really well too. The movie was fun and had a lot of twists, but it should've ended earlier than it did.

East end geezers don't really hang around pubs and markets anymore, do they? Everything is gentrified. People shop on Amamzon. Recording devices in everybody's pockets make crime difficult, and there is reference to this in the movie.

Hugh Grant is very adept as an East End low life journalist mixing with\nthe wrong crowd. Matthew McConaughey brings some Hollywood to the movie and faces off against Succession's Jeremy Strong. Apparently Strong is a very committed method actor which all of the other people on set (McConaughey included) find really annoying.

From start to finish, the action is relentless and brutal, and the acting is done phenomenally, especially from McConaughey, Hunnam, Farrell, and Grant, which absolutely carry this film. The story feels unique and fresh, and the comedy is gutbustingly hilarious, though it can be offensive to some at parts. Really the only complaint that I have is that sometimes the plot and story tends to become so absurd to the point where it either doesn't make sense or it is quite literally impossible for most to follow. However, after the first act of the film, the story picks up its pace to deliver an extremely entertaining and rewatchable crime film.",

Lots of twists and turns and the perspectives of the characters aren't actually clear until almost the very end.  I really don't know if anyone but Guy Ritchie could do this and I'm not a Guy Ritchie fan.  I found the second Holmes, Game of Shadows, to be just a little too oblique to know what was going on and too hackneyed, grey, \"chatty\", and bleak to care.\n\nMichelle Dockery is brilliantly out of typecast as a sexy, acerbic yet soft and feminine, love of the main character's life.  She is submissive to him while powerful, competent, and fearless at the same time and her role is critical to the plot.  She's definitely out of any \"Downton\" curse.\n\nMatthew McConaughey, who I've suffered through his \"too cool\" in other roles, plays this perfectly believable.\n\nColin Farrell and Hugh Grant are also completely out of any typecast.  Farrell brings so many new dimensions to this character that you really lose sight of who he is.  Same with Grant who is so gritty and slimy you can't imagine him in a rom-com.\n\nKudos to Ritchie for finding these characters in these actors and weaving them into the story\n\nI'm not sure why Rex Reed hates Ritchie so much, but it seems to be emotional.  In the film, there's an exchange between the main character, a truly productive man, and gossip rag editor, who creates nothing, rather leeches off others' creations with vile printer word.  The leech is rebuffed by the main character, rather than shown respect.  Throughout the film, the leech is portrayed as a pathetic weasel brilliantly woven into the script.  I, obviously, don't know this for sure, but frequently art imitates life and the subtext of this film may very well be an expression of Ritchie's perspective on Reed.  Yet it's critical to plot and not obvious until I read Reed's review of this film.\n\nI certainly see the similarities and I only just became aware of Reed's excessive derision of Ritchie as \"an incompetent director\" while Reed is really incapable of creating anything of substance and leeches off the products of others.  Would Reed be turning tricks on Highland if nobody made movies?  Maybe. \n\nThis movie is a mental challenge with plenty if action and dark humor as the story unfolds.  It's one of those classics worth a rewatch",

Not as good as some of his most revered works, The Gentlemen is more focused on the characters in the film. Everyone in the movie is well casted and all the performers deliver their characters amazingly. They all seem to be having fun with their respective characters, which is great to see. The intricate web of deceit and shady business is delicately woven as the film goes on. The story is narrated for the majority of the film in almost a meta way by Hugh Grant's character. We get to witness how things go about in the underworld of the UK, and how things go to crazy shit in a comedic way help give the film the energy that it delivers. All the loose ends connect in such a great way that you will feel satisfied as the movie approaches its climax. It's a scoundrel, foul mouthed, fun yet well placed film.

While it has an impressive cast and McConaughey star shines the brightest, the film was too loquacious for me. Most of the film is told from Hugh Grants POV, who plays an investigative journalist, who's blackmailing McConaughey via his right hand man, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam).

Speaking of a Tarantino flick, this movie also has some longer scenes, which is good. It's got it's humour, it's entertaining and it's also elevated by a great cast. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Henry Golding and Collin Farrel are all terrific! Overall,The Gentlemen is a very good crime/comedy and a future classic.

I like Ritchie's usual dark humor, though wish there was more of it & the characters were slightly more shallow - compared to his usual (if not in comparison to his 1st films).  Would have liked to see more depth, if not 'investment' in the main characters, as even McCaunaghy's more than suitable persona seemed to fall a bit flat overall.  Agree with some other reviewers that said Colin Farrell should have been an even more integral part in the film, with a more developed character... but I am also guessing that there may be a purpose behind that (which may just play out in an inevitable sequel).  Despite some lag, it was a classic example of what comprise a signature Ritchie film - which some people may not quite grasp the twists and turns from the very start or be repulsed by the use of language (classic Ritchie) and violence - which was actually quite tame comparatively.   As far as I'm concerned, it was as enjoyable as every other one of his films, but at this stage of the game for Ritchie - had hoped it would've felt a little more seasoned.  With the door left wide open for a sequel, I do hope that the characters might be a little more developed than they were presented here - maybe with more detailed backstories. Would like to feel more invested in them vs a mere glossing over (as they were here).  Love Charlie Hunnam, and the use of Hugh in this role was fantastic - a great scumbag, does he make!",

It feels denser than necessary without a doubt, but it's been so long since classics like Lock, Stock and Snatch that even snippets of the old greatness are more than welcome, especially in the film-starved year of 2020. For a fan, it's a great way to spend a couple hours and is plenty of fun. The film is so stuffed that it's hard to build up a particular affinity for any character, but McConaughey performs adequately and Grant just melts into his wonderfully weaselly role. It took me longer than I'd care to admit that I was very much confused by why Nick Kroll was in this movie, only to realize that it was actually the much more relevant Jeremy Strong. (3.5/5)",

I enjoyed it and even if it won't be counted as a classic like \"Snatch\" it surely does it's job.\n\n7.5 out of 10 paper weights.",

            "content": "Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), editor of the Daily Print tabloid, is snubbed by cannabis baron Michael 'Mickey' Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher (Hugh Grant), to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a Royal Duke with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled Bush) to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam), for \u00a320 M. Born in poverty in the US, Pearson won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building his criminal empire by violence. He now plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for $400 M so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery). Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye (Henry Golding ), an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach (Colin Farrell), orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"It may not win writer-director Guy Ritchie many new converts, but for those already attuned to the filmmaker's brash wavelength, The Gentlemen stands tall.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt rated the film a \"B-\" and found it to come up short when compared to Ritchie's previous crime films, stating, \"The Gentlemen is nothing if not a callback to the Locks of yesteryear, star-stacked and defibrillated with enough juice to jolt a gorilla out of cardiac arrest.\" Some reviews perceived the film as anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and sexist on account of its portrayals of characters that fit stereotypes. The Independent described it as \"an equal opportunity offender\" in its targeting of a multitude of minorities from Jews to East-Asians.\n\nWith \"The Gentlemen\" Guy Ritchie is back at what he does best to be honest (and with that I do mean the two great Sherlock Holmes films he has made as well). This is a classic Ritchie gangster movie with witty dialogue, a great ensemble cast, over the top violence and a storyline with plots within the plot. And you gotta love Colin Farrell\u00b4s Coach if anything. \"The Gentlemen\" is solid entertainment and if you liked \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", \"Snatch\" and \"RocknRolla\" you will like this one as well.",

There were rarely any dull moments since all the characters were so fun and colourful, especially when the movie begins to add in elements of blackmail, bribery, deceit, and violence. However, the movie stumbles a bit in its first act. Dialogue comes at you with rapid-fire speed, which can get overwhelming and requires an adjustment period. (But that's most Guy Ritchie crime movies.) You just feel like you're already behind and need to catch up. Once you're adjusted to the narrative style and the movie settles in, everything comes together in an awesome final act.\n\nOverall: Great\nRecommended for: Fans of Guy Ritchie films, fans of colourful performances with witty dialogue, or fans of saying Phuc hundreds of times until you get it right.

Coach (Played by Collin Farrell) was my favorite character in the whole movie, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam) was amazing, Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) was also amazing, the charisma of each character is the thing that really saved the long conversations or maybe the whole movie, to be honest, and without it, these conversations would've been boring as hell and the movie was gonna be dead.\n\nReally loved the production design that really suited the environment and the characters, also the custom designs were pretty cool and fancy exactly like they should be. \n\nNow for Mickey Pearson (Played by Matthew McConaughey ), I wish if we could have seen him more in the movie, felt like he didn't have much of a role or something, he was just the \"BOSS\" that has his guys to do everything for him and to be honest it makes sense he's the guy who built the highly profitable marijuana empire so of course, he's just gonna have his guys do everything for him, they even call him \"BOSS\" the whole movie, but I still wanted to see more of Mickey Pearson or to be specific, I wanted to see more of Matthew McConaughey. \n\nAlthough all the characters in the movie were \"BAD CHARACTERS\", we still really loved them that's a thing that I loved about the movie. \nFelt like there were some characters that weren't even important in the whole movie or they didn't have much impact in the story and one of them is: Dry Eye (Played by Henry Golding), although his acting was okay, his character was a waste of time.\n\nThe Gentlemen is a very funny and interesting movie, filled with a bit of action that you'll enjoy, really recommend this fun movie.\n\nMy rating is: 7.5/10",

That is where my compliments end. Henry Golding's character was written in such a racist manner. A lot of the dialogue was trying too hard to be deep and witty & ended up sounding corny. So many threads and characters are thrown at you quickly, but I eventually got it all straightened out by 60% through the movie. The overuse of f-bombs and the c-slur is an example of the laziness in this script. Jeremy Strong's acting was weak here. It ends by alluding to a sequel... a sequel?! No, baby, no.

            "content": "This movie is good. It is not great, but it is a solid film. It is about a drug kingpin that is trying to sell his business and all of the back-stabbing that goes along with it. It is interesting to watch, but sometimes it moves at a much slower pace than it should. There is some witty dialogue and the acting is great. There is a feeling of style over substance though which is a bit of a hinderance. There is some dark humor scattered throughout its runtime which livens it up from its oftentime very serious crime world. The movie is told mainly by Hugh Grant's character, Fletcher. He followed this crime story and wrote a screenplay about it and wants to use it as blackmail against the drug lords. He explains in ferevent detail what the story entails, so there is a lot of exposition in this story and a lot of cutting away from seeing the story to watching Fletcher explain what is happening. At the beginning it seemed like a fun little gimmick, but by the mid-way point of the movie it just got a bit annoying. It is kind of like how \"The Princess Bride\" is done but with less charm. Guy Ritchie is fairly known in the directing world for having very stylish movies, like the \"Sherlock Holmes\" movies. This is movie has all the style and slickness we have come to expect from Ritchie, but there is just a lack of connectivity between the story and the audience. However, this movie is fun and will keep you entertained with its several moving pieces. I do think it does a really good job of tying everything together at the end, and I thought its ending was fairly satisfying. The meta-appeal of it being a screenplay is a bit too meta for my taste for this type of movie, but it does add a bit of flare to it. This movie has a lot of vulgar language, and I think it would have benefited if it toned down the profanity a bit. I enjoyed this movie though, and I think it is worth a watch. Overall, I give this movie a 7.5/10.",

            "content": "A raunchy riot for a classy crime saga.\n\nGuy Ritchie sees himself in rare form for his latest crime comedy The Gentlemen (2020). I have to immediately mention that Ritchie's script writing is incredible. He writes an intricate crime narrative with multiple drug lords going at each other's industry, but he shocks you with twists and turns you will not see coming. Guy Ritchie takes his 1990's grit and edge and refines it with contemporary style, references, music, and language for The Gentlemen. I really enjoyed his abundance of English slang that only younger audience members would catch. The Gentlemen is Guy Ritchie going full British director unapologetically and I love that.\n\nHis attention to detail in his written setups is as impressive as James Herbert and Paul Machliss' slick editing that keeps The Gentlemen to a tight 113 minutes. Ritchie writes his heroes and villains as all realistically vile, racist, greedy, violent, selfish, and repulsive monsters in his unique voice. His direction has never been more thoughtful and refined as Ritchie does not waste a shot. Alan Stewart's cinematography is gorgeous with wide shots of sets ornately decorated by Sarah Whittle and styled by Gemma Jackson with a modern production design befitting a Tom Ford film.\n\nChristopher Benstead's score is subtle, then suddenly boisterous and matches The Gentlemen's mature tone. Michael Wilkensen's costumes look like he was dressing actors for a James Bond film. In fact, The Gentlemen is very much James Bond meets Snatch. Guy Ritchie's use of rock, rap, and random other genres is very refreshing to hear in a contemporary film. I'm so glad that Guy Ritchie did not tone down his charming, English style.\n\nThe Gentlemen features a magnificent cast of talented actors and actresses delivering riveting character actor performances. Matthew McConaughey is phenomenal in a unique turn as a methodical, careful drug lord called Mickey Pearson. Instead of the eternal stoner like in The Beach Bum or Dazed and Confused, McConaughey brings menace and leadership as the focal point of The Gentlemen. Charlie Hunnam is the standout of The Gentlemen as McConaughey's right hand man Raymond. He's a far cry from his usual bruiser hothead characters, instead Hunnam plays Raymond as a cautious sidekick with OCD and subtle observant expressions.\n\nHugh Grant has to be mentioned as the sleazy, self-serving reporter Fletcher as his everyman accent is hilarious. His narration is riveting because of how strange and particular Grant goes for in this unusual role that you'll just have to see for yourself. Eddie Marsan has a great supporting role as the insecure media man Big Dave. Chidi Ajufo is great as Charlie Hunnam's henchman Bunny.\n\nHenry Golding sheds his nice guy romantic leading persona as the vicious and violent crime lord Dry Eye. Michelle Dockery is lovely as McConaughey's wife Rosalind with a fun Cockney accent instead of her usual posh accent. Jeremy Strong is funny as Cannabis Kingpin Matthew with his quiet jabs and intense presence. Colin Farrell delivers a killer fighter role as Coach. He's hilarious and caring at once. Farrell is so exciting to see act in dramatic roles and funny in comedic roles. Everyone brought their best for Guy Ritchie and it shows.\n\nIn all, The Gentlemen is a crime film that will age well as it's so technical that you'll always be able to catch something new upon revisiting it.",

I get that he wanted to return to form without making yet another version of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which I liked, especially the former), but I'm quite not sure whether most of the choices he made here in order to render the film a refreshing feel worked together. Regardless, The Gentlemen is a good fun with enough clever touches to satisfy Ritchie's fans.\n\n(6.5/10)",

What stops this from being up there with the best of his work is the distinct lack of interesting, colourful and unusual characters (save Hugh Grant who steal's the spotlight with his role) which means that the aforementioned cast often goes to waste. \n\nNevertheless, it's still pretty fun; I just hope that if there's to be a sequel, Ritchie manages to find a way to infuse a bigger dose of that original flavour that packs more of a wallop.",

The film \ud83c\udf9e is a great throwback to his new old work such as but not limited to (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla, and Sherlock Holmes). The latter of which I could best describe as Gritty British Crime Dark Comedies as a very particular genre to jolly ole England \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f and Director Guy Richie. Do I even need to say all the performances are great, the moment I saw the cast list and what kind of movie \ud83c\udf7f this is, I knew everyone was going to be a tone of fun to watch. Especially Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, and Mathew McConaughey playing up caricatures and having so much fun in their roles. The few things holding it back though is some scenes do feel like they drag on for a while too long, and are not as funny as his previous films. Not to say there weren't any laugh out loud moments there were hilariously dark moments hence the blend of different genres and unlike Knives\ud83d\udd2aOut it has a much more likable charm to it, doesn't feel forced to add in any reference to the current political climate (thank GOD). Editing added funny visuals and transitions between scenes. Along with the cinematography adding visual flair to who the characters and the dynamic between them. Overall while not as his early work like Lock, Stock or Snatch its definitely the best of his more recent work and I hope it does well enough at the box office to allow him to do more projects like this and allow for more creative freedom and I give the movie \ud83c\udfa5 an 8.1/10.",

The dialogue is for the most part really corny and bad; I am not quite sure if it was intended that way (I think it was), but in many cases,  it isn't funny. To Ritchie's credit, when his brand of craziness works, it is really funny. The only saving grace for me is Hugh Grant's performance \u2013 he is hilarious as a paparazzi-type character who has his own objectives related to the marijuana business. Overall, I just never could get into it.

            "content": "SPOILERS FOLLOW, HERE FOLLOW SPOILERS:\n\nSo, I've warned you TWICE and don't want to hear any boo-boo-hooing from the malchicks and devotchkas about spilling the beans and sausages.  Proceed at your own risk, my Dear Readers, as Your Friend and Humble Narrator spins his yarn.   You'll notice I've appropriated some content from something else.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. That is intentional, I assure you, the reason for which shall be ultimately revealed to those few who finish this tale.\n\nThis is an excellent movie, with an asterisk.  The asterisk qualifies my feelings about it as you shall see.  Enough dancing; I'm making my move.\n\nThe writing sparkles with wit and nuance in this complex, multi-layered film that somehow feels like THE BIG SHORT, while being nothing like it in story at all.  You'll delight at the British, Irish, and Scottish slang that abounds here.  The clever witticisms and charming local color.  Breaking the fourth wall on a meta-level.  The extensive use of a narrator who weaves a story told as a film plot that delivers most of the exposition.  It all works. \n\nThe acting is first rate, as one would expect.  The filthy and slippery lead character and narrator Fletcher, captured beautifully by Hugh Grant, is an unctuous homosexual blackmailing curr.  The performance is a revelation.  Charlie Hunnam, whom I've never really noticed much before, is also excellent.  If possible, it's Colin Farrell who steals the show from the fine performance of Matthew McConaughey.  These characters swim in personality, each their own.  So, no problem there.\n\nThe story is problematic as it recycles LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, a fan favorite I find in every way inferior to SNATCH.  Although this film has elements of both, it leans well towards the former.  It's no secret I do not like drug content, which is very much the background here.  Nonetheless, still not the problem.\n\nThe problem is the borrowing and recycling herein.  I suspect there may be legal action in future.  Yes, Ritchie borrows heavily from his own work.  The trademark car crash.  Boxing and fighting.  The pub settings and Houses of Lords.  The Marijuana manufacturing.  Not my thing. Yet, still not the problem. \n\nThis film very obviously \"borrows\" from two things it shouldn't, unless there were arrangements made.  The first is Black Mirror 1:1, my least favorite episode, which grotesquely involves a blackmail plot involving unnatural acts between a man and a pig.  It's very unpleasant, and this film makes it funnier and less onerous by implying more and showing less.  But it's still a direct replay of the shocking 2011 production, if only in passing in one scene.  It's flagrant.  That's a problem.\n\nAlso problematic is the borrowing from SE7EN of the pound of flesh theme of the Sin of Greed scene.  Almost no variation at all.  Once again instantly identifiable and quite flagrant. \n\nFuture legal issues or no, I was very disappointed in these \"borrowings\".  They're essentially verbatim and so obvious that my wife, not a fan of such things, immediately identified both on her own, without help, on first viewing.\n\nYou'll recall the TWELVE MONKEYS lawsuit and theft of the conceptual design of the inquisition chair and inquiring eyeball machine Bruce Willis was subjected to.  The production approached the artist for licensing.  They were given a price, didn't pay it, and used the set piece anyway.  It cost them millions in a resounding negative verdict.  For stealing a set piece for a single scene.  This was more than that. \n\nThese things may not bother most, but they certainly bother me.  An entertaining film with an asterisk for some glaringly obvious problems.  ***. 5/*****.  74/84.",

            "content": "Midway upon the journey of a criminal life.\n\nNot always is going forward a necessary improvement. \nThis is proved by Guy Ritchie's latest movie, The Gentlemen, a brilliant coming back of the British director, after the detours from his original imprint and trade mark represented by Aladdin (2019), King Arthur (2017) and in a way also The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), as well as the diptych of Sherlock Holmes, to his origins, those that brought him success and a distinctive narrative and filmic style centered around the London criminal underworld.\nNobody really believes that the British criminal gangs medley so gracefully cruelty and greed with the irresistibly cool, debonair attitude that denote Guy Ritchie's characters, but it is honestly pleasant to find them again on the screen, it is a like meeting after a long time a distant relative, a bit dissolute but in the end loved and, to a certain extent, even secretly envied without admitting it.\n\nThe American Mickey Pearson, well played by Matthew McConaughey, crossed the Atlantic to study at Oxford but soon became a drug kingpin, aptly able to benefit from his contacts with the needy British aristocracy to build a commercial empire for the illegal production and distribution of marijuana on a national scale.\nMidway upon the journey of his criminal life and happily married to true cockney Rosalinde, he decides to transit to legality and offers to sell all his activities to Jewish entrepreneur Matthew, constantly body-guarded by former Mossad agents.\nThis decision sparks a far-reaching series of effects and subplots that bring onboard various secondary characters, amongst whom Colin Farrell steals the show, that are craftily kept together for the viewers by Fletcher, an investigative journalist working for a tabloid which chief editor holds a grudge against Pearson. Fletcher intends to monetise through blackmail the information he has collected, and those he has only guessed to fill the gaps of what he still doesn't know, and contacts Pearson's top man, Raymond, excellently played by a Charlie Hunnam much more at ease here than as King Arthur. Hugh Grant as Fletcher is in sterling form here, lending an unusual and idiosyncratic charm to a role that deviates, and we should say thankfully and eventually, from the expected characters he has built his successful career on.\n\nMixing his trademark brisk and sparkling dialogues, Tarantino-like yet unmistakably made in Ritchie, with a crafted and expected British-ness of costumes and settings and a pleasant, defining yet not intrusive soundtrack, The Gentlemen is, to put it simply, a very good movie that gives the viewers what is expected of Guy Ritchie, sprinkling cinephile quotes (Coppola's The Conversation, old film reels) and well-integrated self-quotes (Snatch's pigs and poster of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. amongst others) on an excellent camerawork servicing a tight narrative pace whose thread, mainly for Fletcher's catchy story-telling, is never lost during the film and until its, partially unexpected, ending. \n\nA step back,  but towards the quality if his directorial origins, for Guy Ritchie, The Gentlemen will not be remembered for its innovations but it is a solid, well-written, directed and acted, genre movie.\nNowadays, not too bad!",

This one, however, had the same grasp on my mind, but, disabled my ability to guess. Completely unique and absolutely enjoyable.

The narrator like, past explained style as it allowed present and future caused you to enjoy the characters as the movie grew.

This movie has such a stacked cast and I loved all of the performances. Some of the action scenes are very good and it feels so smooth. The score is surprisingly good and I really liked it.\n\nI really liked the script but it is inconsistent and the script is just such so fun.

I don't know, maybe The Man from U.N.C.L.E. wasn't the worst thing ever. Aladdin wasn't very Ritchie-y, though. And I'll shamefully admit I'm still waiting to see the apparent insanity that is Legend of the Sword. Anyway, Ritchie's back to his mobster movie roots with The Gentlemen, and oy oy, I'm chuffed to say it is as entertaining and stylish as it is faffingly British. Indeed, a jammy return to form for the bloke, biscuits and tea, and all that.\n\nThe Gentlemen follows Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Pearson, an American living a life of excess and splendor in the UK thanks to his enormously successful underground marijuana empire. Though ready to put up the mantle, a smarmy blackmailer and rival criminal plots pop up, threatening to ruin his retirement. While Mickey goes around town finalizing his business settlements, his right-hand man, Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) tails the conspiracies revolving around his boss' friends and enemies.\n\nWith all his coined Texan smoothness mixed with an imposing gangster presence, McConaughey's as great as ever as Mickey, and I especially dug Hunnam's surprisingly pleasant performance as his chivalrous, kindly goon, Raymond. The true lifeblood of the film, Hugh Grant also gets tons to do with an electrically eccentric performance hammed up to eleven, and Collin Farrell squeezes in a neat little supporting part in there as well.\n\nSadly, Michelle Dockery and Henry Golding get screwed by significantly weaker writing. Golding's character is particularly unpleasant with potentially racist undertones that carry through the rest of his sometimes fun, more often off-putting subplot. They're fairly minor roles in the scope of it all, though, and Dockery at least manages to own her role well enough.\n\nBut everything I've written greatly undersells the movie. A unique non-linear framing device unravels the film with sidebars and digressions ripe for Ritchie's flair and comedic pickings, and, as expected, the story explodes with personality at every turn. Do you like rapping, acrobatic martial artist YouTuber gangs? Fancy fancy dudes committing dapper crimes?  Are you just looking for a really good time overall? The Gentlemen's got you covered, baby.",

            "content": "Guy Richie has been a director that hasn't always blown me away in the past. I've been amused by his outings with Sherlock Holmes and quite enjoyed The Man from U.N.C.L.E., but I wasn't even all that impressed by his fan favourites, like Snatch. For myself, I see that's he's now on a nice little streak. I really enjoyed his live-action remake of Aladdin and I think The Gentlemen may be my favourite film he has ever done. Although it does get a little self-indulgent at times, here's why I believe The Gentlemen may impress you, even though you may need to have an acquired taste for it.\u00a0\n\nThe Gentlemen tells the story of Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a man who wishes to sell off his Marijuana empire in order to escape from the crimes he has committed. This leads to a lot of blackmailing and mistakes, which then leads to death and chaos. However, at its core, this film is about Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a man who is trying to make this story into a feature film. This element was probably my favourite portion, as it tied current events into past events, which made for an interesting experience. Sadly, that formula became a little self-indulgent by the final act.\n\nAs I mentioned, Guy Richie, who directed this film, has a very unique style. To get the negative out of the way first, without ruining anything for viewers, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that breaks the fourth wall in ways I haven't seen in a while. That particular scene left a bad taste in my mouth, but I enjoyed the rest of the movie too much to let that be a huge detractor. From his witty/snappy dialogue to his hilarious choices of the way certain characters speak, he has certainly not lost touch with the types of movies he likes to make. For myself, this one just happened to work for me, more than any of his previous original work.\n\nFrom Matthew McConaughey to Charlie Hunnam (who is fantastic in this role), Colin Ferrell to Henry Golding, and the rest of the endless talent, The Gentlemen is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the talent on-screen. I was actually worried throughout the first 20 to 30 minutes that it felt a little messy and that these actors wouldn't have many ways to shine, but I was wrong. This movie finds its footing by the end of the first act and never lets up. I was thoroughly impressed by the acting, screenplay, and overall editing throughout the film, that my complaints never ruined my enjoyment.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, The Gentlemen isn't a perfect movie and Guy Richie definitely pats himself on the back a little too often this time, but I would be lying if I didn't say I had an absolute blast. The dialogue came a mile-a-minute and it was either important to the story, clever for the sake of being clever, or simply hilarious, and I just ate that aspect up. The quick style of this movie won't be for everyone, but if you happen to enjoy that sort of thing, then you may just love this movie. I like that style when it's done well and it really worked for me here. The Gentlemen is a fun time and I recommend checking it out.",

Unfortunately, it is a weaker vehicle for carrying a tale to the viewer. It takes much greater control of the craft of film making to 'show' us the story and let us come to the conclusions that the storyteller is hoping to lead us to. \nThis is the only weakness in this movie, because of all of its moving parts, the director may have found it the only viable technique to encompass all of the tales convolutions. This tale has many intricate dimensions and so has a lot of ground to cover in its limited time, so its director may have found this way of taking the viewer along for the ride as his only recourse.\nOther than that, this movie's story is good and enjoyable. I found myself glued to it from the hook in the opening. The ensemble cast is superb and the acting is A list quality, so maybe I should have given it four stars, but won't due to the nature of the story being told - it is not a world shaker. It is about a minor league player on the world stage of life's underbelly - the noble savage, if you will. There are many like him in the world whose stock and trade have come of age, the weed industry. His one act of nobility is that his trade doesn't kill people - but his business does. He'll not garner any sympathies or respect from this writer.\nIt's a gangster movie, and a good one, but not an earth-shaking one, just another little man who would be king and does become so, in the end, through rather clever means and by staying one step ahead of the other big fish in this otherwise small English pond. I would recommend it's viewing if you enjoy Scorsese's content without the Scorsese style of 'showing' you the story rather than narrating it to you. \n\nThat's my rating, and I'm sticking to it.",

Great movie.....It feels Quentin Tarantinoisc , but in a totally unique way that may become a Gut Ritchie signature in the future if he pursues it further...and I hope he does!!! I think Guy Ritchie has proven himself as a top tier director with this movie.   I'm going to go back and watch that chase scene now.....and I need a good laugh so I'm going to watch Colin Farrell's and Eddie Marsan's pig scene!  I find myself doing this often!",

            "content": "Guy Ritchie's career has had its ups and downs, and while The Gentlemen might not be his greatest film, it's certainly the best he's done in a while. It's a return to the gangster black comedy that made him famous in the first place, and he relishes in the chance to do it all again. Full of comically over the top dialogue, witty verbal exchanges, bursts of violence and foul-mouthed characters in a variety of attire, its much like a Tarantino film, only not as long-winded. The plot sounds surprisingly complex, but Ritchie keeps things well paced, and as such you are never overwhelmed by the information presented, so its surprisingly easy to digest. It does often tread on ground that Ritchie has covered before, but what keeps you invested are the characters and their banter. Colin Farrell is hilarious as always, Hugh Grant is delightfully slimy, Matthew McConaughey is a lot of fun as the top dog, trying his best to sound convincing with the British wordplay and mostly succeeding. As some have remarked, those who aren't already Ritchie fans will likely be put off by The Gentlemen, whether by its vulgarity and brashness or its offbeat nature, but for his sizeable fanbase, it's another riotous good time that combines savage comedy with even more savage drama.",

I like how you can see the maturity in Richies writing as we still get all the profanity we come to expect, but its tailored now in a more impactful way rather than just saying a swear word for the sake of it.\n\nThe casting is faultless, Hugh Grant like you have never seen him before and deserves some type of award for this movie. Hunman is pretty standard to his normal performances but fills the role perfectly. McConaughey retains his usual swagger but is again written perfectly for the role. The unsung hero of the movie is Colin Farrell who only shows up in the final third but completely steals the scenes he is in.\n\nThis is a grown ups movie on the british drug/gangster scene and its highly entertaining with plenty of twists and turns along the way.",

It's not groundbreaking and doesn't aim any awards. It's a movie designed to be fun for two hours.\n\nBut then comes the storytelling. It's very Guy Ritchiesque but it has a twist.

With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.\"",

He's looking to retire and sell his lucrative marijuana empire, but when everybody surrounding him has their own elaborate scheme, this isn't going to be easy.  Now I have always held Guy Ritchie in high regard even though it has been over a full decade since he directed a movie that I liked more than I didn't.  I adore Snatch to the point that I consider it to be in my top 10 movies of all time, so I feel obligated to always give him the benefit of the doubt.  I am very pleased to report that this is the movie I've been wanting from him for years and years.  Now while Matthew McConaughey may be front and center with top billing, I wouldn't call him the star of this.  He is well and good in this, don't get me wrong, but Hugh Grant steals the show in this as this charismatic and salacious private investigator.  He is so cheeky and having fun with the part that whenever he is on screen, you can't wait to hear what he is going to say next.  Everybody in this gives quality performances.  Sure, they're all given that macho tough-guy cockney dialogue which we have come to expect from a Guy Ritchie gangster flick, but everybody is committed to the characters and knows how to land a joke.  In fact, the characters are so well rounded and rich that I feel like it makes up for some of the shortcomings in the story.  The movie utilizes the unreliable narrator technique, usually to comedic effect, but it does sometimes make you work to keep up with various story points.  The forward motion of the plot does get muddled at a number of points, but the dialogue is so well written that I was able to forgive it and look past it.  I don't know if the expectation of not having loved a Guy Ritchie movie in ten years had anything to do with it, but I had a great time with this from start to finish.  It moves fast with well-timed jokes, and nobody phones it in, so there isn't really a weak link.  I would happily watch this again, and 2020 is already shaping up to be one of the strongest starts of the year we've gotten in cinema in quite a long time.  I give The Gentlemen an enthusiastic recommendation.",

Bouncing back and forth between the super-serious world of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s drug dealing, and the goofy story-telling of Hugh Grant was odd. I wasn\u2019t even chuckling all that much in any of the opening scenes, despite amazing performances from all the cast. However, there was a point where the movie turned a corner and I let out my first audible laugh. Somewhere along the way I found the humor in the serious stuff, and I was totally on board with the blend of styles, and the story that continuously bounced around in time. Once the floodgates were open, I was laughing a ton at all the crazy antics. It\u2019s been a long time since I last watched a Guy Ritchie film, so I forgot how he structures his stories, and how he writes comedy. As with most of Ritchie\u2019s early films, the profanity flies fast and loose in The Gentlemen. I can\u2019t say I enjoyed how freely they threw around the four-letter words, but I was desensitized to it after a short time. The film doesn\u2019t quite flow as smoothly as I\u2019d like either, because Ritchie wants to constantly play with non-linear story-telling. There are moments where he will leave out a detail in a scene and, even though we could probably fill in the gap ourselves, he feels the need to bounce back and show it. Unless you\u2019re going to shock the audience with a surprise reveal, this kind of editing is style over substance. However, I loved the fact that most of the movie is told in the format of a movie pitch, and even has mistakes because Hugh Grant\u2019s character doesn\u2019t know all the details. There were so many fun moments in The Gentlemen, and it had laughs to spare. While it pales in comparison to Snatch, it is still an enjoyable time at the movies.",

My wife wanted to see Harley Quinn, but, since it was my turn to pick, we saw this one instead. The film is presented in typical Guy Ritchie style, very interrogative, just barely but not quite breaking the 4th wall. I'm pretty sure Matthew M. has made a career of playing characters like this: a not--quite-legit guy operating outside the law and locking horns with other not-quite-legit guys. Lots of colorful characters pop up as the film progresses. I'm pretty sure Hugh Grant's character is gay--not sure, but I think so. Collin Farrell's eyebrows, and his hideous track suit, ought to have been given a screen credit of their own. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this slick little crime thriller. Some scenes, like the one in the crackhead's apartment, go on for way to long, and, if I'm counting correctly, the film had not one, not two, but three endings before it finally did end.",

And I didn't think it felt trite or anything, it had a strong identity to it. It felt, to me at least, that it was able to draw very intentionally from a lot of archetypes of British action classics without feeling a cheap copycat. It\u2019s odd to me that a movie like Knives Out, which follows much of the same conventions, is praised for drawing from obvious influences while subverting expectations, but this is panned for it. Maybe it\u2019s just because I went in with low expectations but the writing felt very sharp and intelligent. It was a lot of fun and definitely above average.",

Most of the time when i go to the cinema, yes i am excited of course but i also thinking, \"I hope this isn't awful\". With Ritchie, i have no such fear as i know what i will be getting - a lot of fast talk, alot of accents and probably something illegal.\nThis film doesn't disappoint, Charlie Hunnam in particular was perfect casting. Its full of fun, laughs, action and plot!",

            "content": "Wonderful time watching this one.  It is easy to see why Guy Ritchie doesn't churn them out too often.  His style is unique and brilliantly thought out.  There were several complaints by moviegoers about this movie but honestly I had a great time keeping up and keeping track of the antics, twists and turns.  But to be fair I am a big Guy Ritchie Fan.  \n\nMany people want to see Snatch, Lock/Stock and Sherlock Holmes redone over and over but each of his films are in many ways distinctly their own.  In fact, SyFy has had King Arthur on high rotation and I have watched it a few times this past month. I liked it when I saw it in the theater years ago and I liked it even more now because I was able to pick up nuances that are all Ritchie.  \n\nIn The Gentlemen, YES there is the one over used \"C\" word.  YES it can be tricky to keep up... But that is just it.. Keep up!  \"There is truly only one rule in this jungle. When the lion's hungry... He eats.\"  The actors literally eat up each and every scene.  Even the scene where many viewers complained were too slow or too confusing. It just takes us coming out of our comfort zone to pay attention to what is going on, the back drops, the colors, the clothing, the slickness, the messiness the perfectness of it all to easily find yourself enjoying what is going on.\n\nMathew McConaughey is like a large Burmese Python.  Slowly moving through just about every scene he is in.  Don't be fooled. He is the sun the entire cast orbits around.  It is because we are not sure when or how he might strike and that keeps our eyes on him.  People complain about the Lincoln Car ads and maybe they are cheesy but heck this guy got arrested in his 20's for playing the bongo drums naked while high.  Was probably considered the least likely of all actors to process through a career but he has come a long way and I can appreciate him for that.\n\nCharlie Hunnam is nattily dressed gold and McConaughey's right hand man who maybe doesn't always get it right but he cleans up after himself so he NEVER gets it wrong. Maybe his is Ritchie's good luck charm the way Jude Law was in a Holmes and King Arthur or maybe he is being paid back for King Arthur's poor showing but I loved not see him as Jax Teller from SoA.  I wish he did more movie work.  I think he is under appreciated for what he could do.\n\nColin Farrell is brilliant as a rehabilitator of young, strong lost souls and after so many bad movies it was wonderful to see him used in such a way to remind us of the fact that he is a solid actor and funny to boot.  \n\nHenry Golding is (as always) gorgeous and seemingly a bit neurotic and too big for his britches but he is an antagonist and unfortunately (he doesn't catch the clue) a young male chimp who swings out a bit too far on a vine with no way to grad another for safety.\n\nMichelle Dockery is making the most of her post Downton Abbey fame and while she is not seen overly much throughout the movie Ritchie has given her character heft and importance and one doesn't mess with this lioness.\n\nAs for Hugh Grant.  Yes his character is outsized and YES it is quite a turn for him to be so un Hugh Grant like but he is the one wheeze in this movie that I would have liked to have seen less of.  Maybe it was his annoying nasally whine or that he was on screen way too long but maybe less could have been more.  I am not sure though.  If less would have been more.\n\nJeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan positively drip with muck and slickness.  I have loved Marsan for all his work on Ray Donovan and know he is a versatile actor.  Jeremey Strong has been in so many movies I have seen and never paid attention to him.  I clearly did here and loved his role.\n\nThis is truly an ensemble cast wonderfully woven together to tell a story that may seem hard to understand but if you can get your frame of mind to understand that it is a Guy Ritchie movie and he spins a yarn like no one else you will have a solid and absolutely fun ride with these gentlemen.

I also found myself appreciating the sound engineering, which isnt something that usually pops into my mind during a film. I think it was expertly written, well acted, and very well executed. Matthew Mconaughey, Michelle Dockery, and Charlie Hunnam put on an excellent performance. My sole qualm is that I found the screenplay and general plot unfolding to be slightly overdone. I think the change in timeline was necessary for the films full effect, but it seemed like it tried too hard to go back and forth and narrate and add asides, that it just became a little distracting. All in all, great performance, unique story, and an interesting perspective on manhood, business, the measure of success, and plain old style.",

Warning: this film is very Richie, and so there are lots of very British monologues and narration, so you might not like if that's not your thing. There are some great call backs to other Richie work, one chaotic chase scene in particular that gave me strong Rocknrolla vibes and Richie's soundtrack doesn't disappoint.

I also noticed the cast matured in age & mellowed: The same way a college student keg stands their alcohol compared to the way an adult sips a tumbler of something aged to perfection. I liked the way the shots were framed and the subtle touches. For instance, in one scene a main character tells some kids to \"sit\". He repeats it with the hand signal you give to a dog. In the background of the kids is a framed picture of a dog. It made me smile. There's more of this through out the movie. I wanted this to be a 5 star movie for me, but the slow pace held it back. I think if they make this into a series of movies with these characters, I may come to appreciate more as an introduction to this world. But for now, it's a respectable 4 stars.",

Extremely pretentious, the only things that work in this movie are the cast (not all of them) and the humor (not all of it), and none of that is enough to overcome the poorly conceived story structure in this lazy throwaway gangster script. I couldn't stand Hugh Grant in this movie his overacting in this just did not work for and he unfortunately is our unreliable narrator, he made it a painful movie to sit through but other other actors in the cast are excellent like Henry Golding, he's playing a very over the top gangster but we have so much fun watching. Eddie Marsden is also a blast in this movie. The Gentleman unfortunately is not one of Guy Ritchies best (although it is extremely well made), hopefully his next gangster film (we know he's never going to stop making these) is a lot better. 5.5/10",

            "content": "\"The American Lion in the English Jungle\"\n\n\tGuy Ritchie returns to both the writing and directing chair to craft an exciting action-filled comedy that only he and he alone could create. \"The Gentlemen\" stars a wide array of talent that perfectly bring Ritchie's patented expressive dialogue to life with every word they utter. The excitement in this film is not solely found in the action and gunshots that were heavily marketed but is instead felt within the elaborate narrative that keeps at a steady pace, along with the eccentric characters that help shepherd it along. Ritchie's style bleeds throughout this film's core from the very opening title credits, to the final cut to black; all of his standard trademarks are here which some may find tiresome, while others will find great enjoyment out of. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that with Ritchie in the driver's seat \"The Gentlemen\" is an immensely entertaining film that will keep audiences engaged in its wonderful world of formalized chaos.\n\t\"The Gentlemen\" centers around the suave Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a kingpin that reigns over his established marijuana empire as he navigates throughout London attempting to remain on top, despite the many adversarial forces he faces along the way (But it is far more complex than that). A private investigator known only as Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is hired by Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), an editor for the Daily Print tabloid with the strict assignment of investigating Pearson's personal ties to a royal named Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). During the course of his investigation, Fletcher uncovers several secrets shrouded in mystery and deception. It is realized, that Pearson is fully intent on selling his business to the American billionaire,  Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for a grand sum of $400 million. However, at the exact same time, a young Chinese crime boss named, Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is looking to relieve Pearson of the stress by outright buying the entire establishment. When Pearson refuses, he and his wife Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery) along with his right-hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) are thrust into a world of chaos where they are the primary targets everyone is aimed at. Having said that, it should be noted that the first two-thirds of the film are framed within a late-night conversation Fletcher invites Raymond to, with regards to his findings. Fletcher fully intends on selling his discoveries to Raymond in exchange for \u00a320 million or he will go to print, a simple blackmail technique.\n\tRitchie provides an exhilarating screenplay that keeps audiences glued to their seats guessing where it will go next and just when you think you've figured it out, the film takes a complete detour of absurdity that most would fail in their attempts  The film rarely stops to take a break which on paper may seem like a real flaw; but for \"The Gentlemen\" it is not. The narrative is told by the character of Fletcher and it feels extremely meta, so much so that a poster of one of Ritchie's previous projects can be spotted for keen eyes. This type of narrative structure is a technique that some may find distracting and unfocused, but I personally find it to be brilliant. After the beautiful opening credits, we are instantly thrown into a shocking moment that immediately grabs your attention like a salacious headline; it is hard to forget. With this inciting moment now lodged in our brains, the audience becomes hyper-focused as they watch in awe eagerly waiting for that fatal moment to come back; and when it finally does, it is just as shocking as it was when we first witnessed it. Although this is a method used by many writers and directors, Ritchie pulls it off in a way that does not entirely spoil the film from the offset. With the film's events unfolding through Fletcher's recounting of the situations, as an actual written screenplay titled, \"Bush\" you cannot help but be fully captivated. The constant callbacks to past incidents and shifts of perspective all add to create a story that is one of the most entertaining ones of the year.\n\t\"The Gentlemen\" as I expressed earlier, is a film constructed by an auteur that relishes in a flashy, yet extravagant style that only he could design. From a very entry-level observation, the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the elaborate and debonair outfits everyone on the cast, dons. Regardless of whether it is a fresh tapered suit, a loose-fitting jacket, or a bold tracksuit, every character showcased on-screen displays a level of sophistication only Guy Ritchie could pull off. Every shoe, every top, every pair of glasses; every single article of clothing appears to have been hand-picked as a means of painting each individual cast member as a figure you will not soon forget. Surprisingly, this quality is not exclusive to only the main cast as many of the extras also have a unique visual flavor that brings more life into every moment. When the film travels from scene to scene, the characters look fantastic, but so is the dialogue they are speaking. Ritchie's use of language is rather impressive as none of his characters are presented as shallow one-trick ponies. Every line of dialogue is pointed with a purpose that perfectly sets the stakes for every scene as all of the actors and actresses are constantly vying to dominate the verbal battles they find themselves in. With metaphors and jokes littered all throughout, it is hard to not find all of the English accents just a bit endearing. Unfortunately, on the flip side, because of how animated the characters and their words can be at times, they will occasionally slip into the territory of a cartoonish caricature of themselves. It is not distinctively a fault of the film that ruins it by any means, but it can be a bit overwhelming from time to time (A sentiment that is true for the entirety of the film).\n\t\"The Gentlemen\" is a blast of a film that explodes with character and features a fabulous cast that all bring their best. From the costumes and sets to the characters and their dialogue, Ritchie's fingerprints are all over this film and it appears as though he is playing in a wheelhouse where he feels the most comfortable. Now of course, if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's films or his overabundant style, then \"The Gentlemen\" may not be your cup of tea. However, the story and visual flair used to present it, flows throughout every frame and is certainly something that will entertain from beginning to end. Truly the first must-watch of 2020.\n\nFinal Verdict - B-",

The trailers looked entertaining, this film is populated with a terrific cast, and after seeing the film, I left satisfied with what I saw.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is relentless in this movie and the best I have seen him in a long time. His character was awesome, smooth, and just flat out likable. Every performance in this movie was terrific and totally fit the tone that this movie was going for. There were some very funny sequences and a lot of fun to be had throughout most of the run-time. That being said, there isn't a lot of action like some critics are saying. Like there is action in the movie, but it's not \"action packed\". It was a fun time to be had with a pretty good story once everything comes together. Some of the side characters I thought were going to get annoying at first but they quickly became important to the story and likable. Also, the opening title sequence was honestly fun to look at and the music choice enhanced the scene greatly. For a January that's been a mixed bag for movies, it was pleasant to sit through a movie like this and Bad Boys 3. However I do have some problems with the film.\n\nNow I mentioned that there is a good story in this film and that's totally true, but the way its told was rather confusing at first. Even though the story comes through in the end, it took awhile for me to understand the way this film was telling its story. It began like it was a part of a movie script, but the events were also happening. Also, as good as some acting was for these characters, it doesn't change the fact that most of them were underwritten. Also, one of the villains was very annoying and I didn't really buy him as a villain. \n\nThis movie was a fun time at the movies and a perfectly enjoyable flick especially considering the time in which it came out in being January. Nothing game changing, but Guy Ritchie is definitely in his comfort zone when working on this genre. Hopefully he never does anything like Aladdin again...jokes aside, I'm going to give The Gentlemen, a B",

As someone who's clung so unabashedly to the notion that his \"Sherlock Holmes\" films are the best things he's ever done, I was wary of this return to the early days for Ritchie. I don't particularly dislike movies like \"Lock, Stock,\" \"Snatch\" or \"RocknRolla.\" I just find them a bit too showy and brash for my tastes. However, it seems the skills accrued via those jaunts through studio-dom have perhaps melded with the indie sensibilities that were already so present within the man. And the movie's all better for it. Yes, \"The Gentlemen\" is still undeniably Ritchie, but with just the right amount of focus, tact and accessibility to make even the most fervent of Ritchie-deniers leave the theater feeling satisfied. As shocked as I am to say this, I have to admit - I honestly think this is my favorite of the \"proper\" Guy Ritchie gangster flicks.",

I loved this movie, it's been one of the best movies so far this year, and overall will possibly make my top 10 or 15 of 2020. Why? Because this movie is engaging, it drives a fast pace story that is changing and taking new turns as each scene begins. There are some interesting and creative techniques used in this movie that don't belong in a \"British Mafia Drama,\" such as that surprising gang music video. This movie surprised me, and I hope it will surprise you. As a young aspiring filmmaker myself, with a few gangster features under my belt, this film gave me callbacks to the drive, ambition, vision and thrill I had when I wrote my own mafia trilogy. I went into this movie expecting it to be bloody decent, because apparently not too many critics appreciated it. It blew me away, and I was very pleased. I don't disagree with professional critics that much, there's only a handful of movies that have been the case. \"The Gentlemen\" is a gritty Guy Ritchie movie, and deserves more appreciation than what some are giving it. Not the best gangster flic out there, but it sure is a damn good one.",

            "content": "\"You really can't unsee it once you've seen it.\" \n\nGuy Ritchie returns to his gangster roots in the underbelly of jolly good England. It's crazy to think that this is the same guy who brought us last years \u2018Aladdin.' But this time Ritchie isn't on a leash.\n\nI honestly didn't expect to enjoy \u2018The Gentleman' as much as I did. A little muddle and sometimes confusing to follow, but the movie has a certain sharpness to it that kept me interested throughout. It's more in vein with \u2018Lock Shock' and \u2018Snatch'. Ritchie has made a successful career being influenced by the work of Quentin Tarantino, hence his given title \"British Tarantino\". \n\nThe cast are all having an absolute blast with the material and I can tell everyone wants to be there. \n\nHugh Grant is my personal favorite out of the cast and it's great to see his enthusiasm in acting again. He plays Fletcher, a gay detective who documents the events in the story into a screenplay he's writing, so in a way it's told from his perspective. While debatable if everything in the movie was made up or not, cause \"every movie needs a bit of action\". The thing I love about Grants performance is that he isn't playing \"typical Hugh Grant\", but an actual character. Although I thought the running gag of him being openly gay and constantly makes flirty hints towards other male characters got old and awkward after awhile. A joke that out stay's it's welcome...kinda like Fletcher.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Charlie Hunnam as an actor, as I usually find him bland in everything I've seen him so far. However I thought Hunnam delivered a solid performance in this movie and might be his best. He plays Ray, Mickey's (McConaughey) right hand man who is professional when it comes to business despite the countless idiots in his path. Imagine Russell Bufalino from \u2018The Irishman', but more physical and incredibly British. His comedic timing was pretty good as well that maybe if you give him the right material and character, he's a better actor than I thought.\n\nColin Farrell was terrific as Coach and my second favorite out of the cast. He's ridiculously cool and shows who's boss, but also display's some comedic chops. Matthew McConaughey was chilled as Mickey, who is the weed Lord of England that likes things in green, which is money and marijuana. Out of all the colorful characters in the movie, I thought Mickey was the least interesting if I have to be honest. Either because of McConaughey's chilled nature or the less exciting material given to his character. \n\nThe style and overall tone of the movie made the whole experience so fun to watch. Everything about the movie is quick. The dialogue is snappy and there's plenty of clever banter between characters. It's incredibly clear that Guy Richie loves cinema whenever he's not held back like some of his previous projects and gets to freely express his passion behind the craft. \n\nThe humor and jokes ain't for the faint of heart, but luckily I'm not that soft. Some of jokes didn't quite land the mark and often times left me puzzled in terms of waiting for the punchline. \n\nOverall rating: A disjointed, but entertaining movie. Misleading title though. There's plenty of man, but not so much on gentle.",

            "content": "'The Gentlemen' (2020)\nGuy Ritchie returns to the crime genre and what a solid return I must say. 'The Gentlemen' is a witty and fun ride, packed to the brim with great dialogue and great action. Each of the cast is mostly great in the film, especially Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Matthew McConaughey. It's nice to finally see McConaughey in a good movie again after somewhat of a lull in his career in my opinion. Collin Farrell is great of course, although definitely seems to have less of a screen time than the prior three I had mentioned. I should also say that this is a very fast-paced film for the most part. It's one you certainly can't doze or space off during otherwise you may end up completely lost. The cinematography and screenplay overall is good, although the best aspect I believe is the script, extremely well-written, rich, smart, and witty dialogue throughout. If I were to pinpoint any criticisms, I suppose some of it would come down to the pacing as I mentioned before. Usually it's good, however it seems as though you either hit a slight lull here and there, or rather it's just bursting from scene to scene. The editing is also a peculiar case, in that it's normally good however will get very eccentric from time to time. Some of the acting was a bit iffy for me at times, mainly from Henry Golding, Jeremy Strong, and maybe a few lesser supporting characters, although at this point I think I'm nitpicking... 'The Gentlemen' is overall a fun movie and nice return-to-form for Guy Ritchie, and just a solid crime/action in general. I'd check it out if you haven't already.\n\nMy Rating - 7/10",

It's a funny and suave take on the British criminal underground scene with a pert editing style that keeps the pace upbeat and moving. Unlike many of his other films, however, this one starts off with a lot of exposition, but once it finds its footing it does not disappoint. The actors all seem to be having a blast and the ending wraps everything up so neatly that it's hard to find fault with the slower beginning. It's great to see Guy Richie back doing the modern gangster films he does best.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like The Godfather by way of Baby Driver, but without the musical choreography.\n\nSetting: Crime\nPlot: Blackmail\nTone: Action Comedy",

The Gentlemen is a closer return to form than 2008's RocknRolla, but it's still a long way off from early Ritchie. The recognizable elements are there, from the convoluted story with twists and turns, the non-linear storytelling lapping and overlapping itself, the comical brushes with sudden violence, the colorful array of criminal characters, and a sense of style that seems all over the place. We follow Matthew McConaughey as a marijuana titan looking to get out of the business, though there are threats old, new, and \"just business\" that are trying to take his empire from him before his exit. The biggest problem with The Gentlemen is how clever it feels like it needs to be and how few characters there are to find interesting. Snatch, by contrast, forever contrast, was practically a Dick Tracy rogues gallery of all its memorable and unpredictable characters. These feel pretty rote, even our heroes, and the minority characters get even shorter shrift. The plot is also more complicated than it needs to be with an extended meta-textual layer of a lecherous Hugh Grant tabloid journalist pitching the story like it was a movie (irony: it is a movie!). It took maybe 45 minutes before I felt like the story was finally picking up momentum and stakes, and by the end, it felt like Ritchie was just extending his story with another twist and wrap-up, and then another twist and wrap-up, like the outer edges of the movie cannot be contained and somehow it's still even going. It's like Ritchie doesn't know when to walk away from his own party. Because of these things the pacing is wonky and there are more than a few tedious stretches. Colin Farrell has some amusing moments but should have been the main character as a boxing trainer who takes a shine to try and reform local hoodlums. McConaughey's character is too boring and always wins too easily, which makes him more boring. The Gentlemen is a C-level rendition of Ritchie's best material, and Snatch only shines even brighter with each new miss.\n\nNate's Grade: C+",

Also I love when the British call marijuana \"bush\" or  \"skunk\" but there's also something very satisfying about Matthew McConaughey saying the words \"Sweet Mary Jane.\"",

I think this movie is a perfect example of style over substance, which is not always a bad thing for a Guy Ritchie movie. I've liked his style in the past and I liked it in this movie. The story drags heavily in the middle sections and doesn't always have a smooth flow. It moves quickly but that doesn't mean its always interesting. Overall, the actors did a fine job and the movie is very stylish, but I can't see myself watching it again, and can certainly think of other Guy Ritchie films I like a lot more.",

He wants to sell his empire and chaos ensues.  Mathew is mis-cast and phones in a dreary boring performance.\n\nThe standout performance that saves this film for complete ruin is by Hugh Grant, who will likely get an oscar nod for his supporting role as a very kinky sleezy UK tabloid paparazzi cameraman.\n\nColin Farrell turns in an 'ok' role which is very similar to the Brad Pitt role in Snatch, so much so you groan at it.\n\nThe first half of this movie is soooo boring that I contemplated taking a nice stroll to the loo, which is 3 floors down in the basement in the crap theatre I was in.  It's two guys sitting and one guy telling a story.  Often about another guy sitting, talking.\n\nPerhaps most disturbing about this movie is that it is horrifically tone-deaf, with gratuitous racism towards jews in particular, as well as stereotyping horrors for asians, and the one token woman in the movie is subjected to a near-rape scene with almost zero fight back from her (after she is disarmed) I found it unpleasant.\n\nWorth a rental to see Hugh do a fantastic sleeze character.

It was made by people who understand that movies need to entertain and who found a way to blend whimsy as in The Mask with the skillful cuts of Pulp Fiction and a storyline that borrows from Connery era Bond films. \n\nThats not to say the screenplay wasnt a captivating tale, or the acting mediocre. Neither could be further from the truth. \n\nThe story is Marvel-esque and the acting carries you comfortably into a suspension of disbelief by a twisty turny route through British Aristocracy and the brutality of the criminal mind. \n\nWith Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding and British star Charlie Hunnam you feel as if the biggest among young stars wanted to do this movie and collaborated at the top of their game. \n\nAll 5 thumbs up for this flick.",

The movie is about a marijuana distributor named Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) who is trying to sell his business off and retire. His potential buyer Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) has some doubts about the business after some snags in the deal happen involving a hot headed young gangster named Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The movie is told in a series of flashbacks by an investigative journalist named Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who is talking to Mickey's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) and during this time we aw the viewer figure out that there's much more going on than it seems. The movie also stars Colin Farrell as Coach. I really enjoyed this one. It has a very complex plot where it takes you on a ride going back and forth with the story, so it's imperative to pay attention. It's very much like Ritchie's other gangster comedies where they don't really let you stop to think much and you have to go with it. The film has some very funny moments here and overall I enjoyed how it ended. I will say some people may be put off by the overall story as it sometimes kind of overcomplicates itself for the sake of moving the plot, but it didn't bother me much. This is a solid film and I highly recommend checking it out!",

It also includes a side business of modding cars, Chinese mafia looking to buy said businesses and a gang of boxing/rapping thugs. It was a perfect mix of action, comedy and classic moments.

And I am glad to say, as a fan of crime movies, this movie did not disappoint. I think that the most appealing part of this movie are the characters, at least for me. Specifically, McConaughey, Grant, and Farrell were the highlight performances for me. McConaughey was definitely the centerpiece of the film, shining as the villainous but gentlemen-like protagonist. Grant brought the charisma and the slight over the top performance this film needed. Farrell was a surprise because he had a lot heart as well as good comic relief. Charlie Hunnam also did great as Ray and Henry Golding as Dry Eye. I downgrade this film a little because it is very excessive in its language use and it also plays out a little predictably at some parts. It also has some slight pacing issues as well as a surprisingly weaker Jeremy Strong performance.  However, this is a great intro to Guy Ritchie's crime movies for me and I enjoyed it very much.",

Taking a step away from the traditional portrayals of organized crime the movie rocks amazing performances from the entire cast. The refreshing and twisting plot is fantastic and has quite a few commentary's on society.  While others tear down Matthew McConaughey's portrayal as flat but in reality he portrays a cold, cold sociopath who only becomes truly bothered by one thing... someone messing with his wife. His wife played by Michelle Dockery is a fantastic female character.  She is her own woman and NOT about to take crap from her husband or anyone else.  Dockery plays her perfectly.  Charlie Hunnam shines as a devoted and calm consigliere with his own quirks and ability to quickly adapt. Colin Farrell is a crazy nutball who finds himself in some unique positions due to the boys he trains. Henry Golding plays a hungry character that might be felt to be a bit stereotypical but fits in perfectly with this cast. Finally Hugh Grant blows everyone away by portraying the slimiest of slimiest characters ever.  Spending the money to see his performance so different from any others is well worth the money.  Overall, this is a great movie and far more refreshing than any other recent crime drama's from the likes of Martin Scorsese who seem to have excellent actors playing cookie cutter characters.",

Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), an American in London offers to sell his thriving British underground marijuana farms to fellow American billionaire, sleazy Matthew (Jeremy Strong, Succession) and blissfully exercise early retirement to fully enjoy Rosalind, Mickey\u2019s stiletto-heeled wife (Michelle Dockery, Downton Abbey) who runs an auto-repair garage staffed exclusively by women. But the lucrative drug trafficking opportunity is chumming the River Thames luring all manner of hungry fresh water sharks to the city. Taking the bait is Chinese gangster \u201cLord George\u201c (Tom Wu) but his underboss \u201cDry Eye\u201d (Henry Golding, Crazy Rich Asians), strutting his independence and representing the up and coming Asian gangsta youth movement, shoots a different plan to Lord George. Crooked private investigator/paparazzi reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is cheerily dedicating his telephoto lens and camouflage expertise to blackmail Mickey\u2019s #1 henchman Ray (Charlie Hunnam, Sons of Anarchy) by selling the unfolding, exclusive, murdering mob and dope tale to tabloid owner \u201cBig Dave\u201d (Eddie Marsan, Vice) who is determined to enact revenge on Mickey who publicly snubbed diminutive Big Dave at a highfalutin London party. Whew! There you have it. Full circle. Mickey to Matthew to Lord George to Dry Eye to Fletcher to Ray to Big Dave back to Mickey. Well, not quite. There is \u201cCoach\u201d (Colin Farrell), neighborhood legend boxing coach who winds up owing three favors to Mickey because Coach\u2019s stable of brawling, YouTube viral-seeking karate kids overstepped their gym boundaries into Mickey\u2019s business. Coach not only pays off his debt but throws in one machine gun rescue as a bonus fourth favor. Then there\u2019s the Russian connection with former KGB czar daddy who takes exception to Aslan (Danny Griffin), his heir-apparent son face-planting the London sidewalk from two stories up, winding up in a body bag in Ray\u2019s home freezer. On the heels of Aslan\u2019s fall from fame is the demise of anorexic Laura (Eliot Sumner), daughter of Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). Lord Pressfield is an estate beneficiary of Matthew\u2019s enterprise, a literal \u201coverlord.\u201d His income is cut off because of tangling with the karate kid gang but Mickey, trying to make amends, promises to rescue Laura who gets mixed up with Aslan and it\u2019s a big heroin mess. Follow the Moscow Mule to the White Widow Super Cheese weed. Cannabis chaos. The entire movie is framed as a conversation between manic Fletcher and deliberate Ray. Fletcher pitches to Ray, typed up as a screen play at a $20 million price tag, the damning, blackmailing evidence he\u2019s clandestinely gathered. Ok? Got it? If it\u2019s any comfort, it took me so long to diagnose the movie-within-a-movie format that I missed important clues flying by in the fast and furious dialogue. Fletcher talked way too fast and Ray way too slow. The British slang went over my head. I like to think of myself as able to cope with the circuitous but this movie took such a scenic route that I wished for an occasional linear respite. For all I know the movie-within-the-movie was the movie. Confused? Me, too. Maybe buy two pretzels.",

In the same vein as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - The Gentlemen is a crime drama/comedy full of colorful well realized characters scheming to come up on some money or drugs. This movie has style to spare with whip smart dialogue, great editing, and audio that helps to move the transitions along. One of the more creative parts comes in the form of a gang of young robbers who video their crimes on go pros and make them into music videos that become viral hits on the web. Hilarious. \n\nWith more than a few twists and turns the movie is consistently engaging and surprising and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the characters just talk to each other about random stuff. The banter is both witty and revealing, but doesn't drag on and is broken up by a healthy dose of violence every now and then. Ritchie's track record of late has been all over the place, but if you're a fan of his older movies you'll find more than one thing to love about this entertaining addition to his body of work.",

But there is way too much talking and you will be confused as to what is going on until Hugh Grant gets deeper into the explanation.  The English slang is amusing but confusing.  Not being raised in the streets of England makes it difficult to understand some of the dialogue.  The acting is superb though.  But the subject, at least in America where marijuana is pretty much legal, doesn't seem so compelling a story line.  But again, if you are a fan of the older style Guy Richie movies you will like this.",

It seems to have a different idea of what the movie was supposed to be about and yet maintained a story that was discreet from the proposition.

What results is a good helping interesting moving parts, dialogue, and performances from great actors.\n\nThe script isn't quite as tight as LS&TSB. The movie could've been a bit shorter. The character of a tabloid editor played by Eddie Marsan could've been cut without effecting anything. I also felt the last scene missed a bit of a punch.\n\nThe previous criticisms are more nitpicks than major issues. Overall, this movie is a good time and I recommend it.

Took awhile to get into a somewhat slow plot but if you pay attention b4 you know it you'll be all in.

While I enjoyed all the performances for me Hugh Grant as Fletcher stole the show. I'm a bit of a fangirl for Charlie Hunnam and I really enjoyed the character of Raymond. A bit of a departure from his usual role as eye candy. No scenes including his bare bottom or shirtless torso here. Quite the opposite. He's impeccably dressed from head to toe through the whole film. He is be-speckled with slicked backed hair and a beard covering his gorgeous face.  I found it refreshing. I thought he was able to disappear into the character without getting glimpses of Jax Teller or King Arthur. The entire cast was terrific. While watching the movie I kept waiting for Colin Farrell to appear wondering how he was going to fit into the story. I was not left disappointed. I recommended this film to my family and friends. I definitely think it's one I would stop and watch if I passed by it while scrolling through channels.",

In the hands of a lesser screenwriter the deluge of expletives would be juvenile and unfunny, but in the Ritchie-verse it becomes something akin to wallpaper. Listen to his complex creative language and one comes to realize that Ritchie is a high poet who makes the most quotable movies of our age (sorry Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith). Ritchie's ear for soundtrack choices is spot on. I am not so much of a fan of Charlie Hunnam or Michelle Dockery as to find them irreplaceable here. However in the acting the department the veterans  Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, and Jeremy Strong  hit home runs here. Further, all heads must be bowed to the nearly unrecognizable accent show that is laid down by Hugh Grant. I might be ready for a Guy Ritchie Extended Universe.",

My one tiny \"dislike\" was the overwhelming use of my all-time least favorite word in the English Language - \"cun!\" Every time I hear that word it has a physical impact on my senses. I realize it has a different connotation in the UK than it does in the US, but just like too much F-word gets used for a visceral response, that word triggers an even more visceral one in me.

            "content": "Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining\n\nThe Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and snatch. (2000). And yes, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its only female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here, but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity works well for the most part. The plot is as derivative as it gets, but Ritchie has injected real verve into it. The Gentlemen won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.\n\nThe film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson, and Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation, telling Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does.\n\nAesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, and it remains immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.\n\nIn terms of themes, the most obvious is the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. The smooth running of Pearson's business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance, for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.\n\nOne of the most central scenes sees Ray and his mn clash with a gang of machete-wielding thugs on a council estate, and there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell) having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.\n\nThe biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.\n\nNevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",

            "content": "The Gentlemen (4 out of 5 stars). The Gentlemen brings Guy Ritchie back into his original roots with a gangster action crime films. The movie is surprisingly good with a witty script that is filled with humor; a story that is filled with twists and turns, and a huge cast ensemble which everyone does a great job in their characters. I did think the movie was kind of boring in the first half hour until it picks up. The movie is not in a chronological order. The plot follows Reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) breaks into Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) home. Requesting a lot of money in exchange for a return that Raymond's boss Mickey (Matthew McConaughey) and his organization of pot dealing story does not get sold to a movie studio. Fletcher and Raymond go over the story on what happened in the past. With Mickey wanting to retire from his organization. Which Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is trying to buy his organization but Mickey refuses. Creating a conflict with Dry Eye. Meanwhile, Coach (Colin Farrell) and his group of young adults accidently breaks into Mickey's plant farm. While Raymond is trying to get everything settled with dealing any conflict that Mickey has. It was a good story. It was all over the place. From the perspectives as Fletcher was talking to Raymond about in the beginning of the movie. There is a scene that Fletcher wrote a screen play from when he was spying on Matthew (Jeremy Strong) and Dry eye. Which he has himself and Raymond acting it out. It was funny and stupid. The film does have some fun humor. Then, there are some dark and serious moments which can be tough to watch. The cast ensemble is great with the movie. Matthew McConaughey takes the lead playing Mickey. There are some powerful moments when a dramatic tension leads him to fighting back. Charlie Hunnam was great. Henry Golding was good playing Dry Eye. Rosalind who is Mickey's wife played by Michelle Dockery is also good as well. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan are good. Colin Farrell was good and funny with his character. Hugh Grant almost unrecognizable playing Fletcher was funny and good. Guy Ritchie direction and script delivered a gangster drama movie with witty dialogue, narrative, and humor. It is what you can expect in a Guy Ritchie's movie. There are some over dramatic moments with a powerful music score by Christopher Benstead. Overall, The Gentlemen is a good action crime film. It does have a slow and confusing narrative beginning. The film kicks off with a humorous and witty direction and a good cast to hold the movie together with a story that has plenty of twists and turns to make it worth watching.",

GUY RITCHIE!!!!!! GUY FREAKING RITCHIE !!!! Is BACK to his old CLASSIC roots and he absolute 100% NOOOOOO DOUBT provessss why he STILL is one of the KINGS of Hollywood!!! This film INSTANTLY is one of his GREATEST movie he was ever written and directed! It is up there with Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels!! All 3 are totally different and their own movie but also the same and it is just AMAZING and beyond talented how a filmmaker can do that! All around from small part to big part EVERY character was P.E.R.F.E.C.T casting.... Freaking MIC DROP! They all took their charter made it there own and just rannnnnnn with it! Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam were our two FAVORITE characters through the film! Those two gave PHENOMENAL jaw dropping performances!! They both had us crying laughing out of our seats in their own ways! WHILE also both being extremely BADASS!! This is going to be hard to say but honestly might be our most favorite role from Charlie Hunnam and we LOVE Hunnam! As for Farrell he can literally do ANYTHING.... Enough said. Now for the KING of the Jungle.. MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY played a MAGNIFICENT leading man that was in charge of everything. He was the leader of the packet and he did NOT disappoint like always. He was serious,smart,cockey, HILARIOUS and a BAD MOFO! Enough said! Michelle Dockery was BRILLIANT as the movies leading lady! She was sexy, spectacular And believable all around. She needs more roles to play. This movie is literally going to be in our TOP 5 all year!! And yes it\u2019s extremely early to say that but TRUST US because you will totally understand after you see this MONA LISA for your self! BEAUTIFULLY written, directed and just crafted!! So many memorable unforgettable scenes and lines from this movie! Guy Ritchie is back and STILL at the TOP of his game!! Go see The Gentlemen ASAP!! ENOUGH SAID!!!",

I recommend this film for anybody who loves Guy Ritchie gangster flicks, witty dialogue and banter, and those looking for a laugh. 4.5/5 for sure.",
