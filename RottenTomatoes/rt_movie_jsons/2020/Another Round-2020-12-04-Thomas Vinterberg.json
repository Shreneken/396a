Resumiendo en pocas palabras, sirva la cita de Píndaro con la que Albert Camus abre su obra El míto de Sísifo:\n\n``No te afanes, alma mía, por una vida inmortal; apura el recurso hacedero´´.\n\nEn definitiva, Otra ronda es, sin lugar a dudas, una película preciosa y de bella factura que, paradójicamente, será recordada a perpetuidad por el mensaje que transmite: todo es efímero, lo relevante es decidir qué hacer con el tiempo del que disponemos. Y es en esta disyuntiva donde los pequeños detalles siempre son los más importantes. Todo un ejemplo de clásico instantáneo.",

            "content": "Golden Globe-nominated 'Another Round' is the latest directorial feature from Thomas Vinterberg (The Hunt, Melancholia). The 117-minute dramedy follows four high-school teachers who decide to launch a risky experiment: upholding a constant state of low-level intoxication.\n\nMads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe star as four mundane high-school teachers who decide to add some excitement to their lives. They start by experimenting with Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skårderud's hypothesis that humans are born with a blood alcohol content 0.05% too low. As their investigation begins, the results are instantly noticeable. Martin's (Mikkelsen) class becomes something his students enjoy, and all four teachers reap the benefits of their new-found enthusiasm. However, the results aren't just work-benefitting, as Martin finally manages to reconnect with his wife and children. They soon agree that they should increase their daily alcohol intake from 0.05 to 0.10, and after not finding any negative repercussions, they decide to start binge-drinking to see how that will affect their study.\n\nThe men's families soon become worried. Martin's family is fearful he's descending into alcoholism after noticing his intoxicated state for weeks. A heated argument between Martin and his wife ensues, and the four decide to abandon the experiment. Months have passed, and all seems well until Vinterberg reveals that Tommy (Larsen) has unfortunately become an alcoholic, a downward spiral that doesn't always end well. As the film progresses, hope seems to be on the horizon for Martin after he receives a text from his wife. As the film drawers to an end, Mads Mikkelsen is seen to be dancing around his newly-graduated students and diving into the ocean.\n\nMads Mikkelsen, being the gift to acting he is, gives a superb performance alongside his castmates, who also give great performances. The camaraderie between the four leads oozes genuineness and provides an added layer of intimacy. As well as demonstrating genuine friendships, the four all do an incredible job of showing how different their teaching becomes after a drop of alcohol is added to the mix.\n\n'Another Round' is one of those few films that feels mundane, but in a good way. There's not too much going on at once, and Vinterberg doesn't bite off more than he can chew, choosing to put more focus on two teacher's personal lives instead of giving all four unnecessary screen time. The editing complements the film's calm, contemporary aesthetic perfectly, and reminds viewers that the teachers are still recording the results of trying out this hypothesis. 'Another Round' has brilliant continuity and casual pacing that reflects the film's relaxed atmosphere. Sturla Brandth Grøvlen's ('Victoria', 'Shirley') enthralling cinematography is the perfect accompaniment to the handheld camera shots - Grøvlen's cinematography also helps to capture the detail in the set design.\n\nThe surprising thing about 'Another Round' is how accurate some parts seem to be, especially the teenage drinking. Denmark has some of the highest rates of teenage drinking in the world. In 2020, the WHO released a report stating that Danish 15-year-olds consume almost double the European average amount of alcohol - this is partly due to teens being able to purchase alcohol from 16. The film dives into the relationship humans have with alcohol, and how it can relieve the numbness of everyday life. It raises the question if alcohol can have a positive impact on your daily life, and if the constant consumption of alcohol can be sustained for a while without becoming an issue?\n\n'Another Round' is one of the more underrated films to come out of the shitshow we call 2020. Fuelled by outstanding performances against the monotonous backdrop of everyday life, if you're looking for a film that provides an insight into European culture, as well as raising thought-provoking questions, 'Another Round' is the film for you.",

Is it the burden of alcohol he's finally freed from in the end or the burden of a life without it?\n\nDoes the somewhat macabre (Mikkelsen is a professional dancer) dancing at the finale celebrate the glorious vodka saturated life of an alcoholic or his liberation from it?  And is this movie somehow a celebration of substance abuse and addiction with a strong nod in favor of it as a \"highly\" effective release from life's burdens.  \n\nYou have to love ambiguity to love how this movie ends.",

I've worked in a school before so I know how soul-sucking it can be. He seems kind of disconnected with people as well. He's lost his lust for life. I love Mads man, he's such a great actor. I actually love how they're justifying their day-drinking by testing out Finn Skarderud's hypothesis of how human's are born with a deficit .05% blood alcohol content. It seems to definitely be working for Martin as his performance as a teacher has drastically improved. I love the way he introduced the three candidates for voting and how the third one happened to be Hitler. I guess you just have to drink a little bit to loosen up and enjoy the world. That part where the students start singing the hymn about Denmark had me crying, it was beautiful. And the way the teacher coaxed their voices out of them was inspiring.\n\nI can't help but think that what's to come is something dark. What if these guys become alcoholics? I feel like Martin's on the road to becoming an alcoholic. He has the highest chance out of the four guys, or so it seems. I love how the little boy, Specs, scored a goal. That was so wholesome. Yup, now Martin's really gonna start drinking. I had a feeling his wife was cheating on him with another man when she said a particular thing in the tent. That final dance scene with Martin was great, Mads impressed me with his moves and nimbleness.\n\nThis movie has a great heart. It has plenty of beautiful moments throughout while also showing the dark side of life. Terrific writing and wonderful acting. Mads playing a depressed, low-spirited teacher who rediscovers his passion fro life is really a beautiful thing to see, a real treat. His performance is definitely the stand out one. Very eye-opening and enlightening, almost like a spiritual journey; only it's done through alcohol consumption. I haven't seen a lot of Danish movies, but the way they filmed this one, it has this sense of tension throughout that it almost felt like a horror/thriller movie at times. \n\nLesson of the movie is: learn moderation when drinking, never lose your lust for life and find meaning in life and yourself. Although the story wasn't anything amazing, it was still entertaining and quite profound existentially. I don't think it's something I'd watch again, but I definitely recommend it. I feel like this movie would be ideal to watch if you're in the middle of an existential crisis or having trouble with alcoholism. It might speak higher volumes for people going through these things. But overall, great movie.",

The plot is quite slow to build and it felt a bit bland in the first half or so but it picks up a bit mid way through and the ending is certainly something to see, I'd say. Mads Mikkelsen gives a pretty decent performance, as a teacher unsure how much the drinking may affect his teaching. Its a quirky watch, more a piece of somewhat thoughtful social commentary than anything else - I wouldn't say its hilarious or really dramatic but its certainly not bad. A curious watch.

            "content": "Critics when a kid's movie ends with a large dance number: >:(\nCritics when a Vinterberg movie ends with a large dance number: :)\n\nWhat could have just been a dour, hypertragic setup for Mads Mikkelsen to show off his acting chops is instead made into an interesting take on the midlife crisis; instead of a period of introspection and regret, Vinterberg uses the setup as a launchpad to touch on repression, engagement, and relationships with others more so than it is about unfulfilled ambition. While the film inevitably had to include some sort of Lost Weekend-esque blowback to our protagonists' seemingly uninhibited drunkenness, the effects that we see on their personal lives are never wholly negative or positive. Yes, alcohol is used by some characters as a crutch and taken to the point of excess, but even when suffering personal setbacks from their experiments the group finds their more liberated sense of engagement (even when morally questionable) actually brings out a more authentic self and improves the experiences of those around them unexpectedly. Tragicomic and well acted, there's a reason that it received such critical praise (and not just because so many movies weren't being released at the time because of COVID-19). Many films encourage their characters (and the audience) to live in the moment, few do it with so many facets as Another Round.\n\nKind of strange that there is apparently a planned English-language remake with Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role. I mean, this won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film only a couple of years ago, it's got tons of recognition in its current form and is very recent. Just ... watch the original? (4/5)",

            "content": "Four friends and a hypothesis — that human beings are operating at a .05% BAC deficit — makes for a highly entertaining and beautifully structured movie. In college, a friend and I took a bottle of vodka to an academic building to crush a couple of final papers, the alcohol performing as a creativity lubricant — I'm well-aware of this theory. In Another Round, four teachers at a Danish high school engage in the imbibing experiment, each for a different reason. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) is the protag, a history professor who has become dull and uninspired, so much so that students' parents meet with the administration to address his lackluster performance. The plot's conflict is foreseeable, but it doesn't take away from the story. The film benefits from following each friend's experience, not just Martin's, and how the alcohol affected their lives and careers. Stories that focus on alcohol can fall into tropes and become stale, but that never happens here. Instead, the (many) drunk moments are funny, realistic, and devastating. The cut to the group fishing off the dock was my favorite. The scene where \"things start to get dark\" was cinematically pleasing and beautiful. I loved that when it was time to kick it into hyper drive, the group drinks Sazeracs. The ending was teetering on deus ex machina, but the film needed to have an overall positive conclusion — I generally dislike dance scenes for endings, but this one actually made sense (they brought up Martin's ballet history earlier) and was contained within the confines of the film. Mikkelsen's performance was commendable, but all around there isn't a weak link — Thomas Bar Larsen as Tommy also deserves recognition.",

All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group begins to discuss psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, who has theorized that having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05 makes you more creative and relaxed. While the group dismisses the theory, Martin, who is depressed due to troubles in his marriage, is inspired and starts to drink at work. The rest of the group eventually decides to join him, considering the ordeal an experiment to test Skårderud's theory. They agree to a set of rules: their BAC should never be below 0.05 and that they should not drink after 8:00 pm. Within a short period of time, all four members of the group find both their work and private lives more enjoyable. Martin, in particular, is delighted as he finally manages to reconnect with his wife and children. Agreeing that the experiment should be taken further, the group increases the daily BAC limit to 0.10. Still finding their lives improved, the group decides to attempt binge drinking to observe how their bodies and minds respond. The group has a fun night, but after coming home drunk, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family express their worries that he is descending into alcoholism, revealing that he has been visibly drunk for weeks. After a heated argument during which Martin's wife admits to infidelity, Martin leaves her. The group abandons the experiment...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics consensus states: \"Take one part deftly directed tragicomedy, add a dash of Mads Mikkelsen in vintage form, and you've got Another Round – an intoxicating look at midlife crises.\"\n\n\"Another Round\" is yet another fine film by Thomas Vinterberg with an intriguing difficult storyline and the consequences of the main characters actions. It´s a view on alcohol and also maybe Denmark´s drinking culture and the severe consequences of alcohol when losing control of it. Alcohol can be a life affirming thing when in small dosis and I guess that´s the consensus of the film as well. We get a really great cast and strong performances from Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe and Magnus Millang. However, I think the ending is not fully satisfying somehow. I felt there was a piece missing. I can´t put my finger on it, but that was my immediate feeling. \n\nTrivia: At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won for Best International Feature Film and was also nominated for Best Director.

It begs the question: is director/co-writer Thomas Vinterberg's film a salute to alcohol, or a condemnation of its abuse? A celebratory yet wary ode to the present, and a tribute to the concoction? A disguised lambaste of Danish drinking culture? Maybe all of the above?\n\nLed by the great Mads Mikkelsen, the film's centered around a band of worn out grade school teachers half-mindedly making their way through middle age. At a birthday dinner, the quartet discuss psychiatrist Finn Skårderud's theory that humans' blood alcohol content is normally 0.05% too low, leading them to take up the challenge and test the hypothesis by binge drinking themselves into a buzz throughout their everyday lives.\n\nAnother Round's got the bones of a low blowing comedy, but the unmistakable touch of a European character art movie. The outrageous energy inherent in its premise peeks out only momentarily throughout, Vinterberg otherwise taking a subdued look at four men thirsting for the youthful energy of their prime. Save for the sudden spark of joy or jolt of a narrative progression, the approach may even be too minimal, the film mostly missing that extra little oomph to push itself into modern classic territory. The story unwinds disjointedly sporadic as well, leaping to its climax a bit too suddenly for one to immerse themselves in the supposedly gradual curve the men's alcoholic journey is taking them on. Still, once the ending hits and sets everything into perspective, you can't deny the haul was more than worth it.",

            "content": "Thomas Vinterberg's \"Another Round\" is a funny, heartwarming and profound drama that offers a compassionate look at the highs and lows of alcohol addiction. With his eleventh feature, Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg draws from his own personal experiences to create a poignant portrait of drinking in Denmark. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the experiences of alcoholics, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Vinterberg draws viewers into the delusional lives of four friends that conduct a risky alcohol experiment. Vinterberg's decision to shoot the movie using hand-held cameras is risky, but it works tremendously. It lends a sense of intimacy and realism to the movie, making viewers feel as if they are in the drunken stupor of the characters. Vinterberg showcases extraordinary control of craftsmanship over the production design, editing and musical score, using these elements to create an immersive cinematic experience. Vinterberg's screenplay is also spectacular, and evokes empathy for alcoholics through a non-judgemental perspective. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Mads Mikkelsen delivers one of the best performances of his career as Martin. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the desperation, grief and recklessness of a high-school teacher that struggles to overcome his severe addiction towards alcohol. The supporting cast is spectacular and also worthy of recognition. Although \"Another Round\" is undeniably a powerful addiction drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a misjudged conclusion. It's a tonally inconsistent ending that sugar-coats the harsh realities of alcoholism. Nevertheless, fans of Thomas Vinterberg's films will definitely enjoy \"Another Round\" and so will movie-goers seeking thought-provoking entertainment. One only hopes that it will teach modern-day alcoholics a cautionary lesson that using alcohol as a crutch to solve life's problems isn't worth the consequences it entails.",

But its much more about using alcohol to escape the mundanity of life, a route many people take and find themselves unable to leave. It's not an endorsement of binge drinking or a celebration of it, since the greatest results our quartet gain without adverse consequences is from drinking in relative moderation. It's easy to predict that things will soon get out of hand, but its no less tragic to witness how 4 people each deal with their own struggles as booze becomes an ever more essential ingredient in their day. They find their lives improving, but nothing is without repercussions, and the 3rd act is all about them dealing with the problems they have brought upon on themselves. The film wants to show the uplifting effects of having a stuff drink, but doesn't shy away from the potentially fatal results if things get out of hand. The acting is fantastic, it feels very authentic, the people talk to each other like normal human beings, and the directing is equally adept at capturing both the highs and the lows of the journey.

The film centers upon Danish drinking culture, and the national spirit of Denmark (both in an internal and alcoholic sense) rears its head in the film again and again, yet the film adeptly incorporates a barrage of other themes to great efficacy. Midlife crises, social responsibility, general alcoholic consumption, and the joy of life are all also equally weighty subjects touched upon, expertly expanded, and then sensibly left for the viewer to chew. \n\nMads Mikkaelsen makes the film, this is true. I think that the four friends who consist of Mikkaelsen and the three main supporters all deserve immense credit. Thomas Bo Larsen as Tommy, for instance, does wonderfully. The film includes genuinely laugh-inducing moments along with tear-jerkers that never feel unduly manipulative. Then, there is the incredible, brilliant final scene that ends the film on an absurdly high note considering the tumult and tribulation that Another Round endured over its 2+ hours. Done worse, the film would have derailed and likely been panned upon release. Somehow, this tonal shift felt perfect in the context of the film. Mikkaelsen certainly commits and ensures that his magnetic performance reaches a new height and finds incomprehensible levels of acting perfection. In the end, even from a writing standpoint, the message that life goes on and we must live it strikes an unmissable chord of optimism in the heart of anyone who paid attention over the course of the journey in a manner that ensures the internalization of this great high and all of the previous crushing lows. This, my friends, is brilliant cinema.",

Given the role that alcohol plays on social functioning worldwide, it occurred to me to be surprised that never before had I seen a movie that specifically explored alcohol and it's impacts - both positive and negative (though there are many movies featuring the negative). I had a community driven alcohol soaked youth myself and I recognise alcohol has shaped my life - for instance I wouldn't have my first daughter without it - so I appreciate the ingenuity of exploring alcohol in it's own right. \nWhilst the movie is about alcohol, underlying that, it is about the ways of being that bring about liveliness- being spontaneous, silly, carefree, doing things that are fun, being confident in yourself and expressing yourself, expressing the passion within yourself, connecting with loved ones, celebrating, and enjoying being alive. \nThese are ways of being that can be encouraged by alcohol - they are also qualities of youth. Director Vinterburg cleverly mirrors the greying landscape Martin has come to reside within against the vividness of youth by positioning it's central characters as high school teachers. The movie follows the group of teachers as they attempt to re-invigorate their lives by the experimental use of daily alcohol, whilst simultaneously following the students as they head towards their final exams.\n(spoiler alert) I was particularly taken by the final scene in which Martin breaks into a wild contemporary dance amongst a crowd of inebriated youth. Until this moment, the movie has no particularly theatrical elements. The break from departure serves to emphasise the bright liveliness of the dance - and in the dance we see the brightness of the light inside Martin. It occurred to me that this light was what had been suppressed over time and lead to his depression. And so the film ends on that note - let the light inside yourself shine.",

I laughed at all the drunken antics and was moved at the heartfelt depiction of the average daily life of adults shown here. Vinterberg's direction adheres to Dogme 95's real sets, realistic performances, handheld camera maneuvers, and raw style for a masterful display of Danish direction. Another Round is instantly one of Thomas Vinterberg's finest films ever in his illustrious career and an easy recommendation to anyone.\n\nSturla Brandth Grøvlen's handheld cinematography captures that in the moment Danish style of Dogme 95's filmmaking techniques. Another Round is beautifully shot whether in striking close-ups for the emotional confrontations herein or with dazzling wide shots moving around dancing in the splendid finale! Janus Billeskov and Jansen Anne Østerud's editing is swiftly cut with a natural pacing and attention to keeping the conversations naturalistic. Another Round is 117 minutes long, but feels like a brisk 60 to me.\n\nMads Mikkelsen astonishes as the dull history professor Martin, who dives deep into day drinking with a new lust for life that would make Iggy Pop proud. He's subtle with his initial performance showing an emotional breakdown and fun to watch drink, dance, and party his life away. Mikkelsen keeps the character of Martin close to heart as you always sympathize with the guy and root for his sobering up straightening out of his love life. Maria Bonnevie is wonderful as Martin's estranged wife Anika, who falls in love with Mads Mikkelsen all over again, understandably. Bonnevie has electric romantic chemistry with the ever handsome and likable Mikkelsen. Mads is pleasantly alive, endearingly charming, and sincerely devastating in Another Round. Vinterberg pulls these miraculous acting performances from Mads Mikkelsen whether it's depressing like The Hunt or divinely entertaining like in Another Round. Cheers to you, Mads.\n\nThomas Bo Larsen is outstanding as the outgoing gym teacher Tommy with his crazy drunken antics, kindness to his young soccer pupils, or his somber portrayal of a man climbing into a bottle. Likewise, Lars Ranthe is fantastic as a music teacher named Peter helping his students find their voice. Ranthe's display of good friendship, forlorn lovelessness, careful musical teaching, and personable attention to Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt's struggling student Sebastian are all powerful. Lastly, Magnus Millang is funny as Nikoalj, an overzealous psychology teacher and tired father of 3 young children. His adherence to his wife's demands are as fun as his eagerness to write about the effects of day drinking. Helene Reingaard Neumann is excellent as his wife Amalie with her commands and frustrations that feel so real.\n\nThomas Vinterberg remains one of Denmark's greatest directors of all time with his delightfully bittersweet picture Another Round. It's wonderful that a film he dedicated to his beloved daughter Ida, who tragically died before the film's completion, is such a celebration of life. Another Round could have been titled the art of enjoying life or the virtues of intoxication.\n\nThomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm's script writing is excellent condensed into four distinct parts as appropriately 4 high school teachers, who are bored with their mundane lives, take up day drinking for a playful attitude and constant buzz. As they increase their BAC to dangerously drunk levels, their lives unravel, their friendship and families are tested, and alcoholism is achieved. Vinterberg approaches what would normally be a depressing subject and smashes it gleefully like a beer bottle to the head. \n\nSimply put, Another Round works so well because it gives you everything positive and negative on the subject of drinking alcohol. You get the silly antics, drunken banter, playful mindset, relaxed persona, and easy clarity of a 0.05% buzzed functioning alcoholic to the raving anger, broken marriages, and disgusting slobbery of a 1.5% blasted fool. Another Round is balanced like a well mixed beverage fit for your consumption and pleasure. I found all the comedy refreshing and the family drama seriously touching. By the end, you are devastated by the moving revelations and satisfied with the inspirational hopefulness we've left from Vinterberg's daring screenplay.\n\nI must mention the fun classical and soundtrack choices, keep you in a good mood. Sabine Hviid's production design is stunning with modernist Danish homes and cozy family abodes alike. Manon Rasmussen and Ellen Lens' costumes look cool with stylish suits for the lead men and the latest Danish fashion trends for the high schoolers. Dorte Jacobsen, Susanne Søbye, and Marike Willard's make-up is lifelike for midlife crisis having adult men as well as the drunken injuries sustained from a night of outrageous debauchery.\n\nTo conclude, I highly recommend the very fun and genuinely touching Another Round. Thomas Vinterberg is a director I will always love and appreciate. He's so much more humanist and endearing than Lars von Trier's depressing filmography.",

            "content": "In one of the best lines in The Simpsons' history, Homer Simpson makes a summary toast: \"To alcohol, the cause of –and solution to—all of life's problems.\" This edict populates the Danish comedy Another Round, written and directed by Dogme 95 co-founder Thomas Vinterberg (The Hunt, Far From the Madding Crowd), who recently earned a surprise Academy Award nomination for Best Director. The movie follows a foursome of middle-aged school teachers trying to reclaim their lost mojo, chief among them Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), a history teacher who feels adrift as a husband, father, and an educator. A friend mentions a theory from an obscure academic that human beings are born with a .05% blood-alcohol deficiency, and to operate at peak performance, a person should regularly imbibe a serving of alcohol to maintain a buzzed feeling. Martin and his three friends agree to live this experiment, sneaking booze onto school premises, and then pushing further, raising the blood-alcohol minimum to see if they can keep up.\n\nIn some ways, Another Round feels ready-made for the kind of wacky ensemble comedy territory on the peripheral of drama, something the likes of a new Judd Apatow comedy (Knocked Up), and I wish that this Danish film had followed a more mainstream and crowd-pleasing approach. I know that sounds sacrosanct, the American film critic decrying the foreign film and wanting it to be filled with more dick and fart jokes, but this is because I see the true comedic potential at play, and I know an artist with the sensibilities of an Apatow or even a Greg Mottola (Superbad) could crush this. Labeled as a comedy, Another Round is more \"comedy\" in broad theory than execution. You would think a group of middle-aged school teachers testing a theory about operating at peak efficiency while being buzzed from booze would lend itself to all kinds of amusing, hilarious exchanges and set pieces where the men cause trouble and get into unexpected shenanigans while trying to keep their secret. The appeal would be watching this group of men cut loose in a way that feels liberating, pushing them outside their comfort zones and discovering something about themselves and their capabilities before, of course, the dark side and going too far, chasing an increasing high. I feel like many readers can picture the Apatow comedy right there. The problem with Another Round is that nothing is ever really funny. There's the brief occasion of physical slapstick and even briefer encounters of the men behaving goofy, caught up in their feel-good vibes. But mostly the movie is devoid of recognizable comedy, even awkward, cringe-inducing comedy. It feels like the filmmakers said, \"Let's tackle a premise that seems like an Apatow comedy but let's play it mostly straight and see how it goes.\" Well, it went.\n\nAs far as a drama, I also found Another Round to be promising but ultimately lacking. We don't really know the supporting characters before they begin their experiment, particularly what is holding them back or what obstacle they seem to perceive is holding them back. This is a movie about drastic change and how it affects these four men, and yet we barely know where they are starting off to contrast how the experiment affects them, good or bad. The men all seem to have succumbed to a general malaise and the joy of teaching has left them. Once they begin the experiment, they find that joy has emerged and they are more engaged in their classrooms, more adept at connecting with their teen students and keeping their attention, and more likely to make the learning meaningful and impactful as it relates to their dreaded high-pressure finals. Really, it sounds like, on paper, that these men use this opportunity to simply become better teachers because they allow themselves to put more of themselves into their teaching. The men don't seem beholden to superstition, feeling they need the alcohol to be the most effective teachers, so one would think they could take the experience and learn lessons about how they can reclaim that feeling of purpose, of being an effective educator without the catalyst of alcohol to get them there. Without a more meaningful picture of these characters and their personal ennui, it makes the experiment feel inconsequential, as if it could have been anything else that shook these men from their general malaise. It takes away from the drama of what these men went through and what it might have cost.\n\nI suppose if the comedy was going to be muted, I was expecting Another Round to be more dramatic. Martin is our main character and his rocky relationship with his wife serves as the heart of the drama; he wants to reconcile after being too removed. We root for him but we're not really invested. The bigger drama isn't even involving Martin. One of the guys in the group becomes a cautionary tale of descent, not seeing a reason to stop drinking, and his downturn is played with such nihilistic certainty for tragedy that it seems strange how nobody intervenes. It would play more emotionally if this character was better developed. The other characters are missing clear arcs and more interesting and relatable character moments. I can envision the kinds of supporting characters under this scenario that populate the Apatow version of this premise, each a reflection of a different kind of malaise, each a different personality, and each finding room to progress on an arc where they learn lessons both good and bad but come out wiser. The start is right there, but without making the most of the shared time, it feels like we're hanging out at a party with people we barely know and overhearing an anecdote we're missing vital info from.\n\nMikkelsen is best known stateside for his intense villainous roles (Hannibal, Doctor Strange) and as the occasional flinty badass (Polar, Arctic), so there is a degree of appeal to watching him play a normal school teacher. Mikkelsen is solid throughout and really shines when the character's inner life returns, thanks to alcohol and then, later, his own sense of self-worth. It's sturdy but unremarkable acting, notable for its normalcy and the edges of humor we don;t usually see from the actor. Much is built upon Martin's past jazz ballet class and this is the closest thing the movie has to a comedic payoff, finally gifting the audience with the sight of a joyful, fluid Mikkelsen prancing across the screen at the very end (the actor actually has legit ballet training). It's a fun sight but, as the film's biggest comic payoff, it's not exactly one that could sustain your built-up imagination.\n\nAnother Round is a fine movie about friendship and recovering one's lost sense of self, but as a comedy it's not very funny, and as a drama it's not very dramatic, and so it feels stilted, stuck between both realms and just kind of bouncing around a miscalculated middle-path. You won't be angry by what you're watching from Vinterberg and the actors but you might not be hooked. Given its surprise Best Director Oscar nomination, over the likes of Aaron Sorkin, Regina King, Spike Lee, Florian Zeller, and Darius Marder, I think I was expecting something more bracing, something more intellectually engaging, and something where the vision was so perfectly predicated by the precise tone of its nominated director. I'm sorry to say, dear reader, but I just don't see it. I cannot see what on screen lead to Vinterberg's unexpected nomination over a crowded field. I cannot see what on screen convinced people Mikkelsen was a Best Actor contender. I cannot see what on screen makes Another Round the odds-on favorite for Best International Film, especially in a category where Romania's Collective is also competing. Maybe I'm just not the right audience for this movie. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I'm just being unfair. It's possible, or it's also possible that this heralded foreign film has a muted identity crisis that saps away its comic and dramatic potential and my potential entertainment.\n\nNate's Grade: C+",

            "content": "Director Thomas Vinterberg cannot be praised enough for this film. After four days of shooting, his daughter Ida was killed in a car accident. After a week of mourning, the Dane was back on the set. The idea for the film was also inspired by his daughter. It tells how four middle-aged schoolteachers go through their midlife crisis based on a theory of the Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud, who says that a blood alcohol level of 0.05 makes people go through life more relaxed and free.\n\nEach of the four main characters gets their own storyline and lets us share in their suffering in life. Once the actually optimistic psychology teacher Nikolaj, played by Magnus Milland, who has to deal with bed-wetting children at home. Then the hapless choir director Peter (Lars Ranthe), who sees himself as an expiry model and cannot find love. Sports teacher Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), a coach who is actually loving towards his kids but lacks any motivation. And finally Mads Mikkelsen's character Martin. He accepts being a bore and goes through life virtually invisible, which has an impact on his marriage to Anika (Maria Bonnevie). The plot is told almost exclusively from Martin's perspective. Mikkelsen thereby appropriates pretty much all the facets a person can have. At first he is desperate, then through regular alcohol consumption he suddenly becomes lively and cheerful, before his emotional world is a constant up and down at the end. Mikkelsen disappears into his role and plays this character with a great deal of subtlety and sometimes impulsiveness. Not only Mikkelsen is fantastic, his three co-protagonists also act at a high level. This is especially noticeable in the scenes in which the four of them discuss their project, explore new spheres and go out together. In the individual moments, Mikkelsen stands out because Martin takes up the most screentime.\n\nAnother Round is a funny film for the most part, although the dramatic moments predominate, especially towards the end. Only then do you really become aware of its seriousness and it takes you with it. Actually, many elements correspond to a classic tragicomedy. Vinterberg manages to lay out the film in such a way that this is not always obvious and you stick to one genre in every scene. It may be mainly about the (worrying) drinking culture among adults and young people in Denmark, but Another Round is also an appeal to life in general. Yes, alcohol can awaken undiscovered free spirits in people, but equally it can literally destroy relationships and lives. Vinterberg covers all these aspects brilliantly. Most of the film runs without any musical accompaniment. But when it does, the classical music adapts to the action. The same goes for the camera work and shots: When the characters are in crisis, the film drags. When they're on the edge, it thrills with outstanding pacing. Yes, Another Round may be tedious in places, but this \"weakness\" is made up for by the explosive finale at the latest, which may be the best of the entire year.",

As someone who doesn't and has never had much of an inclination to drink Another Round kind of piqued my interest in this little experiment at least as far as how it might improve my writing, but it's hard not to see how easily said \"experiment\" could go awry and this is what Vinternerg's latest actually intends to chronicle. How does behavior, experiences, and reaction work through and with one another to shape our lives when no matter the order or what dictates what will always depend on the balance one is able to strike with each factor of their existence. Striking that balance, maintaining momentum, energy, and forward motion while still being present enough to enjoy and remember the moments that will define our memories is the trick of the scenario. \n\nIf love is what dreams are made of, then one must accept themselves as fallible in order to give and accept the love of others as well as the life waiting on them should they have the courage to engage in it. Going in knowing your going to hit a few bumps and make a few mistakes makes the wins that much more precious.

The film concerns itself with four friends who are teachers at a local school. Their lives are somewhat incomplete and stale and when they are out to dinner for the 40th of Nikolaj, he puts out an idea to consider. He suggests they follow the idea of psychiatrist Finn Skarderud, who suggested that having a blood alcohol level of 0.05 makes you more creative and relaxed. Martin jumps at the idea as his marriage and work has become stale and dull and other the friends soon follow. Soon all four are feeling better about themselves and their life and work. But when they decided to up the ante and drink a little more the results are not so good. They become happier in some ways but chaotic in others with eventually tragedy striking. This wonderful film does a great job in informing and entertaining. It's a great commentary on midlife crisis and the upsides and downsides of alcohol.

Because if things don't go well for you in life, then give it another shot, if not, then hang yourself up to dry.\n\nThe movie is about four close friends who so happen to be teachers at a high school. All four of them have mundane lives, who are stale at their jobs and social life, and are just unhappy with everything. Until one day they decided to get a little tipsy, maintaining a specific blood rate of alcohol in their bodies to be happier and more active in work, but more importantly feel less invisible by being more loose and fun.\n\nThrough alcohol, you experience a certain type of happiness that can make you feel bubbly and lively. You laugh the hardest with the people around you. You do or say things that your sober self wouldn't dare to do. You feel completely fearless. However, once you get addicted to that feeling, it can easily lead you to dangerous territory and things can spiral out of control. That's this movie in a nutshell.\n\nMads Mikkelsen, an actor that makes every movie so much better, delivers a fantastic performance that's a perfect mixture of humour, charm, and gloomy. I was also impressed by Mads drunk acting during the small and big moments that felt believable. The same thing can be said with the supporting actors, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, and Lars Ranthe. I can tell this was a collaborated effort to deliver effective performances.\n\nThe movie is worth seeing for the ending alone, as you get to see Mads Mikkelsen dancing and it is incredible to watch.\n\nSo yeah, I highly recommend this one, but I also want to recommend another Danish movie called ‘The Hunt', that came out back in 2012, which is directed by Thomas Vinterberg, the same man who brought us this movie and it also stars Mads Mikkelsen. It's a heart-breaking movie that has one of the best performances from Mads. It feels overlooked in my opinion. So please check out ‘The Hunt' and ‘Another Round'.",

For me, the more significant issue here is found in key questions: Can we instill some joy, some new thrills, or just basic fun and relief from the stresses and routine of our lives at work? Will a bit of drink be the key to bringing back that aspect of our personality that's been missing for a good while? Are we able to keep it together while convincing (conning?) ourselves it's all just a sort of physiological experiment?\n Another Round is sort of a slow-motion train wreck. Mikkelsen's character Martin is struggling in his job and marriage. He's been checked out on his wife and family for a few years now,  and looking for a way to bring energy back into his dull life. But it's clear from the beginning that the group experiment in perpetual intoxication is going to end poorly. It's more a question of exactly how and when it's all going to fall apart. The film features its share of trauma and tragedy, and the final sequence is bittersweet, but it's also one of the most purely entertaining, scintillating moments on film in 2020. It also shows what I've known for years- that Mads Mikkelsen is one of the very finest actors of his time. Filmmaking for grown ups. \nWell done by Vinterberg and screenwriter Lindholm. 3.8 stars",

The film is fearlessly driven by a Mads Mikkelsen performance for the ages and directed with weirdly mundane and disarmingly personal cinematography by Vinterberg.\n\n'Another Round's final scene, cleverly foreshadowed throughout the film, must be one of the most eye opening and liberating recent pieces of cinema. Neither celebrating nor condemning anything, 'Another Round' is just happy to explore our innate vulnerability in the face of failure and our purely human fear of anxiety.",

Well you sir, and you madam are in luck, for this anti-inhibitor miracle which comes in a dazzling array of colours and tastes, is readily available and could well be right under your very noses. That's right, booze!\n\nFour cranky high school teachers, grinding the second gear of life with no foreseeable excitement ahead, decide to liven up their days with the magic of alcohol under a seemingly scientific experiment excuse.\n\nThe theorem:\nthe human body's alcohol level is a tad low, and requires some topping up to run at optimum efficiency.\n\nThe experiment:\nthe subjects drink steadily throughout the working day in an anti-sobriety test, and carefully monitor the results in a very clinical manner, using a computer!\n\nThe result:\nwell, that would be telling, but chances are most astute viewers will connect the plot dots without much effort.\n\nThe conclusion:\nwhat sounds like a half-baked script for a slapdash comedy aimed at the immature set, turns out to be quite the serious and thought-provoking film. Also: Mads Mikkelsen stars, which is always welcome.\n\nAlcohol over indulgence is a major issue in dark Denmark, and as such this film will pierce many a Scandinavian home with a personal arrow. For those abroad \"Another Round\" will be less of a cautionary tale, and more of a buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy story of supposedly grown men wrestling with their maturity and various mid-life crises. It is not all about the drink, but why they drink. Using harried, jaded, aging teachers in charge of jubilant youth about to kickstart their glorious lives, is an intoxicating stroke of genius.\n\nDid I mention that Mads Mikkelson stars?\nExcellent.\n\n- hipCRANK",

            "content": "Off the wagon.  So this is about four friends who all are high school teachers in Denmark.  Over a 40th birthday dinner, one of them mentions a theory that all humans are born with a .05% alcohol deficiency in their blood.  They decide to test this thesis by maintaining this level through the workweek.  Now it was the premise that got my attention on this one.  I'm not even sure how this originally got on my radar, but the fact that this stars the great Mads Mikkelsen only further piqued my interest.  I don't know if I would go so far as to say that I enjoyed Another Round, but it is effective.  Another Round does a quality job with the setup.  At the start of the story, none of these four teachers are alcoholics.  Our main protagonist, Martin (Mikkelsen), is distant with traces of sadness.  His students and family only give him the minimal amount of required attention, so you get why he is barely present at work or home.  He has reached a breaking point, so why not go with this insane idea to shake up the routine?  There is a short stretch in this where they are all succeeding, and you think for just a second that they may be on to something.  That moment is fleeting, and you come crashing back down to Earth as you are reminded that these are all delusional characters that are in denial and avoiding difficult conversations.  If you live in the real world, then you already know that this can only end badly since they are all escalating, and it made my stomach churn to watch these men on this self-destructive road.  I'm not exaggerating, either.  My remote control wouldn't let me pause this movie; I'm not sure if it was the batteries or the internet, but I watched this from start to finish in one sitting, and it made me feel nauseous at several points as I watched this play out.  Much like a Tilt-A-Whirl, I just wanted to get off the ride.  I know that this is labeled as a comedy, but I didn't find all that much humor in this.  Another Round isn't a fun drinking movie like The Hangover; it is a movie where you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for that piper to come knocking for his payment.  As I said, I can't say that I enjoyed this all that much, but I did appreciate everything it was able to accomplish.  I can give this a low recommendation if anything I just described sounds appealing to you.",

That's what Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's latest offering seeks to do for the topic of drinking, one that brings with it alleged benefits and potential harm, as well as a boatload of sensitive cultural connotations. This edgy comedy-drama about four friends who conduct a dubious experiment about the supposed creative, professional and social merits that can come from intentional sustained alcohol consumption traverses thorny questions of responsibility, self-control and personal balance and how their handling can either work to our advantage or against our well-being. Needless to say, this is a tricky narrative path to follow, but the filmmaker manages to navigate through it rather skillfully, even if the final product is too unrealistically tidy at times with a closing sequence that's a little too long and arguably unresolved. This offering is sure to provoke strong responses either way, but no one is likely to come away from it without having a well-defined opinion.",

(Source: IMDb)\n\nI'm glad that I had the chance to enjoy watching Another Round at home and that's thanks to the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nAfter his unforgettable performance in \"The Hunt\", Mads Mikkelsen gives us another great performance as he plays Martin in \"Another Round\", if I would choose which one is his best performance, I would choose \"The Hunt\" for sure and that's because of the emotional and deep feelings that character had and Mads Mikkelsen was able to express that perfectly, In \"Another Round\" his character is kind of similar to the one in \"The Hunt\" but the difference is that in \"The Hunt\" his character was battling a difficult time of his life as he gave up on it and doesn't have anything left to lose, he was desperate, but in \"Another Round\" it's kind of the opposite, he is trying to improve his life by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in his blood hoping it'll work, and Mads Mikkelsen was brilliant in that, sometimes by just looking into his eyes, you can feel what's inside of him, grief / happiness / loneliness / sadness and etc…\nThe supporting cast was was brilliant, his other 3 friends were all great in their performances, when they wanted us to laugh we did laugh and when they wanted us to get emotional we did indeed get emotional, perfect casting.\n\nFor those who don't know both \"The Hunt\" and \"Another Round\" are directed by Thomas Vinterberg and that's why you might notice that the movie is a bit smilier to \"Th Hunt\" with the set design, the characters, and the message of the film, for example, the scene where the 4 friends went to the supermarket when they were drunk kind of reminded me of the one in \"The Hunt\" when he went inside the supermarket and got kicked out, but in my opinion, I prefer \"Another Round\" than \"The Hunt\", I gave \"The Hunt\" a 6.5/10 and I was disappointed by it especially that it has so many good reviews and that's why I was worried of watching \"Another Round\" because I felt like it would be the same but I was wrong. \n\"Another Round\" had so many conversations that were long but they were so fun not like \"The Hunt\", all the conversations were boring and cold, for example in \"Another Round'' the scene that all of them were having dinner and that's when we started to know the story of the movie and where the movie is taking us, the movie started off with happiness and with so much energy but as we were going towards the movie it started to go down little by little and slowly and that's what I loved about it. The movie makes you wonder what will happen at the end and what their lives will be in the end and that's a thing that made me want to watch and enjoy the movie, the film made us happy and sad and happy and sad again all the time. \n\nThe set design was beautiful, the camera angles were able to capture the beauty of the set design and that's not a new thing to a Thomas Vinterberg film and maybe that might be the main reason why this movie remained me of \"The Hunt\". Martin's apartment, the school, and the dinner table with the amazing designs of the cups and glasses. \nThe custom designs were pretty okay, they were matching the environment very well.\n\nFinally, the music was brilliant and a great choice, especially that song at the very end when Martin was dancing around, such a great scene and a nice ending to a nice movie.\n\nSo glad that I was able to be one of the first people to watch & review \"Another Round\", great movie, and highly recommend it.\n\nMy rating is: 8/10",

It also features my favorite ending of the year and an original song that is undeniably catchy and one that I hope gets Oscar recognition.                                \n\nEdit: Upon rewatch I truly can't find anything wrong with this film.

His classes are boring, his family life is boring, with a wife who works nights and is becoming more estranged, and two teenage sons who are off doing their own thing. He and three other teachers decide to test a theory that blood alcohol content should always be at least .05 with no drinking after 8 pm or on the weekends. Their goal is to see if it improves their professional and social lives. The test starts off well enough, and the film explores how it affects all of them, particularly Martin. I liked this film mostly for Mikkelsen's performance, which is amazing (all of the performances are very solid, though). Drunk and sober, he conveys an underlying sadness and emptiness that is in every facial expression and in his eyes. There are also some incredibly touching scenes. There is the one with Tommy (the Coach) and the little boy who gets picked on by the other footballers; Peter, the music teacher, who coaches a hyper-nervous student through his exam question on Kierkegaard; and several scenes with Martin and his family as they draw closer and then become exasperated with Martin. The acting, and the story, are great. I struggled, as someone who has had personal and direct experience with the ravaging effects of alcoholism, with what sometimes felt like a positive spin put on drinking. But I know that the drinking culture is different here, and the film in its own way even provides commentary on it. Overall, though, I loved the film. There are two films this year for which I will always remember the final scenes that are even perhaps the best in my recent memory: Another Round and The Sound of Metal. Big thumbs up from me. This film is Denmark's submission for Best International Film for the 2021 Academic Awards; my prediction is that this one will make the final cut.",

I’m not super familiar with his other films other than knowing they’re critically praised. So this was basically my first Vinterberg film. I gotta say I’m really impressed. Another Round is a fun and dramatic film that goes to places you wouldn’t expect. Leading the film, Mads Mikkelsen gives us a great performance. I really enjoyed his character and what he’s going through. The same for the other three. They’re all doing this experiment for some fun but they have issues to deal with already. The constant drinking is only adding up to it. The most intriguing part was seeing what consequences would arise amidst all the fun. The comedy lands well and I chuckled a few times. But the drama behind it all exceeded my expectations. The last act had me itching to see what would come up next. Thomas Vinterberg is a great director. Just by watching this film, I am really interested in his other works. He has a refreshing sort of approach but reminds us of what we have to deal with by having a little fun, even if it’s illegal. The beginning didn’t quite hook me in. I thought by that I would just feel like it would just be good rather than the raving reviews. After a while, it really starts to pick up and I didn’t want to stop. The portrayal of this growing alcoholism is good. They didn’t pose it as a good or bad thing. Rather it’s a neutral view of what it’s like and how it affects people differently. Each of the characters have a different reaction. I’m glad there’s variation and not just them getting flat out drunk the whole time. And the way the film concludes is a great ending. I don’t want to spoil but it just really works. There’s not much to digest and analyze. All that needs to be said is Another Round is a great film and another showcasing the best of 2020. ",

It's even better to say that he's delivered another outstanding piece of work that's also among this years best films. The premise is fairly straightforward in four grown men deciding to drink every day and keep a certain amount of alcohol in their system as they go about their daily lives dealing with their jobs and families. It even brings some enthusiastic and hilarious results. However, when the stakes are raised, the true nature and dangers of excessive alcohol consumption are exposed and Vinterberg's not shy in challenging the darker side. It's an evenly balanced film, though, with marvellous performances that showcase the characters' humanity and vulnerability. Another winner from Vinterberg, Mikkelsen and co.",

I had teachers like this, who met and socialised out with school. We decided, as seniors , to visit their watering hole. Their responses generally formed around the fact, as they saw it, that the disinterested amongst their classes switched them off so everyone suffered as a result. The ones who wanted to learn ( us ) were treated with more respect after that and the ones who didn't want to learn..... This movie resonated very deeply. The movie involves copious amounts of alcohol, hence the hypocrisy previously mentioned. Struck a cord with me.",

The film strikes a very unique tone. It has comedic and dramatic tendencies but blends them in ways that make it stand out from other films. The film portrays alcoholism in different ways than most films do. It doesn’t glorify alcohol, but doesn’t demonize it. Not everything in the film worked as well as it should but a lot of it did. Overall, this was great. This is a very interesting film that I highly recommend checking out. ",

            "content": "Danish maverick Thomas Vinterberg's intriguing and daring drama, reuniting him with previous collaborators Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Bo Larsen, takes a hard and sobering (pun intended) look at men's, and it's predominantly a male perspective here, relationship with alcohol. Four burnt-out and morose-looking high school teachers embark on an experiment based on Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skårderud's obscure/misunderstood supposition that humans should maintain a constant alcohol level of 0,05% in their blood stream in order to function better; and so begins an increasingly drunken escapade that sees them day-drinking during school hours. Most writers will set the quartet up for a moralistic downfall, but Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm's screenplay is refreshingly non-judgmental and free from moralizing. Instead, the boozing here leads to a renewed spark (superficially) in their classes and even fantastically inspires and helps a few students along the way. However, that's not to say it doesn't explore the consequences of their actions and the messy price they pay as their behaviour spirals. What the film is interested in investigating is how alcohol exacerbates other physical and psychological issues such as masculinity, mid-life crisis and other things that make us turn to alcohol. A gamed cast plays drunk convincingly (or maybe they really are hammered?) and Mikkelsen's toned-down, naturalistic performance as a lost soul is a million miles away from Hannibal Lecter or Le Chiffre. Oscillating between funny and sad moments dextrously, the film's almost 2h duration flies by like a boozy night out with your mates, though, Mikkelsen's majestic jazz-ballet dance that reminds me of the ending of Beau Travail aside, it's arguable that the ending is over-sympathetic to the central characters, considering the seemingly neat resolutions we're given and the perhaps provocatively permissive non-conclusion that (binge) drinking is simply here to stay.",
