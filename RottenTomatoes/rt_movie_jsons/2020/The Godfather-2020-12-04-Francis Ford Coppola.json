            "content": "I love the Godfather movies ever since my father first introduced them to me at ripe age of 10.  The 3rd film however, had always been an outlier I've told most to skip.  It felt unnecessary.  The original cut was confusing and horrendously paced.  Every issue it had was more or less resolved in Godfather Coda (except Sofia Coppolas horrendous acting).  It is still the weakest entry of the series, but Godfather Coda ends the story of Michael Corleone with the glorious finale many of us hoped for but were robbed of in the original cut",

            "content": "\"The Godfather part 3 , CODA . The death of Michael Corleone.\" is the final chapter in cinema's greatest Mob movie franchise. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo move the story into the 1970's with the head of the Corleone family, Michael, trying to become a respectable businessman. By bailing out the Vatican's cash strapped bank while receiving controlling shares in the Vatican's business enterprises Michael hopes to leave his Mobster past behind him. Unfortunately his past won't let go and old connections want a piece of the action. What is really clever in the fictional film is the inclusion of two real events, the murder of the Vatican banker Roberto Calvi and the death of Pope John Paul 1 in 1978.\n\nThe film is a good finale to the series well shot and featuring  a beautiful music score \u00a0which reprises the Godfather theme and music from the first two films. It is a continuation from previous films events and unlike more recent sequel films doesn't pander to the fans with obvious \"remember when we did this moments\". There are a few flash backs and some imagery from earlier films but it is in context to the story telling and not elbowed in just for fan bait. Despite the questionable love interest between first cousins, the story focusses\u00a0on Michaels emotional and spiritual journey that finally concludes on the steps of the Opera House in Palermo. A fitting and fulfilling conclusion to The Godfather film series.",

            "content": "I just watched THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE, and am profoundly disappointed.\nMind you, I'm one of the few who truly loved GODFATHER III when it was released on Xmas 1990. It's hard to describe just how anticipated the film was back then, and how widely debated it was among critics and fans at the time. The film had some glowing reviews, as well as absolutely damning. But even the film's champions agreed that it was easily the least of the trilogy. \nThen again, what other films within the last 30 years could possibly match the status of either GODFATHER I or II? If pressed, I might suggest SCHINDLER'S LIST or CHILDREN OF MEN\u2026but even those incredible films can't quite compare to the social impact or iconic status Coppola's first two mob epics had. They captivated America. \nIn the 30 years since GODFATHER III's release, time has not been kind to the film, as its reputation seems to have diminished exponentially with each passing year. My feelings are that he film has some glaring flaws, but on the whole, I found it to be emotionally powerful, and felt it was a generally worthy ending to the series. It doesn't match the greatness of its predecessors, but it had moments of greatness \u2013 and brilliance. Think of it as a shiny gold Cadillac, but with a few unsightly scratches.\nAnd now we have \"CODA\" -- a new cut that apparently satisfied Coppola's post-partum creative tinkerings. Some scenes have been shifted around, while others trimmed or omitted altogether. These might help to move things along at a somewhat faster pace, and arguably give more focus. In one or two instances, the minor trimmings make sense\u2026but all too often the new cuts are awkwardly done. And in one case, devastatingly so. (More on that later.)\nLet me come out and say it: \"CODA\" does not improve \"III\", nor does it offer anything new. Those who understandably took issue with Sofia Coppola's acting won't find any alternate takes or redubbed lines that improve her performance. Nor have the film's most awkward and clumsily written scenes been modified. Coppola's edits have, instead, merely reworked a lot of the things that were already there. At best, the changes work and are understandable. At worst, they destroy the movie.\nAnd so come my greatest caveat: the re-edit of the film's ending. (SPOILERS) That Michael Corleone's final moment of death has been excised is not so much a problem, though it's followed by a rather convoluted title card that is completely unnecessary. The unforgivable sin here is the garish cut made to the beautiful montage leading up to the reveal of Michael as an old man. After Mary's death in the original \"III\", we see flashbacks \u2013 of Michael dancing with Mary, then with his first wife Apollonia, and then with his second wife Kay \u2013 all beautifully intercut to the music beats of the INTERMEZZO. Whereas in \"CODA\", both the montage and music are trimmed, leaving us with a sloppy, abrupt edit that robs the entire ending of its emotional power.\nNo doubt a number of people will watch \"CODA\", but it will not convert any of the original film's (many) detractors. If anything, \"CODA\" should be viewed as a mere curiosity, or academic supplement, to \"III\". At best, I hope it rekindles interest in the film's previous extended cut, and have people realize that it was, warts and all, a pretty damn good film to start with.",

In fact I like it better then Godfather ll, blasphemy I know.  To be fair I'm not confused it's a better movie, it's not, I just like it better.  Anyway the Coda.  The two significant changes are the beginning and the ending.  I like both changes.  The beginning tightens things up by skipping the church scene and the Fredo flashback.  Ironically the absence of the  flashback and the new ending do exactly opposite things.  The absent flashback removes emphasis and the new ending adds it.  I like the new more subtler beginning.  Anyone who forgot Fredo just wasn't  paying attention.  I like the new, more stylish ending but I would argue that anyone who thought Michael didn't live a long lonely life before dying alone was also not paying attention.  So does it make Godfather lll better?  I suspect it will make zero difference to anyones overall opinion of the film but it feels a little more in line with the whole sprawling enterprise that is the Godfather saga.  It is the version I will choose to introduce my children too.",

And even if they did all that, there would be people up in arms, disgracing the late robert duvall who told them to take a hike over the pay, and winona bowing out to go play make believe with Johnny, maybe it still wouldn't have been as good. Overall the character just like the fate of any movie after a part 1 and 2 would become what it became, it's there now for all time.

            "content": "A lot of people say that it's not fair to compare Godfather III to its predecessors, which makes no sense at all, since it's a Godfather film. Weighing it relative to other Godfather films is absolutely fair and appropriate; if Part II sucked, would they have said it isn't fair to compare it to Godfather? I don't care for this precursor defense mechanism, this attempt to soften expectations \u2013 \u2018I haven't worked out in months, it'll be a miracle if I can lift this'\u2026 then don't try, jackass. Commit to what you're going for, do it. Unfortunately, neither Paramount nor Francis Ford Coppola seemed committed to anything besides releasing a product that just barely resembled what audiences knew as their favorite crime family. Thus, it is an absolute necessity to see this as the third part of a mechanism in relation to it's greater whole, and what effect it has on the full structure. For all the frivolous mistakes made by a studio, it is not the job of the reviewer to be sympathetic and understanding, but to call them out on bad decisions. I'm not reviewing a student's first crack at making a movie; this is the third part of a well-oiled, successful mega franchise, and it deserves to be scrutinized as such.\n\nThe first thing some people get wrong when being easy on Godfather III is understanding that Coppola wasn't given enough time. While that isn't entirely his fault, except for the fact that he took the job, it is still the studio presenting this picture, and they deserve all the condemnation in the world for expecting a film to be written, cast, designed, produced, directed, edited, and delivered in a single year's time. We can't just say, \"for what they had, they gave it their best effort.\" It's the fucking Godfather, there's no fucking E for effort. The audience isn't giving the production team a pat on the back for a simple day's work, they are waiting for the final leg of a story they've invested their lives in. As a result of not having the time to iron, contrived kinks are left rumpled, leading to embarrassing, often cartoonish moments. The assassins have a costume/weapons closet ready for any available situation \u2013 Mission Impossible? There's a lucky run-in Don Tommasino has with the assassin \u2013 why is the assassin already in his costume days before his hit? Michael romancing Kay for old time sake \u2013 cringe. The pope has a tray of orange juice and chocolate ready as soon as Michael requests it for his diabetes attack, because everybody has those two things conveniently sitting on a tray nearby when a random event like this occurs. Also convenient is the ringing of a bell each time Michael confesses a sin to him (insert laugh face). It really gets brutal with the infamous Vincent Corleone, who receives a caricature christening as godfather, then echoes previous death montage voice-overs Michael used to deliver with the goofiest voice. I can just hear George Lucas nearby influencing Coppola, \"everything should rhyme with the previous movies, each stanza \u2013 it's poetry.\" And then there's the top dog, the biggest Don in the world - Luchessi - who stupidly allows his enemy to whisper something in his ear so he can be stabbed by a pair of glasses in the neck!! No, you didn't read that wrong: glasses. All of this is a result of an artist who doesn't have the time he needs, making quick, thoughtless solutions on the go to merely get the job done. \n\nA film without gravity brings me to the surface, and I start asking, why are we watching this? Something is quickly off, and I realize I'm stuck disengaged for an exhausting three hours. When we watch The Godfather with provenience, we appreciate it as an opening to 1970s cinema and relish in the realistic effects of its time. But by 1990, we aren't shocked by this base violence anymore. Coppola is on one end of the spectrum playing violence as classical melodrama, but Martin Scorsese is on the other end experimenting with a novel approach that would dominate the 90s: dark comedy. GoodFellas opened a new wave of violence that would inspire the likes of Quentin Tarantino, P.T. Anderson, and the Coen Brothers as they set out to explore submissive laughter to human brutality. Gone was the shock of a dramatic violent hit, which is perhaps all Paramount understood about any Godfather film in the first place. The silliest death is Eli Wallach, who not only is surrounded by opera, but by an extremely emotional Connie \u2013 why? Like previous films, the climactic death montage has loud music playing over it, but this time it's louder, ostentatiously hiding the embarrassment of poorly staged hits. \n\nBut let's get to the meat of it: characterization. Many have rightly claimed that this simply isn't Michael Corleone. Coppola would defend that this is a changed Corleone, someone who has aged and realized the error of his ways and yada yada. What exactly led to this change? Mary and Anthony seem like perfectly fine, normal young people; they aren't the kids of a vicious mob boss. But they were of age to witness all of Michael's crimes, most especially Freddo's murder. The offspring are an opportunity to characterize the patriarch in the way Vito's characterized him, and this is the first thing that's off. Vito's kids were complicated, especially conflicted young Michael. Mary is a coddled Italian girl who, at best, would be associated with the mob by heritage. Anthony is not even Italian; he's a complete joke and not at all derived from the actor who played him previously. His soft, whiny, stale approach to the character, and Mary's horrendous performance by Sofia Coppola, already detract any character development. The only thing that seemed to give Michael any of his status was Kay, who \"dreads\" him and starts off with a good performance by Diane Keaton, before thrust into fruitless rekindling. Then there's the problem of Michael himself, played by a tonally different Al Pacino. Not only is he taking on this mentor role, like he's an AA sponsor or something, but he's doing it in a way that makes the character unrecognizable. Michael plays for sympathy, becoming a protagonist who has lost all trace of cold, calculating behavior, which the audience has no reason to believe should suddenly disappear. To further this, he seems to be a devout Catholic, which the movie itself plays along with as though we're all Catholics bowing our heads in faith. The first two were existential, but now we're believers in the church reclaiming our good name by ridding the bad guys. Kay thinks he's just using it for status, which is a great angle that should be explored with his faith teetering. Instead, Michael is trying to save the good, honest, spiritual pope from the bad guys. Not one aspect of this character convincingly picks up from a man who killed his brother, thus nullifying the film entirely as an accurate chapter in the story. It should be de-canonized because of this. A movie that challenges Michael's faith, hiding behind it at such expense as to buy his way into the Vatican, that's the movie we needed to see. Coppola wanted to emphasize that more in the new cut, but there was never a payoff to this setup. \n\nI'm very sad to see that critics fell for Paramount's attempt at reclaiming the name of Godfather III so the franchise could at last stand as one of the great movie trilogies of all-time. They all drank the Kool-Aid of its campaign, recklessly altering history. This is hardly a new cut, and it makes no improvements where opportunities arose. There's still all the cringeworthy \u2018love' scenes between Mary and Vincent, as well as Kay and Michael in Sicily. There's still Andrew Hagen, who pops in and out pointlessly to merely represent the Hagen name. There's still all the lingering around so we can pretend this is some nostalgia experience. All the moments occur exactly as we remember them. All the pointless cameos of smaller characters we don't remember are there. Even the same ending is intact, despite being told otherwise, fading out a few seconds sooner, negating the title Death of Michael Corleone \u2013 wink, joke's on us. So, officially, Michael could still be alive, setting up a potential Godfather IV \u2013 how convenient. There's even this cheap title card to close the picture, something totally uninspiring about how Sicilians never forget or forgive; it looks quickly thrown in from an iPhone, and further dehumanizes the whole piece. \n\nBefore closing, I want to make some honorable mentions. 1) Al Neri pets his gun as if he kills for fetish, which is not Al Neri at all. 2) There is yet another pointless character who makes a donkey sound and serves no purpose besides honking when Mary is killed, which couldn't have been a necessary distraction since the assassin was already in position. 3) There is one aspect of this movie that does work, though completely unintentional: it's pretty funny. For a series that struggles with humor, there are moments of uproarious laughter, despite that we are laughing at it. Green Sofia Coppola is so Razzie-worthy that it plays off professional Andy Garcia like gold. Garcia is anxious to show he has acting chops, playing through pantomime motions off of a complete dark cloud. While his performance is far from good, it is only worsened by his attempt to show any serious emotion towards the marionette doll puppeteered by her father \u2013 hey, isn't that the first film's logo?! Hm. Our distaste at Garcia's bad acting is vindicated by the moment Michael tells him to shutup, which gets a good laugh.\n\nPeople love to say, \"it's good for what it is.\" Sure, I applaud my high school efforts too. But I must reiterate: this is the fucking Godfather! Which directly negates that statement entirely; it's The Godfather, that's WHAT IT IS, and it's certainly not at all good for it.",

            "content": "Coda is nearly the same film as the theatrical cut, so I'll give it the same review.\n\nThe Godfather tragedy is completed in this final part.\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola may have only done this third and final part to The Godfather Trilogy for money, but he crafts a solid story with highly imaginative cinematography all the same. Many twists and turning points are telegraphed beforehand with another excellent script from famed writer Mario Puzo.\n\nNotably, actor Al Pacino delivers a highly compelling performance as the aging Godfather figure Michael Corleone. He expresses remorse, rage, and ingenuity even in his advanced years. Pacino's gives you the calm and control focused Michael, while also emoting a sorrowful regret in his acting. It is certainly a respectable farewell to his iconic character Michael Corleone.\n\nFurthermore, the supporting cast is fairly fun and filled with familiar faces. Talia Shire is sublime as Connie Corleone. She gets more screen time than the previous two films, and I appreciate it. Shire nails Connie's loyal and manipulative role. Eli Wallach plays a treacherous old Don with a clear glee that is infectious. Diane Keaton reprises her role as Kay with a sincere attitude of uncertainty as to her forgiveness of Michael's crimes. It is a decent cast with some other minor lackluster performances. However, Shire, Wallach, and Keaton will keep you engaged alongside Pacino.\n\nSimilarly, Andy Garcia gives an earnest shot as Sonny's son Vincent. Garcia is clever in his outing as he starts out portraying Vinny as an uncontrollable hothead. He then morphs into the more serious Vincent Corleone to take over as the new Godfather. It is too bad that his character is weighed down with an awkward incest subplot that is so distracting.\n\nHerein lies the problem with The Godfather Part III: Sofia Coppola. She plays Michael's daughter Mary Corleone with a deadpan expression the entire time. Her line delivery is so flat and disinterested. Even with a solid script and competent direction, Sofia's acting is thoroughly underwhelming. Well I do not think she ruins the movie, she is obvious ill suited for the role. \n\nOn the other hand, Sofia is gorgeous and looks like she could be Pacino's daughter, but unfortunately she cannot act. The saving grace of Sofia's career as an actress being cut short is that we later get her brilliant films that she directs. Sofia Coppola is truly her father's daughter as she eventually goes on to mature into one of the finest directors in Hollywood. She actually directed some of my favorite films with The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette, and The Beguiled.\n\nAt least Carmine Coppola's score is absolutely stunning. He manages to capture the enchanting atmosphere of the original two movies with his lovely compositions. The Italian music playing throughout The Godfather Part III is quite pretty and nicely fitted to the tone of each scene.\n\nAnother weakness is the pacing of the movie. Although The Godfather Part III is by far the shortest of the trilogy it feels the longest thanks to its slow pace. The edits linger too long on many shots, making you notice the film's imperfections all the more obvious.\n\nIn short, Francis Ford Coppola adequately completed his legendary crime trilogy with this satisfying, if flawed film. I found it a bit long, but well worth the wait. While the acting is a mixed bag, you are entertained by a majority of the cast. The music is so sweet and will keep you entranced all the way to the credits. The Godfather Part III is worth a watch to finish out this series.",

The dialogue is weak and forced. The acting is mostly flat, except for a fine performance by Andy Garcia as Sonny\u2019s son. Michael\u2019s \u201clove\u201d for Kay is absurd - remember she \u201ckilled\u201d his son. And she hated him and everything he stood for in Part ll, but now loves him? Michael is one of the most cold blooded killers in screen history, yet he becomes weak and pathetic. Connie goes from a floozy to ordering hits? Sorry, this didn\u2019t work for me on any level,",

Sofia, who went on to become a distinguished film director, really got clobbered by critics and audience  for her amateurish acting performance (which is still manifest in the revised movie), and it was very thoughtless of her father to have put her through it. \"Godfather I\" was a great movie, and \"Godfather II\" a masterpiece.
