    "summary": "During a series of adrenaline-fueled one-night gigs, itinerant punk-metal drummer Ruben (Riz Ahmed) begins to experience intermittent hearing loss. When a specialist tells him his condition will rapidly worsen, he thinks his music career \u2014 and with it his life \u2014 is over. His bandmate and girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) checks the recovering heroin addict into a secluded sober house for the deaf in hopes it will prevent a relapse and help him learn to adapt to his new situation. But after being welcomed into a community that accepts him just as he is, Ruben has to choose between his equilibrium and the drive to reclaim the life he once knew. Utilizing startling, innovative sound design techniques, director Darius Marder takes audiences inside Ruben\u2019s experience to vividly recreate his journey into a rarely examined world.",

            "content": "Another film in competition for the Oscars 2021 with a great theme, but rather poorly realized, by an author completely unknown to me, Darius Marder.\n\nFirst of all, let's clear up a few untruths that are presented in the movie, namely, most medical insurances, even in the US, cover operations in cases of hearing loss. Then, the implant placement operation is always performed first on one side, never on both at the same time. And most importantly, couples in such situations are most often encouraged to go through together e.g. learning sign language, and not being forbidden to do so for some mysterious reason.\n\nOn the other hand, criticism of the plot, according to which it is illogical for the main actor Riz Ahmed to continue making noise immediately after receiving the diagnosis (a couple of months of rehearsal is not enough to call even the most talented actors drummers), really doesn't stand, because it is natural for each of us, and especially the character as presented in the film, to need time to accept and face the new facts in our lives. It is these moments that are, in my humble opinion, the greatest value of the story. Unfortunately, the film did not go any further than that, and that is also the biggest complaint, because it has obviously long ago become a trend to shoot stories without any messages and conclusions.\n\nThe biggest praise goes for the supporting female role of Olivia Cooke, who, in addition to inspiring acting, allegedly performed all the music scenes live on her own.\n\nIn any case, the film deserves a passing grade, unlike some other nominated works, which did not manage to come up with the topics they set out to do. Sometimes it is better no ending at all, than one indulging in the mere commercial taste of the audience, with an extremely illogical plot and maximally stereotypical male characters, using \"subverted expectations\", as in the so-called revenge-feminist \"Promising Young Woman\", which is also in competition. We will see who will do better at the awards ceremony in April.",

            "content": "Movies about losing one of the key senses related to the art form intrigue me. Most commonly, from \"City Lights\" (1931) to \"Bird Box\" (2018) or \"The Invisible Man\" (1933 and 2020, among other adaptations), it seems at least, that sense is sight, as motion pictures are primarily a visual medium, but they've hardly ever been entirely silent--not even silent films were silent, accompanied as they tended and tend to be by musical accompaniment and occasional sound effects or live narration. I've been tagging such use of \"sight-analogy\" on Letterboxd, it's such a frequent reflexive device. All the better, then, when art is featured in the picture. In the case of \"Sound of Metal,\" the art is heavy metal music (hence the title, which also takes on something of a double meaning when the protagonist later drums with his palms on a metal slide in a key scene that a deaf child feels, or listens, to). Similarly, this music is not entirely audial, as there is an unmistakable look to the rock scene. Shown stereotypical pictures of how one dresses--what sort of tattoos or blonde highlights, e.g.--one might do well at guessing what sort of music they prefer. Nevertheless, \"Sound of Metal\" is about a drummer who loses his hearing and at least partly because of playing music. The consequence of which is to focus one's senses on the distinctive qualities of the art, whether music or, by extension, cinema.\n\nIt helps that it's well acted, led by a standout performance from Riz Ahmed and a good supporting cast headed by Olivia Cooke, and well dramatized--even the drug addiction and scratching works--which makes for a nice conflation that the movie isn't just about what's important to art but also what's important in life--there being considerable crossover of both. If this doesn't get an acting Oscar nomination, it better at least get something for the sound. Few films feature such an acoustic focal point. \"The Conversation\" (1974) is an obvious exception, but not to compare this to what's probably the greatest exploration of sound design in film history, it should be indication enough of how good \"Sound of Metal\" is that the comparison even comes to mind. Featuring deaf characters, including some real-life deaf actors, draws attention to the picture's sound design, as well as to the image when the picture becomes silent as well. In general, I especially appreciate the shifts here between subjective and objective camera positions and the accompanying varying degrees of silence and sound and of seeing. The last silent scene is perfect. I don't think a better ending could've been made.",

Unsurprisingly, Riz Ahmed as our protag, Ruben Stone, is incredible and, again, #2 performance of the year only behind Delroy Lindo in Da 5 Bloods \u2014 Elisabeth Moss is also up there for her performance in The Invisible Man. What is surprising is that Darius Marder made his directorial debut with this thought-provoking, touching, and entertaining film. Stone is \u00bd of the punk-rock duo, Blackgammon, the other half being his girlfriend, Lou (Olivia Cooke). Ruben \u2014 with the punk adage \"Please Kill Me\" tattooed across his chest \u2014 is a drummer who suddenly loses 90\u201399% of his hearing. If this wasn't enough, Ruben is a recovering addict, 4 years without using, and therefore needs \u2014 to his chagrin \u2014 not only a deaf-living house but sober-living, too. Marder uses sound in a way I've never experienced before \u2014 maybe because it's never been done(?) \u2014 to portray Ruben's disability. There was a moment when I thought the entire movie might've been conducted in this manner, which would've made a powerful point, but definitely would've been difficult to complete, but instead switches between regular hearing and the hearing-impaired. The direction and acting also beautifully showcases the frustrations of not being able to communicate. If there's one shot to stick with you, it's when all of the deaf school-children are resting on the grand-piano, Ruben right there with them. This movie is still new, so I'll spare more details, but the last three scenes, upon reflection, is one of the best sequences I've had the pleasure of viewing for a long time. There weren't many must-watches from 2020, but this is absolutely one of them.",

He is an ex heroinist and lives with his girl and band member in his RV. They do gigs, but are never a big band. When he suddenly loses his hearing things naturally change. His career is no longer something to chase and he does not have much else. He gets into some sort of home. Kids and grown ups. Some earlier addicts, all of them are hearing impaired. He hats it at first, but likes it after a while. He still want's his surgery to make him hear again, but that's very expensive. His girl is someplace else and for some reason cell phones are prohibited from the home he stays as so there is not much contact between the two. \n\nThings are constantly happening here, mostly into something better. It has great sound, it looks good and it has a very great pace. It's never flat - but rarely big or really hitting you hard.

It is full of engaging sensory experiences even though it is a film about the experience of losing a major sensory input.

Sure, I would not begrudge Chadwick Boseman for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, but Riz Ahmed I think will be the underdog, and this deserves the plaudits. Riz Ahmed has been a wonderful presence in the filmic world for a while now, the first time I saw him he was terrific in Chris Morris' sobering Four Lions (2010) but this is him at the peak of his powers. Playing a drummer in a thrash metal sludge band, he begins to lose his hearing, in scenes that are truly terrifying, and brilliantly capture the initially horrifying prospect of losing ones hearing. Sublimely supported by small cast, most notably an excellent Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci, Ahmed's Ruben must overcome his inceptive doubts about joining a small deaf community (led by Raci's Joe) to come to terms with his hearing loss. Ahmed is sensational, making you feel every emotion using every bone in his body. This is not a performance that steals the film, or indeed makes the film. The Sound Of Metal is absolutely brilliant on its own terms as well, and the final scene, without giving anything away, is utterly perfect.",

It had a great cast, Ahmed shines in his role as Ruben Stone, and Raci as well in his role of Joe. Ahmed in particular, was what made this movie what it is. While I don't think that the film itself necessarily deserves a 98%, I'd give Ahmed 5 stars on his performance as a recovering deaf heroin addict. He is so utterly convincing; he seems so desperately obsessed with not only the drug, but with the things that helped him off the drug, such as his girlfriend and their band. His utter commitment to finding a way to get the life he once had back illustrates an issue many recovering addicts deal with. It shows how he has only switched from one pill to another, and I thought that the scene where Ruben turns off the hearing aid and embraces the silence was riveting. I thought the screenplay, cinematography, and sound were all very good. I was blown away by what they did with the sound, actually. They really deserved the Oscar for that. The only thing that sort of bugged me about the film was the pace. It was really slow and that didn't really bug me as much as it has in other films but sometimes it just gets really annoying. Some parts confused me a bit, but ultimately I thought that it was very good. I was really unsure about how to score this film, but I went with the 4 because I think the max would probably be 4.5 and the minimum would be 3.5. On a side note, I'd also commend the film for not allowing the Amazon/Netflix signature cringe to dig into it.",

The film's innovative sound design further lights Ruben's experience, corrupting, completely fading out, or immediately reappearing with a chilling wide shot cut at Marders' cue. It's a keenly crafted character piece with jaw-dropping moments from minute one, and while the second act pulls into a slower, calmer burn that may drag in retrospect, the film's gut punch ending shines with a bittersweet empathy ranking among the best of the year.",

Wonderful, naturalistic performances, and some of the more creative cinematography on the roster. The best part of this movie was the sound design; similar to how The Father uses recasting and non-chronological editing to put you in the shoes of the main character, this film's sound design attempts to mimic the experience of losing your hearing. While it may or may not be an accurate portrayal of the physicality of it, I think they did a great job in conveying the emotional roller coaster and disorientation of being forced to experience the world around you in a new way. But not a best pic for me.",

With incredible performances, scripting grounded in realism, sensitive direction, and gripping sound design, 'Sound of Metal' tells a story that as many as 400,000 Americans each year may experience - the process of sudden hearing loss. Riz Ahmed's central performance as Ruben, a drummer who in an instant loses his hearing, is imbued with a deep emotional complexity that is complemented by innovative sound design - Ruben's panic, rage, despair, fear, and isolation are palpable as you watch him negotiate, and and eventually begin to grow in, his new reality of muffled silence. There are some scenes that make you want to reach through the TV and hug and comfort this man as his world falls apart around him, and again as he puts it back together. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci are well matched with Ahmed in their supporting roles, the former as Ruben's deeply committed yet troubled love interest, and the later as a leader of an organization that supports the deaf. This film gives voice to a community rarely seen in film, and gifts awareness and empathy to it's viewers. It is certainly one of the most affecting, intimate films of the year.",

It also seems rather silly that nobody explained the serious limitations of the implants before he had the surgery. I thought the ending was a bit bland as well since the film seemed to be setting things up for him to jump off a bridge or something. The acting was well done, but I wasn't a fan of any of the characters, and the focus was very much on the main character. The cinematography, visual effects, and soundtrack were well done.

I now it shows us the deaf community and how Rubert's life changes. But it was just so long and slow that you can't really follow after a moment. I did not also understand Lou.

            "content": "While hanging out with musician friends at shows I noticed that before playing, they all put in earplugs. I wondered why since I thought this would make it difficult for them to hear each other. This was very much not the case. If you've ever been to a loud concert, it is way, way louder on stage. So, the premise of Sound of Metal, about a working-class heavy metal drummer whose world is turned upside down by sudden and profound hearing loss, is frighteningly believable. Thankfully, my friends still have their hearing. \n\nThe path that Ruben, played by Riz Ahmed with one of the best performances of the year, finds himself on is abrupt and unexpected to put it mildly. Likewise, the film never quite goes where you expect, but you believe every moment and every emotion. I wasn't expecting Sound of Metal to receive 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, but I am very happy that it did because I cannot think of many movies from 2020 that I enjoyed more. \n\nFaced with the loss of his hearing, his livelihood, and potentially his relationship, Ruben also fears losing his four years of sobriety from heroin. In need of immediate and special help, his girlfriend and bandmate, Lou (Olivia Cooke), takes him to a sobriety house especially for the deaf. The house is run by Joe (Paul Raci), a deaf Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic who gives off the impression that his inner peace only came after a hard struggle. He takes Ruben under his wing but tells him that his program is about finding a solution to the problem in his mind, not his deafness. The scenes of Ruben at the deaf sober house and learning how to live without hearing are interesting and very engaging. Director Darius Marder's gentle approach to the characters and Ruben's journey gives us the feeling that we are getting a window into a real community with real people, not participating in a kind of cultural tourism.\n\nAs much as I admire the approach taken by Marder's direction and the screenplay he co-wrote with his brother Abraham, Sound of Metal works so well because of Riz Ahmed's performance. This is not a case of an actor showing off their talents by playing a character with a disability. Ahmed plays a full range of emotions but the real pathos comes from his facial expressions, especially his expressive eyes. Most important of all to the movie's success, he is not afraid to show big vulnerability on screen or show just how afraid and anxious someone in this situation would feel, especially if they were a musician.\n\nThough we see Ruben getting on well at the sober house and with the larger deaf community, he still wants to have cochlear implant surgery which he believes will allow him to return to his old life. This is at odds with Joe's belief that being deaf is not a handicap or something to be fixed and leads to one of the most compelling and affecting scenes of the movie; one that likely earned Ahmed and Raci their Oscar nominations. It is easily one of the best moments in any movie I saw over the last year. \n\nI will admit that I was hesitant to watch Sound of Metal at first, despite its positive reviews, because a movie about a young musician going deaf seems like a heavy or even depressing movie. However, Sound of Metal ends up being an uplifting film without delving into melodrama or smarmy sentiment. Every aspect of this movie is low-key, allowing every moment to feel genuine. This is not the kind of movie with twists but it does have unexpected narrative turns which are best left to be discovered along with Ruben. All of the unexpected places, both physical and emotional, the story takes us are what make it memorable. The empathy in the performances from Paul Raci, Olivia Cooke, Mathieu Amalric, and, most of all, Riz Ahmed are what make it so moving. Sound of Metal is something special: a film so seemingly simple but deeply affecting. It is a character study so well executed that it transcends its premise and puts us so in tune with the main character that its final moments become spiritual, or philosophical, depending on your inclination.",

His performance in this movie is so pure, and he is more than deserving of the Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Of the big four acting awards, I felt strongest about Daniel Kaluuya winning for Judas and The Black Messiah, but this movie changed my mind.\n\nWhile it's not technically a character, the sound editing and mixing feels like one. It adds depth and perception to the deaf/hearing-impaired experience. Every sound is so thoughtfully added as well as the inclusion and omission of subtitles. As a byproduct of focusing on the deaf/hearing-impaired experience, Sound of Metal must rely on visual and sonic cues over exposition. This \"show, don't tell\" approach helps make this movie as good as it is. \n\nCurrently, this ranks as one of the five best movies I've seen for 2020. My only gripe is that the pacing is a touch uneven, especially in the third act. Still, the final scene provides a poignant bow to the story.",

            "content": "This was my review in my ASL class.  First of all, this film as AMAZING!!  I absolutely LOVED it!  I had been planning to watch it but just hadn't gotten around to it.  I've been taking ASL through a local college, and this was on our list for extra credit.  I was on Prime back in February and decided to watch it.  I've been recommending it to everyone ever since!  I felt the film was very respectful of the deaf community, and it seems like everyone involved made a big effort to really work together to portray what it would be like to suddenly go deaf and how that and subsequent actions taken would affect not only your own beliefs in what your identity is but also how it would affect other people's lives and perception of you.  The film of course reinforced the fact that people in the Deaf community can do anything they decide to do.  One aspect I hadn't really given much thought to was treatment and halfway housing for deaf addicts.  We've talked about deaf people having access to skilled interpreters during things like doctor appointments in my classes, but addiction recovery wasn't something I had specifically thought about.  That creates another set of challenges, as addressing addictions usually involve a lot of anger, doubt and fear.  If you don't have someone you can easily talk to with sign language to help you through that, it would really create a barrier to recovery and moving forward in life as a recovering addict.  I've had family members and friends who have been addicts, primarily alcoholics, and trying to overcome it was hard enough without an additional barrier of not having a common language to express yourself and get the help you need.  \n\nI loved seeing the progression of Ruben's perception of himself and acceptance of being deaf changing.  I thought he portrayed the denial, fear and anger associated with the loss of hearing quite well.  I thought that was probably how I would react in many ways.  I was surprised he didn't seem to make any effort to discuss getting the cochlear implants with anyone at the halfway house...it was heartbreaking to watch him learn he couldn't stay there anymore and to see Joe's face after he got up to leave.  I was sad he and Lou had grown apart, but in a way I think it helped him finally and fully accept he is now a deaf person.   That last scene was pretty profound.  I think Ruben will perhaps find a way to help deaf children experience music and maybe form a deaf drumming group, perhaps one that incorporates addicts...giving back and helping others find a new creative outlet for themselves.  I hope he remains friends with Joe, Jenn and Shaheem.\n\nI read the interview with Riz, and I watched the panel discussion as well as another video related to The Sound of Metal.  It had Riz doing an actor on actor interview with Steven Yeun where they discuss the roles they played in this movie for Riz and in Minari for Steven (another excellent movie!)...discussing perceptions, roles, and stereotyping in society and in movies...the freedom/exhilaration of using a language besides English as a primary language for their respective movies...the labels that are put on us by society...code switching to fit in with the society around you but to be you at home/with friends & family.  It was illuminating and powerful...I have a lot of respect for both actors. \n\nI found the panel discussion to be very uplifting.  I loved hearing from everyone on the purpose behind the movie, how CJ and others reacted to the movie, how the actors felt about their roles, the preparation Riz and Olivia put into learning the instruments and for Riz learning ASL by immersion and wearing suppression devices to mimic losing his hearing.  Paul Raci was particularly impressive in his efforts to call out Hollywood for not casting more deaf actors and actresses in roles.  I also was happy to see different interpreters working with the panel.  I really hope this film is a stepping point for Chelsea & Shaheem to find more roles.  \n\nThe film was fantastic in and of itself, but then watching the additional videos and reading the interview just took everything to a whole new level and really elevated this movie even more.  I've shared the link to the movie, the videos and the interview on my FB page and by email/text with a lot of close friends.",

            "content": "The sharp, precise and smartly constructed manner in which Darius Marder's debut feature begins is rather remarkable. Not only does it tell us everything we need to know about Riz Ahmed's recovering addict/drummer Ruben and his girlfriend/vocalist, Olivia Cooke's Lou, but it plugs us right into Ruben's nightmarish experience as he becomes aware that his hearing has been reduced to a disorientating static buzz. Much has been talked about the film's inventive designs in sound mixing which manage the rare feat of actually propelling the narrative forward, and every word, and every award it's getting for them, is true and well-deserved. In an equally awards-worthy performance, Ahmed is expressive, vulnerable and raw, and you just can't help but fall hard for Ruben as he struggles to learn how to be deaf at a deaf community run by (now Oscar-nominated) Paul Raci's Joe. It's to the writers' credit that, despite the presence of addiction in the storyline, that it never goes for easy shots or the usual melodramatic tropes that you half expect to see along with a special appearance by Marlee Matlin (who's of course wonderful in her own right). In fact, the film's slow and singular drive towards an inner reconciliation for Ruben is both unexpected and so nicely orchestrated, I find myself emotionally drawn and drained watching this insightful and authentic drama tackling not just a rare subject-matter, but do so in this particular way; and it's 2hrs long but hardly feels it. The last shot may look like your run-of-the-mill elliptically abrupt indie-drama ending, but it's less about what happens next and more about how he finds peace within himself; and as far as the film's emotional arc is concerned, it finishes with Ruben arriving at exactly the right place he needs to be in his head.",

            "content": "\"Sound of Metal\" captures the essence of many forms of loss, and on so many levels that the end result is far more rich and complex than one might expect, even by the film's mid-point. Ruben (Riz Ahmed, Best Actor nominee, whom you might know from HBO's great limited series \"The Night Of . . . \"), a heavy metal drummer, discovers he's losing his hearing within the first minutes of the film during a concert performance with his girlfriend and fellow band member of their duo \"Blackgammon.\" And with that loss, sound itself becomes another character in the film as Ruben fights to save what he can of his rapidly crumbling life. With music suddenly no longer a viable career path, one would expect melodramatic, over the top wallowing in pathos, especially given that Ruben is also a recovering addict. And while there are the expected and understandable outbursts of angry frustation and agony, they are few and far between as Ruben tries to piece together who he is now, and who he can become without lapsing back into addiction. Throughout his journey, the film's sound track mirrors the type and level of Ruben's hearing loss, placing us IN his experience. Muted, muffled, empty, painful, and many points inbetween, \"Sound of Metal\" takes the use of sound in cinema further than we have previously known. Sure, we have had the soundtrack reflect the muffled ringing in a character's ears following an explosion before, but no one that I'm aware of has tried to replicate the experience of going deaf like this, making it a probable shoe-in for the Achievement in Sound Academy Award. This is NOT a film designed to elicit sympathy for the deaf through cheap tear-jerker shots, but uses the deafness to explore loss, as Ruben's life and world crumble around him leaving him empty and desperate to find a future for himself. The majority of the film takes place in a retreat for the deaf led by the wonderfully calm and wise performance by Paul Raci (Supporting Actor nominee) whose uncompromising approach to teaching how to live as a deaf person offers Ruben his best hope for a meaningful future. I can't really say much else without spoiling the film's final act, but the inclusion of the divisive issue of cochlear implants within the deaf community provides the lynchpin that yields the amazing conclusion to this film. Watch this film in a quiet place.",

I felt that the second half of the movie dragged a bit.  I don't really care about Lou. Ruben's learning to cope with deafness was much more interesting. I also feel like for a movie about deafness and sound, the sound design was sadly not very surprising. I think I wanted to see more experimental and creative use of sound design in the movie. I wish sound design could have taken the place of subtitles in the sign language scenes. Could the actors have been dubbed with sound, to allow the hearing audience to experience sign language?

Unlike movies of its kind, Metal does not hold you in a state of panic for the full length of the film but instead weaves you in and out following the ups and downs of Ruben (played by Riz Ahmed), the recovering addict who loses everything when he becomes deaf due to prolonged sound exposure as a heavy metal drummer.\n\nSomehow, as a woman who has never suffered from addiction or played an instrument in her life or who even enjoys loud music in the car, I was able to strongly identify with Ruben and feel  deep empathy for him even in his fictional existence. \n\nSound of Metal is a must watch.\n\nMore at: https://www.freepressfail.com/category/the-conservative-critic/",

It's by no means exceptional, but that doesn't take away anything from its value and efficiency that, in part, rendered this movie a truly immersive experience. It's Riz Ahmed's bravura performance, though, that gives Sound of Metal resonance that, in turn, made Ruben one of the most relatable movie characters I've witnessed in recent memory. \n\nHis ability to reflect his fluctuating feelings throughout the movie and how he perceives every phase in his new life is simply astonishing. The aching experience Ruben goes through demands a real acting talent to make the audience emotionally connected to the protagonist, but Ahmed proved he's not just a talented actor but also one who's in a total command of his craft. For if it's hard to make the viewer feel what his character feels, it's even harder to transport its mental state to the audience. Here, we don't only get the sense of loss and being stripped of everything that forms every inch of Ruben in a flicker, nor only do we only understand his pressing need to regain what he lost\u2014especially since the possibility hovering in the air\u2014but we see him grappling with the dilemma of whether he should continue his journey of adapting to his new condition as if it was the norm or he should keep clutching onto the flicker of hope that definitely wouldn't help in case of it turned out to be a mere mirage.\n\nFurthermore, the movie also excels in aspects other than its nuanced portrait of its main character, namely is its exploration of deaf community that truly offers new insights. That's mostly because of the effort shown in the meticulous attention to its essential components, most notably the sign language. However, Paul Raci played a major part in that by portraying the leader of this community and a mentor for Ruben. Through his facial expressions during conversations with Ruben, he delineates the professional duties such an occupation demands. We see him monitoring Ruben's progress and interfering according to his understanding of Ruben's character in particular. As for Olivia Cooke, she further proves she's a remarkable young talent that yet to bloom. Playing Ruben's bandmate and girlfriend Lou, she managed to prove how important she's to Ruben as his most great and precious loss and equally as a great help for him to get a better sense of what he has lost and how to cope with that.\n\nThe acting clinic these three immense talents put on here left an indelible impression on me, but disregarding the technical quality would make absolutely no sense. Besides the exquisite sound design, the highly-articulate cinematography truly adds up to the experience. If there's only one issue I have about this movie it would be its failure to maintain the same dramatic heft that was in its first half. As the focus on Ruben's progression through his medical recovery and its consequences slightly overpowered the emotional quality, and hence there was a bit of it lost that even the wrap-up failed to fully retrieve. \n\n(8.5/10)",

Hearing is such a fragile thing, and once it's gone, it's gone forever, so seeing the character of Ruben come to terms with that was incredible.\n\nAs for Riz Ahmed's performance, it was nothing short of extraordinary. You feel his initial anger and confusion, and as his character grows, you find comfort and peace in his silence. It's an emotional rollercoaster as his journey teaches us more about the deaf community and how to live without hearing.\n\nThe supporting cast all do a great job, especially Paul Raci as Joe. But the subplot with Ruben's girlfriend, Lou, did nothing for me. Their relationship was touching, and they have their moments, but I just didn't care for their love story/the tour subplot. I just thought that Ruben's personal journey of learning to live without hearing was more interesting when he was figuring it out on his own.\n\nI was actually blown away by the sound design, which is not something you usually hear in movies. (Pun intended.) Since hearing is such an important part of the film, they use it in so many creative ways. There are even long sections without any words ever being spoken, which made for a more immersive viewing experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie can run a little long at 2 hours. They could have probably shaved off like 20 minutes, mostly to do with the girlfriend/tour subplot. But with such an immersive sound design and an excellent performance from Riz Ahmed, this would have definitely made my Top 10 Movies of 2020 list.",

            "content": "As a drummer/percussionist with hearing loss of my own, this film hit me hard.  SOUND OF METAL, directed and co-written by Darius Marder, tells the story about heavy metal drummer Ruben (Riz Ahmed from ROGUE ONE, VENOM and the HBO miniseries \"The Night Of\"), touring in an RV with his girlfriend & singer/guitarist Lou (READY PLAYER ONE's Olivia Cooke).  One night he notices an abrupt hearing loss, and after a few days of devolving hearing Ruben goes to a doctor who tells him he's lost about 80% of his hearing in both ears.  Like nearly all hearing loss, the doctor tells Ruben his hearing can never be restored, and his best bet is to have an operation and get cochlear implants: devices surgically implanted that bypass the damaged ear canal(s) to deliver an electric/mechanized sensation that resembles what humans perceive as sound.  The doc tells Ruben this procedure is expensive ($40-80 thousand), and if you know ANYTHING about working drummers you know Ruben doesn't have that kind of money.\n\nAdding to his troubles, we learn that Ruben is a recovering drug addict: four years sober.  Lou becomes increasingly worried that Ruben will be unable to cope with this devastating news and will relapse.  She contacts his sobriety coach who is able to hook him up with half-way type situation for deaf recovering addicts.\n\nThe bulk of this film is Ruben both learning how to live with deafness (Joe, who runs the rural deaf recovery house, stresses that deafness is NOT a handicap, and instead is something that Rueben needs to learn to adjust to), while also learning how to adjust to a new \"him.\"  The direction is really well done: the situation isn't meant to feel like a super downer for Ruben (obviously the situation is, but the film doesn't dwell on it like some grand tragedy), and all of the performances are on point.  Ahmed's  drumming is done in a way to seem believable and to mask the fact that Ahmed is, well, an actor and not a drummer.  This is a minor point, of course, but if the movie is about a drummer the actor needs to be believable as a working drummer, and Ahmed, as well as the director and editor, accomplish that task.  Too often I get annoyed when movies about drummers feature actors who _barely_ look like they can convince non-drummers they're competent, let alone excelling (I'm looking at you THAT THING YOU DO, WHIPLASH, ROCKSTAR, and many others).  This is obviously my own (any likely other drummers) problem, but it should be commended that SOUND OF METAL does a good job of portraying Ruben as a good drummer through solid 'acting' by Ahbed and subtle (maybe not obvious to the laymen, but obvious to this dummer) editing and film shooting techniques.\n\nI've lost about 25-30% of my hearing in each ear myself; while I'm fortunate currently to be able to adjust with hearing aids, I have some sort of degenerative affliction that is getting worse, regardless of what I've done/will do to maintain 'safe' listening environments.  I don't gig anymore like I did as a teenager/young-20 something adult but I am music teacher constantly around bands and percussion ensembles.  I'd noticed my hearing devolving for probably at least 15 years before I _FINALLY_ did something about it: I waited until I had turned 40, thinking \"well - I guess 40 is kind of old so it's time to get a hearing aid like grandpa\" or something.  This adjustment has been difficult at times, but easily one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI say this only to underscore the difficulties Ruben has, going from a nightly-drumming professional musician to suddenly unable to hear a conversation from his girlfriend, let alone continue pursuing his passionate work.  Riz Ahmed does an INCREDIBLE job portraying this character & his hearing loss.  You can feel the confusion, pain, and frustration every step of the way.  Ahmed is a music performer in his own right, releasing several wrap albums over the last decade or so.  I'm sure he was able to draw on his own passions as a performer in order to portray the pains and frustrations of Rueben being unable to drum.\n\nBut, really, the sadness and frustration is mostly the first Act of SOUND OF METAL.  At the recovery house Joe hooks Ruben up with a class of children, where Ruben interacts with kids, becomes comfortable learning American Sign Language (ASL), and starts teaching the kids basic drumming.  Seeing Ruben start to come alive in his current situation is a legit joy!  When Ruben catches up with Lou, and sees she's pursing her own music passions elsewhere, Ruben decides to sell off his drums and recording equipment to have the cochlear implant surgery.\n\nThe film centers around Ruben trying to find himself instead of chasing what is in the past.  SOUND OF METAL has (inadvertently) become an incredible metaphor for living in the COVID/post-pandemic world.  Those who are still trying to live with the habits of January 2020 in January 2021 are going to be miserable: lamenting what we used to have and what we used to be able to do.  Myself, I've gone from producing award-winning percussion ensembles, and co-producing various types of HS bands (marching, concert, jazz) to moving to a mostly virtual world.  My family used to go to Disneyland regularly, and we haven't seen any family members in person since Christmas 2019.  Like Ruben, it's normal, understandable even, to want to be down that we're in month 10 of a nearly nationwide lock-down from our norms with no end in immediate sight.\n\nRueben gets the implant surgery, but he essentially has to leave the deaf addict recovery house.  Joe stated Ruben shouldn't try to reduce his deafness as a disability that needs to be overcome: he should instead embrace it and learn to adjust.  Ruben defies this ideology, gets the surgery, and then flies out to Europe to see Lou, now living with her wealthy father in Belgium.  But of course Ruben learns quickly that the cochlear implants do not supply \"sound\" the way his brain naturally interprets sound: they \"mimic\" human voice in a metallic, almost robotic voice and there is much distortion for moderate volume sound.  He listens to Lou perform a song, hearing massive distortion throughout, and Ahmed brilliantly captures the moment Ruben realizes \"he could never go back,\" so to speak.\n\nAnother technical aspect I have to give a shout-out to is the sound design.  Through merely sound the filmmakers do an incredible job of conveying the struggles Ruben is going through.  Portraying deafness can be difficult, as most of us are not stone-cold deaf, sitting in stark silence.  There is often some degree of distortion or white-noise (or tinnitus) when the film is portraying Ruben's point of listening, and later in the film after Ruben gets his implants activated, we get a sense for the 'metallic' and distorted (and still quite faint) sound Ruben is experiencing.  Often loud explosions and shootouts garner \"sound effects\" or \"sound effects editing\" Awards, but I think SOUND OF METAL (a clever pseudo-pun of a title, being both the style of music Ruben & Lou play as well as the types of sound Ruben hears with the implants) is deserving of recognition for its brilliant sound design and execution prorating hearing loss + life with cochlear implants.\n\nThe films ends just as the 'new' Ruben begins: when he realizes to let go of trying to hear the way he used to.  He unplugs his implants after hearing the distorted sound of church bells.  This is a great metaphor for what he ALL must do in a post-pandemic landscape.  We have to let go of how things used to be, and how we used to behave (for ex: I doubt I'll shake very many hands ever again) and embrace our \"new normal.\"  As an educator, I've had to learn all sorts of new technology and teaching tools that I plan on implementing into my curriculum for the foreseeable future: regardless of when I'll be able to teach in person to all my students at the same time.  Ruben looks to be on the path to happiness again when he embraces his \"new me,\" and only when we're ready to do the same can be begin our journey to contentment and real joy.",

There were a lot of feel-good moments in the first half of the film. The thought of not using any background score in most parts of the film but instead having natural sounds play out like the breathing of the actors and chirruping of birds was mind-blowing.

Director Darius Marder does a wonderful job putting the audience in Ruben's shoes while at the community. Immersing the audience into how it feels to not only be deaf, but being the newcomer in a foreign environment. Naturally, Ruben runs the gamut of emotions from frustration of not knowing sign language and being excluded from every activity upon his arrival, to isolation, anger, loneliness, and heartbreak. A gutting movie about self-reliance and self-sufficiency with strong performances all around. A shout out must also be given to Paul Raci, who plays Joe, the leader and mentor of Ruben at the deaf community. Definitely worth checking out on Amazon Prime.",

This is not just about heavy metal drummer Ruben (Riz) or deafness or addiction or his girlfriend -- his duo's singer, Lou, who more screams than sings. I almost quit the movie early on, as it was just loud noise. But it was just brilliant scene setting, suggesting there is too much noise for all of us and not just  aural noise. The noise did harm Ruben and made him deaf. And not just the heavy metal noise, but all the noise in his life, the heroin he kicked four years ago, the constant on-the-road in a big RV. He went from hearing to deaf in an instant. And a doc told him the hearing wasn't coming back, though a cochlear implant could bring back some hearing but was expensive. He opted to try a group home run by a deaf Vietnam vet, as Lou had to leave to let the program work. We find she grew up here after originating in Paris, as her parents split up not long after, and Mom took her to the states and Mom finally killed herself,  which apparently pissed Lou off enough to spend her nights in the tiny band, screaming at the top of her lungs, playing metal guitar loud as Ruben  played the drums loud, he also  pissed off, having been raised by a single mom and at some point gotten hooked on heroin. The vet who tries to get him to a quiet place, no noise, where he can be at peace with himself and therefore his god, cuts him loose from the program, where no one is seen as handicapped even though deaf, as Ruben opts to try to fix it with the implant, after selling all he has for the operation. He gets some hearing back, heads for Lou, now in Paris, and they agonizingly and in not so many words decide their relationship and indeed their lifestyle is over. At the end Riz decides to take off the implant, to remove the sound he gets from the metal appliance, and just sit in silence maybe for a long time. We all adapt as we age to literal hearing loss or hip malfunction or fighting heart or cancer ailments, some of which we contribute to  ourselves with our own noise. This asks the musical question: Can we adapt and live in peace with the way we are now? Maybe the best thing that happened to Riz, who should win awards for this, is going deaf. It made him take stock of his  angry, noisy life going nowhere, and find a more quiet, peaceful place to reside, in both his decision-making and behavior. The noisy lashing out in anger is no way to live. The deaf's saving grace may well be that they don't have to listen to all the literal and figurative noise out there.",

Its representation of the deaf community is both empathetic and enlightening, and proves that there should be more high-profile films that focus on its members. Riz Ahmed absolutely owns this role in what is possibly 2020's best performance, and is perfectly supported by Olivia Cooke (who is one of my favorite up-and-coming stars) and a phenomenal Paul Raci, who absolutely deserves every trophy he wins this year. The sound design is also some of the most innovative I've ever seen (or I guess heard) in a film, skillfully and authentically recreating the devastating experiences of hearing loss. The direction and screenplay are also spectacular, as both are very minimalist and low-key but ultimately impactful and universally relatable.

The movie's about a drummer that loses his hearing after forcing himself to perform too much, and gets to know the world differently as a deaf person as a result. Let's get the first things out of the way, the movie is really well made. I really enjoyed Marder's direction here, providing us with some really good visuals. The cinematography is good, and the tone of the movie is direct and straight to its point. The acting is indeed really great, Ahmed showing his range in here, as well as his sign language, drumming and american accent. What this movie really nails is the mixing and overall sound. Since they worked with actual deaf people on set, they knew how important it was to get this aspect right, and so they did. The moments of silence and the muffled sound when the camera closes on the protagonist feel so real and it really puts you in the position he's in, which is great in this type of film, and hands down my favorite aspect here. The plot though, is a little bit messy to begin with. We get little background on our characters here, apart from a brief backstory for some of them. Our main character's past is an enigma, hell, we don't even know how old he is. That's not a big issue here, since the point of the film is the matter at hand and that is losing his hearing. Towards the middle of the movie there's a time jump, suggested by a few shots of landscapes and skies. With that time jump we lose a pretty big chunk of character development for our protagonist, seeing him go from being rejective to Joe to being in complete harmony with everyone. I wish we could've seen how he got to the point where he started to fit in, it would have given some nice depth to Ruben. One of my favorite characters in this movie is Paul Raci's Joe. We get some background on him, and he is established as Ruben's guide to understandng his situation. Again, the fact that this film used real deaf people made this all the more believeable and enjoyable to watch. I did enjoy this movie, despite the slow pacing and some things that went unasnwered and unmentioned. I would say this is one of the better movies of 2020, with a really good message especially with the ending, which I really liked. Sound of Metal is a good watch, one I'd recommend to anyone who likes a good drama. But I doubt the rewatchability of this, and for more critical people, the aspects I've mentioned might take from the overall enjoyment of this movie.",

Suddenly he starts to lose his auditions, and the movie shows the struggle in his life to adapt to the situation and search for help, with the possibility of recovery with a cochlear implant surgery, but not having the money to do the surgery. All the stressful situation leads to a separation of the couple, with Lou continuing the gig and Rubin reluctantly agreeing to seek help in a deaf community to better learn to deal with the handicap.\n\nThe plot is intense on emotions, and shows in a realistic way the drama of losing the sense that was essential to Rubin - all the story revolves around this character, and especially from the middle to the end of the movie, the personal drama intensifies, even with the contemplative silence that occupies most of the film, or the sounds of the implant that he acquires later. The scenes that show the adaptation in the community(that uses deaf actors) is absolutely great.\n\nThe movie has Riz Ahmed as Ruben Stone (Rogue One, Nightcrwaler, The OA,The Night Of), Olivia Cooke as Lou Berger and Paul Raci as Joe (interesting that he had a deaf father in real life). Riz is just awesome on the paper, that involves showing the emotions, despair and anger to the silent parts of the individual learning, dealing and acceptance of the situation. Indeed something that deserves the prizes and indications for best male performer. The def community used deaf actors and that elevated the veracity of the story.\n\nThe cinematography by Dani\u00ebl Bouquet (Nothing persona, Kaubow) is pretty competente, taking a more realistic like approach, with a nervous camera, focusing very well on expressions and situations that are really important in the context. Another great detail is the sound department, with the sound of deafening sense and later with the implant sounds transmitting well the sense and situation of the protagonist that leads to such emotions that he feels. \n\nOverall a great drama, with an intriguing and engaging story, without the load of melodrama that depicts in a realistic way the situation and the study of the protagonist, with the help of an excellent performance and use of sound department on the production. A solid 7,5 out of 10.",

She's definitely got problems and then all the screaming during their live show. I'm sorry, but Lou looks so ridiculous with her bleached eyebrows lol. \n\nGod damn, it must feel terrifying to start losing your hearing all of a sudden. Especially if what you love doing in life and your career require it. Fucking brilliant how they used different effects and sounds to show what it would feel like to suddenly start losing your hearing. The frustration and anxiety one must feel, I can't imagine. \n\nWow, it's almost as if he's living in a completely different world now where the language everyone speaks is foreign to him. Real sweet seeing him adapt and accept his new life of being deaf and building a relationship with the kids. Kids can bring out the best in you. Holy shit, that was crazy how they just cut to him getting the implant surgery. Kind of sad to see how Lou moved on with her life and Ruben is still trying to hold on to what they had when they were touring and living in the RV. The deaf community place was his new home, that was his new world where he eventually learned to adapt and be happy. \n\nJeez, what a depressing song to sing for one's birthday. It's almost like she doesn't like singing the song but is forced to sing it. So sad when he tells Lou that it's ok. That was the official moment when they disbanded the band and went on with their lives. I'm glad he was able to find peace at the end. Now he can movie on with his life. Who knows what he'll do next. Will he go back to the deaf community or move on to unknown territory. My guess is he'll go back since what he was seeking the whole time was the familiar, what he already knew. He came to terms with his new life and accepted it for what it is. \n\nI already knew going in that this was going to be one of those hard-hitting dramas, and boy did it hit hard. This movie gave me anxiety. Smartly written and powerfully acted. All the nuances and subtleties definitely didn't go unnoticed. Beautiful character development. Very impressive how Riz actually learned not only the drums, but also sign language. Watching this movie, I couldn't help but feel thankful that I have my hearing and my sight and all other senses intact. We kind of take for granted these things and it's always nice to be reminded of how fortunate and lucky we are. Extremely sobering and definitely impactful movie. This movie's a bit too real for my taste though, so I don't think I'm watching it again.",

His use of sound brought to life the reality of someone like Ruben losing not only his sense of hearing, but the stability of the life that he had put together with Lou. It also shows how much can be expressed without sound, without actual speech.  \nWe see a segment of our population I very rarely see now, which I find odd. Lead character Ruben is told by Joe at the support group that for himself and the other deaf members, their condition is one to accept and  learn to live with rather than something that defines and controls them, and certainly not something one must fix. But Ruben doesn't want to hear this; or at least he doesn't really listen to what it means. \nJoe is played by Paul Raci, who is great, even though he spends much of the movie looking like Michigan J. Frog in front of strangers. Olivia Cooke as Lou is always so good. This last year or so has been heard reward for all the hard work and skill she has shown in other works, from Bates Motel to Thoroughbreds and Little Fish. \nBut this is Riz Ahmed's movie. Since seeing him in The Night Of, it was clear how good he was already. I've known some guys like Ruben- headstrong punk guys, hot-headed, struggling with accepting change.  Ahmed  shows us all of that in a brilliant performance. His final scene with Cooke, as they both are admitting the reality of what has changed with them without having to say it is an excellent showcase of acting but also a prime example of 'show, don't tell'. \nIt's so good to see Ruben get that moment of stillness finally. 4 stars",

The two of them are played by Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke. She is fantastic in one of the film's several remarkable supporting parts, but the true star of the film is Ahmed in a career highlight, effortlessly creating a compelling, relatable protagonist and  driving the story forward with his enormous emotional range.\n\nIn what is essentially a tale of transition, Marder delves into the actual truths of the deaf community with disarming realism, while the film's scope feels personal, yet universal. So unflinchingly honest with its real world subject, no one should miss this gem of a film, which I suspect will age like a fine wine.",

            "content": "In his directorial debut, Darius Marder addresses a subject to which Hollywood hardly pays any attention and which is also not given enough awareness in society. Sound of Metal tells the story of the young drummer Ruben, who is on tour with his girlfriend and pursuing his dream of becoming a musician. Of all things, this passion becomes Ruben's undoing when he suddenly loses most of his hearing. As a result, his life is no longer the same and he embarks on an adventure for which he is not really ready.\n\nRuben is embodied by Riz Ahmed. He is the clear protagonist of the film and appears in every scene. His journey from a dreaming drummer who has the seemingly perfect life with his great love to a deaf depressive who wants to return to that life is fascinating to follow. Ahmed plays this complex character with great subtlety. But he can also boil up from 0 to 100 in some moments and give free rein to his feelings. His multi-faceted performance makes it easy to understand his situation and to sympathise with him. Ahmed totally captivates you and represents people who have suffered the same fate with a lot of dignity. Olivia Cooke, as Ruben's girlfriend Lou, only has a few scenes at the beginning and at the end. Still, it's enough time for Cooke to introduce us to her equally complicated character in a way that we can understand her as a relative. Another terrific performance is delivered by Paul Raci as Joe, Rubens' also deaf mentor. He runs an association for the deaf and acts as a sort of father to the members. He acts very calmly and emotionally, especially in the heart-warming dialogues with Ruben, though there is always a certain toughness and honesty in there. His chemistry with Ahmed is the highlight of the film. As a veteran who has long since come to terms with his situation, he sees himself in the newcomer and wants to show him that deafness is not a curse.\n\nSound of Metal sends an enormously important message and is hopefully a wake-up call towards Hollywood. Over the 120-minute running time, it's clear that this film was a matter of heart for Marder and the ensemble. As a result, much of it lingers for days afterwards. This fact makes the film-experience all the more beautiful and real. Real is the word that best describes Sound of Metal. Every scene seems realistic and probably takes place in real life in exactly the same way. The slow, almost still pacing in the middle of the film can seem boring, but is very important for the film's authenticity. Sound of Metal is a film you have to see to get a slight insight into the life of this fundamental group of people.",

Soothing everyday sounds, like the rustling of the leaves and grass, the drops in the coffee pot in the morning, and the voices of your loved ones, become that more powerful and precious when we switch to a third person's perspective as Riz loses his hearing. They managed to make even the sound of silence have a shape and form so we could experience it as well.\nRiz Ahmed's acting was the highlight of this film and, in my opinion, makes him a strong contender for this year's Oscars nominations. Every single step of his journey through the stages of grief for his loss, we were there with him, feeling every moment, from shock and pain, to anger and acceptance. Olivia Cooke was also amazing, showcasing wonderfully how our pain affects our loved ones who try their hardest to help us. Both managed to make me invested in their story in just a few minutes.\nEven though this was not a true story, it felt like one. It felt like it could be anyone's story about the loss of something, or someone, precious and an exploration of their grieving process. That's an amazing feat for Darius Marder's directorial debut. The Oscars buzz around this movie is well deserved.",

Ahmed gives a wonderfully active, frustrated performance, giving off very human reactions to his character's plight (an understandably imperfect, often pained individual), though the supporting cast is nothing to brush off. A quality film from Amazon, hopefully the film content produced by streaming services will continue to be of such good quality. (4/5)",

Playing a heavy metal drummer who experiences rapid hearing loss, his initial reaction of furious denial slowly gives way to acceptance of the fact that his life will never be the same way it was before. The film is unique in its portrayal of a person on the outside working his way in. Many scenes have little or no sound in them, and none of the ASL used in the film is captioned, putting us firmly in our hero's shoes and highlighting what a struggle it is adapting to a different world of communication The film is done in such a way that the sound is virtually its own character. Sometimes its loud, other times its quiet Sometimes its slightly muted or slightly exaggerated, and on occasions it simply comes and goes. It flags somewhat in its 3rd act, which suggests to me that the filmmakers had a solid idea for a film, but weren't exactly sure how to bring it to a close. It's still ends on a satisfying note, but its overshadowed by what came before it. It has a strong supporting cast, most of whom are actual members of the deaf community, a decision that's a credit to the movie itself and its intentions, and while its artistic choices might alienate some, I was very happy to see a sensitive portrayal of deafness, done in a manner that makes it very relatable.

He goes into a deaf community to learn and coop without the use of sound. Strong plot. Ruben (Riz Ahmed) is a drum player. And a former drug addict. Stubborn once he discovered he lost his hearing. Desperate to get the hearing implant device but at an expensive cost. He joined a community where he meets a group that teaches him the other way of living around it. Great performances by Riz Ahmed. Olivia Cooke. And Lauren Ridloff who plays a teacher for a class of deaf children. One thing i did not like was the movie was a bit slow moving in the third act. Dragging out the exposition. Spending more long camera stills.",

            "content": "I don't think I've better empathized with hearing loss and deafness than with Sound of Metal, a moving and observant drama about a heavy metal drummer quickly losing his sense of hearing. Riz Ahmed (Nightcrawler) plays Ruben, a former junkie who is four years sober and worried about losing his girlfriend/band mate (Olivia Cooke) with his recent diagnosis. He's attending a treatment center meant to cater to a deaf community and transition others into this community. Ruben is defiant, depressed, angry, all the stages you can imagine with grief. The movie is at its best during its quiet and contemplative moments where we empathize with the terror and alienation of Ruben. When he first joins the center, we don't get subtitles for the many signed conversations between members. It's only after Ruben learns ASL, integrates into the community, and opens himself up to the program that we too get to be knowledgeable. The sound design is exceptionally utilized to illustrate Ruben's changing perspective, and some later choices with it might make you long for the peacefulness of silence. The movie is exquisitely thoughtful and considerate while maintaining a subtle, character-driven approach that keeps things grounded from wallowing in self-pity. For many of the deaf, hearing loss isn't seen as a disability but a community with its own culture and quality of life. It's understandable that Ruben is focused on loss but the movie doesn't dwell in loss, more so transformation and acceptance. Ahmed is fabulous in the lead role which requires him to rely primarily upon non-verbal expression for extended periods. His eyes are his best vessel for communicating Ruben's emotional state, and Ahmed is sensational. Paul Raci is also great as the leader of the treatment center and the responsibility and generosity he feels to those in his care. Sound of Metal is an immersive, sensitive, authentic and poignant drama with an Oscar-caliber lead performance and a depth of compassion for the many people of the deaf community.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

The creative choice to have the audience experience silence along with the main character on many occasions was very impactful. I will also say that the lead actor did a wonderful job and his performance shined through even with what I would say was a lackluster script. First of all, this movie was supposed to be about metal music, but there was no metal music to be found which is not surprising because Hollywood wouldn't know metal/rock music if it was in front of their faces. Secondly, when Ruben goes to the doctor for the first time and finds out he is going deaf he never truly gets an answer for why. He gets multiple reasons for why he MIGHT be, but no definitive answers as to why he so suddenly lost his hearing. All he wanted and was fixated on was surgery to get his hearing back which he knew was very expensive and didn't even ask more questions about how things might sound after the surgery. He assumed he would go back to hearing the same way he did before. This is where I think the depiction of the deaf experience faltered. There would be more conversations between the doctor and patient. I also have a problem with the lack of dialogue about Rubens passion for music. The movie was supposed to be about a passionate musician losing his hearing. How come he never got a monologue where he spoke about wanting to hear again because of his love for music? All he kept saying was, I want to get the surgery. But why? Almost everything in this movie was left for the audience to infer. They barely let the girlfriend speak as well. In the end, I thought it was VERY predictable. I knew after he got the surgery it was either not going to work or he would taking the hearing aids off and that's exactly what he did and the movie just abruptly ends. What will he do next? More for the audience to infer. The critics love movies like this, but for me it was two hours worth of mediocre.",

            "content": "Rating: A\n\n\"With moderately high expectations, Sound of Metal genuinely surprised me. Darius Marder and Abraham Marder's exquisite screenplay is the absolute standout, at the same insanely good level as Riz Ahmed's impressive performance. The former holds a meaningful, enlightening story about not only the deaf community but also about accepting our limitations as something that's a part of us instead of taking it as a handicap. Except for a couple of unnecessary scenes that could have made the movie a bit shorter, the two-hour duration is quite fair, boasting a very captivating narrative.\n\nCountless storytelling technical details elevate this film into one of the best of the year. From an apparently simple yet extremely clever use (or absence) of subtitles for sign language to emotionally compelling dialogues, an outstandingly realistic atmosphere surrounds the movie throughout the entire runtime. Never, not even for a second, the viewer needs to deal with an over-the-top reaction, cheesy conversation, or a typical Hollywood, overdramatized moment. Darius Marder has terrific control of the tone, keeping it exceptionally grounded.\n\nRiz Ahmed delivers what I believe is his career-best display, incorporating his character's hearing disability in a seamless fashion. His subtle facial expressions and body movements are essential for the performance that can easily guarantee him dozens of nominations. Olivia Cooke (Lou) is also excellent in her role. Technically, huge praise to Dani\u00ebl Bouquet's cinematography, which insists on an almost documentary-style composition by applying standard camera angles and shots often seen in this type of feature, helping to generate the before-mentioned authenticity.\n\nOne of my absolute favorite films of 2020.\"",

A heavy-metal drummer's life is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing. \n\nThis is one of the mundane drama, like Manchester by the Sea, where we follow the main character dealing with his/her life like a real person. There's very little background music. Also, there's no big movie twist that would wow the audience. It's simply just a man trying to deal with situations in his life. \n\nRiz Ahmed's performance as a drummer was real and made me care about the character. Since the story followed the drummer, often the sound in the movie reflected how the drummer heard, and this gave perspective on how a deaf person hears. There were little conversations, and many of them were sign languages, which didn't have translations, which confused me a bit in some scenes. \n\nOverall, a mundane and somewhat educational movie about dealing with being deaf. 8/10",

The female lead was very underwhelming though - her part consisted of her looking worried and confused and sleeping.  Moving onto Act 2, this is where the movie slowed way down, and meandered through many scenes that I think were meant to show the main character's growth (I'm not sure exactly), and then we barely got to the beginning of Act 3, where the crisis happens to threaten the main character's progress.  The only character that was provided any depth was Ruben (and perhaps the manager of the rehab facility, but just barely).  There could have been so many chances to show relationships that Ruben had there, but the people living there were just treated as bystanders to Ruben's story, which wasn't all that interesting.

The sound design is astounding; it captures the alienation, the disorientation, and the discovery of his circumstances in ways I couldnt've imagined and the effect is exciting, terrifying, and heartbreaking all at once.\n\nRiz Ahmed nails the behavioral sand traps that keeps someone clinging and clawing at the bubble they're fixated on preserving. The tumultuous lengths to which he will go to combat his deafness echo his heroin addict past; I tragically saw much of Ruben in someone I used to know. We can all be soul-deep addicts in our own way to something or another in our lives and the pain and confusion when you feel like you are being ripped from your identity can be all-consuming. How do you battle for air when you're violently drowning?\n\nThis profound journey says a lot all at once and Darius Marder (alongside his brother and Derek Cianfrance) brilliantly scripts an arc that works on multiple levels - allegorically, spiritually, technically, humanely, all the ways. What often moved me throughout this was not necessarily what I was seeing directly on screen, but the implications of it all.\n\nIt's invigorating to see the thriving lives and relationships of a deaf community credibly explored and Paul Raci is memorably tender as Joe, the recovery leader and beating heart of the tight-knit society. His performance, alongside Ahmed and Olivia Cooke - who's coping with her own aching past - screams awards consideration.\n\n'Metal' captures well that for Ruben, like so many of us, you can't be pushed to someone else's vision of acceptance; the truest form is a result of your unique, albeit stumbling journey, when you evolve organically from the steps (and missteps) you take. It's a long, difficult road, but Ruben shifts the narrative of his life from bemoaning what he's losing to embracing what he's gaining. Moving, eternal stuff. And the closing shot encapsulates a catharsis well-earned.",

            "content": "Change can be difficult.  So this is about a heavy metal drummer named Ruben (Riz Ahmed).  His life is about to be thrown through a loop when he starts to lose his sense of hearing.  He has no choice but to figure something out posthaste.  Now I went into this movie fully expecting it to deliver.  It's a morose premise for sure, but I had already heard rumblings about how great this was.  It has been a weak year due to COVID, so I was hopeful that this could be one of the best movies of the year.  Unlike a whole laundry list of films before it, Sound of Metal did not disappoint.  Now right away, I was vibing with this movie, and it is because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Wrestler.  They share several similarities: you have this skill set that gets shunned by the people who consider themselves refined, a protagonist who shouldn't be pursuing this career any longer for health concerns, and a desire to do whatever it takes to recapture the glory days.  There are also powerhouse leading performances in both films, and I will be shocked if I see acting that impresses me more than Riz Ahmed when I'm putting together my year-end wrap-up.  Even though the story doesn't spend a ton of time on it, you get a real sense of what kind of people he and his partner are right out of the gates, his partner played expertly by Olivia Cooke.  Not only is she his bandmate, but they are in a romantic relationship as well, so there are stakes presented very early on.  This problem is one that you can't ignore and hope that it goes away; you must take action, and you, of course, sympathize with his plight.  In true underdog fashion, you want to see him rise and overcome, but there are only so many options that you would have in this scenario.  You still want to watch how this will play out, and whenever I felt any lulls here, the story came back with an even harder emotional beat.  Sound of Metal is one of the very few must-see movies released this year.  You have to prepare to have your heart ripped out, and it is all too easy to put yourself into Ruben's shoes in this scary situation.  You will find energy and intensity in just about every scene, but even when it slows down for a quieter moment, the emotional charge is still palpable.  I thought the sound design to this was incredible, and you have to give kudos to how this movie handled deaf representation.  It only took twelve months into 2020, but I can finally recommend to you my first five-star movie of the year.",

            "content": "Darius Marder's \"Sound of Metal\" is an intimate, gripping and heartbreaking disability drama that sheds light on the experiences of marginalized deaf communities. With his directorial debut, writer/director Darius Marder has crafted an authentic account of a heavy-metal drummer that rapidly loses his hearing. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the lives of deaf musicians, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Marder draws viewers into the world of a musician that struggles to cope with hearing loss. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Marder uses impeccable sound design to recreate the experience of hearing loss, effectively shifting between deaf and normal audio. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Riz Ahmed delivers his finest performance to date as Ruben Stone. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the frustrations, disillusionment and self-denial of a heavy-metal drummer that struggles to come to terms with his loss of senses. The supporting cast, which includes the heartfelt Paul Raci, is also excellent and worthy of awards-recognition. Although \"Sound of Metal\" is undeniably an immense technical achievement, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a slow pace that tests the viewer's patience. Moreover, its sensitive themes may not appeal towards everyone. Nevertheless, fans of disability dramas will definitely enjoy \"Sound of Metal\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartfelt entertainment. At a time when deaf communities are rarely represented in films, it's a stirring reminder of the power of Cinema as an auditory art-form for telling disability stories.",

With incredible performances, scripting grounded in realism, sensitive direction, and gripping sound design, 'Sound of Metal' tells a story that as many as 400,000 Americans each year may experience - the process of sudden hearing loss. Riz Ahmed's central performance as Ruben, a drummer who in an instant loses his hearing, is imbued with a deep emotional complexity that is complemented by innovative sound design - Ruben's panic, rage, despair, fear, and isolation are palpable as you watch him negotiate, and and eventually begin to grow in, his new reality of muffled silence. There are some scenes that make you want to reach through the TV and hug and comfort this man as his world falls apart around him, and again as he puts it back together. Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci are well matched with Ahmed in their supporting roles, the former as Ruben's deeply committed yet troubled love interest, and the later as a leader of an organization that supports the deaf. This film gives voice to a community rarely seen in film, and gifts awareness and empathy to it's viewers. It is certainly one of the most affecting, intimate films of the year.",

            "content": "Riz Ahmen is Ruben, a drummer in a hard rock \"band\" (which is just him and his girlfriend, Oliva Cooke).  They share a strangely quiet, gentle existence living out of an old Air Stream and travelling the country.  Their music is loud and angry; their lives are restrained.  We learn that Ruben is a recovering addict and we soon learn that he is suddenly and quickly losing his hearing.  It's a devastating diagnosis.  To lose his hearing is to make who he thinks he is (a drummer & overall musician) nearly impossible.  He is encouraged to go to a home for newly deaf adults who are also addicts.  (One of the faults of the movie is that we aren't told exactly why or how this decision is reached.  One day, he's just going there.)  Ruben works to fit in and gradually finds a place for himself.  But in the back of his mind, all this is a \"holding pattern\" while he tries to come up with the funds to get a cochlear implant to regain his hearing.\n\nAhmed is never less than amazing.  The awards season recognition he's getting is well-deserved.  He is pretty quiet through most of the movie, yet never totally peaceful.  He is a deeply decent person, even gentle...yet he has demons he must wrestle with.  Ahmed can convey these battles and contradictions just by sitting there and letting us see his face and eyes.  You can feel how cheated he reckons himself to be.  You can see when he's drawn to simple things like teaching a deaf child how to drum his hands rhythmically.  You can see his battle to contain his anger and confusion.  His first \"AA\" meeting at the center, where everyone speaks in a sign language he hasn't begun to learn yet, is quite arresting because you can see how overwhelming it all it, yet he barely moves.  His performance is worth seeing, 100%.  (I would also point out that the sound design is EXCELLENT and so critical.\n\nBut the events of the movie are shown so frustratingly.  We have no real idea of how much time is passing?  When he learns sign language, has it been a week or a year?  Olivia Cooke's character (and performance?) give us almost nothing to go by.  We initially like her because Ruben does, but we really don't know her at all, and the script and actor give us little to go by.  And strangely, as arresting as Ahmed's performance is, I found myself not actually caring all that much about how everything turned out.  Key events in the character's journey seem to be skipped.  Major plot points (and there aren't many) are presented in a sketchy manner.  It all led to a movie that feels like less than the sum of its parts.\n\nBy all means, see if just for Ahmed's performance.  But I think the film itself is SO specific (a rock drummer addict who is suddenly deaf and must adjust but also wants surgery because he thinks it will be a cure-all to return him to his old life) that it forgets to clarify things that those of us who haven't had this specific experience are sometimes left in the dark.  It's an overall miss for me.",

The film is anchored in Riz Ahmed, from beginning to end. Not since There Will Be Blood, have I felt so bound to a lead's performance. This is largely due to the technical aspect, the presence of Day Lewis' face in nearly every frame of Anderson's Blood, and in Metal, the hand held camera and careful sound design drawing us continuously between Ruben's hearing experience and hearing all levels of sound available to a fully functioning ear and it's inner parts. If the duty of art is to make us see beauty, to make us hear beauty, to make us aware of the beauty all around us, then Sound of Metal succeeds. One circumstance in which cinema shines is when and where a condition of synesthesia is created; the sort of complete experience that is simultaneously disorienting and illuminating for a viewer. Sound of Metal, in moments, brings us there to the cusp. It's a simple movie, there aren't big set pieces or shocking narrative turns, but within each moment, there's a certain high level of authenticity which makes the film feel like a Dardenne Brothers experience, and this sort of docu-approach feels right for the subject matter. With a cameo from The Diving Bell and The Butterfly's Mathieu Amalric and strong work from Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci, this little film packs some strong punches. Where it fails to outwardly wow and entertain, it will at least inwardly illuminate, warming your heart even as it breaks.",

Not many.\n\nMy Story (Review Below)\nI lost my hearing in my right ear in my early 30's. Some weird thing they can't cure called Meniere's Disease. 20 years later and three months ago, my good ear started crapping out and I was told I have bi-lateral Meniere's. Not good. \n\nI wasn't a drummer (practiced to be one though). I went to metal/rock shows before COVID, and I wear ear plugs now when I go. I can't personally speak to what it's like to be in the music business, but I can speak to what it's like to go deaf all of a sudden. \n\nJust as in the movie, I wake up and hear a loud humming with everything else a dull murmur. Even my own voice. \n\nI was told hearing aids could help -- I was lucky that I had a family benefactor who offered to pay for the best of the best as they are not covered by insurance. \n\nAnd they helped -- a little, but for the price they barely did squat. Sounds were shrilly like you had an AM radio with a bad speaker in your ear. I need to put subtitles on all movies I watch these days. \n\nBut having trauma in your life reminds you of the importance of connections. Friends and family that support you, or people you barely even know -- like my Letterboxd friends in the comments section. What a great community we have here. \n\nSound of Metal Review\nI went in without reading the byline, expecting an expose on life in the hard rock music business. Instead it's a tragic situation of the young drummer of a metal band, played fantastically by Riz Ahmed, who goes deaf. \n\nThe acting is fantastic. Riz Ahmed is great as usual but reaches a new level . His girlfriend Olivia Cooke is unrecognizable with the bleached eyebrows, moving refreshingly from trash horror movies to a fantastic dramatic effort. \n\nThere's more to say but I need to digest this more and possibly do a rewatch. \n\nAmazing.",

Darius Marder has directed one film and co-written another, but this is HIS film.  There are some elements that didn't quite work, but it all pales in comparison to how spot on Marder gets what it's like to feel deaf.  I kept reading from deaf people how this movie gets it.  It certainly got me.  I felt like i was the one who had lost my hearing and that is a credit to the brains behind the film.  This film has the PERFECT ending. Final Score: 8.6/10",

This film has everything. It has drama, romance, music and more. \n\nWhen something gets taken away from someone's life or when something gets to an end in someone's life, it could mean the beginning of a new thing, a better thing, a better life. A life where you will find yourself, your true self, you will start to feel every little detail around you, you will start to be grateful, you will see things differently, you might start to like things that you always thought that you might not like. Being deaf or blind or whatever doesn't mean your life stops or ends there, it doesn't mean that something is wrong with you, it doesn't mean that you can't do anything. You don't have to fix it, you just have to fix your \"MIND\" if you think that way. THIS IS SOUND OF METAL and that's why I love this film. The film is about life, love, accepting & loving your life whether it was good or bad, being grateful, feel and absorb everything and every moment around you and never give up. \n\nSound mixing & Sound editing were perfect. Alongside Ahmed's great performance, the sound mixing & sound editing were showing exactly how Ahmed's character Ruben Stone, hears every single thing around him. It is like we the audience, are Ruben Stone. We are feeling what he is feeling and hearing what he is hearing. Loved how sometimes everything goes completely silent where we don't hear any single noise, and sometimes we hear everything that's going around him. The film shifts back and forth through that to show the difference. hats off to everyone in this department who worked on it and got us this beautiful result.\n\nIn addition, The directing & cinematography were absolutely amazing, they were portraying the different aspects of Ruben Stone's life in a creative and unique way. \n\nThe film has a very great screenplay that is very well written. Some scenes will really touch your heart and they have a really deep meaning behind them. The film is also filled with quotes about life that are really deep. \n\nRiz Ahmed's performance was amazing and he was able to play Ruben Stone very very well. Really can't imagine someone else other than him to play Ruben. I really don't know what to say much about his performance other than, IT IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR. Although Olivia Cooke did not have much time on screen, she was able to give a great performance as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Sound of Metal is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I \"HIGHLY RECOMMEND\" every to watch it as soon as possible. It is new, unique, creative, emotional, genuine. It is just everything. \n\nMy rating is: 9/10",

This movie is powered by a great lead performance from Riz Ahmed who is becoming more and more of a talent to keep an eye out for with every project he does. His performance is real and understated but immensely effective. I also really liked how the movie used the sound design to allow the viewer to get inside the character's head and ultimately understand his frustration. The movie feels very realistic, so a lot of the tone is pretty low-key, but I think it mostly works for the story it is trying to tell. Overall, this is a good movie that is boosted by a fantastic lead performance from Riz Ahmed.",

            "content": "I'm very wary when it comes to screenplays, specifically when a first-time writer knocks it out of the park because I then find myself having a preconceived notion that they will always be that good. To me, one of the absolute best films of 2012 was The Place Beyond the Pines. Until now, writer/director Darius Marder hadn't really done anything of note since his contribution to the screenplay for that aforementioned film. Well, he has now made a film of his own, both writing and directing, and he's now two for two in my book because Sound of Metal is a fantastic piece of indie filmmaking. Now available on-demand, here's why Sound of Metal more than warrants your time.\n\nBeginning with a concert scene that expresses just how passionate Ruben (Riz Ahmed) is about drumming, it doesn't take long before the film sends his life into a downward spiral. Losing his love of music due to his now gradual and rapid hearing loss, Ruben must come to terms with the fact that he may never be able to hear again. Trying to find peace and solace after years of drug addictions, this is the final, and biggest test of his life yet. From the very first moments, I was sucked into this film, but Ahmed's performance also helped with that, because it's honestly one for the ages. I have seen him many times over at this point, but his commitment to this character floored me. There were multiple occurrences, even though I couldn't relate to the character, that I felt the pain he was going through. This also leads me to the use of sound design.\n\nFrom the overly loud opening to the near-silent portions of the film, the sound design was one of the biggest characters here. I have to give major props to the entire sound department. There are times where it seems natural that we would be hearing things the way Ruben is, but then the film shifts back and forth in order to show the difference. On top of that, there are moments where not a single noise or music queue is heard at all, which made for a much more engaging film in my opinion. His performance, along with how the sound design reflected it, was simply perfect.\n\nFilms that revolve around a likeable character who has to overcome insane odds are very difficult for me to dislike unless it's just poorly made, so I'm slightly biased for stories like these. With that said, as much as a loved this film, I can't quite call it perfect because the portions of the film that were dead silent are both the best and worst parts of the movie in terms of pacing. Yes, I was engaged from start to finish, but the quiet elements sometimes brought the film to a halt. In retrospect, I still enjoyed all of those moments as well, but that, in particular, is what is keeping me from giving this one a perfect score.\u00a0\n\nOverall, Sound of Metal was easily one of my most anticipated films of this year simply due to who was writing and directing. This is the type of film that has talent littered throughout. Whether you're talking about the wonderful central performance by Ahmed, Olivia Cooke's great supporting role, or even the calm and collected performance that Paul Raci gives as Joe, never once did I question the acting here. Although I haven't had the chance to see a lot of editor Mikkel E.G. Nielsen's work, I will absolutely be keeping an eye on him in the years to come, because his work here inspired me. I loved nearly everything about this film and it's easily one of my top recommendations for this year. Sound of Metal is a home run.",

This is one of the most touching and well-crafted films I've seen this year, bound to land on many Top 10 lists this year. The sound design of this film is some of the most near-perfect I've ever heard in one of these, from the concert scenes, to the moments we are inside Riz Ahmed's head and experience the loss of hearing alongside the character.\n\nRiz Ahmed gives one of the most powerful, moving performances of the year in this role! The anguish and confusion, anger, just a full range of emotions he displays here and it is a true treat to see. Ahmed has consistently been one of the greatest young actors working today, and in this role, things are no different. Before filming, Ahmed took 6 months of drum lessons, and for the film, he also learned American Sign Language. This film was also shot over just one month \u2013 so to see this as the finished product is incredible. Just as with the film \"Run\" and the casting of its lead paraplegic actor, here, Darius Marder casted numerous people from within the deaf community, adding a very respectful atmosphere, as well as a vital piece of authenticity to this story. Sound of Metal is streaming on Amazon Prime Video right now and I highly recommend checking it out ASAP! All the thumbs up from me.",

At this point you are solidly rooting for him to find peace while witnessing the inevitable last cling to who he was before. \n\nThe last 10 minutes are absolutely beautiful and filled with emotion.

I admired how the movie portrays the deaf community in a more positive light, because in the media it's usually misrepresented, as it often reeks of denial and self-loathing. I can tell a lot of care and effort went into this.\n\nIt's very thought-provoking as well. The main character Ruben (Riz Ahmed) who is a heavy-metal drummer, where his entire life revolves around the world of sound and music, which sadly gets snatched away from him. This devastating part of his life also becomes the thing that would later define him. The silence makes him pause and consider what life can be like when we learn to accept and let things go. Not only accepting the lost of your hearing, but overcoming a nasty drug addiction. By losing apart of yourself isn't always doom and gloom after you let it sit for a while, because it can give you a brand-new perspective on things. You start to conclude that silence is heaven to the ears.\n\nRiz Ahmed delivers a terrific and heart-breaking performance as Ruben. He's the type of actor that does such a great job of making you care for his characters and here is no different. Riz has such intense, and yet expressive eyes that convey so much on what the character is feeling or thinking. Every worry, frustration, sadness, joy, and fear were all felt through his performance.\n\nOlivia Cooke, who I didn't recognize at first, also delivers a great performance as Lou, Ruben's girlfriend. There is nothing more soul crushing than watching someone you love at their lowest point both emotionally and mentally. It makes me wonder why she isn't a bigger star already, because I think she's fantastic.\n\nI like how the movie barely has a score, as the background is often incredibly quiet. The movie opens with a loud heavy metal concert blasting away it's music, but from Ruben's point of view it slowly becomes more muffled and clogged up. It just shows that a great deal of thought went into the audio and that alone made the whole thing effective. The same thing applies to Darius Marder's directing and Dani\u00ebl Bouquet cinematography; fantastic and impactful.\n\nOverall rating: Highly recommend.",

After consulting a doctor he learns the damage is beyond repair. A cochlear implant could help but it's expensive. Lou convinces him to go to a rural deaf community where he learns the life of being deaf. This is where the the bulk of the story takes place as we follow Ruben learning sign language but more importantly learning about himself as he navigates his new world. These scenes are a complete wonder, overflowing with stoic humanity and human empathy. Riz Ahmed is simply sublime as Ruben. His performance is one of such subtle beauty and power it left me floored. Amhed also spent months learning how to drum and also how to sign language, adding an extra layer of authenticity. The film is also a sonic masterpiece, from the opening scene of a ferocious gig to the many scenes where we 'hear' the world through Ruben's ears. We hear the muffled noises, the near silence. It truly envelops us in the film, making for an extra special experience. And the ending is one of the best you will see, a moment of pure harmony. This film I believe is a must see.

            "content": "CRUNCH TIME - My Review of SOUND OF METAL \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nA good friend of mine, who has a disability, often shares with me his opinions of how cinema has looked at the various challenges as something to fix. He speaks about how through ableism, people get categorized as suffering from a disability rather than living with one. Some in the deaf community, for example, consider those who wish to hear again to be traitors. It's with this in mind that I came to watch Sound Of Metal, the narrative feature debut of Darius Marder (The Place Beyond The Pines), who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Abraham, based on a story by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine). The story concerns a hard rock drummer and addict who experiences hearing loss and enters a rehab center to reconcile with his new state of being. \n\nRiz Ahmed (Nightcrawler) stars as Ruben, the aforementioned drummer who, when the story begins, thrashes out a set with his lead singer/girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke) as part of their popular but decidedly small RV tour. Almost immediately, Ruben senses an issue with his hearing, and the fantastic sound design by Nicholas Becker immerses us in Ruben's plight, with high pitches, underwater-style rumblings, and more. We as an audience feel just as disoriented as Ruben, and it's a conceit explored throughout. Without health insurance, Ruben has few choices and cannot afford the cochlear implants a doctor discusses with him. Ignoring the physician's advice, Ruben performs at another show and further damages his sense of hearing. \n\nWhen Lou cancels the tour and leaves Ruben at the door of a rehab facility, you can feel his heartbreak. Ruben clearly lives for music and feels trapped in a hopeless situation. The facility manager, Joe (beautifully played by Paul Raci), takes away Ruben's comforts, including access to his phone, a computer, or anything from the outside world. Slowly, oh so slowly, Ruben learns ASL and finds a place within the deaf community. He befriends people like Jenn (Chelsea Lee), a genderqueer deaf person who oozes confidence, teaching Ruben there is life after a hearing loss. Ruben also has a nice chemistry with one of the teachers, Diane (The Walking Dead's Lauren Ridloff), and what could easily have served as a tired romance trope remains a gentle, platonic relationship. \n\nWe watch Ruben go through the many ups and downs of his hearing loss, from anger to denial to perhaps some unexpected places. Ahmed gives a gentle, soulful performance with flickers of rage when he feels especially unmoored. That the film works at all remains largely due to his commitment to the role. Unfortunately, as soon as the story leaves the rock world, it descends into a sluggish, PSA-quality tale. At the risk of sounding tacky, I think I expected Whiplash and got a concussion instead. The issues of the deaf community no doubt get handled with the utmost of sensitivity, but things sometimes feel a little too nicey-nice to work as drama. Don't get me wrong, some of this has an intensity and really makes you feel Ruben's loneliness. \n\nAdditionally, certain plot strands never pan out, such as the several scenes of Ruben sneaking onto Joe's computer, risking getting caught and expelled from the facility. Same goes for Ruben breaking the rules by entering his RV and selling it. I'm guessing the filmmakers didn't want to goose up the drama, but it results in a certain flatness at times. Olivia Cooke's performance rings true, never seeming like an actor playing a singer, but her character takes a backseat for most of the film. \n\nAfter quite a long slog, the film recovers in its third act with a fascinating plot development and an ending of quiet beauty. Thanks to Riz Ahmed's gorgeous performance, to his journey to accept stillness and peace, and the sensitivity to the deaf community, the final moment honors those living with hearing loss in a simple yet profound way.",

            "content": "EAR DRUM\n\nThe nightmare of any musician, particularly a drummer, keeper of beat, keeper of time, is hearing loss. That is Ruben's dilemma. After a boisterous, mid-tour set, one half of a power duo starts to experience aural malfunction. Uh-oh.\n\nIn typical human nature denial, Ruben carries on, but is soon forced to make tough decisions. Scrambling desperately to get back on course, and continue his career, Ruben is eager to gamble on an expensive operation, while his vocalist girlfriend steers him to a recovery community, focusing on adaptation over cure.\n\nReuben's journey, careening between hope, desperation, struggle and revelation, is a fascinating one, amplified by the extraordinary presentation from director Darius Marder. Putting the audience in Reuben's ears the loss experience, through muffled passages, jarring distortions, and worst of all, total silence, is devastating. The eclectic sound design may be the star here. Closed captioned throughout so nothing is missed, the sub-titles, usually a distraction, become a fluid part of the viewing experience.\n\nAs a simple, uncomplicated young man jolted by a life altering shock, Riz Ahmed is terrific in a subtle yet demanding role. He absolutely rocks as a kickass drummer, a reluctant deaf student, and an empathetic partner willing to go any distance to make things right. The buzz about this film is not just in Ruben's ears.\n\n- hipCRANK",

The character Ahmed creates is not only aggressive and determined, but ultimately venerable and touching. The script and direction seem a bit random at times (there are some lapses in logic), but it always returns to Ahmed's creation. The sound design also contributes to the experience of alternate hearing and open captioning is on screen to be more inclusive for a deaf audience.",

The artistry of its storytelling -- the directing, the acting and the sound design -- is as pure as its message; that is, the journey toward accepting the things that cannot be changed change and seeking peace wherever it happens to be. \"Sound of Metal\" isn't an edge-of-your-seat white-knuckle thriller, but it's equally gripping in a different kind of way. Once it's got you, be prepared for a 130-minute immersive experience that holds on all the way to the end. It's the type of film that doesn't land emotionally until the credits start to roll; when the viewer has 10 minutes or so to contemplate the gravity of what they've just witnessed.",

The story is an exploration of the processes a metal musician goes through as he deals with becoming deaf...Riz Ahmed, who plays said musician is remarkable in the role, conveying through his eyes the range of his emotions.  Although most all scenes focus on him; you still feel that you cannot get enough of him because of that range and depth of feeling (& general good looks...love his profile with big eyelashes!).  You also learn much about the deaf community, and signing so the film is both a teaching lesson & a moving story.  Please go to see it and not only be entertained, but have your horizons expanded.",
