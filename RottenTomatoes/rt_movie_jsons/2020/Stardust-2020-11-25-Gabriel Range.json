I'm sure 20 mins of the movie is this repeated over and over (and over).\n\nI'm not saying you should give this a hard pass because it's one of the finest hate-watch movies ever.

And you won't hear any of those songs once.  Whatever you may think of 'Rocketman' or 'Bohemia Rhapsody' those filmmakers, at least, knew people expected to hear music.\n\nThis film will go down in history as one of the least musical biopics of one of the most musically influential subjects ever.  It's utterly mad.\n\nThen there's the specter of schizophrenia which is a predominant theme in Bowie's music but is only explored in fragments in the movie.  At the end of the movie you see he's undergone this complete metamorphosis and you witness not one iota of his becoming Ziggy or anything akin to what we think of as Bowie.  \n\nJohnny Flynn's portrayal is just simply nothing like Bowie at all.  Especially, as Bowie on stage.  He can't walk nor talk nor sing nor even wear clothes like Bowie.  He has not a clue as how to portray Bowie's theatrical aesthetic.  \n\nThe whole thing is just bloody terrible.",

Instead the film makers hacked into Bowie's insecurities, inability to hold normal interviews, highlighting a lot of whining not to mention eye rolls from the press. It makes me wonder if the film makers who couldn't get the rights to Bowie's music were so sore that they pressed on without it and for kicks left a whole portion of the movie on the cutting room floor.

This movie is a very thin slice of the David Bowie story, and probably not one many casual fans know about, or maybe even care to much to learn about?  Marc Maron is absolutely stunning as the late, great Ron Oberman,  the record label rep that took Bowie under his wing when he first came to the USA. Admittedly,  the movie didn't get the nod from the Bowie camp or feature lots of his big hit songs, but it is a wonderful little film that was extremely well done and worth seeing...It is truly staggering to me that this movie is not better reviewed...Do your homework on Bowie's early story,  manage your expectations that you are going to see something like the Queen or Elton flicks, and enjoy what is truly a terrific look at Bowie's progression to the Ziggy Stardust era of his career.

Johnny Flynn does a stunning job portraying the young Bowie. The story is about Bowie touring the USA with publicist Ron Oberman, attempting to promote his album under the most challenging circumstances. Bowie and Oberman have to work together to overcome the skepticism of David's album from the record company and the public. In facing these challenges and potential failure, we watch Bowie find his way, inventing and developing himself as an artist. Especially poignant are the scenes where David spends time with his brother, who faces the challenges of Schizophrenia. This is a thoughtful and sensitive portrayal of a turning point in an artist's life.",

            "content": "I feel that I must preface my review of Stardust by addressing the issue that Johnny Flynn did not fulfill the impossible tasks of mastering physical likeness to Bowie, or his mannerisms and body language, which any obsessed fan such as myself could plainly see when watching the film. I don't think producing a clone of Bowie to portray him in this film was the ultimate goal of the film maker's vision, and I'm sure they realized it was utterly impossible for anyone to share any kind of likeness that could fully portray even a Bowie-esque impersonation, so I'm sure the idea of attempting an accurate depiction of Bowie was likely scrapped before Johnny Flynn was casted to portray him. I am also fully aware that this film was not approved or endorsed by Bowie's family, and as a result the film maker did not obtain the rights to use Bowies music in the film and this very much concerned me before I saw the film Stardust, however I don't really feel like this took away from this impactful film. While I thought this was brilliant film, but it is essential for the viewer to abandon any expectations that it will somehow encapsulate the impact that Bowie's genius has had on art and pop culture. Stardust is not about Bowie the super-human icon, but the story about him as a mortal young man, as well as introducing the viewer to the people, experiences and aspects of his young life that were essential to the specific way in which he developed both as a person, as well as an artist. This film portrays the vulnerabilities and fears he faced at the beginning of his career, and how he overcame the self-confidence issues he had by developing a philosophy, and way of approaching artistic performance through fully immersing himself into the roles he created, and performed over many years of his artistic career. The is an emphasis on how Bowie did not compromise any of his creative vision in order to achieve fame, and thoughtfully portrays him in the process of establishing the framework from which all of his epic works were derived. Stardust is a film about Bowie overcoming ongoing barriers he was faced in his personal life, and finding his way as a human being, performer and artist before and during The Man Who Sold The World promotional tour in America. I think this film really humanized Bowie in an endearing way, with providing just a glimpse into how the public would come to know him as a super human Icon, and a larger than life icon and musical legend.",

I think his role is poorly written and misdirected.\n\nMark Maron does a fine job as Oberman, Bowie's road manager. Perhaps the story would have been interesting told from hisp erspective -- what he saw and heard. Instead, the film tells about things it doesn't seem to know much about. It's mostly surface.\n\nThe parade of anecdotes lead nowhere, several music writers pass through to little effect.\n\nJena Malone delivers, but her wig is bad and distracting... and what happened to the big bump in her dress?
