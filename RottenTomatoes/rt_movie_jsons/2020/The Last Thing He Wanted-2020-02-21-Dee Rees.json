I would happily watch the directors cut of this enterprise just to see how much of the initial vision was left on the cutting-room floor the first time around. A solid story-line, a more than adequate cast,  perfectly acceptable location and cinematography, a quirky and thought-provoking score, and a hitherto talented director. Yet here we are.

This was a rare movie that forces you to read in between the lines and get it wrong!, therefore adding to the confusion. I always felt like I was floating on a major event that fell in the water, dissipated and I sank in with it.

You go through multiple twists and turns , hoping that there is a reprieve at the end, but then you end up in mother of all sh*t hole. Who in their sane mind would write (actually modify) the script to make Treat kill Helena? He just had a very nice romantic night with her (sunset, sweet talk, sex..) and then turns around and shoots her the next day with apparently no provocation and making you think that it was pre-meditated? if it was pre-meditated he could have killed her the first night itself when they met at the bar. This is why the original author of the book apparently had an ending where an assassin shoots Treat and Helena gets killed in the cross fire. Otherwise, it just leaves the audience with that shocker of  \"What the F just happened!\". I mean, movies can have sad endings, its ok, but they have to be realistic too. This was like the movie script writer wanted to add a mother of all twists, and blew it up in the process. The directors and producers must be extra careful for Satan Ex Machinas like this. If a book is a flop, nobody loses anything. Ah, well, the author probably lost coupla hours and the publisher a bunch of paper price, but not anything like a movie. In fact this movie looked like it was really shot in all those exotic locations too, instead of a set. So yes, the producer really would have been punched in the stomach. Am sorry man. The actors did a good job though.  Edi Gathegi especially. I have seen him in the series Blacklist as a very dangerous force to be reckoned with and boy does he not do a good job. But yeah, great talent wasted by poor writing, which even leaves you with so many unanswered qns. Why was Paul killed? Why was max epperson (or bob weir or whatever his name is) a friend of Dick but still wants to kill him (or her daughter). I don't know man. Gives you a high and dry feeling like the girl came home with you after the first date, but then walked out just before getting to bed. And who is he in \"the last thing he wanted?\" Dick? Oh please. The movie really should have been \"the last thing she wanted\" to go with the narrative. The journalist who keeps asking who runs all this, and then realizes it was she herself or something like that. But yeah guys, careful with this movie...stay safe from two things, corona and this movie. LOL",

I'm 53 so, maybe someone who didn't live through it won't enjoy or understand the movie as well. Regardless, Anne Hathaway is great in this, whether you grok the storyline or not.

There is so much that is wrong with this film. Whenever I watch a movie for the first time, I pay full attention to it so that I don't miss any details. After watching this, I thought, \"What?\". I don't understand what this movie was about or what happened. Its plot is so convoluted and confusing that I honestly can't tell you what happened. The film has little to no structure to it. Scenes just happen and then they go on to another unrelated scene. Since I couldn't understand what was happening, I was incredibly bored. This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. None of the characters are interesting or developed in the slightest. I like Ben Affleck, Anne Hathaway, and Willem Dafoe but I hated their characters. They are all unlikeable and don't have any motivation for what they do. Anne Hathway's character doesn't like her father at all and yet she decides to take over his job? It made no sense. Their performances weren't that great either. Willem Dafoe was fine and his performance was the only aspect I found above average but Affleck and Hathaway were pretty bad. Hathaway sounded like a robot the entire film and Affleck who has top billing was only in the film for 15 minutes. He contributed almost nothing to the film. The other actors did a pretty poor job and were very forgettable. I honestly forgot that Toby Jones was in the film until I started writing this. The script they were given was particularly awful. The dialogue was poorly written and shallow which hampered everyone's performance. The cinematography was fine. It wasn't special but it wasn't bad. The editing was particularly annoying though. It would cut randomly during scenes which threw off the focus of it. At other points, the editing would cut so rapidly and quickly that it was hard to tell what was going on. Overall, The Last Thing He Wanted is a convoluted, confusing, and boring film with a poor script, bad characters, and obnoxious editing.",

There's a reason why all of this is still happening, and to some degree, you see that in the film by the end, which is both predictable and simultaneously idiotic. All they had to do to get at least a 3 star rating from me is remove the daughter from the movie. She adds absolutely nothing while existing as the primary reason why this movie would never have happened. Dying dad wants you to uncover a massive arms ring? First thing you say is - uh, no? I have a kid. Even if I don't die out there, someone will send people after her. No mention per say, unless I was too bored to notice. So from the get go it is a masterpiece of foolishness in writing and execution. Hey, give it a go if you want to try to see something we're all not seeing.
