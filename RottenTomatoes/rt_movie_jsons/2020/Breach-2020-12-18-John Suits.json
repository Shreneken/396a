Did he owe someone money or something?\n\nThere was 0 character development,  I honestly can't remember any of their names.  Bruce's character,  well basically it was just one liners throughout the movie.  It was almost like he told the writers to not worry about building his character,  he'll just play random characters from his past film. \n\nThe special effects were laughable,  everything was fake.  When shooting their guns,  you can tell they were just faking it and they were adding everything later.  The way they would shake the gun as if it was kickback was laughable.  Like something a kid would do during pretend time.  What was with alien that was looked like a liquid terminator?  Why did they even bring that up,  when the ship just blows up 5 seconds later?\n\nThe ending made 0 sense,  like I mean 0 sense.  So apparently they make it to Earth 2 and I guess the aliens were there too?  Why was there a building sized alien in the background.   And these 2 actually think their flamethrower is going to work?  Was that supposed to be a setup for a sequel?  \n\noh almost forgot they reused the same scenes over and over.  There is a scene where the zombie aliens were trying to get into a room.  They would reuse the door being pounded in,  like 10 times.  Each time,  the door is back to normal and 'pound'  it's indented.  Then next scene back to normal,  pounded in.  Repeat.  Over and over and over. \n\nMovies out of Hollywood these past couple years have been such a waste of time.  I can't believe someone actually read this script and green-lit it!",

Not only because for most part he never let me down, and not only because some say that I look a bit like him but also because he did deliver some remarkable and memorable roles. So, led by the brand, my loyalty to the brand and my six sense, I made that faithful life changing decision and hit the \"buy\" button. I am now a proud owner of the \"license for life\" that entitles me to watch the movie Anti Life any time I want. \n\nThe thing is, I do not really want to watch it. And this feeling is so strong and is supported by the fact that, even considering that I am stingy, and that I do value my money (actually I value it a lot) I still didn't find the strength and courage to continue watching it. I did try at least three times, after all I am a loyal follower. In my life on this planet, which now spans over the five decades, I have walked away from a sci-fi movie only twice. The first movie I cannot even remember the name, it belongs to the category of life events that you want to remember extremely well just to be sure that you will forget every single moment of it. And now is the second time. Anti-Life. \n\nIn a way, this is a life changing event for a couple of reasons. Firstly, this is one of those creations that make you think, if they did it, I can certainly do at least the same. In this particular instance, I am sure I would do much better. Secondly, I have never ever written a review of anything, I have never returned a meal in a restaurant or a bottle of wine just to prove that I am a connoisseur. I always thought that I would offend somebody who tried hard to deliver the best outcome. \n\nBut this thing, is just so bad that even a person like me is kind of offended. Plot is naïve, events even more so, dialogs are, well I am not even sure how to describe them. You see, in any story or a movie it doesn't even matter if the plot is realistic but it has to be logical and believable. And this one is neither. I do not even want to talk about the acting, the fact is they did their best with what they were given. \n\nAnd here I can to the main point. They did their best with they were given is actually not the way to describe the problem. They did their best with what they decided to accept. And that leaves me with one question. Why? Why did you do this to me Bruce? We had a great ride you and I. \n\nSo, I paid 49 UAE Dirhams. If the equation \"time equals money\" holds true than money is the time. So, Bruce you own me the time. My time that I used to earn 49 Dhs and my time spent trying to watch this movie. That is all I am asking for, give me my time back.\n\nThe only thing that is absolutely brilliant about this movie is the title \"Anti Life\". Anti my life and anti your life. So, please do not watch for your life's sake. Not even if this is the only movie showing for free on a boring long-haul flight (which are not that many these days anyway).",

Willis does a lot of these straight to demand movies nowadays, but I could see the regret in his eyes for this one. I'm guessing he had real liquor in that flask just to get through the scene shots.

That turns a person into a mindless mutant. And a monstrous creature in the end that is trying to consume life. There are other better films like this such as Pandorum. Alien. The direction in this film is terrible. Characters do make dumb decisions. The writing is cheesy and dumb. The acting is stale. It does have a great cast ensemble of actors that were in old action movies. Like Bruce Willis. Johnny Messner. And Thomas Jane whos performance who wears aviators shades inside a spaceship.

CGG is below average obviously the budget was spent on actor/actress wages more precisely Bruce Willis, and he does give an above average performance, nothing near his peak but still better than the rest of the cast. If your set on watching this or have nothing better to do, I'd recommend waiting for it to be free viewing on you local network and not buying or renting it. I love a good SYFY but if you were to compare it to other movies with the best of Star Trek or Star Wars movie's being a 10 out of 10 (not saying they are just a reference point) this would fall in around a 3-4 with Disney's Blackhole at a 2, yes their are worse than that one out there.",
