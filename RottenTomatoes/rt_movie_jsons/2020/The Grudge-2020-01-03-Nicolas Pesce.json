The use of negative space, the sound design and the cinematography overall are excellent. The final 20 minutes are thrilling. I did prefer it when it was creepy Japanese children rather than Jason Vorhees looking guys. This is very disappointing. The original films were entertaining but not the best, this is just uneven, I don't think it'll appeal to new buyers and it certainly won't reinvigorate the series. Bring on the inevitable next reboot.",

It slow and tries to make you feel bad with the characters by having heart wrenching back stories. The director of this garbage should go back to school. He should've juet tried to make his own movie... not try and mimic something that was already remade. Poor acting and poor setup and delivery. Loved the original and this is terrible",

I'd stare at him blankly for about half a minute then ask, \"Why did you feel this was necessary?\" He'd say \"...What do you mean?\" and then I'd nod my head thoughtfully for a full minute till he got up and left. The thing about The Grudge is there are moments that have that weird uncomfortable type of humor some horror movies pull off either intentionally or by accident, but they are too few and far between for this to be recommended. The body horror and jump scares are about on par with a Resident Evil film. The story is told out of sequence and usually when someone does that, its because they want to reveal something in the end. They do not here. There is genuinely nothing of substance to reveal. The final confrontation is like a last minute birthday gift purchased at a Walgreens Pharmacy on the way to the party. It isn't set up in ways that are quite satisfying enough but this would be ok if anything else managed to climb above mediocre. It's not the worst thing you'll ever see, and it has one or two entertaining moments, but its unlikely to be something you'd ever re-watch, recommend, or even remember a month later. Unless it was also your first Rotten Tomatoes review. Then you might cherish it forever.",

I've never been big on Japanese horror so I went in to this hesitantly (also the Sarah Michelle Gellar version was hot garbage back in 2004, so I still had that image in my head.) The premise here is an American nurse working in Tokyo misses her family and gets spooked out and shortens her commitment in Japan to return home. Unbeknownst to her, a spirit has attached itself to her, which causes her to kill her family. Thus, the house is haunted and now anyone entering the house (realtors, police, etc.) will have the same spirit attached to them. For a R rated horror film, it's pretty tame with mostly jump scares and some \"grotesque\" images. The story skips around primarily between 2004-2006. Wasn't expecting much going in and that's how I felt coming out. Nothing special to see here.",

So maybe this is too high an expectation, for the fourth film in a copycat horror film series, copied from the better venerated Japanese films.  The film's cinematography is decent enough.  The CG effects irritated me.  I really don't get why the ghosts don't primarily use practical effects; Sam Raimi should know something about the efficacy of real makeup/prosthetics in horror.  The story and screenplay are poorly done; the forgone conclusion storytelling format is poorly executed and I found it difficult to care for the victims, since the film already showed us the outcome.  This meandering set of flashbacks detracts from the intrigue, and I never became attached to any one character or scene.  The film takes too long to get to the drama of the protagonist, and by then, it's too late and the film is over.",

Even the supernatural have to take up residence somewhere, so it claims a new house and terrorizes any new person that is unfortunate enough to step foot into the home.  Now I have no familiarity with the movies that came before this.  I haven't seen any of the six Japanese movies or the three American movies; all I know is what I've heard secondhand.  I thought that this was a remake of a remake, but this is a sidequel, which I didn't know was a word before now.  I'm not going to lie: this isn't making me want to go back and watch any of the preceding movies.  Now this movie started on the wrong foot with me, because right out of the gates, the acting is noticeably amateurish.  I will admit that it did get better once some seasoned actors hit the screen, but still, it is not the way you want to kick off in your movie.  This is just a sloppily put together movie, and while there are several factors stacked up on top of each other, the most damning flaw is the editing.  About 30 minutes in, I thought that this was just a series of vignettes, as it kept jumping from family to family... and then it started to pick those other stories back up.  It interrupts any flow this movie has, and I don't know whose idea it was to have them jump between years on a dime, but it sank this movie like a cannonball.  The scares are cheap, and for whatever reason, about 75% of them take place in the bathroom.  As I said, I'm not familiar with the previous movies, but it never provides you an explanation of why this ghost favors the lavatory, so I can only assume that it is just a kink.  When you think of bad horror, you are probably thinking of a movie like this.  The abilities of this evil entity aren't clearly defined, and there isn't any motivation that I can see.  There are lots of unnatural reactions, and I can't even begin to tell you how many times characters just brush off being accosted by a ghost and then go back to their business.  There was a reason this was released in January.  There isn't an ounce of subtlety to this, and everything about this just screams low-rent horror.  If I had to say something nice about it, I will say that I didn't mind the segments with John Cho and Betty Gilpin.  They're professionals, so they do show up, but still, it isn't enough of a reason to watch it.   If you're at all familiar with horror, then you have already seen everything this movie has to offer.",

It takes a different setting as this detective on a mystery and the story leads us through all the victims of the grudge until the end. Satisfying for a die hard horror fan. Maybe not to the once in a blue moon horror watcher. All i can say is give it a watch if you really love horrors. 23% doesn't do it justice",

The story itself was fine, but it really wasn't spooky. At every opportunity the scares seemed forced and tired like a joke that had gone on far too long and wasn't worth the punchline. The grudge's ghosties were lame in comparison to their original counterparts and the atmosphere was dark; but not haunting.

But what lurks beneath the surface is nothing more than a sloppy, lifeless entry into an already dead franchise. We are introduced to some intriguing ideas, as it connects the dots to the early originals, but everything that follows feels head-scratchingly disjointed and lifeless.\n\nThere are glimmers of hope here, which unfortunately are too and far between. What we have instead is a jarringly edited, strangely structured franchise entry that is as scarce on its main attraction and antagonist Kayako, as it is with scares and tension.\n\nSPOILER ALERT! - it's really bad, and coming from a non-follower of the franchise, even I left the cinema furious at the lack of involved Kayako has in this movie. Aside from two lackluster moments, we are induced to nothing more than a \"creak creak creak\" to inform us that Kayoko is in the building.\n\nWhat a slap on the face for any fan of the franchise, and what a boring ride for anyone looking to kill a couple of hours on a cold January night.",

With a Rated R rating, the film adds much gore to the typical jump scares we are used to from these movies.\n\nThe gore and CGI is very good but the story is so basic and the story time jumps so much that you might miss something and get lost.

Also, see it with someone who won't mock you endlessly when you mistake Betty Gilpin for Jodie Comer for the entire film!\n\nThis movie is a mess made from tonal inconsistencies, underdeveloped characters, and effective but disappointing jump scares. What Greta Gerwig's Little Women did right with nonlinear storytelling, this movie did very wrong (who would have thought I'd be comparing the two). The acting in this movie is better than expected, but the four different plot angles pull you in too many directions. I was unable to connect with any of the characters, except perhaps the very good boy who lapped Detective Muldoon's ankle. My least favorite character was the rough-looking, always smoking and drinking, never listens to his female partner, talks in almost a whisper detective who offered absolutely nothing to this film beyond a comfortable film cliche and vague backstory.\n\nThis iteration of The Grudge does nothing new for the franchise. As in past films, the rules of the curse are unclear and reason behind the grudge's hold is flimsy (perhaps even more so with this film) and the whole thing feels unnecessary. There was one moment where William Matheson reflects on his view of the afterlife and a chance to be with his soon to be deceased wife where I thought the film might be getting at something new, but the scene is cut short with an out-of-place comical transition to Lorna Moody getting the hell out of there, causing me and others to laugh out loud.",

            "content": "The grudge \n2020\n15\nDirector: Nicolas Pesce\nStarring: Tara Westwood, Junko Bailey, David Lawrence brown, Zoe Fish, Andrea Riseborough, Demian Bischir, Lin Shay, Jon Cho etc\n\nOverall rating 25/100\n\nThe grudge follows cases of mysterious murder suicides that have been happening due to a possible curse inside a house. Wow the grudge was just terrible. It started off promising but got slowly worse and worse and less and less scary. Let's talk about this more in detail\n\nStarting off with a couple of positives the film did have some good building of tension and Jumpscares. The film did do a fairly decent job at building up tension throughout, it didn't always pay off but for the most part I was on the edge of my seat, so the film managed to make me feel tense. And the Jumpscares largely in the first half, were well executed and unexpected in places really catching you off guard. Sadly, this didn't stay consistent throughout as they became more predictable, but they worked for a decent amount of time.\n\nHowever, my first two negative points would be that the film was incredibly repetitive, and it had massive tonal inconsistencies. Wow this film really was just pretty much the same scene repeated over and over again, it had no substance or depth to it whatsoever. All it was, was people investigating something or walking around a house and seeing a demon and that's it. And the film did not blend its tones of horror and drama very well all. It was trying to and also failing to have fairly emotional scenes with characters that you either didn't care about or you knew they would be killed off.\n\nMy next two negatives would be that the movie is generic, and its pacing and tone got duller as the film progressed.  This movie didn't feel authentic or original. It just felt like a rehash of loads of other horror movies, they didn't add anything new to the genre at all therefore making me switch off about halfway through. And its pacing got slower and slower making me bored. The Jumpscares got more and more predictable so I got less scared as the film went on, and it was just so ridiculous in places I laughed when I shouldn't have done further adding to the tonal issues.\n\nMy next two positives would be the films interesting mise en scene and cinematography and its scary imagery. The film did do some interesting things with its visuals and set locations making for an excellent playground for a horror film to take place in. And its colour palette was creative as well to establish some form of emotion. And I have to admit the creature designs and imagery were very frightening and disturbing in places. The actual grudge creatures were terrifying with black liquid pouring out of there eyes and mouth it did get under your skin in places.\n\nMy next two negatives would be the films one dimensional characters and how you couldn't connect with any of them. All the characters either had no depth or development to them or had one function throughout the whole movie so you just couldn't connect with them. Another reason why you couldn't connect with them is because every single one of them gets killed off. It was so frustrating as they made you either like them or sympathise with them and then just kill them off like they were nothing it was incredibly annoying. \nMy final two positives would be that there were some good performances and attempts at character development. The performances from Lin Shaye was very disturbing and believable, and also John Cho who came across as very charming and likeable whenever he was on screen which was a welcome change from some other characters. There were also some attempts at giving backstories to some characters which worked in the short term for the film sadly these didn't pay off or go any deeper but at least there was some form of attempt.\n\nAnd my final negative which for me completely ruined the film was its terrible ending. The ending was one of the most disappointing and anticlimactic things I have ever seen with no payoff whatsoever. All they did was kill absolutely everyone off. Just when you thought they kept the mother and son alive for some form of decent ending she was also killed off. And we were then left with an awkward silence before the credits came on.\n\nOverall the Grudge had some good qualities and started well. But slowly fell apart as the film progressed. Making it dull, lifeless and irrelevant easily the worst horror film I have seen.",

I went in anticipating the storyline would follow the Saeki family, and hoped for new hair-raising scares. The opening scene was by far the best and most promising, as it was the only scene that featured the original house and main specter of the whole franchise. I was quickly disappointed when the rest of the scares were elicited by a completely different family who had fallen prey to the curse. Call me a sucker for sticking to source material, but adding in the familiar \"grudge noise\" whenever there's a jump scare coming, does not make it a Grudge movie. Even though there were a few similar scenes to those of the Ju-on movies, as well as the American remakes of the early 2000's, the absence of the original characters made it hard to see it as a genuine addition to the franchise. Overall, if you have no nostalgia for this movie's predecessors, or like cop movies with a few jump scares, you may like it. Otherwise, stick to the other Grudge movies where the hair is aplenty and that death rattle comes from its original owner.",

Both of the reboots conjure inspiration from a series of Japanese horror films collectively gathered under the title of \"Ju-On.\" For me, the Ju-On franchise is particularly esteemed, its installments (especially the first and third ones) being some of the few horror films which have genuinely scared me. Both American reboots, in general, while not as effective as the Japanese originals, are not terrible (at least not to the extent critics have painted them to be), but the 2004 reboot is better than this one. Where this 2020 reboot is concerned, I really only have two issues with it: 1) unfortunately, it is pretty dull; the scares and characters are very generic \u2014 the film largely falls short in evoking fear/tension and in engaging viewers to become invested in what is going on; I caught myself feeling restless in the theater, even slightly bored, several times during the movie; and 2) the film gave me the impression that it misinterpreted how the Ju-On curse works (compared to how it was depicted in the Japanese films and the 2004 reboot); my mind was analyzing on the drive home, trying to make this film's vision (this film's plot) fit with what has already been established, and regardless of the perspective I took, there are clear inconsistencies in the way this movie presents the curse, both in relation to all the other films and also in relation to itself. Overall, I've seen worse, but I've seen better too. Stick with the 2004 reboot (unrated version).",

The one thing that stood out, that bothered me, was they chose to have everyone drive vehicles from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s even though the storyline takes place in the early 2000\u2019s, although I think they did this to drive the vintage narrative of the storyline.",

A lot of jump scares but not enough to salvage a bad screenplay. I can't put the blame on Nicholas Pesce as he obviously didn't get to use his potential. A horror movie shouldn't feel boring and I wasn't on the edge of my seat. In fact when the end credits started I thought to myself \"Is That It\".",

The Grudge is January's annual horror movie to open up the new year and wouldn't you guess it's awful! \nLet's go over the checklist of January horror movies. The Grudge isn't scary (Check) relies on false jump scares, dismembered bodies, and crazy people doing bloody things (Check) poorly acted (Check) populated with boring characters (Check) nonsensical story (Check) and last but not least, has an ending where it looks like the characters will win but the entity is still alive (Check) Congratulations The Grudge, you have completed the January horror movie checklist! Getting to more specific points, I'm going to give a mild spoiler warning, I don't consider it too much of a spoiler but I have to give the warning anyway. Our \"main character\" finds something on her job which is pretty mysterious, then about 60% of the entire film is flashbacks to how that thing got to where it was when she found it. The flashback sequences don't work at all, are paced together so poorly and randomly that it gets genuinely confusing as to what time period the film is in at the time, and it just makes for a flat out awful movie. As I stated before this movie is all false jump scares and loud noises. I never found myself tense once in the film, I just found myself prepared to plug my ears not wanting to be startled by the loud jump scare noise that was about to happen. I didn't learn a single thing about any of the characters, they were all so hallow and lifeless. The performances were also very dry, including one that was honestly hilariously bad. \nThe ONLY thing I can say that's good about this movie is the acting from Lin Shaye and John Cho. They're both terrific actors and I'm sure everyone else in this movie is too, it's just they were at least passable in this movie. Nothing too great but at least not bad. Honestly, what I found pretty sad with this storytelling is we got more characterization from characters we focus on in flashbacks instead of our main characters. I haven't seen any of the other Grudge movies but as long as they're better than this garbage I'll be happy. January is in full swing people, and I was ready to give this nonsense my lowest grade but it did just enough for me to not do so. Do yourselves a favor.....pass on this one and go see 1917 instead while it's still in theaters. I'm going to give The Grudge, a D-",

If you are looking forward to see the ghoul ghost of \"Kayako\", don't expect her to be on-screen for more than 2 seconds, because she will disappear in a blink of an eye, with the rest of the film revolving around an unknown Caucasian character and family that has pretty much took over the curse while the originals are on Holiday or something.

The first installment, which was itself a remake of the Japanese original, was a surprising box office success. Still, the majority of the audience and critics didn't really like the movie. The consequent theater releases were a disappointment. So, let's do a reboot of the remake, right? Nicolas Pesce seems to be a great filmmaker, he's able to easily generate tension and a dark environment, but such a huge misstep like this can hurt his career. The talented cast tries their best to bring this film to safe harbor, but the absurdly obvious, generic, formulaic, cliche story sunk the movie pretty hard. Its lack of surprising features, the extremely predictable jump scares, and the complete disregard for the audience, treating the viewers like the dumbest people ever, make The Grudge one of the worst horror films of the last few years.\"",

This scare-distrubution makes it an original movie.\n\nIn addition, the build-up to the first real scare develops very calmly, to such an extent that impatient people might think: when does the film really take off? It was almost non-narrative.\n\nThirdly, the film has good actors. The starring actress starts as an empty character but acts soon very well. She gains more depth and stays calm under the circumstances. In addition it's always a delight to have vetaran Lin Shaye in an (occult) horror movie (who starred in all the Insidious movies). But especially the relatively supporting role of the euthanasia counselor is cast very well. She has a creepyness and at the same time love about her.\n\nBeside that it's also a very atmospheric movie.\n\nWhat also is done very well is the absence of music in the first half of the end credits.\n\nI don't know how good the director is, but I think it's visible that Sam Raimi, who has experience with both good and bad receptions of his horror movies, produced the film, really trying to learn from his mistakes.\n\nActually I even want to see it a second time, because the theater room was full, and this way I can view the movie calmly.\n\nIt is possible that I am so positive about the film because I did not see the 2004 version, which makes me unable to compare.",

Originally a J-horror Japanese classic titled Ju-On, it went on to be remade in America in 2004 and catapulted itself into my childhood. This year's retread isn't like that one at all, and actually elevates itself slightly by not being a by-the-numbers remake. Slow and tedious at times, THE GRUDGE excells during the quiet moments it's characters have with each other. In between jump scares and shadows flitting by, THE GRUDGE tries to tell a real story about loss and grieving and death in the family. Unfortunately that is drowned out by the need to scare us and while the film succeeds in this only twice, director Nicolas Pesce succeeds in telling us a fresh story with the Grudge mythos. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50/5,\u00a0B",

I'll start this off by saying- It scared me but I always thought \"it's set over there so I have nothing to fear\". The only cool thing about the film was that it was set in America for once- which made it plausibly scary. What the film lacked was classic structure & CLASSIC scenes. I ponder- who was this movie made for ? If it was for the old fans where were the classic \"grudge goes down the stairs\" scene, the whole \"haunting\" the main character BARELY was shown. So I began thinking well maybe this was for the newcomers.... but that doesn't make sense either. The movie focus too much on three former tenants hauntings instead of just showing up the main character being utterly haunted. The ending didn't feel satisfying because the main character wasn't tormented like the classic grudges/ju-ons were. A classic grudge movie has a main character who enters the house and starts experiencing strange encounters- through investigative work they find out about the curse with the famous lines about \"the grudge\" being born out of someone dying in rage or powerful emotion.... but instead of SHOWING this the film puts it at the beginning of the movie in TEXT.... Why? The only eye witness testimony the main character has is a person who ALREADY investigated the haunting and ended up going \"crazy\"... sure would've loved to see his story more than hers. In the end comparing it to the other grudge/ju-on movies I did not see the appeal. In the end they didn't achieve the most basic aspect of the film- they never explained why the grudge existed. How do you make a film & not explain the abusive father who killed the mother and son ??? Yes this is implied.... but never outright said like in other grudge movies. \n\nIf this were a movie for us oldcomers, it did a poor job of showing us \"classic\" scenes like seeing the grudge go down the stairs and even the shower scene was LACKLUSTER.\nIf this were a movie for the newcomers, it failed to even explain why the grudge existed and focused too much on previous tenants and previous people who investigated the house.\n\nThis movie already failed before it was made.... did they not see the ring versus the grudge?

This film was this director's like third movie and it shows. This film is technically a sequel but thank god not by name because it makes no sense.\n\nIt completely misses the point of the tension and slow creeping horror of even the first American Remake. The 2004 film was by no means a perfect horror film but it had so much going for it even compared to the OG films. \n\nThis films flashes jumpscares in your face. And they're terrible jumpscares utilizing very poor looking flash zooms which, despite the irony of this, I thought we were done with after the 2000s. The ghosts feel incidental. When there are attempts at subtle horror, its completely lifeless because we've already had these dumbass looking zombie people flashed in front of us already (several times). \n\nThis film is a cheap misguided take on a beloved series of films that falls flat on its face that teeters on the point of being nonsensical, and is more stuck into tropes of the 2000s than the actual films that came from that decade.",

If you enjoy jump scares this is the movie for you but if you want anything other than that then probably wait for another horror film. Also, the film doesn't really focus on the Japanese villains so if you want to see Kayako or Toshio you'll be disappointed.",

We saw the house in Japan and the appearance of \"The Grudge\" or whatever, and that's where the movie should've ended. I'll preface this by saying I'm a huge fan of The Grudge series, having seen all 3 and the Ju On films as well. This movie was awful. The first film in years I've debated walking out of, but I stayed hoping I could get something good out of it or at the very least a few laughs.\n\nThe woman from the beginning of the movie (cant remember her name or anyone's name in this film) heads back to America to be with her family and the rest of the movie is based in America with her new home being \"The Grudge\". \n\nWe do get some back story of the home in Japan, like a line of dialogue about the home and that's about it, nothing else is said about the home I  Japan or the family that started the whole curse. It's all about this new American family and their grudge, which didn't really make much sense. \n\nThroughout the movie the woman, her husband, and their daughter are committing the murders. Not once do we see the original Japanese woman who incited this curse. Whoever wrote this script didn't really care about the source material or even understand anything. The woman kills her husband and daughter after coming home to America and whoever goes into their home is now subjected to The Grudge. Make sense? Not really. See, the original woman from Japan is what creates the Grudge and makes the woman from America kill her husband and daughter, and instead of the woman from Japan killing everyone like she did that couple, it's the american couple that does the killing.\n\nI'm not good with writing but I could've made a better script in a day than this garbage. \n\nSo, now we have a police officer who's the main character. Her acting was very stale and it doesn't get better. Anyway, she moves with her son to the same city or town or whatever of the american woman. She's assigned to a partner who'd seen a lot of the murders from that house. She decides to visit the house for herself and eventually the grudge follows her. \n\nLook, save yourself the trouble. This movie is the worst film I've ever seen. Its terribly written, horribly acted, and craps on the source material. Its garbage. I'd rather watch Cats than this movie.",

Keep you hands and feet inside the thread at all times, and enjoy the ride. Today's episode??? The Grudge (2020) \nFirst of all, my general consensus is that the movie had no flavor. It was 1.5 hours of cheap camera tricks, unjustified jump scares, and less emotion than a loaf of bread.\nSecondly, if the characters were trying to fish for a connection with the audience, then you're forgetting the pole; because there was nothing relatable for myself to attach to these characters. You get about 10 minutes of screen time with each of the 20 characters.\nFinally it seems they filmed 3 timeline segments, and just stitched them together for a quick, cheap circus grade horror flick. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I promise you I did. But I'm sure even Sarah Michelle Gellar is like, \"wtf did I just watch?\" \n*end scene*",

It's an anthology of sorts, starting at the original Grudge house, & ending with a troubled cop/widowed mother in Pensilvania, taking out a couple more families in the process. Things are a bit jumbled at first, but it all comes together in the end.\n\nThe cast did an ok job, considering how....unexpected this film was. Andrea Riseborough plays a widow, mom, & cop. John Cho plays a realtor. Lin Shaye plays a creepy old lady, (a role she was born for, & yeah, maybe getting typecast, but only 'cause she's so good!) And through various circumstances, they all fall victim to the curse born in a quaint little house in Japan, so long ago. They, along with the rest of the cast, did a fine job of giving us characters who seemed to know Death was following them; they wouldn't have felt outta place in a Poe story.\n\nThe effects do use a bit more CGI than the previous iterations, but there's still plenty of practical effects work to be enjoyed.\n\nThere wasn't much music to speak of, the film relied mostly on quiet atmosphere to heighten the tension.\n\nThe Grudge 2020 doesn't surpass the original, not by a long shot, but it wasn't terrible, least by my standards. It continued the narrative in an interesting way, & it wasn't detrimental to the franchise as a whole. 3 outta 5 stars, just a helpful reminder, Japanese ghosts don't mess around!",

Around two dozen jump-scares and only jumped twice. The vast majority of the jump scares you can see coming.\n\nThis film is incredibly boring where 30 minutes in I was already looking at my watch. There is many families and time jumps in this film that you barely get any character development. Character development helps get you scared and anxious enough for any jump-scares or horrifying gore scenes. This film fails to get me to care about one character. All I wanted to see was The Grudge kill everyone. \n\nThe only good part about the film I can say is the performance from Lin Shaye. She was great in this film, and though the other actors/actresses didn't shine, it didn't help how bad the script was. Unless you like to laugh at bad horror movies, then don't watch this. Even if you like bad horror movies, you shouldn't spend the money on a ticket to see it.",

But this outing is not only unscary, but loses the appeal of a being a new avenue for suspenseful material that our first run was.\n\nDetective Muldoon (played by Andrea Risborough), relocates to a small town with her young son, where she encounters a creepy house with a troubled history of making anyone who bonds with it go insane. It's not long before Muldoon gets tied up in the mess and starts losing her mind in the process. We're also taken on a journey with other families who have encountered the evil force in past years.\n\nIt's not entertaining, resorting to regular jump scares to jolt its audience out of falling to sleep and the story jumps all over the place while failing to form one sincere bond with any of the characters. Who are these people? You'll have to use your imagination.\n\nThe way Nicolas Pesce links the timeline and the stories is clever, but all it accomplishes is successfully connecting a very poorly done story. It's short 94 minute run time in this case is also a good thing. It's not a good film but at least it doesn't go out of it's way to waste your time.\n\nLet's hope 2020 gives us a scarier and more original journey to theaters this year.",

However, I had begun to see the extremely negative reviews on the movie a day before I was set to see it for myself. Negative reviews on movies never changed the way I viewed them so I did not let the reviews bother me. After sitting through a movie that felt as if it had gone on for an eternity, even though it was only slated to be 90 minutes, I had come to the conclusion that this movie was just plain bad. Way too many cliche jumpscares that I, as a horror fan, saw coming from a mile away. The story jumps years too often and tries to put too much content into such a short film. At some points the story becomes too foggy and hard to keep up with. The main character Detective Muldoon was someone I had no faith, someone that I did not think was important or someone I wanted to root for. The reason for the Two star rating instead of One is because the special effects team on this film was great. The gore and blood in the movie gave it a creepy and atmospheric tone. However, all in all I would not pay almost 30 dollars for two tickets to this movie.",

This film is just lazily written, boring, failed jump scares, dragging plot, and horrible cgi to boot.\n(Some Backstory)\nThis film takes place right after the first film and is essentially about how the curse made it to America. However the spirits used in this film are not the same ones from the original films the spirits are American in origin with the main spirit a female the secondary spirit a little girl (who replaced the roll of the little boy) and the husband the third and final spirit. It also switches the rolls around having the wife (The main spirit) murdering her Child and husband instead of the husband murdering his child and wife like in the first two films. \nIn a film about ghosts you would think you would see more Ghosts but not this film for too much backstory played out as the ghosts became secondary to the story. Not to mention when the ghosts did finally appear it was a  complete let down. \nAll the terror and dread that you felt in the first two films are completely absent in this dumpster fire of the movie. Not even the jump scares and vote a sense of fear during this film. Part of that is because all the job skills that are in this room were shown in the trailer so you're anticipating that it's going to happen. \nAll in all this movie felt for too long with zero pay off. The spirits look and feel or so far from what this franchise initially set up it feels like it's an entirely separate film. \nThey could've called this movie anything else i would've been ok with it. Sure the film s would've sucked but at least it wouldn't have ruined the franchise. \n(This is a minor note for the trademark noise that the sphere makes the croaking that was used in ALL the trailers and advertisements, yeah hardly in the film. CAN YOU IMAGINE PREDATOR NOT MAKING HIS SIGNATURE SOUND IN THE PREDATOR FILMS?!? It is nit picking but that noise is a big part of the dread and Uncomfortability that the movie used to create. Its a calling card before something horrific happens.)",

If you heard that the movie is slow... well.. to me, a movie buff, I enjoyed the pacing because it gave me a chance to get a feel for the main character, which I like in horror movies. While I do feel the movie was somewhat false marketed, it was still good for what it turned out to be. As for the ending, I can't say that it was horrible or great, it was just kind of right there in the middle. I would give this movie a B+",

The movie was not scary at all whatsoever; if jump scares tend to get you, then you might get frightened once or twice but they get inserted in so many scenes that you might as well play a drinking game of when to expect the next one. The film falls in the same trap that most uninspired horror movies fall into, that being that the film itself has an intriguing premise to follow, but with little to no development or answers and the fact that these characters are entrenched in hopeless situations where it's pointless for us as the audience to care about especially if they are just going to end up as cannon fodder. The cast wasn't too bad, in fact, I appreciated their hard work and got crept by Lin Shaye's character, they just had the misfortune to work with a weak script that led to a very predictable outcome. The film had potential, but it didn't deliver enough to the point that it will reside in people's memories that the 2004 film at least was able to do.",

The blatant disregard for the original masterpiece, the throw-away caucasian grudges, and monotonous storyline made all other horror movie remakes, which were by no means good, wonderful. Okay, you added a biracial couple- the black guy wants his wife to commit suicide to escape mental illness. Okay, you started the movie in Japan- that scene was 5 minutes long(if that). Okay, you casted an Asian guy- well, he's not even Japanese... Plus, his name is PETER SPENCER. By the way, he's the first main character to die. I'm not scared of children or white people; I'm scared of abused, vengeful ghosts who have no weaknesses or remorce because all they want is for me to suffer the same fate as them.

There were scenes that just made no sense, the movie literally spoiled things for you by talking about things that hadn't happened yet on screen. There's a scene at the end of the movie where Muldoon calls Goodwin to her house because she needs to talk at 0423, once he gets there she says something to him about what happened to his old parter is happening to her and she's afraid it will make it hurt her son, the camera shows him take a hit of his cigarette and then just cuts to the next scene like he was supposed to say something and they edited it out. However, that next scene is literally her driving her son saying she needs to get him away and keep him safe, where do you think she takes him, to the cursed house that if anyone steps into will die. All she tells him is to stay in the car and don't open the door no matter what but he leaves the window wide open.\n\nThe whole, anyone that steps into the house is automatically cursed thing just doesn't hold up. Maybe I'm overthinking this but you mean to tell me that after a double murder suicide only 1 detective stepped into the house, no crime scene units, EMS, medical examiners? Nope just 1 detective. In my theater there were 8 people, my friend and I, a group of 4 guys a few rows in front of us and a couple in the row behind us. Once the movie was over with the terrible ending it did have, the woman yelled \"I hate when they end movies like that\".",

            "content": "\"The Spiritual Prankster\"\n\t\n\tNicolas Pesce took a giant swing and missed when he decided to helm another installment in the long-running \"Grudge\" series of films.  Unfortunately, this rendition of the haunted house tale does very little to mystify and terror audiences as Takashi Shimizu's 2002 classic, \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" did so many years ago. The film does nothing new to reinvent the horror space in any meaningful way, instead, it utilizes the same old tired and overused tropes of the 2010s we have all grown accustomed to; ominous noises, character investigation, music sting, jump scare, rinse and repeat. \"The Grudge (2020)\" is a dime a dozen, it is no exception to the rule, it is the rule.\n\n\t\"The Grudge (2020)\" features a handful of characters we are introduced to throughout the entirety of the film's ninety-minute runtime. We are first presented with the character of Fiona Landers (Tara Westwood) who was presumably working in Tokyo at the original home before deciding to flee back to the states out of sheer panic. Despite her eagerness to leave, it means nothing because when she returns home to 44 Rayburn Drive, the curse of Kayako has already infected the family and plagued the home. This inciting event kicks off the haunting that will alter the lives of all who enter the home. However, it is not Fiona who functions as our main protagonist, it is instead Detective Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough) that takes up that role. As an audience member, you will recognize that Muldoon will be the primary character because Buhler and Pesce pull out all of the stops in an attempt to make you emotionally care for her and her situation. Nevertheless, we follow her as she and her partner Goodman (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) investigate a car crash from a couple of years ago. It is then revealed to everyone present that this grizzly death has been linked to the sinister house on Rayburn Drive. Goodman's response to hearing this information ignites the spark that lights Detective Muldoon's obsession with the history of the home. From this moment forward the film begins its story by showcasing the tales of multiple families from across the years who have had the displeasure of stepping foot inside the home. We see real estate agents Nina (Betty Gilpin) and Peter Spencer (John Cho) as they deal with the stress of their unborn child, along with long-time married couple, Faith (Lin Shaye) and William Matheson (Frankie Faison) who's warped reality of the curse leads to a few inexplicable events. The family matters are all uncovered by Muldoon as she sifts through voice recordings and case files in order to uncover what truly occurred to the people connected to 44 Rayburn Drive. Muldoon chooses to investigate the case with such a burning desire, but due to her detachment from the house and the prior cases, we are left wondering why she would even continue. All the while, we go along for the ride with Muldoon as she falls deeper into the rabbit hole unshrouding the mystery. However, with every discovery, Muldoon's world becomes more consumed with the curse of Kayako. The film's nonlinearity is a genius reflection of the structure utilized in the 2002 original. Unfortunately, the issue with this scattered nonlinear technique of storytelling is that it sets up scares, frightens the viewers, and immediately jumps to the next scene without letting things breathe; it refuses to force the audience to sit with the traumatic actions being played out in front of them. The film would rather make you jump with cheap scares than establish a meaningful and terrifying mythos that can linger with viewers for years to come.\n\n\tAs with many horror films, characters always insist on showing a lack of competence and reasoning when faced with the circumstances at hand; let me be the first to tell you, \"The Grudge (2020)\" is no different. Whether it's Muldoon or Peter, almost everyone involved finds a way to display a lapse in judgment when the hauntings begin. Why did this person choose to hide there? Because they need a scare. Why did they step foot in that room? Because they need a scare. Why don't they just leave? Because they need a scare. \"The Grudge (2020)\" is littered with dozens of jump scares that are tremendously predictable and uninspired. Yet, the worst sin this film commits is that it just simply is not scary at all. Besides a few low effort jump scares featuring some corpses being flashed on-screen accompanied by a loud musical sting, the film does nothing more than make you groan and roll your eyes. To make matters even worse, this film has access to one of the most iconic j-horror monsters and completely wastes it. Kayako never comes across as a scary demon hellbent on vengeance but is instead perceived as nothing more than an unbathed prankster that wanders around aimlessly. At any chance he can get, Pesce always puts Kayako in the frame but never cleverly hides her or alludes to her presence; he just outright shows her. There is no inherent problem with that method, but when it is the only method applied, it becomes stale and feels as though they are simply baby feeding us. It is as if Kayako is nudging us and saying, \"Hey look, I'm over there.\" The fear of the unknown is a beautiful tool this film seems to have forgotten.\n\nUltimately, \"The Grudge (2020)\" suffers from a multitude of problems stemming from poor writing, terrible character development, a jumbled narrative that goes nowhere and some of the dullest scares the genre has to offer. Despite that, Pesce understands how to competently shoot a film, as majority of his choices when working behind the camera are extremely well thought out and executed. But, throughout the entirety of the film's runtime, \"The Grudge (2020)\" fails to plant any long-lasting seeds of genuine fear. It fails to deliver any meaningful scares, so if you are looking for a night of frights, you would be better served visiting YouTube and typing in the search bar, \"scary videos\".\n\nFinal Verdict: D-",

To start the original came out only 15 years ago and the last sequel came out in 2009 i believe so it\u2019s a bit odd that they would make a remake so soon. Anyways to the actual movie, To start there was no plot, no climax, no build up/suspense, nothing. In fact if i had not watched the original and had someone else help explain it to me i would\u2019ve been left very confused. 90% of the movie is a mashup of flashbacks to different murders which don\u2019t make sense. we barley see the main character and she is shown as crazy through the whole movie, no build up. An example of this was a little white girl with black hair, I was very confused as in the original it makes sense since she\u2019s asian she would have black hair but whatever, you could literally see her natural blonde hair in the front and her eyebrows were blonde. There\u2019s also no logic in this movie?? A cop is shown just going into a security closet and wondering around a evidence room. Anyways, the cheap IMovie effects Really add to the bad effects and makeup. besides the horrible plot and effects the acting was just horrible. in one scene a child is shown with a blank face just saying \u201cmommy i\u2019m scared\u201d . Hey but at least it was scary right ? nope. The gruge has little to no screen time which is extremely disappointing. The only scares that were shown were predictable \u201cjump scares\u201d .  Overall the acting, the logic, the effects, the plot, the scare, were all very disappointing. The gruge which is the entire concept of this movie was extremely overlooked and the story of her was not looked into at all. I would not recommend watching this movie at all ever.",

            "content": "It's not a remake.\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nLeaving The Grudge I have to say this. It's not that scary...\n\nDon't let that turn you away however! This well put supernatural/mystery film is actually a soft reboot of the original American remakes (it's literally The Grudge 4) that starts off as a brief prequel set in 2004. Fiona Landers calls Yoko to tell her she won't be able to take care of Emma Williams any longer, fleeing the Saeki residence to go back home in America after she'd encountered Kayako (Setting up the plot of the original 2004 remake). Returning home, Fiona finds she had carried the curse home with her...\n\nThis new entry in The Grudge only briefly shows Kayako at the Saeki residence when Fiona flees, after that, it's an entirely new cast of characters and spirits that haunt the film!\n\nThe \"new Kayako\" we're introduced to is more of a shared role between Fiona as well as her daughter, Melinda, among other spirits... These two are a venomous presence, with Melinda acting as a sort of omen that her more violent mother is nearby. The other spirits are various victims of the curse that appear throughout the film. One issue I have with the spirits isn't exactly about them, they're all great! It's moreso the fact that, for whatever reason (likely it being iconic to the franchise), Kayako's croaking death scream is used whenever a spirit is present. This is bothersome because Kayako's croak is due to her particular death, breaking her neck while screaming. In this sequel however, she isn't present, nor does anyone die in a similar fashion to her, so it feels strange that her croaks are used so out of context... It feels in a way that the studio wasn't confident in the new spirits..\n\nI will say though that the film was interesting through and through. It has a slower burn however, most of the hauntings become more abundant after around 45-50mins into the film and some of the scares are amazing little callbacks that toy with expectations, but others merely resort to jumpscares.\n\nDespite the negatives, I truly believe this film has all the potential required to revitalize the series (not like that godawful Rings film) and I'm hoping to see more films in the future!",

The scares weren't anything special. Kayako isn't even in this movie despite the intro either. It's just versions of their victims under the curse.

It drove me crazy that this movie basically had nothing to really do with the original Grudge movie (and Ju-On) Kayako would make that creepy noise because her neck was broken, and it made absolutely no sense as to why in this new a Grudge film every dead character makes the exact same noise too when their necks weren't broken or hell, they weren't even Kayako.

I remember the first film in 2004 being something different which created a scary atmosphere of a vengeful spirit that never lets go. Sadly, this reboot film lacks scares, terrible at creating a better story, and has a boring direction. The film's plot follows in 2004 were a lady that was working in Japan in a place that is haunted by a Grudge. She walks out of there, noticing something is following her. She decides to head home in America. In State side, something followed her home. A Year later, a real estate agent Peter (John Cho) and his wife Nina (Betty Gilpin) visit the same house that a family was mysteriously murdered. Only to get a vengeful spirit after them. Then, another couple moves into the house to experience the same thing. Years later, Detective Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough) and Goodman (Demian Bichir) are trying to connect these murders and what is the cause. Which they discover it is not the house that is haunted but an angry spirit that attaches itself from one person to another. The plot tries to expand from the original movie. Which might as well be a connection to the original. As characters bring the vengeful spirit into a new house in America. Which the film follows several characters in different time lines and their encounter with this mysterious spirit. The script lacks in delivering interesting characters as well. The performances could have been better but they are all forgettable with their roles. Andrea Riseborough and Demian Bichir characters are dull. John Cho and Betty Gilpin are are forgettable. There is that famous Grudge shower scene with Cho as he brushes his hair and a creepy hand looks like it is grabbing his head. Lin Shaye was the only decent performance playing a mentally unstable lady. The film's direction is boring. It had some brief scary moments and tone. Majority of the movie is just flat out boring and dull. It has some cheap scares of things popping out on screen which was nothing new. This is another terrible reboot like 2017 Rings which was worse. Overall, The Grudge was not good. The story is terrible. The script sucked at delivering characters. The direction lacked in scares and thrills. You will be on for one slow and boring horror ride.",

All they go for is cheap jump scares that have no meaningful build up and as this movie is going on I knew every time they were going to do some jump scare or shadow walking by or a face jumping out its just so predictable and this movie thinks it's scarier than it is. They make choices throughout that make zero sense and at the end the big twist you see coming from a mile away and it just feels thrown in for no reason. The only thing that was any good about this movie was the performance by Lin Shaye she was truly great in this movie that didn't deserve her or her performance but she couldn't even save it.

So saying that the movie is more or less slow with more jump scares then it trying to be a genuinely a scary movie. My person opinion is I loved the movie I grew up watching the original 2004 version. (SEMI-SPOILER)\u2014\u2014\u2014- I do have to say it was confusing that the movie jumped back and fourth between different times people were affected by the curse but it all came together when they state that everyone effected was \"linked\"together.",

The film starts with a background into the world of the protagonist and how the loss of her husband has affected her and her young son, but within minutes jumps right to her investigation into a house linked to a murder (The Grudge House)... which by the way has nothing to even do with the original movie! The film goes on to transition poorly between past and present, making it incredibly hard to keep up with what's actually going on. Pair that with terrible acting and jump scares that are nothing short of a \"Boo!\" affect, this movie will definitely leave you wondering WTF. This wannabe horror film takes the cake for probably the single worst movie made to date, and that's saying something.

            "content": "Wow was this movie absolutely terrible. Let me clarify anything here for anyone that may be remotely interested in this one. The movie actually started out as a complete reboot, but then they decided this one would actually be kind of a side story/sequel to The Grudge (2004). The movie actually takes place between The Grudge and the Grudge 2 (2006). The movie starts with an absolutely terrible way of telling the audience what the Grudge is (hint: it's better to show than tell people) and we learn if we forgot in the last 15 years that if someone is killed violently in a place their spirit stays there and haunts the place or something. Cut to Japan in 2004 and we find Fiona Landers (Tara Westwood) haunted by the Grudge and calling her husband Sam (David Lawrence Brown) stating that she wants to come home. Cue home. Fiona returns home to Sam and her young daughter Melinda (Zoe Fish). Then the movie jumps to 2006. The film goes back and forth between three years a lot with no queues it's changing time periods at all. We follow newly widowed Detective Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough) who's moved into a small town with her son Burke (John J. Hansen) after her husband has passed away. Her partner Detective Goodman (Demian Bichir) takes Muldoon under his wing. They uncover a body of a lady named Lorna Moody (Jacki Weaver) who appears to have been killed inside of her car off of a side road months back. This leads Muldoon and Goodman to an old case involving the house on 44 Reyburn. This is where we find out in 2004 Fiona Landers killed her husband and her daughter, the following year in 2005 the realtor named Peter Spencer (John Cho) killed his wife Nina (Betty Gilpin) and their unborn child, then to the present day 2006! See I'm breaking this down way better than the movie. Whoever directed this or edited this decided to show tidbits of info from Fiona and the Peter stories and not flesh them out fully, so as a viewer you're jumping back and forth between it all the entire time. It's super confusing and a real mess. Anyways Muldoon goes to the house and uncovers Faith Matheon (Lin Shaye) cutting her fingers off and absolutely nuts in the house (we find out their backstory involving Lorna as well). The thing is since Muldoon went into the house the curse is on her now. Apparently, anyone who goes into thsi house starts to see the ghost which either kills them or leads them to suicide. Goodman has never entered the house as his previous partner Detective Wilson (William Sadler) was driven mad by the murders there. I've gone on way too long, so let me wrap this up. Muldoon soon starts experiencing some real crazy stuff and sees the ghosts of the murdered victims including the classic Kayako Ghost (Junko Bailey) stalking her as Muldoon begins to investigate and figure out how to stop the grudge. The movie looks like it was shot for very cheap. There are some outright terrible CG effects here and some of the acting (especially Burke's) is just really bad. The jump scares are plenty here, but nothing is really too terrifying. I found some of the kills were well done, but with a plot that is jumping all over the place this one is really a mess in plot and for pacing. It's only an hour and a half long, but I felt like it was 2 and a half hours long. This is really bad and I can only say do yourself a favor and stay away from it.",

The screenplay isn't too bad and has some interesting touches concerning the mythology and its pretty gory mostly unnecessary but still appreciated. The big problem here is the abysmal direction. Set between the first 2 American films it concerns a woman who brought the curse home with him from Japan and than ends up murdering her family which curses her house. During the film we are introduced to a group of characters who come into contact with that house and are killed one by one. Nicolas Pesce director of the acclaimed Eyes of my mother doesn't know how to execute a single scare in the entire 93 minute run time. Theres no real atmosphere. The film is clunky, sloppy and boring. And because of the amateur cut you can't really experience any engagement with the stories or the characters. What a way to start the year. I can pretty much say that I may stop watching movies if I see anything worse than this, this year. Just atrocious and embarrassing and I'm talking to you Sam Raimi for having a hand in this.",

It had nothing to do with the original or the American remake. they had it right for the first 5 mins with the scene in Japan but then that's it. nothing else was the grudge. it was just ghost haunted house murder mystery. change the name of the movie and then I'll watch it maybe one more time but nope just don't watch the movie expecting the grudge. I sat there wondering what the hell am I watching. The gargle noise was used here and there but the Japanese girl with the long black hair isn't here and the little white boy that meows or whatever isn't here either. Lmao God that disappointed me. Change the title of this movie please lol",
