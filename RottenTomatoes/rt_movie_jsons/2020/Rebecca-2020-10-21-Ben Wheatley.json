        {
            "content": "Wheatley's Rebecca is solely a dramatisation, and does no justice to the original novel. It is full of spectacle and air where the plot should be. \n\nRebecca, at its core is a psychological thriller exploring the deeply sinister motives of a murderer (Maxim De Winter/Armie Hammer). The strange, one could almost say reverse Oedipal complex which dominates the De Winter's isolating relationship is the focus for the entire narrative - his patronising and arrogant comments \u2018I'm asking you to marry me you little fool', and infantilisation of his new wife, \u2018You've lost that strange  young lost look I loved' suggests pedophilia, and yet in Wheatley's interpretation of this classic horror, he has sadly conformed to the trivial and painstakingly untruthful idea - that Rebecca is solely a Gothic romance.\n\n The cinematography and golden age glamour perhaps distracts from the obvious lack of characterisation from Lily James, whose charming buoyancy is the opposite of the shy, timid and easily persuaded young Mrs De Winter. Aside from the incredible characterisation of Mrs Danvers, (Kristin Scott Thomas), the narrative indulges in the romance of a man twice the girl's age (which is, again, omitted) with soft sex scenes on the beach and unnecessary \u2018romantic' smooches. The use of the red dress to symbolise promiscuity for the ghost of Rebecca is sadly obvious and superficial, whilst the lack of key symbols, such as the rhododendrons (female sexuality) are omitted. Sadly, it can be concluded that Wheatley has falllen, or rather indulged in the popular theory that Rebecca is a romance, and attempts to please his audience through glam and glitter. \n\nIf you want to watch a visually beautiful film and have not read Rebecca, you will be delighted if slightly disturbed by the visual hints at the unequal and dangerous power dynamic between the couple. If you know Rebecca, you will be outraged at the like-ability of this narcissistic murder, and confused by the dramatisation.",

Rebecca is Daphne du Maurier's crowning achievement as a novelist. It is a romantic mystery with a touch of noir and the paranormal. The story is peculiar because it leaves you perpetually distressed, yet hopeful for a happy ending. It can translate well to the big screen. I like the older movie better, but this is still good and I would never discourage anyone from watching it. I gave it 4 1/2 stars. Given a choice I would watch the old version over this one because that's what I grew up with.",

I can never understand why filmmakers decide to make a film based on a book if they know they are going to completely change the principal characters and vital plot points. It's an insult to the classic Rebeca by Daphne Du Maurier for this film to have the same name as the book. I have to wonder if the screenwriters' and director even fully read the book or if they decided to take the concept and loosely make a movie based upon it; the movie is inspired by, not based on the book; so much of the story and the people has been stripped away, it's something different entirely. Here's a tip: if you're writing a screenplay based on a book but can't even keep the essence of the main characters, simple details, the theme, or important plot points, and have to add in scenes that would never occur- then maybe don't write or make the film.",

For the first two thirds of the movie I must admit I found it rather entertaining, hewing close to the 1940 film.  But in the final third the film went off the rails.  I never read the book, so I checked Wikipedia to see which film more closely resembled the Du Maurier novel.  It turns out that this movie is much closer to the original source material.  However, that doesn't mean it is a better movie.  The same thing happened with Mildred Pierce. The 2011 miniseries with Kate Winslett was  closer to the novel, but Joan Crawford's 1945 film was much better.  Anyway, this Rebecca really isn't really all that bad, I just think it's more worthwhile to invest two hours in the earlier film.",

Despite his first wife being a cheater and manipulative woman, Maxim still killed her, which made him a murderer and, worst of all, his second wife became an accomplice when she decided to prove his husband's \"innocence\", so they could be together. It is also annoying that Maxim hid so many secrets about his first wife from his second wife and, at the end of the movie, he became brutally honest with the second wife, and they both decided to work as a team. In summary, I think the movie plot is mostly weak and both Maxim and the second wife are half-cooked characters.",

Armie Hammer and Lily James are well cast as the central characters, but it's Kristen Scott Thomas who walks off with the film, brilliantly encapsulating Mrs Danvers despite the looming shadow of Judith Anderson from Hitchock's 1940 original.

That's especially true when a director attempts to follow in the footsteps of a legendary director.

While the film features a superb BAFTA-nominated production design, gorgeous cinematography, and excellent performances by Lily James, Kristen Scott Thomas and Ann Dowd, the suspense factor that made this picture's predecessor a classic is virtually nonexistent here. Instead, this offering tediously rumbles along, tossing out occasional mildly interesting revelations but never reaching out and grabbing viewers in the way that a Hitchcockian-type tale should. The story even becomes somewhat at muddled as it moves toward its conclusion, diluting the impact of whatever modest chills it may have built up along the way. Indeed, this release is, once again, further proof that, when it comes to emulating cinematic icons, it's generally best to leave well enough alone.",

However, as with too many remakes, the makers had a lot more money to throw at it, and the storytelling suffered under the weight of the overproduction. The thudding music was overbearing (I already know how to feel, thank you very much); the swooping camera, the overheated colors, and the over-the-top grandeur of this Manderley kept pulling me out of the story (\"You're impressed, aren't you? Aren't you? Isn't this all blowing your mind?\"). Add to that the ridiculous liberties taken with terrific source material that did NOT need new inventions and twists, and I grew increasingly vexed. My husband, however, loved it. I recommend hunting down the Jeremy Brett version. (The Olivier/Fontaine version is classic, but the Hollywood censoring of the story is regrettable.) It's available on DVD from at least one specialty vendor. Look, too, for the audio book read by Anna Massey. Superb!",

It follows the original novel a bit more closely than Hitchcock's version. Lily James playing the new Mrs de Winter does a good job of playing naivet\u00e9 but, as the story progresses, her character doesn't really develop far enough. Armie Hammer plays the role of Maxim de Winter stiffly and superficially. Kristin Scott Thomas is the most compelling. She plays Mrs Danvers, the housekeeper, who wants to keep the first Mrs de Winter \"alive\". It's a slow movie with lush cinematography and there are some satisfying twists \u2014 especially if you haven't seen the original movie or read the book. Unfortunately, though, this version of the story doesn't bring any innovation to the plot when it needs to and falls a bit flat by the ending. It has the feel of an old-style Hollywood movie but the director seems to want to make a safe movie that will be liked by everyone who watches it. This means it's not really suspenseful enough and loses some of the potency of the original. Unfortunately, the Hitchcock version is not available on streaming services (as far as I can tell). So this one will have to do. Worth watching on a rainy afternoon or while you're in lockdown during a pandemic.",

Based on the book of the same name by Daphne du Maurier, a young newlywed arrives at her husband's imposing family estate on a windswept English coast and finds herself battling the shadow of his first wife, Rebecca, whose legacy lives on in the house long after her death. Rebecca was one of my favorite mystery novel, and even though I did not remember much of the detail, I still know the major plot points. The book was good because it set up the mystery very well and really hook you in. This made the twist so unexpected and great. With this, I hope that the movie will capture the mystery feeling and the strong effect of Rebecca. However, I felt that the movie did not fully hook me into its plot and the mystery. One of the reasons is that it focused more on the romance aspect. I think that the romance worked because of the great acting from the actors. Also, the cinematography was very well done, especially the mansion and the coast. However, this focus on romance made the plot not as interesting and hooking, leading to the twists being not as impactful as it should. Overall, a decent movie, but did not capture the mystery of the original material. 6.5/10",

He meets a young woman (Lily James) while on vacation, and they quickly hit it off and get hitched.  She comes back to live with him on his expansive estate, but upon arrival, she finds herself living in the shadow of his dead wife, Rebecca.  Now I have never seen the original Alfred Hitchcock movie, but I didn't want that to be the reason to be that I skipped this.  I've seen the majority of his greatest hits, but I managed to miss his only film that won Best Picture.  Unlike most, however, I am not opposed to remaking a movie that is 80 years old.  Nobody talks about Rebecca these days, and as long as you're not doing a shot-for-shot remake a la Gus Van Sant's Psycho, I feel like you can do something with an update.  I obviously can't speak to comparing the two films, but as a standalone movie, I think this does have merit to it.  Now, if you happened to have seen a trailer to this, I can't say that it gives you an accurate depiction of what you are getting.  Netflix is making it seem like it is like the sexy and trashy Fifty Shades of Grey or their series You when in actuality, that is far from the truth.  Sure, attractive people are falling for each other, which is the key to almost every romantic movie ever made, and you are going to get that here as well.  At its core, this is much more of a mystery-drama than anything else.  The production values impressed me right from the start, and I was feeling both the charm and the romance as these two characters are getting together.  The romance is only prevalent in the beginning; for the remainder of the film, that is where the intrigue comes into play.   I enjoyed the genre-bending that they did here, and there was a point where I could easily see this becoming a horror movie; the glances and looks that the staff gives this woman leave options open as the story unravels.  It feels like they primed the film for a Hitchcockian twist, and for a while, I thought I was going to get a progression like Vertigo.  The girl never reveals her first name after all, and the writing is twisty enough that I kept guessing.  I won't spoil if there is or is not a twist, but I was satisfied with the direction they ultimately ended up taking this.  I don't think Rebecca is perfect, and I do have criticisms.  This movie is pushing two hours for its runtime, but I didn't feel like it was too long.  I thought that events move a bit too quickly.  I bet that this could have been very successful as a short miniseries; Netflix recently knocked it out of the park with The Queen's Gambit, and if filmed and divided up in the same way, this could have been just as big of a hit.  I also didn't care for a few of the music choices in this.  Typically I can get with an anachronistic number that doesn't fit the time, but here it drew too much attention to itself for no payoff.  I did ultimately enjoy this, however, and I do give it a moderate recommendation.",

Rebecca is a fair drama thriller film that is beautiful to look at with the set locations, cinematography, and Ben Wheatly trying to deliver a mystery thriller direction.

The plot follows Lily James character as she runs into Maxim (Armie Hammer) who owns an estate. They both fall for each other. When Lily is being driven away. Maxim proposes to her. Which they get married and she moves into the estate. She soon finds out he is a widow after his former wife was lost at sea. And apparently drowned. When Mrs. Danvers (Kristen Scott Thomas) is rude and unwelcoming to her. She discovers that there is so much more that she does not know. It was a decent plot. Starting out as Lily James is a girl that wants to travel. And takes the companionship as a job to get her to travel. Until she runs into Armie Hammers character which the films direction becomes like a romantic drama film. Except Hammers character has an attitude every time she brings up about his former wife who passed away. Or avoids talking about his past. The plot does change gears in the final half hour when the twist is revealed. And it becomes something more of a serious drama. Which is also where it disappoints with a twist that feels a little short handed. Lily James is lovable as Mrs. de Winters. She is sweet and curious. It is difficult to not like her character. James delivers a great performance. Armie Hammer is good as Maxim. Playing a mysterious character which he is struggling with his past. Kristen Scott Thomas is okay playing Mrs. Danvers. Who looks disgusted every time she sees Mrs. de Winters. Ben Wheatly does deliver a beautiful cinematography and tone with the set locations. And trying to build an eerie bleak mystery.

With his ninth feature, writer/director Ben Wheatley has crafted a passable remake that offers a fairly uninspired interpretation of the classic novel. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to reinvent a beloved Hitchcock classic on the big-screen, but he pulls it off admirably. Using captivating cinematography, Wheatley draws viewers into the gothic world of a woman haunted by her former mistress. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's period setting. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Lily James delivers a star-making performance as Mrs. de Winter. With mesmerizing expressions, she conveys the curiosity, innocence and jealousy of the iconic literary character. Armie Hammer is also excellent in the role of a rich aristocrat with a troubled past. While he isn't given much to do, he brings tough sensitivity to the character. Although \"Rebecca\" is undeniably an admirable remake, ultimately it is not a flawless film. Its story is highly formulaic, and follows beat-by-beat the plot of the original. Moreover, it builds to a saccharine conclusion that comes across as misjudged. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved novel will definitely enjoy \"Rebecca\" and so will movie-goers seeking old-fashioned entertainment. At a time when Hollywood seems to be obsessed with remakes of classics, its a cautionary reminder that Hitchcock's masterpieces are meant to be left alone.",

James and Hammer seem capable, and Thomas, while certainly a strong actress who demonstrates an understanding of the Mrs. Danvers character (feeling less like the off-kilter obsessive, and more like a more verbose, generically creepy Lurch from the Addams Family), seems to exist in the shadow of Judith Anderson.

And this is just to speak about the female protagonist. Mr. de Winter was not even there, he has nothing for himself.

It begins with romance across the classes but at it's heart is a mystery, the mystery being the circumstances around Rebecca's death and why she still, even in death seems to have such a strong hold over the lives she touched.

A wonderful adaptation with brilliantly cast archetypes of womens power, the men paled by comparison which was a welcome contrast between 1940 and 2020 direction as well as a spotlight on how well Du Maurier channeled timeless female strengths 80 years ago!\n\nFor me the garish yellow suits the alfa males cowardice; fear of living alone, of betrayal and of losing face. This actor was very close to the Maxim in my mind, conjured and refined from re-reading the book a thousand times; handsome, commanding, hotheaded yet weak in character... defined by priviladge not achievement... a shell. We are not meant to fall in love with Maxim,  he is an object of pity; a male in distress. It is Du Maurier's  simpering, unnamed heroine who defeats her dragon, embraces her dead rival and embodies all women to rescue her man for better or worse and live on... \n\nThe book strikes a chord with women and this film highlights and celebrates girl power where Hitchcock placed artful, broody shadows, perhaps to keep the book within his social lens and time. Nothing can touch the original masterpiece however this film, in many ways, is faithful Du Mauriers cunning flip of stereotypes.\n\nMost critics are comparing the film to Hitchcock's vision not Du Maurier's book and for that very reason have missed the magic.",

Kristen Scott Thomas was delightfully creepy as the obsessed housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. Armie Hammer was swoon worthy as Maxim de Winter and you can understand why a lonely middle class girl would marry him after a very short acquaintance. He played a very difficult character in a appealing way.",

            "content": "Rating: C\n\n\"All in all, Netflix's version of Rebecca gets lost in trying to balance so many genres in just one film. Ben Wheatley does a great job controlling the pacing, offering enough time to develop the main characters and the core relationship. However, the tone changes are far from being well-executed, leading to an utterly absurd, rushed, convoluted last act out of nowhere that raises logical questions and leaves the viewer with a false sense of uncertainty. A well-structured, entertaining first half partially compensates for the weirdness that overflows the second part. Lily James and Armie Hammer deliver great performances, as does Kristin Scott Thomas, but the production design (supported by terrific costumes) steals the spotlight. Clint Mansell's score doesn't go unnoticed, but its placement is exceptionally inefficient. In the end, the attempt at creating a horror atmosphere with the \"haunted\" mansion storyline is so anti-climactic that I can't wholeheartedly recommend this flick\u2026\"",
