The woman appears to have vanished from a locked room, and there are hints of terrible deeds committed within the hospital walls. As the investigation deepens, Teddy realizes he will have to confront his own dark fears if he hopes to make it off the island alive.",

If you think about it, this movie actually makes no sense.  There's no way that the protagonist could be the 67th inmate when we clearly see him interviewing other inmates in an earlier scene who have no idea who he is, have never seen him before, and who give him instructions to \"run.\"  If he was an inmate, they would have no reason to give him any such warning.  And in other ways, the movie is needlessly overcomplicated for the ending to work.  I'm still trying to get through the ending and its taking me several days because it drags on SOOOOOO long!!!!   This is just not a great movie and it needs a lot of trimming.",

The film tells a story of a inspector who investigate in an hospital because a woman was disappear, but he is going to understand that the staf is not really nice. The main actor is Leonardo Dicaprio an famous actor. There are other good actor like Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley.\nThe plot seems to be gripping but classical, just a normal police film. And that is the best quality of the movie, it is more and more strange during the film, an atmosphere take place during the all movie.\n\nspecial effects  are good for the time but there are not too much because they are not importante for the movie. The photography is really impressive and keep the atmosphere of the movie. It is really helping and give the film better than it is. Acting is very powerful but this is not a surprise because the renowned of actor are real, they are extremely spectacular.\n\nThe script can be not original but it marking dwon very fast and the script make new questions during all the movie. The plot twist is impressive and never we can imagine that it is really shoking.\n\nShutter Island is a very famous film but it deserve is place in the industry. every things are perfect, if you doesn't see the film go see it.",

Without giving away too much of the plot, Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshall who travels to a remote and virtually inaccessible island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate a missing person case at a hospital for the criminally insane.  Much like Cape Fear from twenty years earlier, Shutter Island feels like a bit of a departure for Scorsese, a suspenseful neo-noir movie that is designed more for pure entertainment than it is for the exploration of complex themes.  As implausible as the twist at the end feels in retrospect, it still packs a punch and is worth watching a second time to get a feel for how it is all set up.  Again, it is not Scorsese at his greatest, but it proves that a good Scorsese is still pretty watchable.",

It's still a creepy, suspenseful, perfectly watchable genre homage to the great Alfred Hitchcock, but compared to Scorsese's other great recent work, it just doesn't pay off. That's mainly because of the \"surprise\" ending, which doesn't really feel like a resolution at all. It's highly disappointing, considering what came before it is often superb. The 1950s period details, the terrific cinematography, the moody score and 'Spellbound/Vertigo' homages, the vivid WWII flashbacks, the palpable tension--all of that is betrayed by the cheat of an ending. Still, it's never boring and Scorsese has assembled a fine cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is starting to carve out a nice career for himself out of beady-eyed paranoia, and gives his scruffiest performance yet. It's nice to see him, a young actor who has paid his dues, go toe-to-toe with some of the best character actors around--Ben Kingsley, Max Von Sydow, Mark Ruffalo, John Lynch Carroll, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, and especially Jackie Earle Haley and Michelle Williams, who provide the best interactions with DiCaprio. The interrogation set-pieces provide some chewy \"actor's scenes.\" Things chug along nicely until that finale that sends this thing off the tracks. That it never recovers is a narrative sin Scorsese should know better than to commit. But hey, even Hitchcock disappointed once in a while",

The direction and soundtrack manage to create a great atmosphere for this thriller and make all the madness of the protagonist very intriguing, the only negative point is that a part of the plot is delivered too early, the moment he discovers the note in the room of the fugitive and in some following scenes he is warned about the number of patients, just connect the dots and we know that he is also one of the patients.",

            "content": "Shutter Island lingers in your mind like pain.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese crafts a brilliant psychological horror mystery with his haunting picture Shutter Island (2010). Scorsese makes you believe in every clue and hides all the terrible truths through wonderful deceptions. Shutter Island has an eerie tone, especially with the assorted classical soundtrack that bursts into hearing with sudden melodies. I appreciate sound designers Eugene Gearty, Marissa Littlefield, Philip Stockton, and Tom Fleischman's creepy echoing noises. From dead silence, building up dread, into these distant screams and richoting noises.\n\nWriters Dennis Lehane alongside Laeta Kalogridis come up with endless narrative red herrings and clues to Scorsese's magnificent mystery. I really love how Shutter Island's story is more about repressed emotions and romantic understanding than any mind blowing twist. I feel like Scorsese wants you to empathize with his hero, so that you can understand his pain and relate to his conflicted confusion. Shutter Island is an exercise in trusting others over your own senses, while also expressing profound grief, and earnest acceptance as an admirable and necessary trait.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is truly phenomenal as United States Marshal Teddy Daniels. His every pessimistic sneer and intelligent jab show Teddy's sly wit and careful observation about Shutter Island and its curious patients and staff. I continue to be stunned by DiCaprio's emotionally honest performance that he just lets loose with devastation at Shutter Island's shocking reveals and painful memories. Michelle Williams is wondrous as DiCaprio's dead wife Dolores Chanal in flashbacks and visions with her raw intensity and gentle sweetness that conveys a very peculiar atmosphere to Shutter Island. Her final scene is so upsetting that it is burned into my mind forever.\n\nMark Ruffalo is excellent as the attentive and steadfast U.S. Marshal Chuck Aule alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. You feel like Ruffalo is right along for Scorsese's dark adventure into the mind and the past. Ruffalo ensures that you're always in on each new detail and hints at unlocking the door of truth to Scorsese's mystery. Sir Ben Kingsley is fantastically entertaining as the blunt Dr. John Cawley with his nonchalant remarks delivered with a deadpan like only Kingsley could muster. Emily Mortimer is very touching as Rachel Solando with her emotional clarity and genuinely empathetic performance. Max von Sydow's supporting role as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring is bold and philosophical as a neat foil for DiCaprio.\n\nJackie Earle Haley has an absorbing and scary cameo as George Noyce with his violent manner and viciously delivered dialogue. Patricia Clarkson's cameo as Rachel Solando is fascinating and still keeps me guessing. Ted Levine is sinister and delightful as Shutter Island's blood-lustful Warden. John Carroll Lynch is pleasant and straightforward as Shutter Island's Deputy Warden McPherson. Elias Koteas channels his inner Robert De Niro as the unsettling Laeddis. You never know which character actor will appear next as Scorsese's cast for Shutter Island is splendid all around.\n\nScorsese plants an idea in your head from the beginning only to lure to an island of emotional horrors. His direction is fascinating as he will use subtle storytelling by having editor Thelma Schoonmaker cut in a flashback to concentration camps or a foreboding lake house. Shutter Island is so enthralling to me that it's formidable 138 minute run-time only feels like an hour.\n\nI love cinematographer Robert Richardson's wide shots of this ominous, brooding island. All of Richardson's close-up shots of Leonardo are quite effective at showing his increasing paranoia and harrowing psychological experience while on Shutter Island. Dante Ferretti's production design creates all these rundown mental facilities and an opulent office for the head doctor of Shutter Island. Every creaking door and wet path feels intentional to imply the island's fearsome potential for murder or anguish. Set decorator Francesca Lo Shiavo finds all these antiques for the office, while providing sterile, cold medical and prison furnishings for the main buildings. \n\nArt directors Robert Guerra, Christina Ann Wilson, Barbra Matis, Patricia Woodbridge, Hinju Kim, Max Biscoe, and Marion Kolsby drew really striking imagery for Shutter Island's thoughtful frames. From a wife crumbling into ashes to her getting absorbed in a car explosion, Shutter Island is full of visual delights and conceptual tragedies. Sandy Powell's costume designs look retro in aesthetic with pleasant yellow Summer dresses to neat orderly uniforms, but there's a sorrow to each outfit in how they all look too nice. It's like there's something wrong the entire time. Make-up artists Manlio Rocchetti and Sian Grigg meld sweat into water and nerves into facial expressions with brilliant use of gritty bruises and ethereal looks.\n\nMy favorite Scorsese shot ever may be Leonardo DiCaprio embracing Michelle Williams amongst the cinders of a flame long past being lit. I am amazed at the breathtaking CGI from visual effects artists Ron Ames, Matthew Gratzner, Ben Grossmann, Christina Graff, Paul Graff, Magdalena Wolf, David Sanger, Shannon Blake, Gans Robert Legato, and Jonathan Stone. I feel chills when the water suddenly appears on Michelle Williams or the fiery inferno bursts forth onto her figure. Shutter Island is a gorgeously shot film with impeccable nuance even in Scorsese's visual metaphors. Scorsese and Richardson's visuals are captivating and startling. \n\nIn conclusion, Shutter Island gets me gripped and finally releases this cathartic emotional reveal that still shocks me more than a decade later. I highly recommend seeing Shutter Island at least once for a dark and enchanting mystery from the master Martin Scorsese himself.",

I'll try not to give away the plot, but the script and Caprio are so convincing in their narrative the first time you watch it, any alternative ending to that narrative seems a let down.  However, even knowing the ending when watching it the second time, it truly allows you savor the nuances you had missed/misread the first time making it even more enjoyable.\n3. Scorcese, Caprio, Sydow, Kingsley....what more can you say?  Great work by all. \n4. The pace, timeline and script are exceptional.\nWatch it.  Then watch it again.
