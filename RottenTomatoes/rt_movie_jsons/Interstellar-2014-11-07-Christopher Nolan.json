            "content": "A nice movie with very good visuals, which reaches its greatest when defining a world in decadence with extreme realism, but its lowest when recurring to storytelling mechanisms that have become a bit too obvious for audiences familiarised with time-travel sci-fi. In general, I recommend it. The best: the way Nolan depicts a decadent humanity without either the use of guilt and blame characteristic of climate change-based accounts nor the exaggerated thunders of catastrophic events movies; just a slow, unavoidable path into decadence, where civilization has to fold on itself \u2013or not.",

Phenomenally edited and incredibly imaginative cinematography with a epic story to back it up. the music is very good but I wouldn't call it catchy, though it is very memorable. The pacing is a perfect slow burn that suits the complicated story perfectly. The acting is phenomenal as well. though it takes some time to warm up to everyone, once the slow burn builds momentum the acting builds right along with it. This is a film everyone should see once. The less you know about the story the better.",

            "content": "In November of 2014 I was 8 years old; my parents were never particularly cinephiles. As long as I have lived with my parents, they pressed quality cinema and literature upon me. My Mother can't recall what possessed her to take me to the movies on that unusually warm November night. It wasn't often that my parents would let me spend time in front of screens or eating junk food and candy, this was a rare treat. I was wide eyed and happy, oblivious to what I was about to witness. Often in this age of the internet we forget that our access to knowledge and news was constricted. Being an elementary school student without access to any computers or phones I had no knowledge of what I didn't see in advertisements, hear in school or learn from my parents. One of my main memories from that first viewing was confusion and drowsiness. A run time of nearly 3 hours and I had stayed up way past my bedtime. But what that night did was it laid the foundation. I have never written a movie review before; for a while I have considered diving into scriptwriting and involving myself further in cinema, but I couldn't find the right channel. I recently realized that reviews, even if they remain unread, are a great way to channel my passion. I chose to review this film for a single reason: it's stunning. Christopher Nolan is perhaps one of the greatest filmmakers ever. Interstellar's incredible cinematography and attention to detail with the addition of Hans Zimmer's greatest soundtrack demands the viewer's full attention. I look forward to the day that Interstellar will be passed in excellence by the next masterpiece. However, for now Cooper's journey to find home is the greatest movie of all time.",

After all, this was the movie I'd been waiting for someone to make for years. Why couldn't it have been perfect?\n\nI saw it a third time. Why, you may ask? Because despite the errors the story haunted me. And I had to admit to myself that it was beautifully executed & acted, with possibly the best soundtrack in movie history. It was on this viewing that I managed to just let go & relax into the film.\n\nI was stunned.\n\nHow could I have missed this masterpiece? A complex, tightly knit, scientifically accurate story (Kip Thorne won the Nobel prize in physics later in 2017) that seemed to have been plucked right out of some fictional ether, instead of painstakingly worked out around a table in a story room. Some stories are like that; they feel more real than real, like they have always existed and were waiting for a hand to snatch them and gift them to us.\n\nIt occurred to me too that some works of art, like this film, can have a sort of 'emergence' - that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and that it may well take time for a culture to come to recognize its true greatness. I see now that the flaws of this film are very small and don't matter at all. The movie's greatness transcends its own mistakes.\n\nI don't know if any movie will ever be made to match Interstellar. As sad as that makes me, I'm happy enough to just keep watching and re-watching. If you haven't seen it yet - I envy you.",

The film is a sci-fi epic about a group of astronauts who venture through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. The film boasts a stellar cast including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain, and an incredible visual experience.\n\nThe plot of Interstellar is well thought out and beautifully executed. It is a story about hope and humanity's drive to survive, and it is told in a way that is both scientifically accurate and emotionally impactful. The themes of love and sacrifice are explored in a profound and meaningful way, making the film a true work of art.\n\nThe acting in Interstellar is top-notch. McConaughey delivers a standout performance as the lead, capturing the right amount of emotion and depth to make the audience connect with his character. Hathaway and Chastain both deliver strong performances as well, adding depth and nuance to the film.\n\nThe direction and cinematography in Interstellar are exceptional. Nolan is known for his visual storytelling, and this film is no exception. The film's visuals are breathtaking, with incredible landscapes and space scenes that will leave you in awe. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive, elevating the film to another level and providing a haunting and memorable soundscape.\n\nThe special effects in Interstellar are absolutely stunning. From the massive black holes to the beautiful celestial bodies, every aspect of the film's visual design is meticulously crafted to deliver a truly immersive experience. The film's production design is similarly impressive, with a believable and well-realized futuristic world.\n\nThe editing and pace of Interstellar are masterful, with a well-crafted rhythm that keeps the film moving forward and engaging the audience at all times. The dialogue is smart, and thought-provoking, and adds to the film's overall impact.\n\nIn conclusion, Interstellar is a triumph of filmmaking. It is a film that will make you feel, think, and question. It is a beautiful and profound work of art that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. If you are a fan of sci-fi or Christopher Nolan, this film is a must-see.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's futuristic trek into the stars is a visually stunning and heartbreakingly real film that also happens to be the director's best entry to date. Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a former pilot turned corn farmer who stumbles onto a NASA plan to search for a new home. Earth has been turned into a ball of dust by climate change and one thing is clear as crops continue dying out: Humanity can't sustain itself here. Cooper teams up with Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) and his daughter (played by Anne Hathaway) to traverse through a recently (and mysteriously) opened wormhole through which other options for planetary habitation exist. What results is two stories told simultaneously: Cooper's daughter Murph (played by Jessica Chastain) is determined to help her father's mission by computing equations with Professor Brand on Earth as well as the space odyssey itself. Chastain's devotion to her work is a thin mask worn to protect herself from further hurt at her father leaving her during her childhood. Cooper's journey only takes him so long, but due to the changing weight of gravity in their various stops his time moves differently than those still on Earth, allowing Murph to grow from a child to an adult while Cooper is gone. In space, Cooper and crew are to investigate three potential new homes after successfully traveling through a wormhole (the images of which were impressively rendered before our first real-life visual of a black hole) with varying degrees of success. In the end Nolan manages to tie the terrestrial, metaphysical, and intergalactic altogether in a way that can only be described as poetic. Excellent writing, acting, and story pacing culminate in one of the greatest sci-fi epics of the past decade and, perhaps, of all time.",

Still, I like this movie because it discusses many different aspects of humanity, such as love and betrayal, beyond the scientific part of it, and I would recommend it to people who are interested in physics or scientific fiction.",

Visually stunning with sufficient emotional depth from the first-rate cast and crew, I am somewhat disappointed with the outcome.  Was it a cautionary tale of what happens when humanity doesn't take care of its resources?  Is it just a tale of heroic efforts at great personal sacrifice?  Perhaps, both but again I'm not sure.

It brings together the human instinct of survival and the inevitable issues of the future to create a story of both time, gravity, and joy. By far the best acting performance of the movie is Matthew McConaughey as Cooper. Everything from the emotions he feels for his family as well as the little quirks of jokes and interactions with his other travelers and artificial intelligence is what truly makes the movie stand out. I also appreciate the acting prowess from Chastain and Hathaway, who both put together endearing characters that shined individually and supplementally to McConaughey's Cooper. In terms of storytelling, Nolan doesn't disappoint. The way he ties everything together is perfect, as well as his choices in cinematography. The scene where Michael Caine has a voice over monologue is a perfect example of how great Nolan is at directing. In addition, the accuracy of the science behind the entire plot of the story just adds to how real the movie is and how it reflects to the audience. Also, Hans Zimmer is HIM.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" gives a space thriller take on the relationship between a man and his daughter. Matthew McConnaghae's performance displays the tragic yet heartwarming arc of a man who has to see the world he knows fall to pieces, then sacrifice his own life to save it. Throughout the time he is away saving the world, the movie follows an intriguing story line where he continues to face deep hardships and sacrifices. The screenplay of the movie travels through some of the most exotic locations on earth, creating an exhilarating viewer experience. The director, Christopher Nolan, also uses a different use of sound than what is traditional to most films. He creates suspense by using screechy and uneasy audio during scenes that are supposed to make you uncomfortable, doing this creates a sense of suspense for the audience. The movie also explores complex ideas regarding our universe which leave you thinking about the movie well after watching it. The depths the movie dives to in existentialism leave the viewer questioning their own surroundings, as well as the world beyond their own reach. In the film Christopher Nolan's greatest concept explored throughout the movie is the concept of time and how it relates to the world and universe around us. During the movie he plays with the concept of how time can move differently for different people and locations, this ends up creating a dramatic twist in the end by reuniting the characters. Christopher Nolan's style of movie directing is often seen as unconventional which makes it so his film doesn't stick well with all viewers. The reason this works for him is because he is able to reach a specific audience with his films and create them in a way to a virtual masterpiece for its intended audience. I would highly recommend this creative masterpiece to any one who wishes to explore movies with deep perspectives. This is the movie that is able to express Christopher Nolan's genius perspectives and ideas. The film is able to leave a lasting impression on you, which makes you want to keep rewatching to keep gaining understanding of its excellence. This movie goes down in my top 10 movies ever along with a few other Christopher Nolan films. I would especially recommend this to people like myself who appreciate a movie's ability to make you think about and explore complex concepts. I would give this movie a rating of 8.9 out of 10.",

Yes I'm watching it again to think about what happened because I couldn't concentrate with the sound that is so loud! Haha! \nThe visuals is an absolute masterpiece, if you talk about realistic it should be this movie, the space shuttles, suits and planets look so realistic. And to top that off, this was an absolute perfect cast. Mathew McConaughey was absolutely brilliant, when he had to be emotional you really believed it. Anne Hathaway, was also brilliant, she is extremely versatile. Jessica Chastain really shined in her role. And Michael Caine really added so much so to the movie. Casey Affleck who was so into the role that you kind of thought why does Ben Affleck look so young? But I didn't expect Topher Grace to pull of such a performance aswell. \nI don't know how Christopher always gets a great cast that fits the roles so perfectly. Is there going to be a sequel? With what Christopher Nolan has done that we have seen, he definitely can pull of a sequel and it can actually be even better. \nWould I recommend you watching this?

            "content": "Arguably Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight Rises. Not only Nolan's undisputed and undeniable best film he's ever made, but also a strong contender for best film of ALL TIME. Stanley Kubrick opened the floodgates with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now? Nolan did what Kubrick couldn't. Not only does Interstellar answer the question that Space Odyssey simply wasn't clear enough to answer, it's simply better in every way. Nolan creates a real life, living, breathing, living intergalactic world. Nolan's work is so immaculate and precise that he actually helped make a scientific discovery. Every single detail is explained in detail so you actually know what's going on in Interstellar. When this film says, \"Mankind was born on Earth, never meant to die here,\" what it really means is that filmmaking was born on Earth and is not meant to stagnate here. Nolan is a filmmaker who makes movies ethereal. The Waste Land is representative of Hollywood and its failed, unoriginal ideas, while the film's intergalactic discoveries represent how Nolan rebooted the film industry. While the spaceship takes off with Matthew McConaughey as the pilot, Hollywood takes off with Christopher Nolan piloting it.\n\nInterstellar was one of the movies I didn't care about this year. One of my friends is a real Nolan fan and he promoted it but every time he put a trailer in our group chat I didn't watch it and when he had news I didn't bother to read it. Hell, I didn't even know Matt Damon was in it, I didn't even know Matthew was starring. I actually only remembered that this movie existed because my group of friends decided to go and I was like \"hell, let's try it\". That gives you some information about what I knew about the movie beforehand.\n\nWhat I got was one of, if not the best movie I have ever seen. It was so beautiful that sometimes I find myself thinking \"damn, is this real life or cgi?\", and that's coming from a computer gamer who is known for putting up with graphics. Visually, I can say without a doubt that it's the best ever made, you can't find a better looking one. That said, the story was a bit of a clich\u00e9. I figured out pretty quickly that the wormhole was going to be important and that the \"ghost\" was the father since the Morse code for the word \"stay\" was also pretty obvious. That said, it was a pretty damn good story, and even a gritty one has its twists, but it wasn't too distracting. So story wise I would rate it 7/10.\n\nNow the most important part, or at least for me: the feeling after leaving the cinema. It got me thinking. The movie sparked your imagination and showed us some possibilities of what we could do. One of my first thoughts when I left the theater was: This is going to inspire people the way Star Wars did back then. It's the kind of movie that you'll still think about and remember in a few months, and that's why it's such a good movie: It's funny on a really high level without being an action movie or a comedy. fires up your brain.\n\nAll in all, and I know this will be pretty unpopular with a lot of people, I think this movie should be IMDB #1 with a score of 93/100, just above The Shawshank Redemption. This is mostly to do with 2001 being so high on the list and in my opinion 2001 should be compared to that movie and not the other way around. It should be about this movie. It has every single aspect of a good movie: Great cast, near perfect acting, drama, humor, action, suspense, visuals so beautiful they make you wonder if it's cgi or not, no major scientific flaws, and let's not forget innovation ( the way these robots were made, brilliant!) it was quite original, it had breathtaking music, it was immersive and even hard, it was long, it didn't feel long. This 2001 movie looked like a b-movie.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not a professional reviewer, but since I was so blown away by this movie, I needed to get it out there",

It, unsurprisingly, features good CGI and its quite gripping at times, although I felt frustrated by the quite frequent whispery/mumbled dialogue, this makes it hard to follow whats being said at times. I suppose the film is about hope, though I'd also say its about determination and isolation. \n\nThe dialogue is a little cheesy at times, with one line I remember being \"love is the only thing capable of transcending time and space'. A more notable quote, I thought, was 'out survival instinct is our greatest source of inspiration'. Suffice to say, this is not a light watch(!), thus its a bit hard to follow fully but I'd be lying if I said it doesn't have anything going for it. There are some plot twists and near the end I did feel a bit let down a bit, in as much as I can't say I felt what happened was entirely believable? also it didn't surprise me this is a Christopher Nolan film, given one of the aspects featured in the film which clearly harked back to Inception.\n\nI thought the cast gave relatively decent performances and its certainly a thought provoking film - its somewhat memorable too. I'd say, in my mind, its more of what I'd call a 'deep film' than an 'epic', although it certainly has an epic running time of just shy of 3 hours long (2h49 to the end of the credits). If this really interests you, then its probably worth seeing but if your not interested in the sci-fi aspects of this, then it'll likely seem a bit too long winded and lose your interest, so I'm 50/50 about recommending it but hopefully my review has given you an idea if this is for you or not.",

By the 32nd time you hear \"Do not go gentle,\" you want to scream at the film and just say OKAY WE GET IT. You can tell they had these huge concepts and a lot to say, but even with the ultra extended runtime, they just couldn't figure out how to tighten it all together into a good, cohesive whole. As a result, it feels like they said everything they wanted to say, but didn't really get it all out, leaving either a lot of confusion or a lot of doubt in its wake.\n\nIt's certainly not a bad film though. And if this inspires people to enjoy sci-fi, who am I to besmirch it? I was just hoping for something more, and given that I had zero expectations and was not spoiled at all going into this film, that's a bit disappointing.

This film takes risks and leaps for abstract concepts/themes, and it basically nails them all.\n\nIt's impossible to overlook Hans Zimmer's score. What he composed for this picture is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard, and the way it complements Nolan's scenes is some of the most unrivaled movie magic I've ever experienced.\n\nThe only flaws I found in this film were a few brief sequences on Earth during the climax and a few cheesy lines of dialogue sprinkled throughout the movie. The dialogue is mostly flawless, with the exception of Brand's speech about love, which is a little heavy-handed. Despite these minor flaws, I believe the greatness of this movie is so powerful that it still qualifies for a perfect rating.\n\nAlthough Interstellar isn't my favorite Nolan film, it is unquestionably one of his masterpieces.

Achieving high concepts with grace and having great cinematography along the way this movie truly transports you to an alternate future/reality that becomes more and more engrossing as you watch. I have seen this plenty of times and with every re-watch the message seems more clear and I pick out new things I learned. Christopher Nolan truly had a visionary mind when crafting this film and to see it come to life on screen is one reason that I truly appreciate moviegoing to the extent I do.\n\nThe movie is really well done in no small part to the grounded characters. Matthew McConaughey holds a lot of weight in the role as this is undoubtedly his best acting of his career to date. He shows the emotion effortlessly through his facial expressions and delivery of dialogue. Anne Hathaway isn't usually my favorite actress but she does surprisingly well in this role for this film. Also Matt Damon has a smaller role in this film but his time is truly felt as he is probably the story arch and character I remember the most when I think on this film. This is not to mention the rest of the star studded cast of Jessica Chastain, Micheal Caine and even a young Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\nThe real meat and potatoes behind this film however is found through the ambitious story. It is the backdrop to an epic and ever evolving landscape that I think is beautifully and expertly crafted. People who have problems with this film boil it down to it not making to much logical sense and being overly ambitious. I would have maybe sided with them more upon my first watch but with every subsequent viewing I pick apart different aspects of the film and for within the film it actually works all relatively soundly. Now sure you have to suspend some disbelief that the characters keep narrowly escaping their ultimate demise but the whole message of this film of love and fate helps to show that maybe their \"luck\" is just this worlds way of having fate play its part in the perfect manner it was intended.\n\nWith a powerful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, amazing visual effects, and impressive overall spectacle this movie comes in as a homerun in my books. Up there with some of Nolan's best work this movie only gets better for me as I continue to come back to it. I am also a person who likes thinking outside the box and considering new ideas so that has to be noted in playing a factor into my love for this film.",

It explains everything that feels impossible or unknown like a slap in the viewers face. Its a complex plot, but it works.\n\nTime travel or Relative time is also really nicely explored making science freaks like me really happy.\n\nThe \"bad\" part is that Interestellar uses our physics current limitation (e.g the undefined, still not discovered intern of a blackhole or how its created) to create a vast almost supernatural experience.\nEven if science cannot accurately \"unprove\" its story it doesn't feel like it is really possible.",

The total ratings this movie received on rotten tomatoes honestly hurts me, this movie easily belongs in the high 90's %. Can't believe movies like Mission Impossible received higher rankings than this. Nothing against Mission Impossible, but Interstellar is EASILY better than MI. \n\nEverything about this movie works. So fucking well. The story. The acting. The characters. The cinematography. The balance of action and drama. The balance of real science and science fiction. The black hole. The soundtrack. Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. \n\nNeedless to say, the acting was phenomenal. Matthew McConaughey absolutely killed it in his role. I also loved Jessica Chastain's performance. Although her role was relatively minor, Mackenzie Foy also did an excellent job of playing young Murph. All the other supporting actors were really great too (Matt Damon, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, etc), however the three I listed I believe just stood out. \n\nThe story was beautiful. And it combined all of the elements of what makes a great story so perfectly. The excitement of discovery and space exploration. The anxiety of the outcome of the human race. The frustration of betrayal. The mystery of the ghost. The heartbreak of a loved one leaving. But also the love of a bond that transcends space and time. \n\nAnd all the things this story makes you feel, are super amplified by one hell of a soundtrack. Hans Zimmer is guilty for this soundtrack. Now one thing I know when it comes to Hans Zimmer, is that if he has written a soundtrack for a film, that film is gonna have one damn amazing soundtrack. But interstellar was even amazing for him. Just that next level. Each sound, makes you feel so much, and perfectly captures the thoughts and feelings of each and every scene.\n\nAmazing cinematography also. The landscape shots of Earth are stunning, and the same goes for the camera angles of space. The scenes are always really well set. The camera shots capture the beauty of Earth, the other planets and space. \n\nAnd I am crazy for gargantua, the black hole featured in this film. So much real research and scientific data was used, and so much effort was put in to generate the animation of gargantua. It is as beautiful as it is terrifying to look at, and I love how this movie went to the effort to ensure the black hole was as accurate as possible, despite this largely being a science fiction film.\n\nThis movie is just so perfect in many ways. Watch it!",

            "content": "I don't think I appreciated the dystopian world that Christopher Nolan had created the first (and only other) time I viewed this movie. In addition, I also found the acting to be really well-done, notably the scene when Cooper (McConaughey) is leaving his daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), and when he's seeing his grandchild for the first time (over a transmission recording). Movies that concern massive consequences for humanity are a good place to start with me \u2014 it's a reason why Children of Men is my favorite movie \u2014 and you don't get that much more consequential than the survival of the species. In this world, the planet is beyond repair and 21st Century conquistadores must venture beyond new horizons (to put it lightly) to find humanity a new home. I love \u2014 and have come to expect \u2014 difficult scientific concepts boiled down to simple, laymen's explanations; a corroborating visual makes that all the better. We get it here, paper and pencil and all. There are legitimate action thrills, whether they be from monstrous tidal waves or a traumatized astronaut (Damon). Maybe the tesseract climax was a little too convenient and weird and\u2026 confusing(?) but it didn't take away as much from the plot for me, but I see how it could be a huge letdown for others. The recurring theme is delightful and excellent to use as background music for studying/working. The RT is at (72/86) right now and had you asked me before re-watching it, I probably would've assumed I'd be closer to the critics, turns out I'm much more with the \"audience,\" my people, and our simplistic scientific explainers. I was hard on Nolan for Tenet, which I think is underwhelming at best, stupid and pretentious at worst, but Interstellar, on the other hand, is something you should revisit, if the summer blockbusters this year aren't delivering.",

Yet there is something ever more powerful than even time itself that this movie presents. Our emotions and our connections with others are ever present. We are humans and we seek to connect no matter the cost, and despite being millions of light years away and time pressing forward in an endless march our connections will grow, break, and form anew.

It's one of the most ambitious movies ever directed and not only did they pull it off, they nailed it.  When it comes to the expansion of our universe, I don't think anything is farfetched, but Interstellar made me feel as if I was journeying into our future and watching a real-life space exploration take place, rather than a science fiction flick.

Coming fresh off the success of his Dark Knight series, Christopher Nolan breathed fresh air into the sci fi genre with gorgeous spectacles, amazing cgi-coupled with his innate attention to detail that most filmmakers can only dream of.

            "content": "Interstellar is a stunning example of mind-blowing sci-fi and a story that reflects humanity all tied into one neat package. At its heart, it really is a film about humanity, which is why I believe it resonates so well with its audience. I would give the film 9.5 out of 10 stars, because of its emotional depths and fascinating plot.\n\tThe film begins by introducing us to the premise: in a dystopian future, humanity doesn't seem like it will survive for much longer on Earth. But more than that, it introduces us to (Joseph) Cooper, Murphy, and the rest of Cooper's family. You really get the sense that Cooper is a family man, and the bond between Cooper and Murphy is all laid out right in the beginning. And interestingly, the idea of Murphy's ghost is introduced here, which pays off much later in the film. \n\tBut when NASA calls, Cooper answers, launching us from the exposition into the film. Humanity has to uproot itself for survival, and what NASA wants Cooper to do is scout these other planets to see how fit they would be for survival. But Murphy doesn't want Cooper to go. Murphy's child actor does a great job with, and the emotional plot thread of being away from family begins here. The mission seems to go well at first, until a giant wave on an ocean-planet causes the death of a crewmate, and Cooper and Amelia Brand find that time has been dilated for them, and over twenty years has passed. What follows is where I really became emotionally invested, as Cooper finds recordings of messages from his children, now grown. Especially heartbreaking is the message from Murphy, now the same age as Cooper, saying, \"now would be a really good time for you to come back.\" These moments would not work as well without Matthew McConaughey, who shakes and sobs in a way that feels utterly, captivatingly real. There's no single man-tear or delicate crying, this movie just makes it feel ugly and raw and human. \n\tBut the plot continues nonetheless. Cooper, Amelia, and Romilly go find Matt Damon's Mann, who laughs or sobs into Cooper's chest upon being awakened. That moment continues on for long enough to be uncomfortable, but is also what I like about it. Again, it just feels raw, not manufactured, which makes the moment resonate. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Murphy finds out that uprooting all of human civilization was never the plan, leaving most of humanity to die. She sends a message to the crew, to which Cooper announces he's going back to Earth. However, Mann reveals his true colors and sabotages Cooper (which I didn't expect as much as I really should've. I think watching The Martian before this skewed my thoughts on Matt Damon's character). This betrayal, again, is ugly but it never descends to cartoon villainy in my opinion because the film gives Mann motivation that makes you understand his actions, and sympathize with him. Nonetheless, Mann ends up dying, and it is just Cooper and Amelia trying to reach the other planet.\n\tUntil it is just Amelia trying to reach the other planet, as Cooper ejects himself from the spacecraft to ensure Amelia can make it. In the most mind-boggling section of the movie, Cooper finds himself in a physical dimension that represents time. Made of bookcases, he glances through to see moments from his past and realizes that he can send messages\u2014that he was Murphy's ghost all along. McConaughey gives another incredible performance here, rummaging through the bookshelves with sheer desperation, but also the realization that love will save all of humanity. Along with the physical time dimension aspect, it should be cheesy, but it's not. It works thanks to the stakes and the performances from the actors, and somehow, the climax feels just right. In a movie that centers Cooper and Murphy's father-daughter relationship as the main emotional thread, of course it all gets tied together and that relationship ends up saving humanity. This solution feels earned, all the way through.\n\tThe conclusion to the film is sweet, showing humanity's survival, but Murphy has also grown old. The way Cooper cups her frail face, almost reverently, really kicks you in the gut. Cooper has saved his daughter, but at the cost of not being able to see her for the majority of her life, up until death. Finally, the movie ends on Cooper seeking out Amelia, and while it's unknown how that search turns out, the movie ends on that note of hope for the future. I enjoyed overall how bittersweet everything seemed to be, one last sendoff that was, like the rest of the film, absolutely human.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there.\n\nI really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, \"we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?\" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was ok with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing.\n\nOverall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5.",

            "content": "As someone who has always had interest in outer space as a kid, I always wanted a movie about space where unnecessary alien invasions and their civilisations are not shown. And with Interstellar my that dream definitely did come true, though not as much as I was hoping it to be. There are many things in this movie that I didn't understand, and the cosmic concepts are definitely not one of them.\nSo first of all, this movie is taking place in a dystopian future. If I didn't know better I'd think that it's happening in an alternate reality. There was no mention of this being in the future at any point in the beginning. The only way to know about things was by people's talking, and I will explain later why it was a terrible decision.\nSo everything about humanity is on a path of destruction and thus they choose to find a wormhole through which they can go to another planet and live over there, which is something I completely agree with. I'm the kind of a person who completely supports humanity to settle in space and letting nature and wildlife live on Earth in peace. But why are they going as far as another planet? Can't they just live on Mars or Titan? They looked way safer than the water planet they went to. The excuse that Mars and Titan don't have oxygen won't work because neither did this planet. And it was shown very well in the fight scene.\nSpeaking of the fight scene, it was completely unnecessary. This is a movie about interdimensional space travel. No one is interested in petty conflicts. Already we are tensed about the crew not making it back to Earth and Cooper's daughter ageing and never getting to know whether her father is alright or not. I was feeling very bad for her. She didn't even take the opportunity to say goodbye to her father and now she has to regret about this for her whole life. On the other hand Cooper is also very tensed about not getting to see her daughter before she grows old and dies.\nMy favourite part in the entire movie was when he reached the fifth dimension. He could see his daughter from the day he left her. While floating behind a bookshelf he tried his best to make her understand that he wanted to see her. And finally after long he decided to use the Morse code from the watch to make her understand. I was really empathising with him. I was feeling how I'd behave in a situation like this, where someone I have to contact does not even know Morse code and there is no way I could talk to them. Finally in the end we get to see the awesome world that the scientists make, where the gravity gets inverted and people can live in a much bigger place. It was a terrific idea. I wasn't even expecting the movie to end like that.\nAnd now like I said, I'll talk about the audio quality. The voice is so low and the score is so high it's very hard to listen to all the exposition that is given. Normally I'd not have any problem with that, but out of almost 3 hours of this movie, 2 hours is just talking, talking and more talking. I'm not able to read subtitles very fast so I couldn't keep track of what was going on. In fact, when TARS was speaking I didn't even know it was him. I used to think it's someone else in the background on whom the camera has not been shown. Since the volume was so low, it wasn't even possible to understand that these were different voices. And speaking of TARS, he was the most forgettable character in the movie. To write this review I had to watch Honest Trailers to remember everything, and then I remembered that TARS was even a thing.\nInterstellar is a masterpiece we can only expect Christopher Nolan to make. If anyone else had made a movie about outer space, they'd have definitely added aliens, like fishes on the new planet, or some rabbits hiding in their burrows. But I'm really glad that didn't happen, because that would have meant humanity didn't learn from its past mistakes and are choosing to start life on someone else's land. If it weren't for the long low volume talking and the forced exposition meant for uninformed audience, it'd have easily been my favourite Nolan movie.",

McConaughey is good in lead role; when Matt Damon enters later as an astronaut stranded on a viable world waiting for rescue, I was like, Is this the Martian? Good flick but ending is kinda wack IMO.",

A truly great space movie, made with the support of science-savvy people and a great team.\n\nInterstellar is not so much about space, the singularity, and black holes. The film explores the theme of love and the common good, the theme of life and death. The theme of death for the sake of others. He plays with your feelings, sometimes doing it directly: with the help of the acting and the pumping soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, and sometimes doing it indirectly, showing you the cold emptiness and loneliness of the boundless cosmos.\n\nInterstellar visual is an art worthy of all awards and accolades. Many shots from this film want to see in the form of a picture at home.\n\nWatching Interstellar, you start to believe in the true power of cinema. Because of the drama, because of the direction, because of the composing skills of Hans Zimmer. And you start to believe in the genius of Christopher Nolan.\n\nThe story has a very personal, intimate connotation. The relationship between father and children. A father who will have to save humanity, in the truest sense of these words. The cold, boundless space echoes with the pain of a long separation between native people.\n\nThis film is included in any list of my favorite films of all time, it was for me a kind of discovery in the world of space films.

Regardless, I have to say that I don't really know how to feel about this film. Sure, the visual effects are gorgeous and stunning, and the movie is well based on real science. But, talking about the story, I didn't really like it. I feel like the movie started off in an excellent way, I really liked the story at first. But, for me, the part where Doctor Mann is introduced and we learn some sketchy things, is where the film changed the direction completely on to a path that I don't really love. It starts to get a little too complictaed for me. All the stuff with the dimensions, the ending, the timeline... too confusing. It's a shame really, because I was feeling that Interstellar was going to be epic from beginning to end. It's also a bit over-long and the acting is just good, nothing special. Still, it is not a rotten movie, and I guess each person has it's own interpretation.",

Often you just want to see the space scenes tbh but also tbh they stick to those scenes more than not. I've read many critics or audience members claiming the movie is too complicated but to this I say BS. I come from an engineering background which of course did make the concepts immediately easy to get but to those who are regular folk claiming its complicated they literally explain nearly every aspect of the science  to the point where I was thinking okay okay we know. To be fair idk how many people do know which is why they explain this stuff.  The wormhole and dimensional aspects they don't bother explaining. Why? Because its 100% science fiction, only theories physics people dream about when they think about general relativity and the like.  Meaning no one knows since obviously we can't warp space or play with gravity.  The decisions made that were part of the danger plots were questionable but not horrible. The ending was satisfying overall and the cast did a good job of selling it. Again if you found the movie complicated then you prob weren't paying any attention considering its pretty linear. Movies good its not the amazing but makes up for it by being beautiful in the imagery, dialogue, and the cause and effect of the casts actions.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's 2014 film, \"Interstellar\" is a masterpiece of film and storytelling that demands multiple watches It's superb leading actors, Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine bring out emotional beats they cut deeply into the viewers feelings and engross them in the characters' situations.\n\tEarth is a wind swept planet plagued by dust storms. Crops are dying and humanity has all but accepted its fate. Everyone that is, but the secret remnants of NASA. Discovering a wormhole by Saturn that leads to potentially habitable planets, Professor Brand (Michael Caine) enlists Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an ex-NASA pilot, to fly the small crew of scientists through it in a last attempt to save the human race.\n\t\"Interstellar\" has mastered the art of letting you feel the emotions of the scene. Matthew McConaughey's acting perfectly encapsulates what the character Cooper is going through, his prowess and control over his emotions shining through in scenes with his daughter, Murph (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain). Every character feels realistic and grounded. Michael Caine's character, Professor Brand action's rfectly aligning with his system of beliefs brings truth to his decisions that feel rational. Brand (Anne Hathaway) makes decisions in this movie that alter its course and have real consequences making the movie feel raw and real.\n\t\"Interstellar,\" all though complex and confusing if not thoroughly engaged, makes sense. Its sounds counterintuitive but everything makes internal sense within the logic of the movie. Time is slowed around heavy objects, so a black hole, being the most dense object in our universe, will screw with time in ways beyond our understanding. Everything in this film is foreshadowed, even from the opening shots it hints to what is to come. Upon a second watch through things fall into place bringing each part of the movie to another level.\n\tHans Zimmer's score accents the film, making it greater than the sum of its parts. It deepens the emotions in each scene, leaving an impact on the viewer. In a movie where stress and sadness are felt most keenly, the score shines. It's haunting tones and flowing notes makes you feel the scene, feel the stress, feel the actor's mind. Another outstanding score from an outstanding composer.\n\tIf you have not seen \"Interstellar\" you have deprived yourself of an experience I have found nowhere else. The thrilling story only gets better with each watch. Many people will say that the movie is too long or too confusing. They may be right. This movie is not for casual viewers. It is instead for the people passionate about film and storytelling, the people who are not daunted by hard topics or complex storylines, the people who would rather work to understand a movie on a deeper level then instead of being fed each plot point. All in all, \"Interstellar\" is a masterpiece. It's acting? Perfect. It's story? Perfect. Musical score? Perfect. It's impact on the viewer? Tremendous. It might possibly be Christopher Nolan's best film. \"Interstellar\" is a brilliant film that could be Christopher Nolan's magnum opus.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has created yet another masterpiece of a film. Interstellar is yet again another film that Christopher Nolan has put his talented filmmaking skills into. The film gave me an overall amazingly good impression. Between the detailed characters, the in-depth and complicated plot, and many more things, I could not be more pleased and impressed with this film. \n\nInterstellar tells the story of a future in which the people of Earth are headed towards extinction. The Earth has now started to have dust storms like the Dust Bowl. The main character, Cooper, was an ex-Nasa pilot who has given up his past life to become a farmer. When Cooper's daughter starts to find weird anomalies happening within their home, Cooper and Murph investigate. They realize it has something to do with gravity and use the coordinates they found to discover a secret Nasa base. Cooper is recruited to man a mission to another galaxy through a mysterious wormhole found near Saturn. He and other Nasa workers (Brand, Doyle, Romilly, and a few robots), must travel by Interstellar travel. They run into many problems that include time acceleration, Doyle's death and black holes. When they reach one of the \"promising\" planets, the astronaut that was already sent to explore (Mann) is in cryosleep. They wake him and then start to explore the new planet. When everyone splits up to do different things, Mann takes Cooper far away and then proceeds to fight him and cracks Cooper's helmet. Cooper then calls Brand as Mann escapes and Romilly dies in an explosion. Cooper and Brand try to stop Mann from boarding the space station that they have been using. When Mann fails to do so the right way he dies in an explosion that damages the station, Endurance. Cooper and Brand are available to reattach to the Endurance through an intense and amazingly crafted scene in which Cooper has to use his piloting skill to match the destroyed station. Because they do not have enough fuel to reach the other planet explored by astronaut Edmond, Cooper uses his skills agin to use the black hole and a way to launch themselves towards Edmund's planet. Cooper sacrifices himself to save Brand and goes into the black hole. He then blacks out and is in a mysterious tesseract which allows him to change the past. He uses this to send messages to Murph about how to save the entirety of the human race back on Earth. He realizes that he, himself, is the \"ghost\" that caused the anomalies in his home. While in this dimension, Cooper realizes that the human race of the future created it just for him. The tesseract starts to close and Cooper blacks out. He is discovered by the saved human race near Saturn and his life is saved. The movie ends with him and a much older Murph being reunited. She tells him to go to Brand who is habiting the new future world for the human race, and the movie ends with Cooper doing so.\n\nNolan did an amazing job at creating and implementing very diverse and detailed characters to his film. If these characters were not as good as they had been I feel that this movie would have been very boring and not very interesting. Between the smart astronaut and the simple farmer trying to make his way in the dying world around him, I feel that Cooper's character really made people see what the movie industry can show when it comes to interesting characters. That also doesn't even include the other main and secondary characters of this film that if they had not been included would have made the film boring and not very interesting in the character development category. Over the course of the entire film I believe the character development for each character, no matter how important or whatever age was portrayed by confident actors/actresses, made the film interesting and moved the story in a pace that I both liked and was intrigued by.\n\nThe techniques within this film also was something that helped to make this film very interesting and overall a great movie. I found that within the movie all the scenes are constantly changing to different shots. I believe that this is one of the key factors to why this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. If the shots had been long and drawn out there movie would have gotten boring, quickly. But Nolan did a great job at making sure the shots were always changing, whether it be a close shot of the characters in a ranger cutting to shots of the ranger flying or shots on the ranger itself, the shots were always enjoyable and full of details for the story. Along with the different shots I feel that the audio composition in this film was beyond spectacular. The audio was very suspenseful when it needed to and when it was suspenseful I was on the edge of my seat. The audio changing volume during scenes also helped to show me that I needed to pay attention or I would miss something important. It also helped to set the mood when needed and showed when the scenes were going to get action packed or were not going to be very eventful. With the overall plot of the movie being confusing for some I believe that these techniques were used to help guide watchers towards what the director and other filmmakers were trying to tell.\n\nI believe that Interstellar is yet another masterpiece of a film. I personally think that Christopher Nolan did an amazing job with creating not only a very detailed and at some points, confusing plot, while also creating very important and detailed characters. I also believe that between the different shots, colors, and other key factors along with a great soundtrack, Nolan was able to get across what he wanted audiences and watchers alike to understand and appreciate when it came to Interstellar. In my opinion I believe this film is very much worth watching and will become a favorite for all watchers like myself. Especially those who are interested in futuristic movies that also deal with the ever so changing and vass detail of space.",

Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain really brought the movie to life and played the roles perfectly.\n\nI thought this movie's plot was really well planned out. The movie starts out with the idea that the earth they live on is dying out and will soon not be able to support the humans on it. The main character, Cooper, and three other astronauts are sent up to space to try and find another planet to support human life. This mission is full of discoveries and breakthroughs as well as sadness and unfortunately death. The plot line throughout the movie keeps the viewer thinking and wondering what might happen next. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think that the acting in this film was amazing. I think that the actors that were chosen honestly portrayed the roles the best they could have. They hit every kind of character needed to make the film work. They had the positive and optimistic character, Murphy, the reasonable and confident character, Cooper, the selfish or \"bad guy\", Dr. Mann, and the followers or support characters, Romilly and Amelia brand. Lastly we have the character that is seen as bad by some and good by others, Professor Brand, he had the drive and determination to send people up to space with a hope to save the human race. These actors portrayed emotion so well which was such an important aspect in this movie. They truly made you feel connected to them through their acting.\n\nI thought this movie had a very large range of shots and some great opportunities for awesome shots. They were able to portray a sense of emotion or intensity through the lens of the cameras. On top of the amazing camera work, the music added a whole different aspect to the movie and gave you such an amazing sense of time and also added emotion, anticipation, and suspense into the scenes and overall film. \n\nInterstellar will have you on the edge of your seat and grabbing the tissues throughout the whole movie. I believe it's a must see!",

And yet such a global catastrophe is never really emphasised other than for a few dust storms in Cooper's back yard!\n\nThen there's the cameo of Matt Damon, who is completely wasted in a meaningless and time-consuming subplot that really doesn't advance the plodding plot very far.\n\nThe ending we could see coming almost an hour before, and never really gripped you the way some Nolan films can. Instead its all very nicely wrapped up the way we knew it would be, and we're left to wonder \"After almost 3 hours, is that really it!?\"",

Com mais proximidade, fui conhecendo outras outras e aumentando meu repertorio cin\u00e9filo. Dito isso, revi o filme ap\u00f3s quase 2 anos - e j\u00e1 tendo o visto pelo menos umas 5 vezes; e devo dizer que estava um pouco receoso pois minha vis\u00e3o mudou muito com o tempo, mas fico feliz em dizer que minha vis\u00e3o me proporcionou outra experiencia, que diferente do que eu pensei, foi t\u00e3o boa sen\u00e3o melhor do que das ultimas vezes.\n\nAgora pude observar aspectos que antes nem notara, sejam mais t\u00e9cnicos ou envolvendo roteiro. Ao assistir em 4K, numa tela grande, fica bem claro que Nolan faz filmes para o cinema especificamente. Quem teve o privilegio de assistir essa obra no cinema n\u00e3o sabe a sorte que tem - provavelmente sabe sim rs. O IMAX faz toda diferente, e as melhores fotografias vem daqui. Voc\u00ea fica hipnotizado, quase que literalmente. Principalmente no buraco de minhoca, qual eu acredito ser a retrata\u00e7\u00e3o mais linda e complexa. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do mundo funciona bem, com uma poeira mortal, sem contar nas planta\u00e7\u00f5es infestadas. Acredito que poderiam ter dito algo no subtexto para os pa\u00edses a fora, mas tudo bem, minha liga\u00e7\u00e3o com a trama e os personagens \u00e9 tanta que nem penso nisso. E o que falar da OST de Hans Zimmer? A melhor dele, sen\u00e3o uma das melhores. Essa parceria com o Nolan \u00e9 uma das melhores coisas do cinema. A retrata\u00e7\u00e3o do universo mais essa trilha \u00e9 simplesmente uma obra de arte completa. MasterPiece.\n\nEu gosto muito dos personagens, e as cenas dram\u00e1ticas me pegam de jeito, principalmente nas primeiras vezes que assisti. O plot twist \u00e9 maravilhoso, e pra quem gosta de viajar nas sci-fi da vida, se entregar ao mist\u00e9rio e n\u00e3o se acomodar a respostas, esse filme \u00e9 pra voc\u00ea. E alguns \"subplots\" como um todo funcionam bem. Matthew McConaughey t\u00e1 excelente, mais uma vez se provando um ator completo. Mackenzie Foy me surpreendeu, tendo um futuro muito promissor. Men\u00e7\u00f5es honrosas a Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon e Michael Caine, que est\u00e3o excelentes.\n\nO trabalho de mixagem e edi\u00e7\u00e3o de som \u00e9 muito bem feito, sendo obrigat\u00f3rio assistir com um fone de ouvido bacana pra imergir completamente. O filme tem 3 horas mas parece que se passam 1h e meia. Os planetas s\u00e3o magn\u00edficos, uma real experiencia IMAX. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de todos \u00e9 \u00f3tima, mal dando pra acreditar que, de fato, foram filmadas na terra. Os personagens tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o bem desenvolvidos, pelo menos os principais. Algumas coisas tu s\u00f3 pega na segunda ou sexta vez assistindo...\n\nEnfim, Interstellar \u00e9 uma obra obrigat\u00f3ria a qualquer cin\u00e9filo, e tem tudo que um filme precisa ter para ser uma verdadeira obra de arte.

The story of this film is another point that makes it spectacular, it becomes a complete story and of which there are many incredible moments.

Interstellar follows astronauts looking to find a new planet since earths days are numbered. Now this may sound like a cliche movie that\u2019s been done before but this film is anything but cliche. By the end of the film, your emotionally drained by the vastness of worlds and suspense of how all of the plot points will hopefully fall into place. While the cast is large and has some heavy hitters in play, this is McConaughey\u2019s film. He delivers a physical and emotional performance as a father that wants to save his family. No surprise from a Nolan film, this is visually stunning. Great use of camera work and practical effects to make this film feel like it\u2019s all believable. By the end of the film it\u2019s mixed by audiences who are either scratching their heads or somehow it just makes sense with the info that was given to us.

Having won the Nobel Prize for being one of the founders of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), Kip was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Kip was Nolan's consultant for the entire movie, everything except moving though the worm hole is scientifically accurate and up to date with where we are in theoretical physics.

I enjoyed the entire 2h 49m.\n\nThe first 41 mins of the movie were kind of an \u2018'introduction'' and we were getting to know more and more about that journey and what might happen and really loved these 41 mins, the movie was building that real slow and gentle without it being boring, it was so good.\n\nMy rating is: 9.6/10\n\nThe story and the script of interstellar were so very beautiful and really well written, felt like the story was so very deep with its meaning, and with just everything, I really don't know what else to say.\n\nInterstellar's music score was so fantastic, deep, and did match with every single scene, It was composed by Hans Zimmer so\u2026what's new, Hans Zimmer always blows our heads.\n\nChoosing Mackenzie Foy as the \"young Murph\" and Jessica Chastain as the \"older Murph\" was a very great choice, it's like when Mackanzie Foy grows up she'll actually become Jessica Chastain with her attitude and with her look and with just everything Matthew McConaughey was, of course incredible, great acting and he gave us an amazing performance that deserved an Oscar nomination at least. Anne Hathaway wasn't a problem at all, her acting was pretty good but her character was the problem, \"Brand\". \nBrand was a weak character, at first, I really thought that she'll have a bigger role and especially that she is played by Anne Hathaway, I just didn't feel anything towards that character and felt like she was like any other character in the movie. Michael Caine (plays Professor Brand) was a great choice and his acting was good.\n\nThe Visual Effects were so mind-blowing, I even felt like they were all real and no CGI was used to capture these scenes in space, defiantly deserved an Oscar for that.\n\nThe Production Design was so very good, wasn't surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar. It was so beautiful. The Costume Designs were okay the only thing that grabbed my attention was Cooper's (played by Matthew McConaughey) jacket and the hairstyle was pretty cool and did suit him well. I mean the whole movie they go to space so space suits are the only thing they wear so I won't talk about the custom designs. \n\nInterstellar is a masterpiece and a movie that I really really enjoyed from beginning to end, hats off to Christopher Nolan, and to the whole cast & crew.\n\nMy rating is: 9.5/10",

            "content": "Interstellar is an absolute rollercoaster of a movie. The tone switches almost constantly, and, while that isn't necessarily an issue, it became noticeable fairly quickly. Of all his non-batman films, interstellar is the one clearly made specifically for the general theatre audience. While it has all of the classic Nolan moves, Interstellar clearly valued the visual style over the story. However, through this, Nolan still managed to make a very well made and compelling blockbuster. As I mentioned, a large part of why Interstellar works so well is the way the film looks. Almost every shot is inspired in a genius creative sense, the only exception to that is the surprisingly bland interior of the space ship, where most of the film takes place. While I understand the intention of the bland space ship interior, it simply doesn't fit with the visual style of the rest of the movie. One specifically impressive visual moment is the moment where they realize that the \"mountains\" are actually giant waves. This is something unlike what I have seen in any other movie, and that's something Nolan can do well. Nolan is able to make something completely new and inventive and introduce it to the medium of film without having it seem out of place. Overall, making something with as much creativity in the look of a film adds to the impact. Another unique aspect of Interstellar that added to the impact is the music, or, Hans Zimmer falls asleep on his Pipe Organ for two hours. Using a pipe organ shouldn't work, it should make the whole film feel like a trip to church, but, the pipe organ sound adds to the feeling of an empty void that is space, asking the question \"are we alone\" that Interstellar subtly focuses on throughout the film. Interstellar is full of these deeper themes. Although I do appreciate it, the themes that are presented aren't as unique as the rest of the film. The themes don't seem to have any meaning to the characters or the overall story, almost as if they were thrown in at the last minute. Too give an example of this, the ending where Matthew Mcconaughey sees his daughter one last time before she dies could have meant much more if he actually stayed to watch her die. Earlier in the film, Matt Damon's character mentions how the last thing a parent sees is their child. Contrasting this at the end would have made everything feel much more rounded, because, without it, Matt Damon's character serves no real purpose other than to make the movie about 20 minutes longer. Not to mention, the character is kind of flat, as are many characters in this film. Every character acts as an archetype, and are often more 2 dimensional rather than not. This is partially due to the dialogue. While Nolan has nearly mastered the art of making a film, dialogue has never been his strong suit. That is evident in Interstellar more than any other film, dis-including Dark Knight Rises. So, overall, the film's visual style is incredibly unique, and the more technical aspects all are near perfection. However, in Interstellar, it seems that Christopher Nolan put the way the film looks over the story.",

McConaughey's Cooper and Hathaway's Amelia Brand join a team of astronauts to lead an expedition into space to battle extinction on Earth. Their mission is to find a habitable planet in another galaxy to which mankind can escape to, from our apocalypse-approaching Earth. The almost three-hours long adventure that follows is full of strange new worlds, a lot of techno-talk, and a fair bit of philosophical debates.\n\nInterstellar is an astounding prototype of superior science fiction films, the kind which refuses to let you look away from the screen even when space suit-clad scientists discuss theoretical physics. On their mission to find a habitable, cognizable planet, the Cooper, Amelia, and the rest of the astronauts on the mission are removed from everything that defines them as humans. They have had to leave their families, their homes, and their jobs back on Earth to take on the Herculean responsibility of saving mankind from perishing on the soon-to-be-inhabitable Earth. Apart from this planned objective, they have no idea what lies their way. From entering a wormhole to setting foot on an ocean-planet to falling inside a black hole, they face all kinds of complex and scientific obstacles.\nHans Zimmer's background score helps in relaying the underlying thrill to the audience and lends a somewhat hypnotic effect to the film. Interstellar has just the right blend of science and fiction which makes it an enjoyable watch along with being thought-provoking and scientifically viable. Even after you have walked out of the theater, one thing you can be sure of is that this film will stay with you long after it has ended.",

As a science-geek myself, I thoroughly enjoyed the physics aspect of it. For instance, the concept of time and fifth dimension in the movie are the two things that stood to me the most. \n\tAs an astrophysical based movie, Nolan connects the science fiction story to a more sentimental aspect - family and love. Despite the movie having a deeper understanding and explanation of the alternative universe that exists, it emphasizes the importance of family. It also plays a major role in portraying the relationship between a father & daughter who undergo many sacrifices. \n\tAs the movie progresses, the understanding of the movie progresses too. What I find most intriguing about Interstellar is that it engages audiences from the get-go and the person will always be interested to know what will occur next.

The movie gave us the best role ever of Matthew McConaughey With greats performances of Anne Hathaway , Jessica Chastain And Michael Caine . The way of photography was simply a masterpiece, and the selected photography sites were perfect, and I don't think it is possible to find a better one . Music was a fantasy by the genius Hans Florian Zimmer and of course it has a big role in the attachment with the movie with the movie . Once you enter watching the movie, it starts taking you to dimensions you never expect and makes you feel part of it. As for the end of the movie, it will make you realize values and lessons that will remain in your mind forever.. When the movie ends, you will realize that it is very difficult and even unlikely to see a movie of the same level as  interceller . To everyone who has not seen this masterpiece, I highly recommend you to watch it, you will enjoy it. A big greeting to everyone who contributed to this project. \nPeace.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan surprises moviegoers yet again with another (Inception, you've seen it, right?) mind-bending (and blowing) sci-fi movie. Armed with an impressive cast and a physics professor to keep abreast of the latest discoveries in physics (though I suspect they're all just theories), Interstellar is literally unstoppable. Although the movie's attempt to keep in line with scientific accuracy makes the plot pretty hard to understand, Interstellar is very cleverly narrated and succeeds in captivating viewers with its beautiful, grand cinematography (such an aesthetic depiction of space). I was also surprised at how the movie portrays wormholes and black holes differently (more realistic, I guess?) from the predominant spiral-like shape, which gives them a much more mystifying and wonderous tone. The film makers really tried hard to boost Interstellar's faithfulness in its theme, didn't they (I can go as far as to call this flick a documentary film)? There're small details that might grab your attention, you know. As for the story, I can say that it's intriguing enough, maybe even more than enough. Space-adventure can be a bit dull and even boring for some (my feelings towards it are well, neutral), but Interstellar is nothing like that. I, with utter confidence, can declare that the movie is \u2018very' exciting and suspenseful. Interstellar is a mixture of science, drama, love, and dust (don't forget the blight as well). Anyway, in my opinion, the father-daughter storyline was very well-chosen as the main plot since its quite enjoyable and heartwarming. Matthew McConaughey is splendid as Joseph Cooper, so the story moves on smoothly. I think all the actors were given the right roles to play, though some of the characters don't do much (wish I could have seen more of Anne Hathaway's Dr. Amelia Brand). As is Nolan's usual habit, an astonishing twist awaits us in the movie (the revelation came as a complete shock to me, mostly because I wasn't expecting it at all). Then, as the twist plays out, we're introduced to Dr. Mann (Matt Damon). I mentioned him because he was the only character in the whole movie who succeeds in disappointing me. I'm not going to say much about him since Dr. Mann plays an essential role in moving forward the plot, but I just want to say that his motives are somewhat irrational (not that all villains' intentions have to make sense). Now finally, the ending. I understand perfectly that due to the immense gravitational pull of Gargantua (which is a black hole), time moved much slower for Cooper and his team. And that by getting sucked into the black hole, Cooper was able to communicate with Murph via some forth dimensional mobile network. But how in the world did Cooper escape from the black hole? I don't get it. I mean, according to science, if something enters the Event Horizon, nothing, not even light, can evade the black hole's clutches. So how did Cooper manage this time-traveling fit? (I'm not much of a physics expert, so the reason for that particular situation might exist out there somewhere, but don't blame me for that) Anyhow, here's my conclusion: Interstellar is interesting and all, but without some basic knowledge of the physics used in the movie, it's going to be a perplexing journey through that black hole.",

            "content": "\"Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.\" \ud83e\ude90\n\nAmbitious, loud and sublime, almost to a fault, the 2014 sci-fi epic from blockbuster auteur Christopher Nolan fascinates, and drains, on an emotionally charged three hour odyssey that's sure to leave audiences overwhelmed, just as the writer-director intended. Boldly going where few filmmakers have gone before, Nolan, alongside his longtime writing partner and brother Jonathan, proves he's at his best when interweaving breathtaking landscapes, heart-pumping set pieces and stunning cinematography with affecting character moments, poetic storytelling and poignant themes. Receiving a mixed response from critics when first released, much criticism was thrown at the film's lofty runtime, melodramatic sequences and clunky dialogue, yet these fail to tarnish an otherwise captivating and thought-provoking experience. Soon to be seen in the same pantheon of sci-fi classics from Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott, Earth's finest all turn in fantastic work, such as a superb leading man performance by Matthew McConaughey, strong supporting efforts from Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, and the career-best Hans Zimmer score that slingshots this picture into another dimension.\n\n9/10 cold cryostasis cameos.",

            "content": "A hopeful look at humanity's future.\n\nChristopher Nolan's science-fiction adventure drama Interstellar (2014) is a breathtaking vision of space exploration to save humanity from starvation due to a new dust bowl. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan's script is interesting in concept, but a plethora of scientific jargon just loses my interest quickly. I like certain sci-fi films, but they can get depressing during the post-apocalyptic scenes alongside endless science exposition to explain what the plot is about to the audience who would have no clue otherwise. Their human drama gets very sentimental and melodramatic, which is out of place for a Nolan feature. I will say I found Interstellar cathartic and poignant by the end with sincerely moving drama, but it can veer off course at times.\n\nInterstellar is not one of Nolan's better films with its slow pace and lack of action. I loved the emotional opening that unfortunately leads into a dull and boring middle. However, the entire third act is all phenomenal and thought provoking. From the water and ice planets onwards, I was riveted by the space concepts put into something tangible I could relate to alongside excellent action and harrowing drama. I found the start genuinely emotional as characters are introduced and ripped apart by fate, which endears you to the lead all the more. The central passage of space exploration feels more like space travel until a shocking reveal happens mid journey leading into the action packed finale. Interstellar is no 2001, Apollo 13, or Ad Astra, but it's as good as First Man and way better than Gravity. Interstellar is ideologically opposite of Ad Astra as the former wants humanity to reach for the stars, while the latter would have us focus on our home first.\n\nNolan's direction is captivating so that Interstellar's 169 run-time is not jarring. His clear love of sci-fi is apparent with ambitious and stunning visual effects with groundbreaking scientific concepts. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is breathtaking as space has never looked so vast. Stars, wormholes, black holes, and planets pass by with equal grace in Hoytema's magnificent wide shots. Lee Smith's editing is pretty sleek for such a large picture. He keeps the pace steady to match Hoytema's visual style. Interstellar sometimes feels like a roller coaster the audience is forced on with scary spaceship rocking and spinning like something out of a spatial nightmare.\n\nHans Zimmer notably composes one of his most refined and enthralling scores for Interstellar. His lovely melodies are a far cry from his pounding Batman scores or his blaring Inception music. Zimmer clearly took the criticisms of his music seriously after detractors had called his scores too loud, obnoxious, and in the way. Interstellar sounds full of serene symphonic melodies and chilling organ passages. Zimmer's use of the organ in Interstellar is second to none. Hans Zimmer complements the intensely emotional scenes as well as the frightening cosmic action alike!\n\nMatthew McConaughey is fantastic as the astronaut Joseph Cooper. His devastating displays of dejection and loss are Earth shattering to watch. McConaughey plays Coop seriously with an affection for family and a respect for piloting that makes his character Cooper incredibly riveting. He has a great chemistry with Anne Hathaway's Dr. Amelia Brand. She is so focused, mean, and blunt you will not even recognize Hathaway with her pixie cut and dry humor. I like her a lot in Interstellar. Jessica Chastain is excellent as the conflicted adult Murph. She brings a sense of knowledge and gravitas to Murph that makes her genius believable. Mackenzie Foy is outstanding and heartbreaking as young Murph. It's too cool that Christopher Nolan cast Ellen Burstyn as old Murph with her wizened intellectual presence.\n\nMichael Caine is wonderful and intriguing as Professor John Brand. His bedside scene is hard to watch as he feels so real there. John Lithgow is hard hitting with his advice and criticisms. Casey Affleck is excellent as the jaded adult Tom, while icon of his generation Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is underused as the young Tom. They both could have been developed more as Nolan cast two of the greatest actors alive and didn't give them many lines. Bill Irwin is fun as the voice of the sarcastic robot TARS. Matt Damon is phenomenal and arguably my favorite aspect of Interstellar as the unreal villain of Interstellar named Dr. Mann. His crazy twist is shocking and exciting to watch Damon act his heart out for Nolan.\n\nDavid Gyasi plays broken, weak, and intellectually strange well as Dr. Romilly. Wes Bentley is good as Dr. Doyle, but is not as memorable as the rest of the cast. Topher Grace is an alarmingly distracting casting decision that I didn't care for as he doesn't even get to do anything interesting as Getty. Everyone else in the cast served their purpose, but didn't blow my mind.\n\nIn all, Interstellar is a well made film with an interesting concept. It goes overboard with certain sci-fi concepts, but I enjoyed the bizarre ending twist as well as the stranger logic throughout Interstellar. Nolan is such an engaging director that he can make anything cool.",

The sound design elevates the story and Han Zimmers score is amazing he is my favorite composer working now. The editing is fabulous. The movie creates such good characters with them being compelling and he gets asked to go in space and he doesn't know when he's going to return we don't want him to go because he will miss his family but he has to go and do the right thing. I loved the story it kept me wanting more and more and it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish wondering what will happen. There is one thing towards the very end of the movie that may throw people off but I feel it really worked for what it was going for.

Though it does take time to move the plot, more is done in for the sake of exposition and world(s)-building. The visual effects of this film are astonishing.\n\nAlso, I applaud Nolan's decision to hire Hans Zimmer on this masterpiece. Without his mesmerizing work, this film would have felt incomplete.\n\nInterstellar came out at a time there was waning government interest in space. Funding was cut for NASA and we were unsure if we'd ever launch a space mission again. But with the success of Interstellar among other events, we're back to seeing space exploration in the cultural mainstream.

            "content": "Christopher Nolan is one of those directors who do not see each day, is known and respected for the trilogy of the knight of the night and for telling his stories in different chronological order. Interstellar was a film acclaimed both by critics and by the audience, it could be said that these were the main reasons why I wanted to see it, apart from Matthew McConaughey being the protagonist.\n\nThe movie has a good start, because you understand who is who and what you need to know about the main characters. The performances are as always in the excellent Nolan movies, the comrade movements seemed good to me, the environment I loved because it is not fictional, you think that what you are seeing is real.\n\nThe script is great in the sense that you can understand that Nolan made him want since he even bothered to ask a professional in Astronomy to help write the script.\n\nThe plot may sound something simple but it is really very complex, it would be that the characters have to find a habitable approach to save humanity from extinction, if that sounds very simple, but it is not because there is more like that mission itself was a farce and the human relationships of the characters.\n\nThe relationships of the characters feel real, the movie made me feel how the characters felt, it is very emotional to see how Cooper takes his time to decide whether to go to the mission to save humanity or stay with his children in the earth, for example when Cooper is taking the mission and his daughter tries to reach him desperately, you manage to feel the sadness that the characters feel at that moment, and that is something that not many films achieve, if their realization with Murph is quite complex, you could say that the main theme of the film is love, everything is done for love, in fact you could say that love is what saves humanity, the connection between Murph and Cooper is so strong that it helps Murph to save the humanity from extinction.\nBut no matter how emotional it is, Nolan did not make a perfect movie, since in itself, it makes no sense that a secret government organization hires a subject who has not seen in years for such an important mission, and when the characters go to the water planet and one of the characters stays on the ship, I understand that the hours spent there were 20 years on earth and on the ship, therefore I have to ask myself questions like:\n\nHow the hell did that guy survive 20 years on the ship alone without losing his sanity, entertaining himself and not resorting to suicide? Did they have provisions for 20 years? Wow, that guy really deserves all my respect, for surviving that, and the truth is that something that surprised me about Nolan was that, it was very obvious those who were going to die and those who were going to live, I say they surprised me because Nolan He is a respected director for not making mediocre mistakes, if he may make mistakes in his movies, but not as mediocre and repetitive as that.\n\nIn conclusion Interstellar is a film that I personally liked very much, with good performances, an interesting environment, a good direction, characters with personality, but with things that have weight for plot, which are the opposite of reality, this movie It deserves a 7/10 but I will make an exception, for the good attitudes, for the complexity of the protagonists, because Nolan took the trouble to ask for help from a professional for the script and because it entertained me a lot, it is because that this movie for me is an 8/10.",

The big \"twist\" towards the end, I actually saw coming about an hour before it happened, so I was disappointed that there wasn't more to it. Very anti-climatic ending too.  There were some very intriguing moments but I wish there was a condensed version. The movie's main \"lesson\" was how valuable time is. So maybe spending 3 hours of my life to remember how valuable time is was worth it?  Some really good moments of science, but some ridiculously stupid fails as well. Better than a lot I've seen though.  ",

I loved those slow, silent pans across Saturn, reminiscent of much older films like 2001 (as was the weirdness towards the end!) The pseudo-science-speak was mostly okay, and I enjoyed the tantalising sense of impending discovery\u2014of higher dimensions, or connecting relativity and quantum mechanics perhaps.

Secondly, this movie, while very much a Nolan, is the creation of Kip Thorne, and it includes some very revolutionary cosmology theories and black holes, and space-time bending, even to the point the pre production work of the movie resulted in two Nature publications. Not only that, the simulations of the black hole used for special were proven right to be extremely accurate after last years ever photo of a black hole. Kip Thorne also got a Nobel prize just a few years after. So, the science is very science, although it also some VERY spectacularly ideas, or rather tale tales, about what might happen inside a black hole.

On the other hand, the acting is really good, you can feel the worry and angry of Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway in his try to save the humanity. A last thing that I have to mention is that the visual effects are really good, good enough to raze with the majority of the movie awards in 2014, including Oscar\u00b4s Award.\nSo, if you want to have 3 hours of pure emotions, suspense, action and love, you should watch this movie.\n",

This movie was nominated and won the Best Visual Effects Oscar at 2015.\n\nThe atmosphere at the movie it really caught you because they explain somethings about the universe and their faults maybe isn't a funny way to lear but its entertaining to lear a few more about the universe and what they're trying to do isn't a crazy thing. Actually they show us that maybe more planets in the Universe are able to host live.\n\nI think this movie is the best one ever because the soundtrack, the cast, the production and the visual effects made a great work  they knew how to got my attention, the script isn't boring, they show you how unpredictable can be the space, how big it is, dark and at least for my was stressful that feeling.",

No words can describe how Christopher Nolan takes us to the adventure. He is a really good producer and we have seen it since Inception to The Batman Dark Knight. \nWhat I like the most in this movie is that it doesn`t go against any physic law everything was supported by a physicist that helped making the movie precise and really convincing.\nI think Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, both did a great performance. They together, protagonist and supporting actress, created magic in this movie. \nAt one point, it took my breath away after finishing the almost 3 hours, it keeps me thinking that this movie could be real, Earth is dying and if we do not do something about it, we do not know where are we going to end.\nThis movie really gets you to think your exact place in time and space, it also makes you question about yourself, your life and everything surrounding you. We are really small compared to what there is outside there.\nIt takes you to think that love is the only thing that can transcend space or time. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals.

Interstellar is no different. The best scientific minds label it as a masterpiece. \nThis is a filmmaker's film, in contrast to an actor's film. \nInteresting Facts about \"Interstellar\" is that, the science behind the movie is advancing the field of astrophysics.\n\nDefinitely, yes. I have seen many sci-fi films and Interstellar is the best one (no offence). It depicts events with maximum accuracy and logic. It is based on a fantastic concept of Interstellar journey. I was amazed by the imagination of writer, director Christopher Nolan and how well he executed it on screen. \nThree things distinguish the film from recent space-themed movies: it is grounded in the current concerns of our world; its plot is rich in the technically accurate science and technology of spaceflight and the movie pays homage to the best of the spaceflight cinema genre. All three themes transport the viewer and leave few concerns for what might be missing, rather than what the film got wrong. \nThe movie begins with a series of filmed oral history interviews with survivors of a global dust bowl that has resulted from a plague that eroded agricultural production to the monoculture of corn. The interviews fade into a farmhouse where widowed NASA pilot-turned-farmer, Cooper, aka Coop (Matthew McConaughey) lives with his father-in-law and two children. We know the setting is the not-too-distant future because the technology of computers and drones are part of our reality. The Earth will survive, but it won't support life. More importantly, humanity is also doomed because the culture that has prevailed accepts the current situation as an inevitable consequence of past mistakes. The Apollo program, it is widely believed, was all faked, a propaganda ploy concocted to bankrupt the Soviet Union. The scientific genesis of the plot is the recognition that humans have exploited. \nNever before have I seen a movie blend sci-fi and philosophy like this. It's fascinating.",

That's as much as you can do, for a film so heavy and personally touched. The writer and director Christopher Nolan is a believer of doing your homework properly. Simple as that. And working with Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist, he has embodied the actual laws of physics in the film to a certain degree that it, itself started to create storylines of its own. Deciding to go towards the call, Nolan jam-packs this three hour of film with a whole lot of science and maths.\n\nAnd just as it happened previously in Inception- not in this scale, of course- the science took over the emotional impact of these incredibly empathetic characters. Now, the only reason why this one comes off a bit slow in that department, compared to the Inception, is because it over-explains the narrative arcs more than the theories and philosophies of this science expenditure. Just walk through the jolting revelation placed later in the film, which spirals out an informative; yet not actually informative, conversation between Mathew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon discussing Michael Caine's character.\n\nOnce again, these are just minor flaws in this touching love story, where my personal favorite aspect of it is how mythological the equation between a father and a daughter comes off, especially in the final moments of the film. That very piece of note resembles beautifully with Steven Spielberg's AI: Artificial Intelligence. Another thing to note here, is how simple Nolan's direction and choices in the film are. In a complex dystopian future, he has kept things elemental- for instance the planets are often painted as one key, like water, rocks, dust and even love(!)- in order to mark the events occurred in this long Interstellar travel clearly.",

After the airlock depressurizes, the music is just as surprised as the actors - it stopped. But now everything is in danger of failure. If they dont dock and recover the vessel, humanity is lost. So the music builds up the tension in this scene, it is a very dangerous docking maneuver.

It's fun to watch and it doesn't make any major mistakes that distract from the universe it creates.  I enjoyed the personal stories and conflicts and there was a 15-minute sequence of scenes that builds and maintains suspense so masterfully I was calling out verbally just watching at home - I can only imagine what it would have been like in a theatre.  I'm not sure how it will hold up on subsequent viewings, but my first 3 hours (yes it is long) were extremely entertaining.

The script is based on the facts of Pulitzer Prize winning Astrophysicist Dr. Kip Thorne, with additional theories references from Einstein and Hawking.  The script is based on love for family and to the love to save mankind where our planet is suffering from overpopulation, loss of oxygen, and loss of food source associated to the same degree as Grapes of Wrath during the Great Depression.  The movie is similar to 2001 Space Odyssey but I just didn't understand how McConaughey's character ends up back in our solar system and how his daughter was able to save mankind and build a planet like ship that is similar to scenes in the movie Inception.

Everyone was hoping that Interstellar was going to be the next 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but it's not. Interstellar is not a perfect film. It has a good amount of flaws, but it is still an amazing film. Let's start with the amazing performances. Matthew Mcconaughey has one of his best performances in this movie, and the emotion he expressed in this film actually made me cry at times. The actors that play the character Murph (the actors played younger and older versions of this character) had riveting performances and she also made me cry at the emotional moments. The cgi in this film gives me chills thinking about it because all the space and planet sequences looked so real and beautiful, it's probably one of the best cgi used in any film EVER! The story is about finding a new habitable planet, but the real theme of this movie is love. Matthew Mcconaughey's character had the choice of either finding a new planet and leaving his life behind, or staying with his family and letting the earth turning inhabitable. He chose to find a new habitable planet, and he and his daughter being apart, and him eventually regretting his actions has such a great emotional impact. The emotional impact in this film is probably the best aspect of this film, and this is one of the best emotionally driven Christopher Nolan films. But sadly, there is a handful of flaws. Matthew Mcconaughey was accompanied by other astronauts on this mission, and I did not really care about them or their backstories at all. Anne Hathaway plays one of the accompanying astronauts, and the movie concentrates more than they should on her, and I wasn't invested in her subplot because I cared way more for Matthew Mcconaughey and his daughter. Matt Damon also played an astronaut that was stranded on a planet with malicious intentions, and I even though his appearance is out of nowhere, I really did not care about him at all and I feel like he didn't even need to be in this film. The pacing of the first half is also very slow and at times did drag, but the second half really did escalate and became more of what this movie was supposed to be. I like the second half way better than the first half. Even with its glaring flaws, I still think this is a great film. 4/5",

However, Nolan is so highly ambitious and reaches farther with his stories than most people have or have dared, that sometimes the ambition reaches farther than it is able to grasp. This movie is a marvel in every sense, but the well-built-up story ends up falling short of its potential. Without spoiling, I will simply say that, while the ending is very good, the few scenes before it are pretty weak. The whole \"It's us, just not yet\" thing is, honestly, quite lame and felt like a cop-out; like Nolan dug a deep, but great, hole and then saw it was too high to climb out, so he just planted the shovel and stayed there. It's a fantastic movie, and the water planet is one of the best scenes, but plot-wise, it finds itself lacking.",

Interstellar, In my opinion, could have been the greatest space movie since 2001: a Space Odyssey. What made it fell short of a that cirteria for me was the writing. Its the type of movie that you need to rewatch a few times two full grasp its beauty. The expository dialouge was mediocre, and was useless. And it was hard for me to hear what the charcaters were saying half the time made it difficult to follow along. And the concept of love transcending space and time was nonsensical, and it wasnt as if they meeded that to be a fact in order for the movie to make sense, the plot would've still easily worked without the love nonsense. But nonetheless, interstellar was still a beautiful thought provoking film.its ability to interweave space science and physics with human connection and emotion along with a stunning soundtrack made interstellar a majestic and captivating story.",

This film takes the next logical step in the scifi and storytelling process started by Kubrick and Clarke showing humankind compelled into action by a blighted Earth.  The painstaking process of General Relativity also takes effect, and the film makes smart work of showing time flow according to Cooper's perspective, while time in the universe around him changes according to its relative flow.  Plus the set and environment designs were so well done, I had no problem suspending disbelief as the characters negotiated environmental rigors.  I suppose that despite the sound explanations, there's still some mystery left, leaving us to the question of what is the 5th dimension?  And why and how would a group of aliens (or whoever) manipulate that dimension to help us?",

I always thought I would wait for THE movie.\n\nAnd this is IT!\n\nWhen I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.\n\nFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.\n\nThe sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. \n\nThese two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).\n\nThen, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.\n\nAnd finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). \n\nWhy? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.\n\nBecause, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.\n\nMy rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.\n\nThis is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. \n\nInterstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. \n\nI have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.\n\nNow, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves \"behind\" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the \"black hole beyond the horizon\" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, \"all it takes is a little push ! \"\nThere have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.\n\nInterstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.\n\nNow, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.\n\nThis is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",

            "content": "Interstellar: Christopher Nolan's Greatest Film\n\n\tChristopher Nolan is arguably the greatest film director of our time. He has had many successful, big-budget films release in the 21st century, such as The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. However, despite those strong films, I believe that Nolan's finest big film he's made in modern times is Interstellar. That's a strong claim to make, considering the amount of commercially and critically successful films Christopher Nolan has directed, but Interstellar is strong enough to make such a strong claim. This also isn't a new movie still in the theaters,so why write about such a topic? I believe that this movie will be a part of the greatest films ever made in generations to come. The secret to these truths lies in the film's perfect balance of grounded relatability, and abstract concepts.\n\n\t\"Now hang on a minute,\" I hear you saying, \"you've already listed two other films that Nolan's done that do both of those things.\" That is true. The Dark Knight trilogy certainly does a good job of staying grounded in the world of Batman, while still keeping some of the fictional concepts of the caped crusader in there. However, The Dark Knight trilogy isn't balanced between those two things. Those movies have a greater emphasis on keeping Batman and Gotham City relatively grounded and relatable to our own world. The most abstract concept present in the films is Ra's al Ghul and his League of Assassins, with their mystical knowledge of supernatural things, but even that is fairly grounded in these movies compared to what they can do in the comics. Often times I consider Nolan's Dark Knight movies as the \"realistic\" Batman movies. There's nothing wrong with that, that's what makes those movies so good, and indeed being grounded is what helps make Interstellar good, but The Dark Knight trilogy is lacking in keeping the audience in awe and wonder of fantastical impossibilities.\n\n\t\"Hang on another minute,\" I hear you say, \"if fantastical impossibilities is what you're looking for, then Inception has you covered.\" That is also true. Inception definitely isn't lacking in that department, what with the film's concept of going into other people's dreams and subconsciouses, and even making multi-level dreams for a single person. The problem I found with Inception was that, while there were grounded moments in the film, even within the dreams, I found the main abstract concept to be distracting from those moments. I felt the film got too complex within its own fiction for the audience to be able to truly connect with the characters in the story. For me, Inception was an awesome movie to watch, and a good thought-provoking film, but I hardly ever felt moments or characters that I could relate to. Inception is on the opposite side of The Dark Knight trilogy in terms of the grounded-abstract balance. In between these two, though, is Interstellar.\n\n\tWhere Interstellar outshines these other two movies is its ability to have characters and moments throughout the film that feel grounded to our own world, and thus relatable, and the abstract concepts that are interwoven into those grounded moments. The basic summary of Interstellar is a former NASA pilot turned farmer, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), is approached by NASA in hiding to be a pilot for their mission to find a new home for the human race, as Earth is running out of time as a habitable world with a blight pandemic on the rise. Cooper accepts, but only because he believes that his two kids will be able to escape Earth's terrible fate and live. I don't understand a whole lot about finding other habitable planets to live on and colonize, but I do understand wanting to protect my family and keep them safe. I don't have any kids myself, but seeing Cooper willing to go to great lengths to keep his kids safe, even to go as far as travelling to a whole new galaxy and face the terrors of space just to find a new home for his kids, I could strongly relate to Cooper and his struggles. Part of the reason for this is the performance that McConaughey gives as Cooper. He gave an excellent performance in this movie. That's not to say that Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio didn't give great performances in The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception respectively, but the other part that makes McConaughey's performance more powerful, in my opinion, is the context of the character he's playing. He's not playing as a billionaire who dresses up as bat, or a dream-specialist trying to clear his name of a past murder, he's playing the role of a father who wants to keep his kids safe, even in the darkest places of the universe.\n\n\tThe best example of the blend of grounded relatability and abstract concepts in Interstellar is between 1 hour 55 minutes and 2 hours 11 minutes in the film. *Spoilers ahead.* Dr. Mann, the scientist whose world Cooper's crew went to as their last hope of finding a habitable planet, reveals to Cooper that he faked the data he had been sending out, and that his planet isn't habitable, he just wanted to be rescued. Mann fights with Cooper, and he breaks a hole into Cooper's face shield in his helmet. Cooper manages to contact the rest of the crew that Mann lied about the planet, and that he was suffocating. The remaining crew fly over to Cooper's location and rescue him, while Mann steals one of their other ships to fly up to the Endurance, an interstellar space station Cooper's crew uses to travel to various planets. Cooper follows Mann, and tries to warn him not to dock with the station. Mann turns off the comms on his ship, and doesn't hear these warnings, and then docks with the station imperfectly. When he tries to enter, the airlock depressurizes, and Mann and his ship blows up, causing the Endurance to spin rapidly. Cooper knows that he can't get away from the planet, and in turn he can't save his kids, without the Endurance. \n\n     Cooper attempts to match the spin of the station and manually dock with it. This scene is underscored by music, composed by Hans Zimmer, that perfectly relays the tension, intensity, and stakes of the situation to the audience. If Cooper doesn't dock with the station perfectly, not only will he and his crew die, but the rest of mankind will have no hope for survival, including Cooper's kids. The music increases in tempo and volume as Cooper gets closer to docking with the station, and as he begins to dock, the music starts to calm down until it goes to a moment of silence when Cooper and crew successfully dock with the spinning station. I say this moment is not only the best moment of the whole film, but is also a great example of the film's balance between grounded relatability and abstract concepts. Except for a rare few, most of us don't know and won't know what it's like to fly a plane or spaceship, let alone dock one with a space station orbiting a foreign planet that's orbiting a black hole in a foreign galaxy. What most of us do know are the actions we're willing to take to protect those we love, even if those actions seem impossible to others. The interaction between Cooper and a on-board robot, CASE, in regards to matching the spin of the ship with the Endurance, demonstrates this statement:\n\"CASE: It's not possible.\nCOOPER: No, it's necessary.\"\nThis brief bit of dialogue in this scene is the best bit of dialogue in the film, due to the grounded-abstract balance the film attains, when impossibilities smack into real and urgent necessities.\n\n\tWhile Nolan has made many great films, Interstellar is his finest work, and I believe will always be among his finest work going forward. Whether he can top the perfect blend of grounded relatability and abstract concepts of this film in his future films has yet to be seen, but I believe that this film will go down as Nolan's greatest work, and even as one of the greatest films in human history.",

That's actually the problem with most Nolan films: He is a master of visual storytelling, with some of the richest and most imaginative settings in recent memory, sublime scoring, and precisely tuned plotting. Yet a movie like Interstellar stumbles, ultimately, because the ideas driving it are so flimsy. Love as a measurable force? C'mon. In attempting to celebrate what makes us human, he divorces us from our inmost desires and drives, making them alien and supernatural and metaphysical. Even a Philosophy 101 student knows better than that. And making matters worse is the remarkable sexism and bad faith politics Nolan needs to drive these points home, all couched in the appearance of their opposite: It may look like we have two strong female characters, but the whole point for Nolan is that they are irrational, and continually punished for it. But it sure is nice to watch, I admit.\n\nUPDATE: Having now seen the runtime cutdown to a clean 95 mins and its lofty self-importance cut apart by riffing cutups, I'm all the more amazed that audiences would ever think of this as anything other than a black hole of excessively heavy-handed metaphysical codswallop. Good pseudo-Philip Glass score, though.",

            "content": "This film proved that Nolan can make any movie and it will be good; this film is Christopher Nolan 2nd best he has ever made (Behind The Dark Knight). It has fantastic acting by Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine, (Spoiler if you have not seen it) Matt Damon, and Anne Hathaway (Although her character wasn't the most interesting her performance was fantastic. The relationship between Father and Daughter is wonderful and you can truly feel it and it is a big emotional factor in this film. Now the musical score by Hans Zimmer is by far the best in this movie; it is so great and personally I think it is not only Hans Zimmer best musical score yet, I think it is the best Musical Score of all time. I have few negatives with this film: It has some storytelling problems in a way the first time you view this movie you won't get some stuff and sometimes you won't know what is going on probably because of all the crazy scientific stuff in it (So view it a second time to really give this movie a feel) and my second and last negative is that these characters won't act like normal humans at times and do some things that your like a normal person or even a super smart person won't even do and I think they do that so they can move the plot along. But at the end of the day this film is incredible and you should check it out.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s just as I thought -- Matthew McConaughey is a space cadet.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) This could have been called 2001: The Year We Make Contact. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: We meet a man named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who lives on earth in the not too distant future. The Earth at this point is a dying planet. Dust storms and blight are ravaging a dwindling human population that relies on a weakening agrarian economy. Cooper has a teenage son and a 10-year-old daughter named Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), whose bedroom is the scene of odd occurrences. Books fall off her shelves and dust arranges itself in strange patterns. Cooper figures out that the dust contains coordinates to a location nearby. When he and Murphy drive there, they discover a huge, secret NASA base.\n\nGREG: Because the Earth is dying, the only way out is towards the stars. By some miracle a wormhole has emerged near Saturn (why so far away?) and NASA has sent 12 men and women out to find planets on the other side of the wormhole (near other stars) that could sustain the survivors of Earth. But there is a  Plan B  - they ve in vitro-fertilized enough eggs to start a new colony of humans on a habitable planet in the event that it takes too long to find a safe world. Take too long, you say? Well, because of the relativistic effects of space travel and flying near black holes and through wormholes, what seems like a few years to our heroes could be a century back on Earth. So, NASA has asked Cooper (a former astronaut) to man the final mission and find the habitable planet. But, he will have to leave behind his young daughter. Will he return in time to save her? Or will he be marooned in space leaving behind the last of his kind?\n\nSCOTT: Interstellar is a complex, ambitious, space epic. It s a long movie, covering almost three hours, and its topic and detailed story are so complex that if it were a television show it could be a long-running mini-series. As a movie, it could have easily been carved into a trilogy. But the decision was made to condense this sweeping arc into a single 170-minute long film. The result is a movie that is breathtaking in scope but a bit too densely packed to give its grand cosmological theme the room it needed to breathe. Still, I was impressed. Interstellar is no lightweight escapist science fiction story. There is a lot to sink our teeth into here, and some of it is pretty heavy emotional material. The earth is in its death throes, the close bonds between fathers and daughters are being shattered, and heroic astronauts are dying in space while trying to save humanity from extinction. We learn that John Lennon was prescient when he sang  love is the answer  more than 40 years ago, as love is interwoven with physics during the film s many attempts to explain the workings of the universe.\n\nGREG: When you look at Interstellar you cannot help but compare it to classic science fiction movies gone by. It has the trippy look and feel of 2001: A Space Odyssey. But it is far more coherent than Kubrick s masterpiece. And, like Contact, the relationships and bonds between father and daughter are at the core of this story. And that is what I really walked away with in Interstellar. As any good story should be, this is a story about relationships. The physics and high technology were amply evident (who cannot love robots with the personalities of Marines?). But this is very much a story about people. We see how a planet reacts when the food supply runs out. We see how people grow to fear science they cannot understand. There s a wonderful scene where a teacher replaces textbooks with government-issue books explaining that the Apollo missions were faked as a way to bankrupt the Russians. And there s a quote about sending Cooper s older son to college to study farming because  the world doesn t need any more engineers. We didn t run out of planes and television sets. We ran out of food. \n\nSCOTT: As hero stories go, you can t do much better than Interstellar. Cooper follows the classic hero journey almost to the letter. He is sent out into space (the unfamiliar world) and he is charged with saving the world. All heroes are missing some quality, and in Cooper s case he is missing an understanding of what binds the universe together. The answer is not unlike what Dorothy discovers in The Wizard of Oz -- the answer is love, home, and gravity. Ironically, Cooper mentors himself, or more specifically (using wormhole time-travel magic) Cooper s older self serves as the mentor to his younger self. Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and an older version of Murphy also assist Cooper on his journey. At the end, Cooper is a transformed individual, having gained an understanding of his place in the universe. Overall, it s a textbook hero story.\n\nGREG: I think you re giving short-shrift to the message here. While Cooper already understands how to love - he has an undying love for his daughter. But he doesn t see love as a binding force in the universe - as much as we see time or the three dimensions. He has an argument with co-astronaut Brand (Anne Hathaway) who wants to let her heart be her guide. She posits that finding her lost love (one of the astronauts who went before them) is just as valid as calculating orbits and fuel ratios. And this is the lesson that our hero ultimately learns. It is his love for his daughter that finally drives him to make a connection with her in the past. He manipulates time and space to send her a message that will save her and what is left of humanity. In the end, the lesson learned is that love binds the universe just  as much as any other dimension. That s pretty heady stuff for a geek movie. If you want to look for villains, we see a different take on villainy here. Professor Brand makes the decision for all mankind that trying to escape Earth and transplant the existing humans on another planet is fruitless. He has decided that Plan B is the ultimate solution. So, he s lied to his daughter as well as everyone else on the mission. Plan A was never the goal. This villainy is different from most that we ve seen. This is the villainy of a lack of hope. The Professor gave up hope for all of mankind and reasoned that the only hope was to start over. One of the castaway astronauts was Dr. Mann (Matt Damon in a surprise appearance). He knew about Plan B. But the planet he found was not appropriate for human colonization. He purposely sent back a glowing report so that someone would come and rescue him. He has the villainous attribute of self-centeredness. This is also the point where the movie talks about preservation of the species and preservation of the individual. The conclusion is that the species can never overcome the selfish aspects of self-preservation.\n\nSCOTT: There is a good reason why Interstellar is a November release rather than a summer popcorn release. This movie makes us think, not just feel. We are treated to fabulous CGI effects, of course, but more importantly we are compelled to ponder deeply about our place in the universe and what lengths we would go to save our planet. The integration of love and gravity as the glue that binds us all together is an inspiring take-home message. I give this movie 4 Reels out of 5. As I noted, the hero story would make Joseph Campbell proud. Most of the central elements of the hero s journey from classic myth and legend shine through in their fullest form. Cooper possesses just about all eight of the Great Eight characteristics of heroes: he is strong, smart, resilient, charismatic, reliable, caring, selfless, and inspirational. There is even a reverse form of  atonement of the father .  I give him 5 Heroes out of 5. The villainy in this movie is difficult to categorize, and you re correct, Greg, that it defies convention in some ways. Professor Brand and Dr. Mann are possible villains, yes, but Cooper s main opponent is Nature. He is in a constant race against time and other laws of physics. Interstellar is not a movie about a hero defeating a villain. It s about a hero solving problems of the heart and problems of nature. For this reason, my villain rating is a mere 2 out of 5. Movie: Villains: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I agree, Scott. Interstellar was clearly released in November as an Oscar contender. It has high-caliber stars (McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, Damon, Chastain) and high-value CGI. But that wasn t enough for Gravity last year. We ll have to see what Meryl Streep is up to this year. Still, I was totally engrossed for the full 170 minutes. And I am the target demographic for this movie (Baby Boomer Geeks). I give Interstellar 5 out of 5 Reels. McConaughey really delivered in this film (although there were a few truck driving scenes that seemed to echo his recent  Lincoln  commercials). As a hero Cooper has everything we look for. He is so selfless that he gives up a lifetime with his daughter to save the human race. That s a lot of self sacrifice. I give Cooper 5 out of 5 Heroes. And I hate to agree with you three times in a row, Scott, but it s true: Time is the villain in this story. It is warped and twisted in ways like no other villain we have studied this year. Still, you need a human character to have an argument with, or  to be betrayed by. Professor Brand and Dr. Mann weren t the strongest of villains, but they exposed two different parts of the villain s psyche (lack of hope and self-preservation) that we haven t seen before. I give them 3 out of 5 Villains. Movie: Villains: Heroes:",

The Dark Knight Rises, I can understand, hell, I think the 5 stars I gave it in my review were a bit generous but was Interstellar really that polarizing despite what IMDb might say? Is it the overlong runtime? Some of the most universally acclaimed movies in history are 3 hours long. Oh, I think it's the scientific education, which proved to be too much for audiences. But, like most Nolanites, I think Interstellar is amazing. The visuals and cinematography are breathtaking, with the aspect ratio changing into fullscreen whenever it sees an opportunity to say \"Hey look, amazing visuals\". It's a thought-provoking story about love. I think I almost cried a bit with Matthew McConaughey when he sees his children sending him a video message having grown up to become Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain since 23 years have passed. Yeah, science. Hans Zimmer's score is phenomenal. In fact, I think Interstellar does its best to be scientifically accurate. Especially since one of the crew members is actually involved in science. It may be confusing but, like most Christopher Nolan movies, it's confusing in a good way. The result? An ambitious, gorgeous and even nearly heartbreaking sci-fi adventure that proves Nolan's still on a roll in his post-Dark Knight trilogy days. And, seeing how much everyone's loving Dunkirk so far, I just might go ahead and watch it.",

            "content": "Interstellar aka Spaception\nA film review by: Corey J Smith\nWhen Christopher Nolan, the creator of the film, \"Inception\", decided to take his next adventure to the stars, there was no question that it promised to be mind blowing and spectacular. That's what \"Interstellar\" does. It doesn't go gentle into that goodnight. It goes where lead actor Matthew McConaughey has never been before. It's two and half hour runtime explores strange new worlds that are masterfully rendered. \nAs with all journeys into space, Interstellar finds it's beginning on a stricken Earth. An agricultural blight has wiped out most of the world's capacity for food production, except corn.  Massive dust storms plague the planet. The number one form of employment is farming. This results in Depression Era like state where Joseph Cooper (Mcconaughey), a former NASA pilot, struggles to get by and provide for his family. Through a series of mysterious events, he's recruited into a last ditch effort by the remnants of NASA to travel into deep space via worm-hole and save the world. To do so, though, means he must leave behind his family, especially his precocious young daughter, Murphy (Murph). \nThe story is both familiar and exploratory. In the face of great hardship, an individual must take extraordinary measures to save not only his family but countless others as well. Cooper is often confronted with instances where he must choose between what he wants and what would be best for others. Nolan weaves both a story of personal hardship and a foil for the challenges which face humanity on a greater scale. As Cooper states at one point in the film, \"We used to look up and wonder about our place among the stars. Now we look down and wonder about our place in the dirt.\" In light of all that goes on in our day, Interstellar asserts that the best way is always forward and upward. It sparks the imagination and the possibilities of what more is 'out there'. \nFrom the start, Cooper is clearly a devoted family man. He abandoned his former passion of being a NASA test pilot so he could better care for his children after the passing of his wife. It's clear he has a distaste for farming life, but does so because he loves his children. This is what makes Cooper relatable. Nolan takes Cooper's relatability a step further as he introduces Professor Brand (Caine) and Amelia Brand (Hathaway), the top minds at NASA who appeal to Cooper to take on the dangerous mission to save humanity. Knowing that he's probably the only one capable of carrying out the mission, Cooper accepts, keeping in mind that his efforts would not only benefit humanity but also give his children a future. \nHis election to depart on the mission puts a strain between him and Murph's relationship as he leaves without reconciling the costly nature of the journey, realizing it could take years to return. After he leaves, his family moves on and he can only watch and wait eagerly to return home. Meanwhile, their mission is confronted with various challenges which put in jeopardy Cooper's ability to return home to his family, putting his resolve to the test. Cooper's struggle mirrors the complexities of contemporary life as challenges abound in our lives and we strive to satisfy the demands asked of us by various parties. The question in the end is whether or not we can reconcile the differences between those parties in light of the challenges we have to overcome. On a side note, seeing as how I don't like spoilers, I won't say how it works out for Cooper. \nInterstellar is by far one of the most visually and scientifically picturesque films to date. A central feature of the film is human deep space travel is enabled by a worm hole that appears next to Jupiter. On the other side is an expansive solar system dominated by an appropriately named black hole called \"gargantuan\". These central features of the film were rendered by physicists and artists. Their efforts yield a dazzling panorama of space, which offers a glimpse into the most complex form of human travel available. The immensity of such scenes is sure to captivate and amaze.\nInterstellar also manages to put a proverbial cherry on top of its freeze dried ice cream sundae of cinematic mastery. Hans Zimmer's musical prose in Interstellar shines brightly as he too embarks on an odyssey with his composition. His selection of the organ as his instrument of choice stands out from his other notable film scores, which often featured large brass and string sections. Its range of tone enhances the overall intensity of the film from moment to moment, from the tranquil to the chaotic and the melancholy to the joyful. Much like Nolan's writing, Zimmer's score acts as a portal through which one may reach out and touch the raw emotion of the film. A prominent scene in the film shows Cooper and Brand landing on a watery planet beset by perpetually reoccurring tidal waves the size of mountains (which they mistook as mountains). As Cooper and Brand look about, Zimmer's piece is quiet and supports the feeling of exploration. Upon realizing something isn't right, the music builds until it reaches a deep crescendo that is synonymous with Cooper and Brand's realization that the mountains aren't really mountains at all. Who wouldn't want their day to go by without Hans Zimmer's musical accents?\nIf there ever was a film that was both deep in nature and well-rounded with intensity and action, it would be Interstellar. The combination of genius script writing, heart pounding music, visual effects, and complex creates a tapestry worthy of space. From exploring the concept of a fifth dimension (yes, it really does), to simply making you sweat with anticipation because a few particular scenes are just so suspenseful, Interstellar does just that. It aims for infinity and beyond and makes it. You'll leave having travelled among the stars and will not simply go gentle into the good night.",

I can't say i've ever seen a movie reach as far as this one does, but Interstellar performs this flawlessly.\nThe plot will bring you on the brink of tears and your highest sense of joy. Multiple themes are tackled, hope, love, time, promises, and more and all leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Some of the most accurate scientific research/work went in to the production of this movie (Kip Thorne assisted) and brings ideas that most viewers have never even thought of. A chilling score by Hanz Zimmer brings emotion to every scene, and is so important to the overall appeal of this incredible movie. The acting is phenomenal. McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, etc (Nolan's favs) help aid the display of this movie's ideas and emotion. \n\nOverall, Interstellar shoots high and ends up even higher. It thrills, engages, and flat out astounds it's viewers in it's 3 hour runtime. It will leave you emotional, hopeful, and thinking about everything it has to offer for weeks after viewing. Those who were dissatisfied with the movie did not look at it for what it brought, but rather for a mere space film, something that it completely blows out of the water. Dialogue mixing and a cliche line about love are not its highest points, but in no way take away from the sheer amazement that this movie brings it's viewers. Undoubtedly a top 5 movie that I have ever viewed.",

            "content": "Interstellar has to be one of the great Space Odyssey films since 2001 a Space Odyssey. Interstellar is directed and written by Christopher Nolan. With a star-struck cast staring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn, John Lithgow, and Michael Caine.\n\nThe movies sets in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film  follows a group of astronauts to travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. \n\nBack into 2014, me and a group of friends are very in love with Christopher Nolan Films. Every time that if Christopher Nolan is releasing a new film, I am there!! I love Christopher Nolan's bills no if's nor buts. Not just because of tackling of great direction which this film is, not just the music by Hans Zimmer which it is fantastic, has to be one of the greatest movie soundtracks ever put to film history, cinematography is always the best of Christopher Nolan which it is in this film!! Not even a single flawless with any tackle direction that Christopher Nolan puts into himself. \n\nEvery time that Christopher Nolan makes a film it seems and breathes practical effects, this film is heavily heavily used with CGI, I couldn't even tell it looks like this film was made out of outer space, completely!! \n\nI do have some flaw moments with the story actually, because you know why, because every single time when I go see a Christopher Nolan film I try to detect the flaws of his films. I don't want to I don't need to. I just do because every single time of when I go see a Christopher Nolan film, I have to bring my brain with me. I do that to every practical film I go see, but I have no flawness with this film to complain about. \n\nEvery time I get the Blu-ray of any film I like to go behind the scenes, especially with Christopher Nolan films, they bringing a team of scientists for this film. This film is filled with science, practically this is not a three hour action-packed film, it is a Science course of space in college. \n\nMatthew McConaughey is excellent in this film, he just won Dallas Buyers Club for Best actor. He was on the right road when he chose his new project with Christopher Nolan and he did flawlessly amazing. And this is what I love about Christopher Nolan's characters humanity is the character. Choosing should I stay home with my kids or should I go to space to save my kids. Cooper, his character chose to save his kids. Anne Hathaway is pretty damn good in this film as well. I think this was her best collaboration with Christopher Nolan yet. \n\nI'm not gonna spoil this film I keep saying this in every single review for Christopher Nolan because it is required in my book to see a Christopher Nolan film. \n\nInterstellar has to be one of the most ambitious films of space that is ever been puttin out ever!! Interstellar was one of my favorite films of 2014, this film actually did drove me to the movie theater every single time I saw this film at least five times because it was that remarkable, visually amazing just visually. Hans Zimmer score is breathtakingly amazing, I think one of his best ever put out. I do love his music for the dark Knight, I do love inception his score, The lion King is his best, but this score of interstellar has to be his best. I can't wait for his collaboration with Dunkirk that's coming out in a couple weeks. \n\nSadly enough I do get the ending, I don't want to spoil it but let's just say it's almost like Stephen Spielberg meets with Christopher Nolan for the first time, and still has its ambiguous ending. Really good. Interstellar has to be one of the most ambitious space films ever put out, no exposition, just spaced traveling to save the world and it eye-opening for humanity if it ever turns out to be this way in the future for us. Christopher Nolan is still has it!! \n\nGrade: A Perfect 10",

It was the first time I saw a wormhole, a 5-dimensional tesseract. It blows you away. Especially when it is so gorgeous and frightening as these phenomenons. It is like Nolan took an astronomy textbook and visualized it. (it is everything, it is reality on film) \nEvery time the camera is pointed to actors though things go sour - so much went wrong there. Every character is wasted, no relationships are established correctly. The script feels like a counterweight to the visual storytelling: Nolan builds this haunting world with extreme crop shortage, dust storms - it is no meteorite-crash scenery that kills our earth, no, our planet and the humans on it are dying slowly, the subtlety makes the decay feel real. And then you have a just plain stupid interaction between cooper and a teacher where discuss whether scientific research is of any value. The space shots did their job, Nolan! I was amazed, inspired, completely struck by them - in so much love for humanity - and then you make Anne Hathaway give a cringey, cringey speech about love and how it guides people?! Why?! \nAlso, why are known actors even hired any more? Not for a second was I not seeing Jason Bourne, Alfred and Fantine.",

Ainda falando sobre a dire\u00e7\u00e3o do filme, ele sempre tenta ter um ar mais real nos filmes dele, nesse tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o foi diferente, nada na dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte parece ser futurista ou imposs\u00edvel de existir. Eu sempre fa\u00e7o quest\u00e3o de citar o realismo dele, porque \u00e9 uma das coisas que eu mais admiro sobre o diretor brit\u00e2nico. Falando um pouco sobre a trilha sonora do filme, pra mim, \u00e9 um dos melhores e maiores trabalhos do compositor Hans Zimmer, emociona e te deixa agoniado. Arrepios e olhos marejados ouvindo a trilha sonora dentro do contexto do filme \u00e9 muito bom de sentir. E enfim, o roteiro do filme, sendo o 1\u00b0 ato o melhor deles, \u00e9 bem desenvolvido, e busca aproximar o publico dos personagens, ponto para o roteiro. O 2\u00b0 ato se desenvolve muito bem, mas com alguns furos. Isso recorre tamb\u00e9m ao fato de ser um filme de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cientifica espacial, muitas pessoas n\u00e3o entendem aquelas teorias e logicas de espa\u00e7o que est\u00e3o sendo apresentadas, eu tenho um raso conhecimento sobre, e com isso eu consegui entender a maioria das coisas. Existem furos, alguns s\u00e3o claros, como explica\u00e7\u00f5es que eles mesmo d\u00e3o, mas que n\u00e3o fazem sentido, e fica por isso mesmo. O 3\u00b0 ato \u00e9 o \"desastroso\", \u00e9 o porque de algumas pessoas terem odiado o filme. Ele vai dando solu\u00e7\u00f5es radicais ao filme e montando toda uma teoria gravitacional, que volta no tempo mudando o passado atrav\u00e9s da gravidade, com salas infinitas de tempos diferentes e... \u00e9 confuso eu sei. Eu particularmente achei muito interessante e curioso, essa ideia colocada no filme \"nada volta no tempo, s\u00f3 a gravidade.\", e atrav\u00e9s disso eles montam o final do filme, com plot twist, e ele fica de certa forma em aberto. Esse em geral \u00e9 um dos meus filmes favoritos. \u00c9 uma fic\u00e7\u00e3o emocionante de drama, com uma trilha sonora impec\u00e1vel e com uma historia que o acompanha excepcional.\nNota: 9.0",

Don't waste your time and money. Speaking of McConaughey, he's basically playing the same philosophizing pseudo-intellectual we see in those Lincoln car commercials.

Christopher Nolan has impressed me in the past with pretty great films, even though I was never really a big fan of the dark night trilogy. I was aware of his talent in his previous works but I never gave them enough value for what they are. One thing I've noticed from his films is that he engages the audience in thought provoking situations that even makes oneself question what they beheld on screen. The film inception achieves that by emerging the audience in a style of filmmaking that is scarce today and should be practiced more often, but Nolan also tackles thought provoking themes and plots that will never fade away. \n\nInterstellar was his next attempt in making a great film that would change the way people view space exploration, by also integrating a father daughter relationship in the center of the story. When I first saw this film, I was stunned by what I beheld and almost considered it too good to be true. I for one am a big science fiction fanatic with favorite Hollywood blockbusters such as Star Wars, E.T., Jurassic Park, ect... but interstellar brought me the pleasure of viewing realistic scientific theories about space and time while maintaining a fictional plot. \n\nI don't remember a moment in the film where I felt bored or uninterested, because every moment in the movie was not only shot beautifully, but executed to near perfection as the actors pushed themselves to great limits. Matthew McConaughey did an excellent job portraying his character Cooper and carried out an emotional scene later in the film that jerked a few tears. His effort and success in his character is was oscar worthy. I definitely think everyone should see this film, even if you end up hating it.",

The master of twists and deception made Batman real, showed us how dreams work in Inception, and brought us inside the dangerous world of magic in the Presitige. In his latest film, Interstellar, Nolan tackles the concept of time and how different it is from what we perceive. This film does have a great twist in the end and some terrific special effects, but beyond that it is one of the longest and slowest moving films I've seen in years. Once again, Humans have finally destroyed Earth and have gone looking for a new home, but outside our solar system, things are much different than they appear. Time and gravity are different concepts in different regions of space, and the effects on the crew, who had hoped to one day see their families again, diminish with each passing day. Matthew McConaughey stars and as is the case with most of his films, he's terrific. Based on some of the poor choices he made in his younger years, he has a bad rep among critics, but the fact is that he's always fun to watch, and is one of the most intense actors out there today. As for the rest of the film, it's usually Nolan's genius that makes the film unique and special, but in this instance he was too smart for his own good. The story moves very slowly and at times is more than somewhat confusing, not to mention at nearly three hours long, it's a challenge to sit through to even reach his famous twist at the end. Nolan films are something I always look forward to, as they are different and both entertain me and make me think, but in this case, I was just beyond bored and fed up with the whole thing. I guess sometimes even genius takes a holiday.",

But there isn't even an attempt. It's just put out there as if it's a \"no duh\" reason for any of this shit. Inception had an internal consistency that in the end, made sense. Interstellar tries, but disappears up its own ass in the attempt. Hard to buy the drama when the science and the lead characters' explanation of it is so opaque.

Every time I watch it (about 7 times), it never fails to amuse me and I'd like to say I learn something new everytime. While many believe this has a lot of plot-holes, it really doesn't if you took the time to watch it again and be more attentive to every detail which you can tell Nolan thought out.

The film's seed started from works of Carl Sagan way back in the 80's then Spielberg was going to make the film but handed it to the Nolan brothers. \nBest \"space\" movie I've seen and much deeper than average outer-space films that are usually about failing missions and portraying mostly astronauts dangling in space trying to fix crap , plus this one has alot of heart. If you are into good film-making (especially Nolan's past works), astronomy/Universe/time and space, progressive quantum physics type of stuff/veering towards 'spiritual', you have no excuse not to see this film (however I would highly expect a film like this is way better on the big screen). If u have grown to appreciate Matthew Mcconaughey much more since his stellar role in Dallas Buyers Club and the show True Detective, I highly recommend Interstellar. It could have been shorter, and Matt Damon may have intentionally been cast (in this particular role) to prove a point that we are going to have to deal with all sorts of personalities if we want to evolve or achieve 'peace'.

            "content": "I am actually really surprised by some of the ratings on this movie on here, many of which state that the movie was \"inconsistent\" or contained many plot holes.  Perhaps these people simply did not pay much attention to detail, or perhaps they were simply unable to piece the clues together, but every last detail of the story builds on the previous, resulting in a remarkable end.  The movie itself does not blatantly come out and state each, individual point, but if one is remotely decent at putting together both tangible and philosophical clues, then the story as a whole will make complete sense.  Even the ending of the movie was explained in full by precious clues in the movie.\n\nSPOILER ALERT-\nFor example, many people do not understand the scene with Brand at the end of the movie, where she is shown to have landed on a desolate planet.  Earlier in the black-hole scene, Cooper explained that they were going to use Gargantua to propel the ship around the black hole (sacrificing Cooper in the process), but Cooper realized that there was not enough fuel for Brand to make the journey back through the wormhole and towards Earth, so they directed themselves to the third, unexplored planet in the solar system (the same planet her lover was on).  Once there, Brand assumed her lover to be dead, but later on she found his settlement and was able to determine that the planet's conditions were similar to those of Earth (enough to take her helmet off).  She additionally realized the settlement meant that her lover was alive.  There was also an additional complaint:  Brand's age.  Many wondered why Brand appeared so young, where characters such as Murph had aged well beyond their initial age of around 40ish.  The movie also explained this:  As seen by the water planet, being near Gargantua caused a massive spike in gravitational time dilation, meaning that nearing the presence of Gargantua would increase their velocity through space, resulting in a decreased experience in time.  Since both Brand and Cooper fell into the black hole near the end of the movie (and then Cooper's experience halted by the new dimension), they would have both experienced nearly the same degree of aging as each other.  \n\nHonestly, I cannot stand it when people claim that the movie is \"full of holes\".  If anything, their ability to concentrate or analyze the clues given is what is \"full of holes\".  There are plenty of other examples of information which builds up on previous clues, but those were two of the more major ones.",

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO DIE HERE.\nLet's travel to a parallel world in the new film Star Trek I mean Interstellar. But seriously what's the damn difference,this movie is about space exploration for an inhabitable world and Star Trek is just still space exploration.\nThe film is about a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.\nI honestly could not tell you if this film achieved it's goal or not because I'm not sure if it's trying to be fun or just something else. It tries to be a serious exciting adventure into space so I am going to go with it trying to be fun,but in which case it isn't. I was so bored during this movie. The film is way too long they could have finished it sooner but decide not too and it just makes that much harder to sit through.\nThe story is not that interesting,with it's theme being about you know take care of the earth which we've seen to death in some better movies. The film is getting massive talks for reasons I don't know but I'm going to go with the venturing through space and it's awesome CGI which a film does not make.\nThe performances from the film are solid even from actors who I don't find too be great but just ok(Topher Grace). The standouts however are Michael Caine,Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway.They were my favorite part of the movie as for everything else,I just found to be boring.\nThe direction from Christopher Nolan this time around is not all that great,he gets good performances out of his actors ok but he always does. The problem was the shots and worst of all I saw lens flares,is he turning into J.J Abrhams.\nThe only worthwhile point from the movie is what I had just mentioned earlier,it's about taking care of our planet,but like I've said we have better films then this for that.\nThe movie is also way too long,i did find a problem with it's pacing everything feels slow. I believe it's because Nolan wants us to take in everything were seeing on screen.\nThe elements of a good film are not here much,it has great Cgi and some good acting but that's about it. I didn't care for the characters and I wasn't invested in anything that was going on, I'm giving Interstellar a two out of five.",

I do see it's flaws, and after re-watching it recently for the 6th time, I can see how many of the characters aren't as fleshed out as they should have been, I can see how some dialogue was poorly acted or written, and I can see how many people could find issue in the films central questions of gravity, love, and 5th dimensions. Personally though, these don't bother me so much as the beautiful abyss that is space, the questions surrounding gravity, time, black holes, worm holes, and other things pertaining to the universe fascinate me so much that I am happy a film attempted to explore it in such a way.

When we do know we are headed for uncertain futures while other futures we know we are headed when it's what the world depends on. When we know how to drive machine and technology, when they are meant to guide and help us. When we don't know but know why somethings that we ought to know we shouldn't know and have technology remind us that too much knowledge is unsuitable for humans to handle in harsh environments where only peace and not chaos is needed to steer smoothly. When we know we are right for some missions when we can steer Machine and nature to the right direction. When we don't know what some signs might bring or who sent them to be chosen to read them correctly. When we do know some signs move in a positive direction when we don't need other things in times of great turmoil.

When all we know life created everything on Earth for life to live. When we know life tries to speak to us and head us on a journey further then no man has ever travelled before. When we know where we must go when we font know who created such places for us to travel. When we do know life finds away to only want our existence to continue further and travel. When we know others have tried to head to there location. When we know time is of the essence to only go deeper and not know how much time we are taking off others clock and our own when others depend on us. When we know what we must do when some tickets are one way and only need to complete a job. When we know life finds away to only resort to doing it the artifical way when time runs out. When know being far away from too long is scary and wrong to only wish to go back home to place we only wish to be. When we know there really isn't much hope and enough we could do to sustain life when life takes along time to evolve and grow that we can't rush it. When we do know we land in a place created by our own people but don't know how when we can't see the possibilities of the future to create such things that are impossible. When we know that our journey here was to bring us to the point of no return so we could change that when we send others what they need to know to give us our ticket back home. When we know advancement and progress only propels us in what we don't know to know and move faster. When once we know we have goals to know we have a 2nd chance to build to. When we know time doesn't stand still and is always moving to keep building onto the future we know we have around and within us to do. When we know we can't sit back and not be prepared to create plans that work. When we think we have seen everything we ought to know exists that we can control to think differently when there are still untapped resources out there we should be using to propel us into the future. When we know how some ends happen, but what happens after we don't know. When not knowing the beyond we need to continue exploring and find away, for it may hold & unearth keys/tools we need to start using. \n\nWhen we don't know how much time we have or whether some plan would work but we do know that we need to start planning on creating a loop that we have plenty of chances until we are successful. When we know that some travels are far that we need to have plans for all outcomes, whether it's longer stays, autonomous hands, replenishing resources, hubs to stay, and much more that takes time in which we don't have.\n\nWhen we don't know what sacrifice would be to us when our hearts and intentions steer us to a result we never could for see. When we don't  know what solo missions we go on will reveal to us. When we do know that life finds away to survive, when time was we know it and don't know it can reveal a safe return or new destination where we left off. When we know that it takes time to build a better future we yet don't know exists, we can at least pave way a path for those who can make it happen. When all we know is the world we rather be in are ones who we share the same environments with to go back for them. \n\n***************************************************************************\nWhen we have to base everything we see with facts in order to base a conclusion.

For me, as a result, it not only winds up one of my favourite movies of all time, but it also far-surpasses virtually every other film under Nolan's expert hand as it succeeds in a slightly richer and emotional way than many of his other films which helps to build unprecedented emotional engagement in the story - and consequently the ideas.\nIn fact, never does one find themselves out of the all-consuming experience throughout Interstellar's lengthy run-time, as well-built and beautifully-portrayed characters hook you into the world extremely well and not only take you on the thematic and spectacle-driven journey you expect, but also on a surprisingly gut-punching emotional one that constantly brings tears of awe, elation, angst and sadness to the eye. Couple that with the the sheer wonder you feel as Nolan delivers his most impressive and immersive visual experience of all, and as Hans Zimmer composes his most incredible score yet; you've got yourself a film that leaves you truly speechless and genuinely shook for days on end.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: If you allow yourself to distance from the emotion and amazement even for a second, you'll realise the physical concepts and ideas, and perhaps even the overall narrative, are slightly over-ambitious.\nVERDICT: Nolan delivers his most ambitious and shockingly heart-felt movie of all, and the result is definitely one of his best, and perhaps one of the best cinema has seen in a long time.",

What's so incredible about this notion is each movie evokes tears for different reasons. Interstellar made me cry because I love my dad. What Nolan does so well in this picture is intertwine his multi-layered story telling with the central idea that family is key. \n\nI've seen this movie 7 times and still don't fully understand the twist ending; and that's delighting. Any time you can think, ponder, puzzle over the meaning of a story then that's a story well told. Is the story told without flaw? No. Sometimes Anne Hathaway says some cheeseball lines about love, but she delivers the fluff in an acceptable way in the universe of the story. \n\nI wish Interstellar could have another go in theaters. I've never walked out of a movie and said \"Yes! That was totally worth an overpriced ticket with popcorn marked up 500%!\" But this one was worth it. Interstellar was a visceral experience. It was fully satisfying. Also Hans Zimmer rules!\n\nJD",

The exploration into science in space and all its possibilities, so as the meditation on our own self, humans, the NASA, selfish individuals ruining the civilization. Generally, the scope is huge as it sometimes addresses humanity as a whole, thought provoking and resonant. If everyone on earth is dead yet embryos are retained and brought to another planet light years away to live, are they still homo sapiens? Is it really a continuation of species, after all the civilization is gone? Is that really necessary to do so?\n\nInception is better. The intellectual concept about dreaming is much more palpable for audiences, and its cast is star-studded. Still, Interstellar is a scintillating showcase of one of the most complex brains in the film industry. As long as Nolan keeps on making films,  keeps on delivering the thrills, there will always be that group of audience in the theaters who believe that blockbuster sare not always dumb.",

            "content": "For fourteen years now Christopher Nolan has achieved a near unstoppable success in film, rising to become one of the best directors in the business. Having concluded The Dark Knight Trilogy in 2012, the renowned director has now turned his sights to the realm of science fiction and the result is what can easily be the considered one of the best if not the best film of the year.\n\nInterstellar takes place in the future where the Earth has almost run out of food; dust storms ravage what was once a healthy world and society has devolved into an endless line of struggling farmers. Facing the possibility of extinction, a team of NASA scientists led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) commissions a team to travel through a wormhole in a bid to find another planet for habitation. The crew is comprised of several scientists and leading man Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who reluctantly agrees to leave his family behind to serve as the ship's pilot for the mission. In a similar way to 2001: A Space Odyssey before it, Interstellar is split into several defined acts (minus the text that introduces them). The film begins on Earth where we're introduced to the characters and the setting they live, which is conveyed brilliantly through the emotional bond between Cooper and his young daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) and from there, the film cuts between outer space and the characters back on Earth as they attempt to unravel theories which will assist in saving the human race. What makes it all work is the build-up that occurs in both the character's emotions and the inevitable countdown to save humanity; as things grow more and more desperate and out of control, you'll find yourself believing in the characters to succeed. The film, like many of Nolan's previous works mixes in several themes and ideas, most notably human nature and the concept of love being something which transcends time and space. With this in mind, the film builds an emotional resonance that not only matches Nolan's previous work, but leaps beyond the norm for science-fiction. The plot's one misstep is a poignant moment towards the end of the film, which may stick out as rather confusing for some. But does this damage the narrative in a major way? Not so much for me personally; when every other aspect of the film is so engaging, so immaculately produced, it's easy to overlook these small flaws.\n \nWhile NASA sends a group of people to the beyond, the film's central focus never deviates from Cooper, who is characterised with a simple yet strong purpose; an immensely emotive connection to his family. When he looks and weeps over several transmitted messages from his family, you can feel the weight of the burden that is placed on him. McConaughey's heartfelt performance is matched by Foy's (and later Jessica Chastain's) where we see an equal amount of pressure and desperation built up. The other characters, most notably Anne Hathaway as biologist Amelia Brand and the aforementioned Michael Caine are also on hand to give plentiful amounts of reinforcement to the film's central themes. Even the actors who receive smaller roles such as Matt Damon and Wes Bentley are intriguing in the ways they contribute to the film's scientific undertones, further engaging the audience in the journey. By possessing a small circle of characters, Interstellar never becomes too uneven, allowing the plot and special effects to sit on a relatively consistent level.\n\n2001 was one of the first science fiction films to dazzle audiences with its spell-binding imagery and if Interstellar's effects achieve anything, they represent just how far we've come in animation. The visuals and settings of Nolan's latest epic are absolutely stunning, and perfectly draw the audience into the journey beyond the stars. From the gorgeous celestial backdrops to the planets explored by the team, every location feels vast and expansive and on top of it all, the production crew even brought in theoretical physicict Kip Thorne, making many of the film's portrayals of space travel feel much more grounded in reality. The sound, typical of many Nolan films, is loud and booming; despite the few times it gets in the way of dialogue, you really do feel the roar of the spaceship and the weather effects on each planet. There's also a heavy use of organs during the more intense scenes which greatly heightens the urgency of the character's struggles. Suffice it to say that when it all comes together, in terms of technical presentation, Interstellar could well be the most beautiful science fiction film of modern times.\n\nInterstellar is quite simply a modern movie masterpiece; I haven't been so captivated by a film since 2005's King Kong. It was never going to be as ground-breaking as something like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it doesn't need to be; this is the one film this year that will utterly blow you away and leave you awe-struck and astounded from beginning to end.",

            "content": "Though imperfect, Christopher Nolan's space epic is a must-see spectacle.\n\nOver the years, moviegoers have had their minds pleasantly twisted by Christopher Nolan with films such as \"Inception\" (2010), \"The Prestige\" (2006), and \"Memento\" (2000). We have also been taken on all manner of celestial journeys, from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) to \"Gravity\" (2013) to the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\n\nThis year, we are treated to \"Interstellar,\" in which Nolan combines the wonders of space travel with the type of thought-provoking premise that is his hallmark. \n\nSet on an Earth which is rapidly and irrevocably running out of resources, the film follows Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an ex-pilot who is enlisted by NASA to take the controls of the Endurance spacecraft. The goal of the mission, to be carried out by Cooper and three scientists (one of whom is Dr. Amelia Brand, played by Anne Hathaway), is to enter a wormhole to another galaxy in the hopes of finding a habitable planet to save the human race.\n\nThe premise is compelling, and the screenplay (co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan) does it justice for the most part. Some portions of the dialogue come off a bit clunky; this is especially true when characters are exhibiting sentimentality, which has never been one of Nolan's strong suits, but Nolan does do a great job of characterizing the relationship between Cooper and his family. Characters also have the tendency to blurt out unprompted explanations of scientific theories and phenomena, but this is more understandable considering the hefty subjects the film addresses.\n\nThe movie doesn't become an undeniably Nolan-esque film until about a third of the way through, and the shift in tone is a bit of a jolt. However, this spike in intensity ultimately becomes welcome as it makes the viewer mostly unaware of the well-paced film's 168-minute running time.\n\nWhat works consistently in favor of \"Interstellar\" is the acting. McConaughey continues to impress after his success in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" (2013), Hathaway deftly portrays the brainy Dr. Brand, and the two are rounded out by the likes of Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Wes Bentley, and Matt Damon.\n\nThe main constant issue I have with this film is the sound mixing. Sound mixing has to do with balancing the respective volumes of the dialogue, the effects, and the score, and the film often misses the mark in this regard. Important chunks of dialogue are sometimes obscured - or drowned out entirely - by the louder parts of Hans Zimmer's score (which, by the way, is excellent). The sound effects themselves are impressive, but it'd be preferable if they were toned down just a bit to allow the characters' lines to make it through.\n\nContrarily, the visuals are nothing short of spectacular. I find it increasingly difficult to be impressed visually at the movie theater anymore, but \"Interstellar\" blew me away. Viewers are treated to the picture-warping experience of a wormhole, the untapped wonder of new planets, and even the haunting beauty of a dying Earth. Each of these is expertly shot, and it's all topped off by seamlessly executed effects. This is a film that requires being seen in a theater if at all possible.\n\nThen, of course, there's the science. Nolan did his homework with \"Interstellar,\" enlisting the help of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne to ensure that every piece of science fiction is rooted in science fact. Thorne explains in \"Building a Black Hole,\" a behind-the-scenes featurette, that \"Neither wormholes nor black holes have been depicted in any Hollywood movie in the way that they actually would appear\" - until now, that is.\n\nThe movie delves into advanced theories of relativity, extra dimensions, and gravity in ways never seen before. Though some of the material will naturally go over many viewers' heads (myself included in some places), the film is ultimately able to explain enough of the science such that viewers can join Nolan in wondering at the possibilities presented on the screen. \n\nWith \"Interstellar,\" Nolan provides viewers with both a feature-length sci-fi extravaganza and, following that, plenty of room for discussion. After all, a large portion of what makes this movie so entertaining is the piecing together of the puzzle that inevitably occurs afterwards. Overall, \"Interstellar,\" though not free of flaws, is a cinematic experience that simply cannot be missed.\n\nLike my reviews? Have a disagreement?

The acting is spot on, the visuals and craftsmanship are phenomenal, and even the story and themes are well fleshed out. A special shout-out should go to Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain. There's this heartwarming but also tragic feeling that seeps through their relationship. One that makes you feel the weight of each passing second and their continuously growing rift as a result. Despite not sharing any direct screen time together, you fully believe they are father and daughter. Unfortunately, it's in the last third where this film starts to fall apart. Everything that was built up so well crumbles beneath its own weight. The story becomes too over the top, the acting suffers greatly, and the philosophical themes seem to be stretched beyond the film's own comprehension. A polished rewrite would've definitely helped. However, if there's one thing that works wonderfully all the way through, it's the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has absolutely outdone himself again with such an enchanting but haunting bit of music. While far from perfect, Interstellar deserves at least one viewing, if nothing else, for its sheer spectacle alone. If you have a free afternoon or evening, check it out.",

Die Musik ballert nur so, auf dass in jeder Szene maximale Aufregung herrscht. Die einzelnen Charaktere posieren eitel vor uns und d\u00fcrfen allerlei philosphisches Geschwurbel von sich geben.

            "content": "I want to talk about how well-made Interstellar is.\n\nI want to talk about Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography in director Christopher Nolan's ambitious, awe-inspiring film; it's remarkable. Stepping in for regular Nolan contributor Wally Pfister, Van Hoytema establishes an old-fashioned aesthetic full of shots of a decaying Earth and a quietly wonderous beyond.\n\nI want to talk about Lee Smith, Nolan's regular editor. He turns this three-hour space-set drama into one of the most brisk and thrilling filmgoing experiences of the year. And while the film as a whole, as ambitious as it is, feels rather conventional, Smith zigs when other editors might zag, meaning we get extended passages that are heavy on dialogue and mood-setting as well as one of the most breakneck extended climaxes in recent movie history.\n\nI want to talk about Hans Zimmer-top composer du jour, another Nolan regular-whose organ-filled score carries the majesty of the subject at hand. It's classic Zimmer, meaning some will find it overbearing and too loud, but its weight is welcome in both dramatic and action-packed moments.\n\nI want to talk about the film's controversial sound mix. Yes, occasional passages of dialogue are tough to make out, but no more so than any other action film. More notable are the moments during which Smith's editing makes exhilarating use out of space's silence (something Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, interestingly enough, didn't really do).\n\nWhy lead with this? Because this film is damn divisive, and I totally get why. But the obvious technical expertise at play in Interstellar feels like something we can all agree upon. Right? RIGHT??\n\nThe fact is no one can agree about Interstellar, and that's fine. The film is a little like Darren Aronofsky's Noah from earlier this year insofar as its flaws are masked by grand ideas and an innate ability to burrow into your brain. Both also are tremendous conversation-starting movies, and both are among my favorite films of 2014.\n\nThe film opens in the American Midwest circa 2050. Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a widower, father, and NASA pilot who turns to farming after a blight begins destroying the world's food supply. It's bleak (and really dusty), but most of the world doesn't know quite how bad things are about to get. Cooper is perhaps cosmically guided toward a small group of NASA scientists working underground to send a team into space. Their goal: find a new home for humanity because Earth is rapidly becoming truly uninhabitable. In other words, if Cooper and company don't succeed, we're finished.\n\nThe space-bound team is made up of Cooper, Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and the robot TARS (voice of Bill Irwin). Meanwhile, the elder Dr. Brand (Michael Caine, playing Hathaway's father and McConaughey's mentor) is trying to unlock an equation that will make mass space transport possible for those remaining behind on Earth-including Cooper's distraught daughter, Murph (Mackenzie Foy), who grows up to become a student of Dr. Brand herself (played in adulthood by Jessica Chastain). Should Brand, Murph, and company fail to solve this equation, Plan B states that Cooper and his team colonize the most habitable planet they encounter on the other side of a mysterious wormhole that's opened up near Saturn.\n\nThe plot isn't complicated, but it's dense and tough to talk about in too much detail without getting into perceived spoiler territory. What I will say is that it's heart is intensely focused on the micro despite all the macro stuff on the surface. Wormholes, relativity, fifth dimensions-the film's ideas are HUGE. And it physically manifests its largeness in the form of deep space's geography (those waves!) and something literally called Gargantua. But ultimately, Nolan never lets us stray too far from what's clearly driving him this time around-love, relationships, human connection, and the things we as people can do together. His insistance on hitting those notes aggressively has been/will be a sticking point for some. They certainly lead to some talky, sentimental passages, but I was excited seeing McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, and the rest of this fantastic cast of actors get to show off some dramatic chops in a Nolan science-fiction movie. It isn't something you'd expect to work, but my does it. McConaughey in particular gives a sensational performance, and Foy steals every scene she's in.\n\nI talked up the craft already, but it bears repeating: this movie is just gorgeous. What I'll take away most, however, isn't the acting or the images. It's not the story, the music, or any single scene. I cherish Interstellar, instead, because of how much I've wanted to talk about it. It's not often that such a bold, challenging, frustrating, lovely, fun film comes along, and when it does, I want to tell people to see it. I want to recommend it-all three hours-to everyone I know, so we can talk about it. From the Dust Bowl to Saturn to \"beyond the infinite,\" this film doesn't contain a single scene unworthy of intelligent conversation, which is so much more than can be said about 95% of films in general, nevermind major studio fare.\n\nSo you can nitpick about the exposition or the sound mix or a certain controversional cameo if you must; I won't even argue with you. I just want to talk about Interstellar.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/interstellar-review/",

I do not believe the crew would have survived docking on that wrecked ship. This is complete hogwash.  I could suspend my disbelief up to the meeting with Damon on the planet. Post this the film is grasping at straws and laughable.  The film Martian explains science well with a zero dramatic effect. This also murders a plot in the science fiction genre.  This kind of film has to be balanced very carefully. I believe KubricK does this well for 2001 back before the mobile, CGI age.  The wormhole scenes are amazing and I enjoyed the CGI immensely  however a lot more believability has to be there for this genre of film. This is not a comic book, Stan Lee-inspired movie. It becomes a pathetic leap of faith if you bring the imagination to the completely comical in a serious film with serious issues for the future of this planet. We live in a world where the single humanist will use every last drop of fossil fuel or clean water to live in houses made for 15 families and a private jet to fly the world as he or she pleases. I refer to the bahaviour of a supposed ecologist Leo Dicaprio. I enjoy his acting but the celebrity elite has to live by EXAMPLE. We are crushing our world right now in not SHARING and being LOGICAL in our wants. The city I live in has empty mansions that use water and hydro and are useless empty buildings sitting there for investors. Is this logical? Will this be good for our future? The billionaire biosphere will be a very lonely, devastated world people. All we have to do is view the character of Damon in this film or in Martian. You are creating a very lonely, deadly world for those to come. We have to OPEN OUR EYES. Did the Buddha not tell us to WAKE UP? Did Christ not raise the issue of sharing on the Sermon on the Mount?  We should use this film as a warning story but how do you do this when the science falls apart. Moreover, the Twilight Zone-like book shelves and phantoms lost me completely. The \"tipping point\" is already here. We do not have time for nonsense. Let us all do our part even the humanist has to be appalled by the current ecology in our world.  This could have been an excellent film but it was only satisfactory. I gave it three stars for the effort.",

It also takes heavy inspiration from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and this ultimately hurts the film in the last 15 minutes or so. For much of the near 3 hour run time, Interstellar remains fairly grounded within reality, but near the end it tries to bite off more than it can chew and goes into places beyond what it is really capable of. It is however a great achievement for Christopher Nolan that something as incredible as Interstellar doesn't even make the top 5 of his films. Most directors can only dream of making 1 film as good as Interstellar over their entire careers. Nolan not only made Interstellar, but has made at least 5 other films which are better than it. Truly he is one of this generations greatest filmmakers",

            "content": "So many problems. Where do I begin. First, the movie is nearly three hours long. Hour and a half in I couldn't believe I had more than an hour to go. Painful. Not that the movie doesn't have its merits, but they are few by comparison. OK, let's get into it.\n\nHere's a film that is highly self-conscious often going to great extremes to be intelligent. But there are simple questions within said complexity that can be addressed as well. For example, it's 2067, and it's not world war or aliens or global warming that's going to do us in but crop blight. You'd think that by 2067 there'd be a way to kill pathogenic organisms. I could understand a comet hitting the earth, even global warming or world war, but blight? I'm not buying it. \n\nThen there's these alleged aliens who are helping the scientists find a solution to the blight / end of the world problem, so they've provided a wormhole to a possible alternative world, but there's a problem. First, no one's coming back (or so Dr. Brand tells us) so plan B, 5,000 embryos to perpetuate the human race, is the only option. To enable this part of the plot to work (see, this is what sci-fi writers have to do, find technical excuses, but if there are too many explanations it becomes a story full of complex conversations and little else), we are told that the ocean world where the crew has landed is close to the black hole so time has become severly dilated: for each hour there seven years on earth pass. Once you hear this you just know the crew will not be able to get anything done in an hour or so. No, by the time they leave decades have passed. \n\nMeanwhile, back on earth, Murphy believes that the problem can be solved by getting more data on gravitational singularity (fyi, might be a good idea to read Brief History of Time before watching the movie; otherwise, you'll be as lost as Cooper's crew). Now the big mind meld: Cooper realizes that as Endurance attempts its escape from Edumund's planet that the black hole is pulling the ship into it. To provide a sling shot, Cooper jettisons him and TARS towards the black hole. They become entrapped in a tesseract, a four dimensional analog of the cube (see, now you wish you had paid attention during those math and science classes) that is made of book shelves. So where did this come from? Well, the smart extraterrestrials, of course. They set it up so that Cooper can send data to Murphy to solve the gravitational problem. But exactly who are these aliens? We never find out. So it's here where we find that the \"ghost\" in Murphy's room at the beginning of the movie was actually her dad. Here you'll have to understand that time is not linear that it folds in on itself and future, present, and past are all the same thing. See what I mean about those science and math courses?  \n\nOK, eventually, by sending morris code via a wristwatch (yeah, you see what I'm taking about. I'm getting a headache too) Cooper sends Murphy enough data to solve the gravitational problem. The earth is saved. Cooper is ejected back into normal space, arrives on a space habitat orbiting Saturn where the humans have collected to survive. He visits a very old, heroic Murphy on her death bed who tells Cooper after some time that she wants to be with her children, who have gathered about her, who then ignore their granddad as he leaves the room like some janitor who came in just to empty the waste baskets. \n\nWith problems large and small, Interstellar is not what it's purported to be, or what many are saying in the positive. It is way too complicated, too long, and the payoff? Well, guess what? The answer is love. At the end, at Murphy's behest, Cooper leaves to find Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway) who's stuck out in space to feel the love all are looking for. Did we need all that complexity to discover this? You get my point, I hope.",

Let's first take a look at--\n\nWhat Interstellar Does Well:\nThe visuals are astounding. I may have only watched it on my dinky iPhone 6 screen, but the set pieces and settings are at once tangible and sublime. It all feels real in a way that calls attention to the insignificance of life on Earth, Carl Sagan's sentiment made staggeringly real. It also tries to say something profound about humans existing and transcending the vastness of space time through emotion, but that's where we get to--\n\nWhat Interstellar Doesn't Do Well:\nFor a movie that goes to painstaking length to bring physics theory to life, it falls back on a limp story. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph attempts to ground the theme of \"love conquers all,\" but it gets in the way more often than it sells the connection between these characters. It also throws science fiction ex machinas into the plot to patch up any loose or undeveloped ends whenever it paints itself into a wall (finding the solution to \"gravity\" being the biggest eye-roller of the bunch).\n\nAnd as much as Christopher Nolan can direct the heck out of an event movie, he gives his audience exactly zero credit to think on their own. Everything is explained in pedantic detail often to the point that it mutes what should be emotional scenes (we don't need TARS to explain the \"library\" to us. It's better if there's some mystery left to it). He clearly tries to ape the epic scale of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" here, but part of the beauty of Kubrick's films is that he never went out of his way to explain anything. There isn't a word of dialogue in the final twenty minutes of that movie. Nolan should have taken note.\n\nIs \"Interstellar\" worth a watch? Undoubtedly. But it's more a microcosm of Nolan's weaknesses as a writer-director, than a showcase of his strengths. 4.9/10",

This time I think Nolan's apparently boundless imagination is too great for his own good, and the concept becomes too unrestrained, to the point where it cannot be well-executed. At times, it seems like Nolan has just learned about all of these cool concepts of astronomy and theoretical physics, got really excited, and just decided to jam them all into this movie, while also beating some of them over our heads. The casting decisions for the lead roles are also questionable, and I actually think this winds up being Nolan's messiest and least cerebral movie.",

Who picked up this space adventure his brother Jonathan Nolan was writing in 2007 for Steven Spielberg to direct. However, Nolan makes it his own, and despite the absolutely stunning visuals on display, it's a very grounded human story. Set in a near future where Earth is facing an agricultural crisis, where crops are dying and the earth faces massive dust storms. NASA\u00c2\u00a0physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine) comes up with a plan to move Earth's population to another planet in another solar system, using wormholes in space to get there. Brand asks ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to pilot a spacecraft with Brand's biologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway\u00c2\u00a0to a potentially habitable planet in another solar system. This means Cooper has to leave his 10 year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) and 15 year old son Tom (Timoth\u00c3\u00a9e Chalamet), a tough decision to make. It's a film of two halves, the struggle for survival on earth, and then the struggle for survival in space. There's some brilliant set pieces in the film, including the potential planets discovered. The science may leave your heads aching with the information, but it's a visually stunning film, with a brilliant ensemble cast to boot and some amazing visual effects.\u00c2\u00a0",

Boyhood stands a good chance as well, but what it lacked was the objective emotional point for the audience to live inside the world of the film and watch time go by. the 2nd act of this film is SO BRUTAL, so delightfully hard to sit through and see the pain in the characters' faces. this film reaches far into character depth on a small level within relationships, but SO FAR in terms of scope, design, and exploration of string theory - and does the last visually in a way that's actually comprehendable (to a point). if you're not seeing this film in IMAX, you're missing out on the 2001: A Space Odyssey of this generation. I believe this film will age SO WELL; it'll be the space film, spiritual sequel to 2001 and you'd be foolish to pass it up in theaters.",

Much of the dialogue varies between the bland and bizarrely timed pseudo meaningful speeches. Nolan's direction doesn't come to the rescue either as it works more on artistic presentation than good story telling. What is really shocking is that, in a film with a name such as this, the presentation somehow completely fails to give any sense of distance to the journey, partly aided by poor pacing . The action also has some bizarre turns where you don't really know what's going on until after it's done (see the planet with all the water scene). Therefore, most of this film rolls back on waiting for people to simply say what is going on as it's otherwise not being conveyed. So yes, this is a big incomprehensible and underwhelming mess with an ending that tries to cleverly exposition it's way out of just being a cliche'd let down. I would only recommend it on the basis of it's intrigue and atmosphere in the first half before it starts to fall apart, but fall apart it does.",

The relationship between McConaughey's character and his daughter is very good and tugs at your heart strings a little.  There are 2 main reasons I did not give it a 5 stars.  1, you kinda figure there is a good chance they will find an earth replacement. 2, something happens that, to me, does not make sense.

What makes the film special for a sci-fi work is that he doesn't have to show any monster--nothing is truly more scary than humanity itself. This is a work that can combine an excellent explanation of the theory of relativity yet still show that the only things that truly matter are the relationships we develop in our everyday lives. My favourite film of all-time is still one of the most ambitious, '2001: A Space Odyssey', but it's very comforting to me that six generations after the birth of cinema, and the Faberge eggs of genius that have come along the way, from Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' 'A Trip to the Moon' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', that outstanding works of science fiction, such as 'Gravity', 'Ex Machina' and this fine film by Nolan, are still being made.

            "content": "There's no doubting Christopher Nolan's passion for the craft of filmmaking and his desire to entertain his audience. I wholly admire his ambition to go beyond the conventional; to realise his own very distinct vision. The worlds of his films are often so seductive that their shortcomings are largely forgivable. But with Interstellar what's become apparent is that he's not actually a great storyteller.\n\nSet in the not too distant future when the earth is doomed and the only crop that will grow is corn, Interstellar is the story of Coop (Matthew McConaughey) a former space test pilot who, along with his daughter (Mackenzie Foy and later played by Jessica Chastain), discovers that NASA, led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), has set up shop down the road from their farm and just happens to be in need of a skilled pilot to man a mission to a distant galaxy in search of a viable planet for human habitation.\n\nWhen Coop takes off on his intergalactic adventure with his crew (Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley and David Gyasi) so too does the narrative finally find momentum and Nolan is clearly in his comfort zone. There are some truly riveting sequences, superb effects and stunning visuals that lull you into a false sense of security.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you don't follow all the quick-fire chatter about quantum mechanics or that there are significant logic holes, you are taken on a thrilling ride that for a while feels masterful, even groundbreaking. But then Nolan and his co-writing brother Jonathan delve deeper into thematic exploration at the expense of plot momentum and find themselves in territory where they're far less comfortable.\n\nAgain, Nolan is to be applauded for wishing to deliver something more cerebral than a mere popcorn science-fiction thriller but abandoning a satisfying plot-driven climax and resolution for a conclusion overblown with soppy connotations about the power of love just doesn't cut it. And as the mysteries of Nolan's world are unpacked it slides into some sort of M. Night Shyamalan film that feels manipulative, hollow and silly rather than clever and affecting.\n\nThere's plenty of emotion in Interstellar but it doesn't extend beyond the screen. Every lead actor has their turn at blubbering but I wasn't moved enough to shed a tear. In fact, as the film progressed I found it increasingly annoying. The unconventional sound mix doesn't help. Lines of dialogue are totally swamped by Hans Zimmer's overbearing organ soundtrack. And while I understand Nolan's aim to express the emotional intent of a scene not merely through dialogue but through every sound/image tool available to him, his intentions don't always translate effectively.\n\nMatthew McConaughey also grated on me. It seems the higher his star has risen the more stylised his drawl has become. I laughed out loud on more than one occasion at his too-cool-for-school delivery and it didn't help that Nolan didn't pull him (and every other actor) back on the crying. When Anne Hathaway delivers the film's most profound sentiments about love, she does so with such teary, doe-eyed flagrancy that their impact is muted.\n\nThere's enough spectacle, tension and ideas in this film for you to feel like you get your money's worth. Nonetheless, as you exit the cinema after 167 minutes there is a distinct gnawing of dissatisfaction and by the next day it's already started to slip too easily from your mind. For a film of this magnitude and supposed profundity I'd say that's mission not accomplished.",

While I do like many of Nolan's films, I don't consider myself a Nolan fanboy (or a fanboy of any directors) and I judge a film solely on its merits. \n\nFor the most part, Interstellar is an exciting and interesting film with big ideas and bigger set pieces. Parts of the film do remind me of other (great) films like Gravity, Sunshine, Prometheus, and especially 2001: A Space Odyssey. But unlike 2001 (a movie I personally still don't understand), Interstellar is pretty straightforward about its science. \n\nBut it's not without its faults: There are several illogical moments (why was the military disbanded? How are there no food riots? Shouldn't the world be more like Mad Max?) that could have been explored a bit better while trimming a bit from its three-hour runtime. A third-act revelation that is fascinating is also confounded with more questions (Is love really a scientific phenomenon?) and the final few minutes of the movie really make no sense and even question much of the movie (Perhaps an attempt to be like Inception?). There's also a great score that I heard would overcome the dialogue, but it wasn't as big a problem as I expected, because it wasn't dialogue integral to the plot of the film so much as just parts of the scene that could still hear, but low. And the cast - save for Matthew McConaughey, who was exceptional - was just okay.\n\ninterstellar is a slow-burn of a film that could have been trimmed down a lot and still make sense, but considering I had low expectations, I think I could be able to watch this film again and enjoy the ideas and theories explored.",

            "content": "Interstellar was a bit complicated and lengthy, but I enjoyed it. Some of the science was flawed, while some of it was reasonably realistic. Ultimately, it was an entertaining story, inspiring about the amazing possibilities awaiting humanity on the far frontiers of outer space.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the movie was the depiction of several potentially habitable planets. These alien worlds were brought to life in a believable and visually stunning way. They really inspire thinking about the possibilities.\n\nI also enjoyed the human side of the story. Matthew McConaughey plays scientist turned farmer Cooper, who begins to realize his children's future is dimmer than he realized, and time is running out for planet Earth. He makes the great personal sacrifice of leaving his young children behind as he goes out into space on a dangerous mission to search for a habitable alternate world for humanity. His mission is a last ditch effort to find a solution for the long term survival of his children--and everyone else on Earth.\n\nHis heartbroken daughter Murph spends years waiting for him to come back, while growing up to become a scientist herself who works relentlessly toward the solution for humanity's survival. Ultimately, Murph is the one who succeeds in finding a solution to save humanity from extinction, while her father gets forgotten as the years go by. And yet, he is still out there trying to survive and get home to her. \n\nWhen he finally does return, against all odds, he finds Murph still alive but on her deathbed, surrounded by her children and grandchildren, while he himself is still young and unchanged from how she remembers him, because of weird quantum science in the storyline. He gets to say goodbye to her and make peace with what has happened. Then, he gets to go find his surviving astronaut partner Brand (played by Anne Hathaway) left behind on one of the planets and try to start over on an Eden world.\n\nInterstellar relied heavily on stretching the limits of science and creating some miracles, in order to make all the amazing things that took place happen. Nevertheless, it was a hopeful story with some hair-raising suspense, inspiring possibilities, interesting drama, several unexpectedly suspenseful action scenes, and a beautiful against-the-odds happy ending.",

For the past record all the movies blown me away and made Nolan in my favorite director's list. Knowing it's the first NOLAN movie i had watched in big screen and i am proud to share. I don't want to classify this movie under science fiction its more than that. It has emotions, love, adventure, mystery. Nolan took the best capable and needed casts for the movie, Mathew's emotional sequence, Anne Hathaway's journey for her love above horizon amazed me.\n\nDialogues are unforgettable apart from the story it makes us think of it even in our reality life. This the first movie i have watched 7 times (apart from theater 2 times).\n\nVisually this movie is a treat for fiction lovers, Nolan with the scientific consultant KIP THORNE gave life to the imaginations, especially for the Gargantua appearance and no more to say it already had its Oscar.\n\nMusic: Hans Zimmer played lovely music which is ultimately at its best for the movie in inch by inch scenes. Every sounds is perfectly connected with the movie in every way that carries you into the movie.\n\nFrom the beginning i am having suspicious thought of the ghost asking myself is it a ghost movie? Mystery??\n\nThe plot started due to the earth's changes that is unfit for the human to survive unnoticeable by most of them denoting us that our earth's life graph is started raging downwards in real time.\n\nAnd there are people still sacrificing their whole life for the world to be safe and sound for the survival of humanity. \n\nPresence of TARS and CASE with amusing chemistry between Mathew and Tars is lovable.\n\nI must say there are some visuals and sequences i am totally awe full for\n\n1. Into the wormhole sequence\n\n2. The endurance flight traveling appearance\n\n3. Visual of alien planets\n\n4. High waves because of Gargantua gravity\n\n5. Depiction of a black-hole\n\n6. Docking scene with Endurance\n\n7. Appearance of future multi dimensional cube inside the black hole\n\n8. And this scene when u came to know that the ghost is cooper and he is the one who sends the message co-ordinates and simultaneously in the earth Murphy deciphers that mystery and solves. NOLAN SHOWED his thing and i must say EVERY adjective words in the world and still out of words to describe this scene and in theater i screamed the hell out of me in my native language. Thanks to JONATHAN NOLAN for this Epic story and CHRISTOPHER NOLAN for giving life to the story. \n\nYES! the ending with the beginning of the FUTURE! leaving us to ask lots of questions to ourselves. IT'S the TOUCH of the CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. Don't care of anything Just feel the love that made everything happen in the movie, and don't care of the unknown, it's always good something to be unknown. PRAISE THE LOVE! of NOLAN's style. I must admit i had tears in my eyes!",

A Terra est\u00e1 cada vez mas inabit\u00e1vel, e a ra\u00e7a humana busca alternativas de sobreviv\u00eancia.

The underlying plot about the very real possibility that the characters may never see their families again is incredibly emotional. The NASA astronauts and the worlds they visit feel exceptionally real, creating one of the most believable space movies ever created.\n\nHowever, it also has some stellar problems. The plot can be very confusing at times, and missing one line of dialogue among pages of scientific jargon can lose the viewer. While the physics is all very nicely calculated and helps to build realism, it does make dialogue scenes drag on far too long.\n\nWhile the alien worlds are beautiful, the Earth scenes leave a lot to be desired. Although no exact date is mentioned, the story is implied to take place in a far, dystopian future when the world is suffering from deadly sandstorms and the US government is actively suppressing scientific knowledge. However, the world we see is the same world we see today. No effort has been made to make Earth seem futuristic. The houses are ordinary and the vehicles are straight off a used car lot. Even by the end of the movie, which is implied to be about 100 years later than we began, the space station interior still looks exactly like modern America. Did society just stop? Were there really no new products designed after 2014?\n\nOne thing we do see is automated tractors, which are just modern tractors with their cabins covered in a repeating metal pattern. In itself that is a very pointless design choice, as under full automation there would be no need for any cabin, but if the cabin exists for human operators, they simply won't be able to see out of it. There are also military robots such as TARS, which are articulated steel blocks with screens of code on them. Considering that they only perform calculations or tasks normally done by humans, they seem like a horribly impractical design.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I'm an industrial design student and part-time engineer, so this stuff bothers me more than it probably bothers most. Otherwise the movie is great, even if the pacing is very slow at times.",

While many say it's not technically accurate, I contend that since we don't yet know the inner workings of space-time travel, it very well could be. We don't know. Also it's a movie so maybe suspend some of your disbelief instead of looking for something to pick apart from your throne. The acting and cinematography are top-notch and overall this movie is definitely worth seeing. Also Hans Zimmer's score is amazing, yet again. He and Nolan agreed they needed to completely reinvent their approach after the Batman trilogy and they did. And it's excellent.",

This movie was a thrilling and intellectual space exploration adventure that does not shy away from difficult scientific theories as a fundamental part of the story.

And who wouldn't love to see so many famous actors piled into one movie?",

            "content": "I must admit that I am still digesting a single viewing of Interstellar. Given the depth of its ideas I will likely be digesting it for a while. \n\nIn a lot of ways Interstellar reminds me of the film \"Contact\", with its mix of science and spirituality and its interest in asking some big life questions. The difference between the two films though is that where Contact left us with unanswered questions (purposefully utilizing the faith/doubt tension), Nolan is interested in fleshing the questions out on a larger scale, both visually, ideologically and in the pace and length of the film itself. \n\nPerhaps there are better comparisons to \"2001\" when speaking of the sheer depth and scope that Nolan brings to this project. There is a similar trajectory to both films in this sense, and one could logically assume that there is some degree of influence at play here. And yet the two films take different approaches to the story itself, with Interstellar seemingly a bit more interested in bringing together it's grand and creative process in an accessible fashion (as a Hollywood film).\n\nEven further yet we catch some glimpses of \"Gravity\" in this film, primarily in the way the story brings together it's two main characters (Matthew M. And Anne Hathaway), and certainly in the way the onscreen chemistry develops accordingly. \n\nThe science of the film is about the nature of Quantum Physics and Blackholes and multiple dimensions. The earth (and the population) is dying off, and a quest has begun to save humanity by colonizing a new planet. The search of course is for a planet that could possibly be habitable for human kind, a search that has now become possible through new theories and technology (that includes long term deep sleep units) that enables a much more expansive journey across time and space. \n\nThe science is likely to be deemed pseudo-science (even being a reach at that in terms of plausibility for those who hold to a more hard and fast approach to science). But the nature of this sort of science is to allow for questions that other scientific processes might not be willing, interested or aware to ask. The film embraces this and uses it to give all kinds of wonderful layers and introspection to the story itself. At it's heart this is a very human story, even as it asks us to get lost in some of the difficult scientific premise. \n\nThe film is absolutely beautiful to watch in terms of its stark visuals, the intimate shots of space, and the the creative imagining of the planets. It uses the space motif to really amp up the thrill of space travel for the viewer, and as the film progresses it simply gets more intense. \n\nThe relationships are also very interesting to watch unfold. While the robot stands as an amazing technological feat (seamlessly integrated as a character), where the film carries forward is in the family dynamics of Cooper (Matthew M.), and the twists and turns that we find in the relationships of the crew. Here the film explores the human need to survive, the mystery of love as a motivator, the ties that bond us across time and space, the lies and surprises that make trusting such a volatile process. \n\nWhile Interstellar, as I mentioned above, is the kind of film that sticks with long after it is over, it proves equally rewarding in the moment. It is as much a thriller as it is a sci-fi drama. It is as much a \"sit on the edge of your seat\" experience as it is a patient (and overly patient for some I admit) character drama. It is lengthy, but I never found i dull. It is slow, but I never found it dragging. The one place where I felt unsure was in whether the film took its own ideas too far. The beauty of Contact was that it brought out the questions without feeling the need to answer them or tie up the movie. Interstellar is far from tidy and clear in it's own conclusions, but it certainly takes the time to play out it's own ideas far past our own questions. But this is a small criticism of a film which, in the end, I very much enjoyed.",

It plays/tests Einstein's theories and it dares to have the explorers travel through a wormhole (a shortcut in space) in order to find other worlds where life could exist.  This is necessary since there's a food shortage on Earth and this is why they are sent on this mission.  The idea of being close to a black hole is crazy.  In fact there's a part in the movie where one hour in that specific place/planet equates to seven years passing on Earth (due to the closeness to the black hole).  And as if that were not cool enough, McConaughey exits the wormhole into a tesseract (hypercube, like a cube in fourth dimensional space)...how cool is that?!\n     The connection Matthew McConaughey has with his daughter is great, just like the acting.  The last 15 minutes of the movie are sad but it makes sense after so much time has gone by on Earth.  The movie Gravity doesn't even come close to this one, I give it 9/10 or 4.5/5 GREAT!!!",

Matt Damon's appearance was a waste of time and opened up a loophole that one could drive a bus through. The script was clunky at times, explaining what a worm hole is as the ship approaches it is one such example of this.

In the long run will Christopher Nolan's film hold up next to 2001 after a few other viewings? Probably not, but it may. I will say that while watching the movie I was thinking about 2001 during several scenes so there is some interesting serendipity in their ratings. \n\nInterstellar tells the story of a dying world that needs an option to carry the human race forward. The acting was aces, every one involved did their job very well. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan wrote a wonderful story. Those are important parts to any film. What makes Interstellar truly special is that the film was conceived originally by producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who previously worked on Contact) so the science was there before the Hollywood influence.

Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son and daughter Murphy. Murphy believes her bedroom is haunted by a poltergeist. When the \"ghost\" creates a pattern of dust on the floor, Cooper realizes an unknown intelligence is using gravity to communicate, and interprets the pattern as geographic coordinates, which Cooper and Murphy follow to a secret NASA installation. There, they meet Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), a college professor of Cooper's. Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence, appeared near Saturn 48 years before and leads to a distant galaxy, with numerous potentially habitable planets. Twelve volunteers have gone through it, knowing they were unlikely to be able to return, each to assess a different planet's suitability as a new home for humanity. Three - Miller, Edmunds and Mann - have sent encouraging data from planets near Gargantua, a supermassive black hole. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to evaluate as many of the planets as possible, while he works on a theory to harness gravity for propulsion, which would allow humanity to leave Earth (which he calls \"Plan A\"). However, should his efforts fail, the Endurance also carries 5,000 frozen embryos as \"Plan B\", to provide for humanity's survival. Cooper agrees to the plan, angering Murphy. Cooper's crew consists of three scientists - Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) - and robots TARS and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they first head to Miller's planet, an ocean world where time is severely dilated; for each hour there, seven years pass on Earth. Romilly stays on the Endurance while the rest take a lander to the surface, where they find only Miller's wrecked lander in the shallow ocean. Suddenly, a massive tidal wave strikes, killing Doyle and waterlogging the lander's engines; when Cooper and Amelia return to Endurance, 23 years have elapsed for Romilly and Earth. Murphy (Jessica Chastain), now an adult, has been assisting Dr. Brand with his research. On his deathbed, he admits to her that he solved the equation long before and deemed Plan A impossible, and that he lied to everyone, pinning his hopes on Plan B. Murphy sends a message notifying Amelia of her father's death, then accuses her and Cooper of abandoning Earth. She continues researching, concluding that Plan A could work if somehow information could be obtained from observing Gargantua's singularity...\n\nWriter-director Christopher Nolan has more and more made a thing out of trying to master thought-provoking, mind bending and visually outstanding movies as we saw in \"Inception\" in which he played around with time travel and alternative worlds and how you could interact with them. \"Interstellar\" is a classic sci-fi continuation of \"Inception\" in a way with a nod to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as Nolan takes us on a journey into space and time and tries to give us hope on what\u00b4s out there as we are slowly heading for a situation where Earth might need to be replaced with another planet in a unknown future for us. The ultimate message is that love conquers everything. Oliver Gettell, writing for Los Angeles Times, reported that \"Film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining, emotional and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times.\" And Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing, and \"thin characters\" despite seeing the film twice in order to \"give it a second chance.\" Mendelson writes that Interstellar \"ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of 'go into space to save the world' movies.\" I agree in both cases. \"Interstellar\" is ambitious, grande and visually stunning, but at the same time Nolan seems to have fallen so deeply in love with his thoughts and ideas on space and time travel that he ends up in a blocked momentum of numbers and dimensional mumbu jumbo. The dialogue is stretched and so is the running time and I couldn\u00b4t help feeling a bit \"Ok, wrap this up now\". But, Nolan just loops back the storyline in order to be a bit clever and that just shines trough. I like the fact that Nolan wants us to think. What\u00b4s our universal bond? What is humanity? Is there something tangible behind those black holes? And if so, what is there? Can we actually interact between dimensions? Distance, may it be space, may it be time, will ultimately reinforce the relationship and love between people and hope is the last thing we will give up on. The ensemble is great in their respective roles, but I couldn\u00b4t help feeling annoyed that Matt Damon (being Matt Damon...) showed up as a jack in a box and sort of ruined this quite dramatic part of the film. That was a miss in my book. \"Interstellar\" is not Christopher Nolan\u00b4s best film if you ask me, and I was not fully blown away as many other claims they have been.",

The final third teeters on clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, but the concepts at work in the background mostly level this out.

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's space exploration epic is serious science fiction with brains, beauty and heart\n\nInterstellar is Nolan's best and most brazenly ambitious film to date. Doubling down on the Kubrick comparisons, he's made his own sweeping space odyssey in which a team of astronauts, led by Matthew McConaughey's stoically smouldering Coop, venture into the great beyond in search of a new home for humanity. Starlight whirls, planets rock on their axes, and spacecraft cartwheel through nothingness, all soundtracked by a reverential Hans Zimmer score that's equal parts Johann Strauss and Philip Glass. \n\nAt its heart, Nolan's glimmering cosmic ballet is less concerned with space than time - and particularly the way it's experienced by parents, who watch their children grow up and drift away at a speed that seems brutally out of step with the rest of the universe. \n\nNolan and his co-writer and brother Jonathan explore that question here in the most Nolanish way imaginable, with black holes, event horizons, and much metaphysical bungee jumping. (The theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was a script consultant and served as executive producer.) But the aim of Nolan's film isn't to reduce love to a function of quantum physics: it's to set quantum physics and love on an equal footing, as two densely complex, destiny-steering forces his characters learn to surrender to without ever fully fathoming. \n\nThe film takes place in the near future, with Earth in the grip of The Blight, an airborne disease that causes food crops to turn to grey-brown powder. It rolls and billows across the land, piling up around houses and cars like the dust-drifts in Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, another film in which the characters slip between time's cogs. \n\nCoop (the allusion to Gary Cooper is vigorously intended) is a former Nasa pilot who's pitching in with the dig for victory effort, although for him the plan to sit out the famine lacks ambition - and therefore humanity. \n\n\"We used to look up and wonder about our place in the stars,\" he grumbles. \"Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.\" The words ring with Nolan's own frustration at cinema's narrowed ambitions. Where have the wild-dreaming pioneers gone?",

Christopher Nolan might have taken some of that to heart with his new space adventure Interstellar.  Here is a movie with infinite science and infinite filmmaking skill, but it weighs so heavily on an overmelodramatic bid for the soul of humanity that after three hours we find ourselves too exhausted to care.\n\nThe story, at its core, is a good one. We're sometime in the near-future when the planet Earth is essentially on life-support (Al Gore will love this movie), suffering a resurgence of the dustbowl as our crops are drying up and humanity has regressed into an agrarian state. Amid this breakdown we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a good-hearted former aeronautical engineer-turned-farmer who is raising a son named Tom, and a daughter named Murphy (if you forget that name, rest assured that Cooper will repeat it at least 300 times before the movie is over).\n\nDuring a massive dust storm, Cooper and Murphy find themselves the recipients of a sign in binary that is either a message from ghosts, God or space aliens. In doing the math, Cooper finds himself among officials at the remains of NASA, and quickly assigned to travel into space, navigate through a worm hole and find another habitable planet to sustain mankind. His crew includes a mournful co-pilot named Brand (Anne Hathaway), a physicist named Romilly (David Dyasi); and a geographer named Doyle (Wes Bentley). Also, two robots named CASE and TARS, who look like monoliths and move like spiders. Actually CASE and TARS are the best things in the movie. They look like the kiosk that you buy your movie tickets from, but they break into smaller parts to perform rudimentary functions -they're really quite impressive.\n\nThrough a plot that gets way too complicated, the crew find themselves on the other side of the galaxy where they realize that one hour on the new planet equals seven years on Earth. That leads to emotional crises on Cooper's part because he's the one member of the crew with kids back home. Time and relative space begin to spin and bend and twist until neither the crew nor the audience can figure what the heck is going on. This is a very complex story, one that I admit I struggled to follow (and I was able to follow Inception).\n\nYou find yourself having to look amid large chunks of story to find the main narrative. When you get there you find that through all the gargantuan special effects, music and sound effects, Intersteller is really the story of the disconnection between Cooper and Murphy. Cooper knows that when he gets back home that his daughter will be all grown up (and played by Jessica Chastain) so his mission is really just an effort to make things right. That leads to a long, VERY long scenes in which Cooper mourns the fact that he'll never get to watch his little girl grow up. That would be fine except that the movie belabors the point for nearly three hours, playing the same overemotional notes over and over. Not to be heartless, but when traveling to the other side of the universe, I really could care less about a weepy little girl back home.\n\nChristopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He is the one director working right now who really wants to put his vision on screen rather than pander to popular taste. We've seen in Inception , and the Batman pictures that he knows how to tell a grand story using logic and good screenwriting. He has a grand vision for what he wants to put on screen, but in Intersteller he goes over the edge. His overbearing emotional output becomes too much for the audience to carry.",

The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. \n\n\nThis is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey.

There are great performances from a star studded cast along with visually stunning CGI which just about saves it from being completely dull. Not sure about the theoretical physics surrounding black holes which just made the last 10 or so minutes of the movie absurd. Lastly I found it incredibly frustrating why Earth was a dying planet. No explanation was given. Was it a planetary reason or human's over resourcing Earth or was it our very own Sun dying? If a reason was given I certainly missed it due complicated science stuff or the fact at times it was hard to comprehend was being said, not because of not understanding was what being said but due to too much mumbling & whispering by the actors on screen.",

However, the last third of the movie is so incredibly confusing and nonsensical that you're left almost stunned at how anyone thought it was a good idea.  As a scientist myself, I'm fairly well versed in some of the issues discussed.  I'm willing to overlook liberties taken with scientific accuracy if it results in a good action movie.  However, this movie turns into some sort of paranormal babble disguised as science.  There are about a million questions with no good answers for what you see in the last hour.

            "content": "Interstellar came at the end of 2014 to give us a Christmas blockbuster worthy of leaving our warm hearths for. I saw it late after a stretch abroad, but I'm glad I caught it on the big screen, even if it was the 'Bijou' screen of my local cinema. Some films excel at spectacle, and this really deserved to be seen on the biggest, loudest screen possible, so count yourself lucky if you managed it.\n\nThe film is a science fiction epic, but it's not an outlandish fantasy. Forget Avatar. Has anyone watched Avatar recently? Interstellar feels grounded in possibility with ideas full of personal conflict and universal philosophy. The story begins some fifty odd years in the future on an Earth devastated by crop blights. The world is becoming a barren dustbowl as humanity struggles to feed itself.\n\nOur hero is Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a widowed former pilot turned farmer who ekes out a living with his father-in-law and two children Tom and Murphy. The film does well to establish this world; a parent-teacher meeting where children are denied a college application so they can become farmers and an early action sequence where Cooper salvages a downed Indian drone for parts hint at the environmental, technological and geopolitical situation of this future world.\n\nThe main narrative starts when a mysterious signal leads the ever inquisitive Cooper to the remnant of NASA, helmed by Cooper's old professor Dr. Brand (frequent Nolan-collaborator Michael Caine) who offers him the chance to join a secret mission to find a new homeworld for humanity. A wormhole has been discovered near Saturn which leads to a system of potentially habitable planets orbiting a supermassive black hole.\n\nHere begins the struggle and the decisions Cooper and his family must make. Should humanity continue to fight the losing battle on Earth, or abandon it? Should a man leave his family for the future of humanity, or live out what life he can with them, as best he can on a dying world?\n\nAt the heart is Cooper's relationship with the daughter he leaves behind (Jessica Chastain) and her struggle to forgive him as she grows up to become a scientist herself. The relationship is paralleled with Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) who joins the mission to look for something else among the stars.\n\nChristopher Nolan is a twenty-first century auteur and his films are always ambitious, complex and engaging. Even if that ambition is sometimes stretched, he never shrinks from a bold idea. But it's not just a philosophical narrative. While emotional through and through, the film also explores its conflict through gripping action and spectacular visuals, and its pioneering attitudes through the inclusion of cutting edge scientific thought.\n\nOkay, so you don't have to understand every part of the physics; some artistic licence has undoubtedly been taken for the sake of story or spectacle, and there are 'Star Trek' times when characters with a scientific background explain their complicated plans to each other with a simple analogy (a technique immortalised by Fry in Futurama), but we're here to watch a movie, not a lecture in theoretical astrophysics.\n\nThe result is that the characters not only explore foreboding new worlds of ice and oceans but deal with the vaguely realistic implications of exploring wormholes and black holes, such as time dilation and intense space-time-warping gravity. This is used to great emotional effect; imagine communicating with your family at home when hours of your time is years of theirs and your messages can 'only' travel at the speed of light.\n\nIt's enough that theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was present as a consultant to know we're in safe hands. Thorne collaborated with Carl Sagan on the latter's novel Contact, which became a film in 1997 and dealt with the communication between a father and daughter across the void of space and also happened to feature Matthew McConaughey in a supporting role.\n\nInterstellar seems like a spiritual successor but stands on the shoulders of another giant, that unforgettable epic journey to the edges of the solar system and beyond: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968); although that film's astronaut Dave had no family keeping him on Earth. It's worth mentioning here that the cubic robots that assist on the mission are markedly less homicidal. The robots have been brilliantly realised with inventive simplicity as real puppets played by actors and not CGI.\n\nThe effects as a whole are a cinematic experience; the spaceship blasts through the void to ludicrous organ overlays and emerges overlooking the black hole, a magnificently realised singularity of ultimate light and darkness simulated using Thorne's mathematics. Then a moment of peace, all the more accentuated after the volume, allowing us to ponder the 'gravity' of the situation in more ways than one.\n\nI read an article explaining that the pipe organ was for a long time the world's most complex man-made device, this scientific significance a possible reason behind its inclusion, aside from the obvious spiritual associations. Organ pipes also have a visual similarity to spaceship engines, reminding me of Boston Third Stage album cover where the band's signature organ is presented as just that.\n\nMy only word on the film's ending is that it comes very close to undercutting Cooper's sacrifices by letting him have his cake and eat it, but after the mind-bending finale, we're on board enough just to go along with the ride. So I'll leave it there.\n\nThe word 'stellar' is sometimes used to describe something of an extremely high standard, but it's hard to say now without sounding like you're quoting Stanley Kowalski. I think it's time for a change, so this film gets full marks because it was Interstellar.",

Of course, he's worried about the future for his kids (as we all are).  So, when the opportunity arises to search for a new home world (I'll keep the spoilers to a minimum), he takes it.  Thus begins an adventure that is probably equal parts Gravity and 2001, with a few other nods thrown in. It can be gut-wrenching in its physical tension but also somewhat incomprehensible in its farfetchedness.  At a certain point (admittedly very late in the film), I simply gave up \"believing\" and just decided well, OK, then.  Although I'm not sure I was ever fully transported into the world of the film (it would have been a very different experience on the IMAX screen) and this might have been because of the distracting presence of name actors (McConaughey is solid but Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Matt Damon are distracting; Jessica Chastain has too little to do).

            "content": "A cinematic experience of the highest order, I imagine Interstellar will be many different things to many different people, a movie that will inspire thought, flame imagination and push filmmaking in a varied myriad of new and exciting directions, yet it will also be a film that divides the masses, as we've seen already with critics. While many will herald the vision and scope of Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film yet, there will be equal amounts that find fault in its lofty goals, pick holes in its unashamedly mawkish sentiments and then there's those that think Matthew McConaughey might mumble just a little too much. Taking a very personal approach to a movie I feel deeply awe struck by, I will be one of those many people that completely and faithfully stick by a film that for years to come will be a new benchmark in not only the Sci-Fi genre but movie making as a whole.\n\nNaming Interstellar as my most anticipated movie of the year was based on Christopher Nolan's impeccable track record at crafting lofty and masterfully made movies. Over a period of nearly two decades now, the British auteur has oft delved into the human condition, whether it be our memories, our dreams or our dark knights, Nolan has never not reached for the stars and never more so literally than in his most affecting tale here. That critics have found flaws and faults in this journey bemuses me greatly and in saying journey I truly believe this is as close as we could ever come as an audience to such an expedition (not since the Lord of the Rings trilogy had I felt so immersed in a world, in a trek). Critical backlashes to Interstellar bemuses me so as finding flaws here makes me wonder where these critics were for Nolan's previous productions. From Following right through to his most flawed yet thoroughly enjoyable Inception, Nolan's films have always been far from foolproof experiences yet nit-picking them would be taking away from the abundance of cinematic genius that lays so openly before us. Interstellar without question is riddled with moments and with scenarios that are very far from perfect yet what encompasses them is something one can only but marvel at.\n\nDisplaying a directional tone and an emotional depth that sees a maturity to an already mature behind his years filmmaker, Interstellar sees Nolan open up new dimensions both literally and in a directional sense and there is a heart here I've never seen from Nolan, an emotional core that beats so strongly even as we venture deeper and deeper into the unknown with McConaughey's Cooper and his crew of mankind's saviours. There are ideas here that not only click your mind into overdrive but a beating pulse that drives this adventure into the affecting material it becomes. This is Nolan at his finest and we to see yet another stunning turn from the born again McConaughey with a scene where Cooper watches videos now years old of his family particularly showcasing the power of McConaughey as an actor and he is without question the rock that allows Interstellar to be built upon. There are also visuals to wow the mind here, fantastic cinematography work by new Nolan DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema and a score by Hans Zimmer that must surely be one of the most finely crafted film musical accompaniments of the modern movie era and there is a general sense of overall excellence to a production that clearly wanted to do justice to its masters grand visions.\n\nOnce more on a personnel note, I was starting to question the power of modern day movies to engage in an entertainment sense, an emotional sense and in a thought provoking manner but Interstellar has wholeheartedly showcased to me once more the power the medium holds when produced in such a splendid manner. Sure Anne Hathaway can be annoying, yes no doubt some of the dialogue may clunk and do we really need our movies 100% scientifically accurate? There criticisms of the film are valid to a point; there also criticisms of a film that also do not in many way shape or form matter. Put your prejudices aside, allow yourself to be carried away on the Endurance and Nolan's cinematic treat will take you on a movie trip unlike any other (even when paying homage to Sci-Fi greats that have preceded it). A startling example of the power off big budget movie making and wonderful vision come to life, Interstellar is not only the big screen movie of the year but an all-time classic that I for one can guarantee will be talked about and studied on for years to come by a raft of not only movie lovers, but movie makers, inspired to reach for the unknown just like Nolan did here.\n\n5 A-listers in cryogenic sleep out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Ambitious is a good word to describe director Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" (PG-13, 2:49). The word applies equally to the filmmaking, the story the film tells and the actions of every main character in the film. Instead of giving us a typical end-of-days sci-fi adventure, Nolan has produced an epic worthy of David Lean and as imaginative as anything Steven Spielberg has ever dreamed up. This is a broad, yet intimate story featuring a long-odds tale of human survival, spectacular visual effects (especially in IMAX), high-concept science and sprawling storytelling, all centering around a beating heart full of family values and the transcendent power of love. \n\nThe Nolan brothers (screenwriters Jonathan and Christopher, merging their many disparate ideas for this story) imagine a near future in which mankind has advanced technologically, but regressed societally. Environmental conditions have turned the planet into a modern day Dust Bowl in which much of the world's food supply has been obliterated and the variety of crops that can be raised from the earth is dwindling. Mankind's increased focus on producing the basics for human existence has removed common luxuries from our lives and rendered our early 21st Century lifestyle obsolete. Not much matters now beyond survival - and family.\n\nThe family at the center of what becomes a fight for the survival of the species is that of former astronaut Cooper (Matthew McConaughey). He's now a farmer, and a widower struggling to maintain his home and provide for his family - his father-in-law (John Lithgow), his 15-year-old son, Tom (Timothee Chalamet), and his 10-year-old daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Murph is precocious and intelligent, but seems to believe there is a ghost in her bedroom knocking books and other items to the floor. Her father, always the scientist, tells her to approach the strange occurrences in her room as a scientific problem. The two of them discover that these seemingly random acts of gravity are actually messages from a mysterious intelligence beyond their understanding. A clear pattern in the dust that blows in through Murph's window leads father and daughter to a top secret research facility. \n\nIt seems that the current environmental conditions on earth are even more ominous than most people realized and it's almost as if Cooper was sent to this remote location to play a role in helping to save the human race. Cooper is reunited with his former NASA mentor, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who is leading a team of scientists working to avoid human extinction. An experimental spacecraft stands ready to take a small group of latter day explorers (Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley and David Gyasi) through a worm hole that has appeared near Saturn in the hopes of finding a hospitable planet on which to relocate... or to create a brave new world on one of those planets with frozen human embryos (\"Plan B\") loaded on to their ship. Cooper is more experienced as a pilot than anyone on hand and he reluctantly agrees to be a part of the Lazarus Mission. Murph doesn't want her father to go, but he realizes that leaving his children is his best chance of saving them. He promises Murph that he'll return to her, but with no guarantees that he'll be able to fulfill that promise.\nTime is not this mission's friend. The distances traveled and the relativity of the space-time continuum (Einstein and Newton deserving equal billing here) mean that even if the mission is successful, the people of earth may not survive long enough to benefit from it. As Cooper and his team go in and out of hypersleep and attempt to visit as many as three possible new earths, Coop's kids become adults. Tom (now played by Casey Affleck) is raising a family in the increasingly difficult conditions on his childhood homestead and grown-up Murph (Jessica Chastain) works at that secret NASA facility, trying to help Professor Brand solve the scientific problems associated with getting the rest of the human race off the planet and to a possible new home - just a few planets and a wormhole away. The rest of the movie cuts back and forth between Lazarus' significant challenges in an unknown galaxy and the struggles of life on earth, as we wait to see if humanity can be saved - and if love, as one character opines, can truly maintain its power across space and time.\n\n\"Interstellar\" is a wonderful blend of the tried-and-true with the original-and-new. There is no mistaking the presence of earlier sci-fi cinematic influences here, but the film never crosses the line into mimicry. Fans of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", \"Contact\", the recent \"Star Trek\" films, \"Gravity\", Nolan's own \"Inception\" and even the movies of M. Night Shyamalan will enjoy elements of those earlier works in this film as the rich background to a story that still feels very fresh. From the ambitious story-telling and the marriage of movie magic and realistic science (overseen by theoretical physicist and executive producer Kip Thorne) to the unusual-looking robots and the original score, there is much here that is new. Although the movie is longer than it needed to be and some of the plot points strain the limits of credulity (even for a sci-fi adventure), the film's many strengths (including stellar performances, especially from McConaughey) and its deep soul carry the day and deserve an \"A...minus.\"",

            "content": "Where can I start instilling my praise for Christopher Nolan's mesmerizing film \"Interstellar\"? There is lots to love about \"Interstellar\",but keep in mind it's a Nolan film, so there's lots to learn with \"Interstellar\" by viewing it repeatedly and getting a degree in Astrophysics. OK, I was a bit far out there, but again it's a Nolan film so there are plenty of \"come again?\" moments even if your intelligence if plenty above ground. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a widowed father of two, who resides in a future where the crop is dying, and the world is in danger of extinction. Cooper, a pilot and a farmer himself, gets fatefully transported to a secret organization who at that time many thought no longer existed; we call them today NASA. Cooper is asked to go on a mission with space astronaut comrades to find another planet that can inhibit life so the people on earth don't have to face their impending doom on the endangered planet earth. Cooper has a wily 10 year-old daughter named Murph and a devoted teenage son named Tom. Murph is the one that is fully against her dad going on this longtime mission, an age part of the mission is that Coop stays the same age while the earthlings get older; beats Oil of Olay any day I guess! The mission is filled with complexities, deceit, discoveries, and challenges; and they even go and Save Private Ryan; OK, I am stopping there. Will Cooper ever see Murph and Tom again? Well, I am not not going to be an interspoiler by revealing that. Nolan proved once again that he is a master auteur with his direction of \"Interstellar\"; but what I was enamored more about his orchestration of the film that he made the picture more as a love & bond story between a father and a daughter through the test of time (and this is big time) and their brawny magnetic force. The technical features of the movie were exemplary including its cinematography, production design, sound, and of course its extra special visual effects. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay was sure complex but very heartwarming, And yes, there was a a bit of a drag in the film's second act, but it all rightfully led to an astonishing third act. McConaughey continues his alright, alright, alright acting with his superb performance as Cooper. Anne Hathaway was outstanding as the fellow physicist astronaut Dr. Amelia Brand; and there was another brand that rated high, and that was the performance of Michael Caine as Amelia's father, Professor Brand who orchestrated the mission. The enchanting Jessica Chastain yet delivered another potent performance as the adult Murph. Other fine supporting work was lifted off by Wes Bentley as fellow astronaut Doyle, David Gyasi as the Black Hole expert Romilly, and child actress MacKenzie Joy as a young Murph. So if you have not done so already, now it's the time to set your cinematic mission set to the stellar \"Interstellar\". \n***** Excellent",

            "content": "I love Christopher Nolan. He has a distinct style, he conveys consistent/similar themes in his films, and he usually directs actors well and makes good cast choices. This film, however, falls somewhat flat for me.\n\nI'll get the spoiler out of the way because it is one of the main problems for me. This being the second time viewing the film, I looked for information on the black hole, harnessing gravity, and saw how it was explained well in the movie. What is not explained very well is why the black hole specifically sent Cooper to Murph's bookcase. He claims that \"we sent ourselves here,\" but with that logic then futuristic humans needed to place the black hole/tesseract there and select for him to view the bookcase specifically. He didn't place that black hole, so how could he have sent himself there if there don't exist future humans to place it for him. Paradoxes are great in certain sci-fi films such as 12 Monkeys and Looper, but this paradox falls short of greatness.\n\nBack on Earth while Cooper is on his mission, things are pretty dead and boring. One of the most intriguing scenes is Dr. Brand's death bed reveal that he has been lying to/betraying the people at NASA, but we can't even hear all of what he is saying due to how he was directed to say it. We get he is dying, but with a barely audible voice in the mix with some eerie noise/music to set the mood. And to think that Roeper actually thought this film would win both sound-related Oscars.\n\nThere are poor casting choices in this film as well. A lot of characters portray sadness in this movie, but the only actors to pull this off effectively are McConaughey and Matt Damon - plus the younger version of Murph; that scene was very emotional. Jessica Chastain, who one critic praised before the release of the film, did a sub-par job as older Murph, which is disappointing when we look at Zero Dark Thirty and her Oscar caliber performance. I didn't believe her when she cried - and even if I did she still seemed like a little girl, and not grown up as she should be. On top of this, the character comes to the conclusion that Cooper is her ghost due to revisiting her morse code notes and looking at the watch she was given by her father, which means she relatively bases this conclusion on no evidence. And really, Nolan? Topher Grace? Yeah, because it was so dramatic when you see him grab that object with the means to fight Tom off. The Earth segment of the film was just trying way too hard to be dramatic when all the real drama was happening on Cooper's voyage.\n\nI have to admit, the film intrigued me emotionally with Cooper's relationship with Murph and his struggle to prioritize the human race over family, but this film also clearly shows why Nolan is considered a very overrated director.",

The bulk of the narrative is a thrilling and visually stunning adventure that never ceases to keep viewers on the edge of their seat.

            "content": "There are a few directors in the world that are given a lease of freedom to create any project desired with no strings attached\u00e2?\u00a6 and director Christopher Nolan is one of them. His projects have grown from The Prestige to the Batman trilogy to Inception and Interstellar takes his work to another dimension\u00e2?\u00a6 literally! Films with the scope of Interstellar are not made anymore and if they are, they arrive on our screens years apart therefore this is a film to be cherished. It has the best group of filmmakers off screen coupled with some of the best actors at the moment so it really can\u00e2??t put a foot wrong. With each Christopher Nolan film comes a sense of excitement because his work provides a cinematic magnitude that is rare in a repetitive Hollywood.\n \nSet in the near future where Earth is ravaged by blight and is no longer able to sustain humanity, a team of space travellers head through a wormhole near Saturn in order to find a appropriately inhabitable planet for the remainder of mankind. Considering scientific experts acted as consultants on the project, the representation of relativity and wormholes are as accurately embodied as they can be. Interstellar is a true adventure film that has been influenced by sci-fi classics such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey but it feels original in everything intergalactic. Interstellar\u00e2??s soul derives from the multiple genres the film incorporates. It has action, drama, comedy, and love and yet it never gets entangled in its abundance; it humbly captivates you with its transcendent beauty and sweeping intellect. To put it simply, Interstellar is perhaps the most exhilarating cinematic experience of times gone by that it will almost leave you in a trance at how spectacular the vision has come to fruition.\n \nWith imagery able to rival that of Gravity, Interstellar\u00e2??s visual scope is majestically realistic even if it is a fabrication of the filmmakers\u00e2?? imagination. Interstellar captures the magnificence of space effectively; the shot of the Endurance space shuttle silently drifting past Saturn\u00e2??s golden rings is a sight to behold because it actually is a factual place. Once the shuttle enters the wormhole, the emphasis on the imagery shifts from the blackness of space to the appearance of each planet they investigate. The grandeur of each planet is stressed and you go into the film expecting an out of this world experience and Interstellar provides exactly that. If Interstellar doesn\u00e2??t fulfil your graphical expectations, no film ever will!\n \nInterstellar features solid, dependable performances from a resiliently recognisable cast. All the actors are of the highest order; most have either won or been nominated for an Oscar and therefore you feel secure that these actors chosen to helm such a project will be able to pilot your enjoyment. Matthew McConaughey portrays Cooper, a widowed astronaut who agrees to leave his family and take on the mission to save mankind. McConaughey is reliable throughout, as the calmly experienced astronaut or as the lovingly devoted father; he delivers a performance that can easily take charge of such a film. Anne Hathaway is likewise emotionally powerful and the Oscar winner is convincing as the female lead and functions as a nice back up to McConaughey. The rest of the cast features an array of actors from Michael Caine to Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, therefore the film has a strong foundation. If the intellect exceeds the film\u00e2??s grasp at times, the actors are there to fall back on, as they are effortlessly credible and certainly likeable.\n \nRenowned composer Hans Zimmer just keeps delivering amazing scores and this one is just so hypnotically operatic it not only provides an equivalence to the grandeur of the scenery but it also lures you into this new dimension to the point where you feel completely submerged in the interplanetary action.\n \nThe fact Interstellar arrives at just under 3 hours gives the filmmakers the time to express the scope of the film not only visually but also emotionally and narratively. A good part of 2 hours are spent exploring the vastness of space whilst the whole film challenges you intellectually to consider what may beyond the confines of Earth. Yet Interstellar still has a heart and is not just a technical exploration but an emotional rollercoaster for the characters undertaking the journey as they may never know if they will return to see their loved ones or even save humankind. Interstellar is also intense on your senses; your eyes will be fascinated and your ears will be submerged in the Interstellar experience.\n \nInterstellar is a rare film that is not restricted by any outside force and simply has the freedom to explore unexplored boundaries of the imagination. Only the greatest filmmakers can deliver a true family blockbuster with a gritty edge to it that also allows you to become engrossed on an intellectual and emotional level. It is a film with layers and under each layer lies a dose of enthralling indulgence.\n \nThe only problem with Interstellar is that you can get lost in its complexity. The penetrating uproar coupled with hypnotic sounds can overpower the conversing and the important scientific information can be too much to digest on first screening. Interstellar deals with an unexplored phenomena of wormholes and new galaxies therefore the film needs to explain to us in such a simple way about something so complex that you can get a bit bewildered by the event. Perhaps with the extra help of subtitles to allow you to read the script, Interstellar would be the perfect film as it truly is a cinematic pleasure.\n \nAudacious, thrilling and transcendent in its vision, Interstellar is a moviemaking masterpiece that just falls heartbreakingly short of perfection.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        9/10",

But I cant stand the block buster, science fiction for the modern mass audience sheen to it all. This film was praised for scientific accuracy, but all the dialogue just comes off sounding retarded.  I also find his father-daughter-love and noble sacrifice themes to be so insipid and frustrating. Outer space is just no place for such nonsense, 'Gravity' had a similar thing. I should probably just stop expecting much from blockbusters and keep my malicious and hateful thoughts to myself.",

The visuals alone are outstanding, but what I really like that this movie uses to it's advantage is time. Time itself is a huge plot device and the display of how time passes in the movie makes it feel so huge and on another level.

This meaning gives a good message, we are running out of resources and we will eventually come to this point but for now let's just enjoy the movie! This movie is amazing at capturing different types of environments, in this case planets, Matthew McConaughey gives a good performance as does the rest of the supporting actors. What I think really just lost people in this film is when he somehow enters another dimension and he can see into the past. I personally thought that at this point in the movie, the director definitely was trying to give off a message that obviously not very clear, but then again many directors to that. They like to leave you guessing just like Prometheus did. Guys this is a good movie I advise you watch it. A",

This is a good movie with great potential but a few things holding back that potential.

            "content": "The term \"flawed masterpiece\" sounds like somewhat of an oxymoron and yet it is the only way I can think to describe Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar.\"  How can it be a masterpiece if it contains flaws that are worthy of mention?  Despite the fact that there are several irksome moments in this film, it still comes out the other side as a triumph of not just modern cinema, but a film that belongs in the same conversation as many of Hollywood's classics.\nI get it.  That's incredibly high praise for a movie that I openly just admitted is flawed.  The people who do not like this movie cannot stand its \"overhype\" and \"over-praise.\"  \"Yeah it was really cool and I loved watching it, but I hate how everyone thinks it's like the best thing ever,\" is a comment I have heard from nearly a dozen friends of mine, and hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Now, I'm not sure why what other people think of a movie should bother you and the way you enjoy it, but I cannot get inside other people's minds (Christopher Nolan can though, thanks to \"Inception.\").\n\"Interstellar\" is the perfect balance of emotion, complex story, and the science to back it all up.  Often times Nolan's films can become imbalanced between these three factors and you end up with something like \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" which is heavy on plot details and very light on character development.  Or you can end up with \"Inception,\" with certain well-rounded characters, a complex plot narrative but slightly bogged down by confusing scientific details thrown right at you.  Before now, I found \"Inception\" to be Nolan's greatest triumph and I still think it is his best blend of fun and serious, and is infinitely more re-watchable than \"Interstellar,\" but this film manages to create something special without ever having to flinch.\nFor the last few years, we've seen the dark, brooding Matthew McConaughey in \"True Detective,\" \"Mud,\" and \"Killer Joe,\" and it's refreshing to see him playing a good old fashioned Texas boy again, but not in the annoying way that we have known in the past.\nHere we get him as Cooper, a pilot-turned-farmer when the world doesn't need his technical duties anymore.  Throughout the film we feel the deep connection he has with his daughter, Murphy, played by Jessica Chastain, despite the fact that they never share the screen together, which is an achievement Nolan has never quite pulled off before.  In \"Inception\" we understand Cobb's connection to his kids only because he constantly reminds the audience through dialogue how much he loves them, but we never get to see that love from his children's side.  Here we see the love, contempt and complexities between the father and daughter because we are given access to both sides of the relationship.  Unfortunately, the relationship between Cooper and his son, Tom, played by an underutilized Casey Affleck, is not nearly as firmly developed.\nWe are treated to dozens of breathtaking images of foreign planets and fast-paced space travel with special effects that are as top-notch as they come.  But we have come to expect that from Nolan at this point, which does not make it any less impressive but there is one new addition in \"Interstellar\" that has been noticeably absent from his from his other films: comedy.\nEarly on we are introduced to TARS, a wise-cracking robot that goes on Cooper's mission.  TARS is a breath of fresh air in the otherwise bleak world that Nolan has introduced us to.  There have been moments here and there of comic relief in his previous films, there was some nice banter between Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in \"Inception,\" but it was not explored all that much and moments of comedy in \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\" were few and far between, often times not even working when they tried, unless you were some kind of psycho that relished in the Joker's one-liners.  Finally we get a comic relief character that can properly ease the tension without feeling forced.\nI also must commend the development on TARS: often times robot characters with \"personalities\" just become humans with their own agenda that just happen to be made of metal and thus have no grounded reality (e.g. Fassbender in \"Prometheus\"), but TARS will be the first one to remind you that he is still just a robot and has to do whatever you tell him to.  Thank you, Nolan, for giving cinema a fun robot that actually stays a robot.\nThe film grips at difficult scientific and existential questions and thankfully, actually takes a stab at answering them, regardless of whether or not they are correct; instead of leaving them vague and open-ended in an unsatisfying fashion, the filmmakers decide that within the world of this movie, their answers are correct.",

            "content": "My excitement for this movie started back in 2013 when the first teaser trailer was just released. Although the news of Christopher Nolan doing a space adventure had reached me before, it became mentally tangible after hearing that Zimmer theme for the first time with McConaughey's voiceover about our pioneering nature. After a year of trailers, interviews and TV spots, expectations were high for a movie directed by my favourite director and starring my favourite actor and actress (McConaughey and Chastain), so does it deliver? Not in the way I expected.\n\nIn a not too distant future, frequent dust storms and the blight have led to a world deprived of food leading most of America to become an agriculture orientated society. With conditions worsening the only solutions seem to be off planet. The story was entirely engaging, Nolan created a very plausible threat (see dirty thirties) to propel the story into space; from there science becomes the driving force of the story. Gravity, black holes, relativity become problems that ignite raw human drama in a way I didn't think possible. When learning about time dilation you never really think about the impact it will make on a person, but in the film it is expressed in a close up of McConaughey's face that left me in tears. Although there is a lot of science and exploration, the film still focuses on human emotions. This is highlighted in most of the film with the bond between Murph and Cooper. \n\nIt's no surprise that Nolan has brought together another strong ensemble cast including Ellen Burstyn, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley and of course Michael Caine all of which served their role and performed great as normal. The standouts are of course the main protagonists Cooper and Amelia Brand played by Matthew McConaughey (the McConaissance continues) and Anne Hathaway respectively. I was most impressed with Mackenzie Foy who brought to life Murphy in such an incredible way she is possibly the first child in a movie who doesn't annoy me (looking at you Iron Man 3 (2013)). Later portrayed by Jessica Chastain, although the characters don't share large amounts of screen time there father-daughter relationship resonates with the audience. Another character worth mentioning is TARS voiced by Bill Irwin. Both CASE and TARS were simply designed rectangular prism robots, but TARS especially was given a fantastic personality that you can't help but enjoy. \n\nThe film surprised me with its large amount of laughs, mostly from interaction with TARS. The jokes never became excessive, staying in the sweet spot of making you laugh without changing the tone of the movie and becoming annoying. It was no surprise however, the sheer ambition of the film, daring to go so high in terms of exploring space and humanity. This leads to some of the most amazing imagery ever filmed. Especially in an IMAX cinema, the shots of space seem to consume you in its breath taking beauty. Hans Zimmer's score compliments the visuals along with the deafening sound mixing to provide a complete audio and visual spectacle. \n\nWatching the film, Christopher Nolan's inspirations can be very easily spotted. Ranging from all types of films, mainly Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Star Wars (1977) and of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Nolan has stated that he sought to make a family film akin to Spielberg films such as Jaws (1975) and in this respect I think he succeeded, this being a film I would share with everyone in the family. Although the influences are obvious it never feels in the film that he is just copying parts or trying to improve their works but instead, making his own movie stimulated by the other works.\n\nWhile visually stunning and emotionally compelling the film isn't without fault. For example the dialogue in the film is repetitive at times, especially Michael Caine's repetition of the opening lines of Dylan Thomas's poem \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.\" Also, at times, the plain overstatement on the importance of love isn't some of the best dialogue. Although I didn't have this problem, I could also understand how some of the third act may not gel with all audiences. Not much more can be said about that without spoiling the movie.\n\nInterstellar left me walking out of the cinema mind blown. I was in awe of the stunning visuals, the integration of science and its power to thrill, make me laugh and cry. Days after I am still thinking about the film, and will definitely return for repeat viewings. There are some other great and not so great parts which I can't elaborate on without giving away minor spoilers so I won't say more except the film may not be perfect but it is phamtastic.",

That it's being rightfully compared to Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A Space Odyssey in it's scope and ambition? Sure, undeniably, Interstellar is a gargantuan, 3 hour space epic that will blow your mind. It has to be seen in IMAX to be truly appreciated. But Interstellar is a winner as much for the emotional ride you take.\n\n Ever since he quietly dazzled with 2001's indie mindbender Memento, Nolan has delivered high-quality, contemplative entertainment (The Prestige, Insomnia), global blockbusters (Inception) and one of the best franchises ever in The Dark Knight trilogy. He is often accused of a lack of humanism in his work; however, he and fellow screenwriting brother Jonathan bear their heart and soul for this universe-spanning saga that's concurrently an intimate family drama.\n\n McConaughey continues to roll after his Oscar win last year for Dallas Buyer's Club. He stuns once again as an astronaut turned farmer who joins the last of NASA for one final mission to find a new home for humanity before our planet becomes unlivable - a giant dust bowl doomed by our irresponsibility. Whether that is actually happening in reality is just one of many debates to be had as you leave the theater. McConaughey rockets through worm holes and explores desolate planets with a cold, capable Anne Hathaway and two robot computer modules who at times entertain and exasperate. But he longs for his daughter stuck on Earth and played by the phenomenal Jessica Chastain. Already twice-nominated for best picture contenders The Help and Zero Dark Thirty, Chastain has four performances for the Academy to choose from this year. This may well be the one she is once again recognized for. \n\nAll the actors navigate not only the starscapes designed by the Nolans and their mega-star production team (Hoyte van Hoytema behind the camera; Hans Zimmer creating another powerful score; costume designer Mary Zophres and art director Nathan Crowley), but the challenging philosopical and intellectual dialogue. There's a lot of mumbo jumbo you are asked to swallow and plenty of disbelief to be suspended to get through the plot. And we forgive those stretches because this is after all meant to be an epic entertainment. And at almost 3 hours, it better end well, right? You will have to go see it to find out.",

            "content": "Admirably Ambitious but Ultimately Underwhelming. I recognize the ambitious nature of this film (from the high-level science-fiction concepts to the extensive use of IMAX cameras in filming), but it really didn't come together for me like I was hoping and felt overlong. I don't know that I can recommend it as a great film to go rent, though it would probably have been fun to see in IMAX. \n\nI seriously considered seeing Interstellar in IMAX when it came out last year but I never got around to it. Now that it is out on Redbox, a poor IMAX substitute to be sure, I decided to give it a try.\n\nPlot Summary: \n\nIn the not too distant future, Earth will become a dust-bowl with limited technology, dying crops and an ever more likely possibility of suffocation due to a rapidly deteriorating atmosphere. In an effort to save his family and his race, former astronaut (Matthew McConaughey) must join a desperate mission through space and time to locate a suitable planet for a new Earth colony.\n\nTarget Audience: \n\nThe 'Nolanites' (director Christopher Nolan's fan-base) constitute an obvious portion of the target demographic of this film, but they would come see the movie regardless of what it was about.  Due to dramatic themes (such as survival, human extinction, mental instability, and prolonged separation from family and other loved ones) and due to the highly intellectual nature of the film, I would submit that the target audience is 13+ (if not higher than that). \n\n\n\nScore & Recommendation: 5/10 \n\nI struggled with whether I should even give it a 5/10 because, to be honest, I don't know that I would ever want to watch it again. This is definitely more up the alley of an Inception, in terms of the complex nature of the plot, but Interstellar's pacing is immensely slow, by comparison.\n\nImpressions: \n\nWith a 2 hour 45 minute run time, Nolan was fighting an uphill battle from the start. Most audience members don't have the attention span for a film of that length; I would not consider myself to be an average moviegoer, in that respect, since some of my favorite films include Inception (2 hrs, 28 minutes) and Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2 hrs, 49 minutes). Despite my appreciation for and patience with lengthy films, Interstellar feels incredibly long. While there are frequent high-intensity moments throughout the film, they are often so long that they lose their momentum and just drag on. \n\nUnfortunately, since most of the more action-heavy elements didn't quite work for me (for the aforementioned reasons), when it came time for the less-engaging astrophysics lessons sprinkled throughout the film, I felt less enthusiastic about trying to understand all of it.\n\nMatthew McConaughey and his fellow cast members (including Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, who have both worked with Nolan previously in the Dark Knight trilogy) do a great job portraying the depth of emotion that their characters must feel in that situation. I also found their robot companion, who is programmed with a sense of humor, to be pretty hilarious.\n\nThe world that Nolan creates and the concepts addressed in the film are certainly thought-provoking but the pacing is painfully slow and, despite extensive build-up, it leaves a lot of loose ends by the time the credits role; and not the fun kind of loose ends that leave you chatting with your friends after the film, but the annoying kind that leave you upset that you just spent 3 hours watching a film that didn't wrap things up. I feel like the film really falls apart in the last half hour or so.\n\nIn short, the base concept of the film is interesting and the acting is pretty good, but both the pacing and subpar storytelling cause the film to collapse under its own weight.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nThe official MPAA rating is \"PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong language.\" I agree with this assessment as the violence is very minimal (hand to hand conflict with a few non-graphic deaths) but the perilous situations are nearly constant throughout the film.  I did find it odd that, despite relatively infrequent use of strong language, there is at least one (if not two) instances where the protagonist uses the F-word, which I found a bit jarring and unnecessary.\nFOR MORE FILM REVIEWS: check out my blog at www.cinemacommander.com.\n\nThanks!",

Also I can say with all certainty that this is Hans Zimmer's best score thus far and given his career that is saying something. Any complaints? It may have been just little too long.

From my understanding, the world is on the verge of an end. Like there's a phenomenon coming, making its people suffer from starvation and devastation. The guys from NASA are planning to move these people out into a new planet with signs of life. Yet, the plan turns out in a different way.The first part is kinda confusing yet interesting, where like ,they were attacked by a huge sand storm, that hits every crop and every household. And sh*ts happening like, wtf are those? Cooper's daughter Murph ( Mackenzie Foy ) always mentioning, there is a ghost, and the gravity. I mean, who is the ghost? What does gravity got to do with this? By the time Cooper was about to leave, she said a word to her dad to \"stay\" with an emphasis. I was thinking, there's really something going on, like you always wondering from the beginning of the story. And from being a part of a certain connection of the second half of the film.I was thinking Cooper is already a well trained astronaut before all of this. With his skills and experience, NASA convinced him to lead the guys of astronauts and make a space travel in search for a new planet, a new sign of life. The plan is, they'll go into a wormhole, and travel in the next galaxy. The funny thing is, as they warp into space to the next wormhole, they have already cheated time. It's already 23 years past. People are getting older in our world as they (the astronauts) never got aged wondering, what if that will happen in real life. I would say that is pretty interesting. I'm not a physics guy, but everything in this movie still interests me. Using quantum physics in a space travel. That is really sick man. The plot on this will not pleases anyone for sure, especially the climax of the film. Based on my understanding, Cooper was trapped inside a black hole and can manipulate time by using a Morse code and send a message to his daughter. He sends a quantum data by time traveling. It really sounds ridiculous and over the top, but still engaging as ever. The execution is still very \"Nolan\" to me. As they travel along, those mind blowing one take camera shot whilst space traveling. And it is superbly well made. Watching it on IMAX blows your mind even more. And the amazing and breathtaking views of the beautiful landscapes as they landed in several planets such as planet Miller, Mann and lastly Edmunds. Those are some of the most visually stunning landscapes in a Sci-Fi film. My eyes are filled of magical things on what is happening on the screen. And the IMAX moments are way longer than expected. I like the characterization. Anne Hathaway as Brand, I thought she was great on her role. She is very dedicated to her work as an astronaut / researcher. And she is willing to sacrifice everything just for Science. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, I thought his performance was brilliant. You can really feel for his character as he does care as a father, and as a leader of the crew. I never thought of Matt Damon in this film till such time they arrived in planet Mann. As he is the asshole of this film. I thought he did a fantastic job. And my new favorite robot TARS.He is like the side kick of everybody. I love that they include a Robot in this film like he is the real life C3PO. But in all of that, I thought this is a fantastic movie. Not for everyone, but for someone who loves science fiction, or who appreciates the art of Science. This is a must watch. I did love it. I could think about it for a very, very long time. Christopher Nolan is a genius in terms of film making. You sir, are a genius. This is modern Science at its best and it is freaking hardcore.5/5",

            "content": "There is simply no director like Christopher Nolan who goes above and beyond to leave our eyes amazed in wonder, our emotions go through a rollercoaster and our brains to think inquisitively. Every film he does seems like it goes to the far reaches of what our minds can handle and then alters it to make room for his next creation. With Interstellar he has perhaps reached his most daring and personable yet as he goes deep into the outer realms of space and time. It's easy for me to get on board a Nolan film, but having it not only look beautiful and have a story that's completely engrossing and somewhat conceivable is another. We may never reach the heights that this film does in our lifetimes, but it's important that we constantly look upon the stars for what we can achieve. And with this film, maybe inspire others to reach for something more.\nCooper (Matthew McConaughey) was once a great pilot for NASA but has since moved on. He is now a farmer and an engineer. He has two young kids Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) who would age into Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck, with Murph being incredibly intelligent and headstrong when it comes to science. She also likes to tag along with her father on assignments and such. They both soon find out the discovery of a top secret NASA base that no one knows about. Cooper soon finds out by his old teacher Professor Brand and father to Amelia (Michael Caine) that the world is dying and Murph's generation will be the last to survive. He enlists him to pilot a space ship with other astronauts Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi) to another galaxy through a wormhole to find a habitable planet for the rest of the planet to live. Tasked with such a difficult task proves hard on Cooper's daughter who can't bear to see him go. But to ensure that she along with the people of earth live, he has to risk his life for the greater good, but soon finds that it's a mission that is far harder than anything than anybody ever envisioned.\nWhen it comes to the stories in a Nolan film, they are always more than what they seem. There is always an underlining element in every tale that is wholly original. It doesn't stop here with Interstellar as the story was very well thought out in respect to various theories, thoughts, ideas and interpretations. I don't know much about space and the various laws of physics, but I do know that laws are always bended even in the most highly regarded films of all time. No film is ever 100% accurate in every retrospect so nitpicking that someone did this when a law said that shouldn't really be applied here. The point is to entertain, excite and amaze, not give you a power point presentation. When it comes to space, the laws are unpredictable and do so without rhyme or reason. So I bought in with whatever Nolan was selling since it's just a movie in the end. \nThe story was incredibly engaging as it jumped through decades and dimensions in a matter of moments. It was very easy to be invested with the story since it is plausible; maybe not in the way that they are saying it, but something along the lines. It was also surprisingly funny in many parts where you wouldn't expect. It lightened the mood at times and was definitely needed to offset some of the heavier aspects of the film. It made certain moments that much better with an inclusion of comedy and not just have it be straight up drama and intense exploration of the mind. At the heart of the story is a man who wants to get back to his children and make amends with those he hurt. Much like other Nolan films like Memento and Inception who pine for those that was close to the main character. It drives the story amid all the craziness and gives it a more personable feel, knowing that Cooper may never see his kids ever again. It's by far his most emotional film where an impossible task is put fourth upon a man and thrown into the most unpredictable setting known to man. The drive to get back to what you lost makes you pine for him to reach his goal in the end. \nIt was a very intelligent and well thought out script by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. You could tell how much time and effort went in to flesh out nearly every aspect as humanly possible. It was incredibly hopeful and moving at times where you can see the struggle to survive within all of us. I think it's the Nolan's most complete script yet and actually feels like its worthy of mass importance. I didn't get a feeling of egotism or being impressed with one's self in regards to the Nolan's story telling. Nobody really makes big pictures anymore where a litany of questions is being asked to the viewer. Not many films are built up as big, presented as big, experienced as big and then loved and appreciated as big. It touches on all the right elements of love, wonder, fear, death, survival, life, new beginnings and so forth. \nThe philosophical and psychological elements ushered throughout the film allowed it to stretch our minds on what we would do in the situation. They were all handled extremely well and put fourth what the cost of human life really is to you and if we don't explore the stars, we might as well shut down. I love movies that make you think deeply about the world and your own dreams and aspirations. Its perhaps one of the most uplifting films I've seen in a long while. It really makes you want to reach for that higher plane of being and discover what was once deemed impossible by men who don't know any better or are afraid to go after. It wasn't as confusing as I thought at first. Some of the technological and space aspects caught me off guard where I had to decipher what was being said in relation to the scene and the film, but overtime it eventually becomes one by the end. I understood much of it by the end but a simple look online will clear up any thoughts or questions. And then it's simple to understand, as well as you look at it from a movie director's perspective and not from say Stephen Hawking. \nIt went by quicker than I expected where Cooper goes into space relatively quick. I became so interested with the characters on earth that I forgot that there is an entire universe that's to be explored. The three hours go by without even noticing and frankly it was worth every minute. I could watch it for another three hours and be as happy as a clam. When the team does get into space there are the standard complications that threaten to doom them all and they are presented incredibly well at the perfect time. I did get confused about the time difference on one place and how it related to other places sometimes. The time difference between earth and space made sense but got a little hard to understand when the characters were all in space and how it related to all of them individually. \nThe ending was a gorgeous palette of colors and shapes that was mind-blowing and somewhat reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey and just as trippy. It also features the now standard Nolan twist that bookends most of his films. His are some of the best in film that always continue to stir debate long after they were released with Memento, The Following, The Prestige, and Inception churning out some mind bending twist that no one sees coming from miles away. It's my favorite ending to his films by far and the most explorative where you think its ending but it's really only just begun. It's important to have the ending be as wide, expanding and free as space itself.\nMcConaughey is the perfect hero to save the world and felt like the most human of all the heroes in Nolan's films. Seeing his struggle felt incredibly real and trying to understand something that is beyond his comprehension translated well on the screen. You feel his plight and pain as he watches his children grow in a matter of hours to grown adults. Seeing his distraught face wrought with tears and hardship was heartbreaking and a powerfully sentimental moment in the film. The McConaissance is in full swing as he has grown to a fully emotive actor as well as powerfully capable of handling whatever material is thrown at him. He was strong, headfast and dedicated to his mission with his kids firmly on his mind at all times. \nThe dual performances by Chastain and Foy were very impressive with the latter being far better than anticipated. Foy shows great poise with herself displaying anger, confidence and sadness. For such a young actor, she takes on the role with much experience and assuredness. She was strong as well as vulnerable when faced with the dire situation of potentially never seeing your father again. Chastain was great as the older, wiser and angrier Murph with an increased somber tone that only sees the worst happening. Her performance really anchored the film in the latter half, bringing out the needed desperation and anguish of the story on earth. Michael Caine was spectacular as you would expect as the father figure to the entire mission as well as the last hope for furthering away the extinction of the human race. He was perfect in the wise, old sage role dispelling words of advice to Cooper and Amelia or reciting a classic poem in Do not go gentle into that good night by Dylan Thomas. Hearing him say that throughout the film gave me chills because it was so resonant to the plight of the mission and was a bearing of hope for the astronauts who don't know if they can go on any longer. \nThe rest of the astronauts presented a more subdued performance but makes sense since Cooper and his love for Murph is the emotional core of the film. Everyone had time to shine and a scene to show their character. Romilly had a great scene where he explained how bizarre it is that a few inches of metal are between him and the empty vacuum of space. Amelia was somber as she expressed how love is the only thing that can transcend space and time despite everything that could go wrong around them. Her and Cooper get the worst of it as they become more emotionally distraught. At times, she seems more hopeless than Cooper and you feel sadder all the more for it. TARS (Bill Irwin) were one of the most entertaining aspects of the film. The technologically advanced robot with artificial intelligence guided the astronauts throughout their mission and provided data to them when they see fit. I loved the interactions that TARS had with everyone as it allowed for some great dead pan humor from everyone. You quickly become attached to him even though he is a robot and you kind of wish you had one yourself. He provided some great one liners that broke up the seriousness tone of the film. TARS is easily on the list of the coolest cinematic robots. \nThe special effects were perhaps the greatest I have ever seen on film and it simply could not have been better. You will watch with your mouth aghast, eyes opened and will make you feel like you are eight years old. Event films like these only come around every once in a while and that's exactly what this was. How many films can command sold out IMAX screenings all over America like it's no big deal? It was like watching a moving painting onto the screen and almost like you could go out and grab it yourself. It's an experience that is well worth the high ticket price. For all the press that 3-D gets, it's never really used to its full potential. IMAX on the other hand is used for more dedicated, experienced filmmakers who see past the trivialities of 3-D. IMAX was made for films like these where other screens wouldn't not only diminish the movie but the special effects and the fully immersive viewing experience. If one were to see one film in IMAX, this would be it. It's going to be incredibly hard to top Interstellar in terms of scope and vision on this massive screen.\nThe cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema was gorgeous and it completely transports you into space where space is infinite. You see how large and how far everything is, making the emptiness of space that much more imposing and terrifying. The camera movements were slow and deliberate at times, allowing one to take in the massive landscapes of possibly inhabitable planets. Composer Hans Zimmer once again out did himself with another masterful score to a gorgeous and amazing film. It's not as intense as say The Dark Knight or Inception but is far more emotional and personable. One of my favorite compositions and scenes was when Cooper was leaving to go to space and the countdown went along with him driving tearfully away from Murph who wanted to say goodbye. I believe the title was Stay and was exceptionally beautiful how it translated so well to loss and leaving one behind. The use of pipe organs made for a soundtrack that is different than any other Zimmer has done for Nolan or any other director. It was hypnotic at times as well as subdued to give the dazzling and isolated climate of space a more palpable feeling. But it made the more intense moments an added panache that sucks you in.\nChristopher Nolan knows how powerful and meaningful films can be and how big they can aspire to be. He makes films for viewers who want to see something different on an epically large scale where nothing is as it seems. With Interstellar, he raises the bar on every film he's ever done and presents a film unlike anything else. While I love Inception, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy and The Prestige, Interstellar just feels more important and something that will last longer in the minds than Nolan's past films. With such a deep understanding of the material, he adapts it very well and also adds his usual dramatic flair to shake things up a little bit. He knows how to use ideas such as REM sleep, magic or amnesia into its own entity that no one else would have been able to do so well. He brings out the best out of everyday topics and uses real life theories with his own creativity to make an all-encompassing world unlike anything else. \nThey sure don't make em like this anymore is something that may be heard after leaving a screening of Interstellar. And that person may be right as this is simply a once in a lifetime experience that has to be seen to be believed. This film isn't perfect but what movie really is. I don't comb over a film that is universally loved by many to find some plot points that may be implausible or unproven. Something should be just left as is and the message should be accepted more than whatever theories are thrown about. The science should not be debated ad nauseum but more so the universal will of man and survival that is within us all and what one would do to ensure that they don't become an exciting species. When one obsesses about the science, they miss out on what it's trying to say and where the human race can potentially go for millennia's to come. There is no way to be prepared for something like this and is best to let oneself go, strap yourself in and prepare for the most awe inspiring, beautifully shot, emotionally powerful film one would see all year. I only wish I could erase my mind and become amazed all over again. Not many films have elicited this type of emotion out of me, but then again this isn't an everyday type of movie. Five wormholes out of five.",

            "content": "Interstellar will remain with audiences long after the IMAX door close. It contains three key elements, which make it truly memorable, but also three important elements, which restrict it's appeal. The memorable aspects are as follows: (1) Audience Trust, the director Christopher Nolan gives the audience a galactic amount of scientific jargon to digest and understand as the narrative flows; we the viewers, may not get it all the first time and that is why multiple viewings are recommended; (2) Respecting Sci-Fi Forefathers, Nolan pays due homage to Star Wars (1977, George Lucas) with the droids and Han Solo-esque spaceship acrobatics; the most frequent comparison is 2001: A Space Odyssey (1967, Stanley Kubrick) because the scope, feel, and images contain copious amounts of 2001; (3) Matthew McConaughey, McConaughey imbues his widower NASA pilot Cooper with an everyman pathos; it helps that he never breaks down at critical moments and is always propelled forward by familial love. However, Interstellar may try to imitate 2001: A Space Odyssey in scope, but it falls short in substance.  The following are the film's shortcomings: (1) No Villain, 2001 contained HAL 9000, but Interstellar doesn't contain any antagonist that powerful. There is the Matt Damon character of Dr. Mann who comes closest and should be a storyline developed more fully. Nolan made the character very human (hence his name Hugh Mann), and his faults contain the conflict we the viewers seek and empathize with the most; besides when do you ever get to see Matt Damon break bad? (2) Focus on Outer Space and less on Earth, a third of the film occurs on planet Earth setting up the plot puzzle for the film's climax, but we the viewers get bogged down in earthly drama when (honestly) we all came to look at the stars and the character's interaction among them. (3) Anne Hathaway is the wrong choice for Cooper's astronaut-scientist co-pilot. She looks uncomfortable in the role (word is she almost got hypothermia while filming water scenes in Iceland). As much as Nolan wants her to be, Hathaway is not Charlize Theron (of Mad Max fame); she does not hold that kind of stoicism. Hathaway seems more emotionally fragile when that character she plays should be strong. In the end, Interstellar will gain a larger, cult following over time.  2001: A Space Odyssey gained the same momentum back in the 1960s after the Apollo Moon Missions, Lunar Landings, and Space Station Construction. So, over the decades when NASA and Mars Missions become more active, so will future interest in Interstellar.",

By breaking conventions, this film sucks us in. However, for a movie so scientific, its foundations lie on a sort of Deux-ex-machina where the protagonists are handed their solutions on a silver platter. While the seemingly supernatural phenomena are explained in the story, it only just does so, creating a reason for the audience to detach from the film's believability. In addition, the story falls victim to the writers giving the audience the ending it wants so that the story falls back into the mould of its predecessors and distracts from how truly ingenious the plot is: much like a bitter aftertaste to a great drink. In short, this movie goes above and beyond in many ways: visually stunning, well acted, and thematically deep. However, certain points, though few, hold back the true potential of its ingenuity.",

I would go as far to say that this is one of the films of 2014 that essentially everyone needs to see just for the sake of interpretations. Verdict: A-",

I understood the reason for Dr. Mann's( Matt Damon) betrayal. The scenery in the movie was fantastic as well. I personally loved the way the wormhole looked. Just a clear sphere floating in space with some distortion around it. The inside of the black hole was also amazing.  Overall a really great movie though not perfect.

While Nolan's films often contain confusing elements, Interstellar's twist was beyond baffling and, honestly, stupid.

As the movie progressed It began to capture my attention more and more. I began to ask myself if this was a movie about how the human race could possibly end up and to some extent it was. The movie takes you on a journey through space in a top secret program. Our protagonists leaves behind his whole life in search of something that may not even exist. Stunning images of space, cool technology ,suspenseful scenes envelop the viewer. For science enthusiasts like myself, the movie is thought provoking, many concepts of space time are visualized throughout the movie. Interstellar was imaginative and created an experience that is unique to this movie. Almost three hours long Interstellar is a masterpiece that became a classic the day it was released in theaters.",

            "content": "Nolan reaches for the stars. Bold, beautiful and incredibly ambitious. Interstellar shows director and writer Christopher Nolan's love for space.\n\nWatching Interstellar reminded me of why I love sci-fi and brought me back to the glory days of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But where Kubrick used music and art to incorporated his film, here Nolan used emotion and heart. Nolan's filming and execution were done beautifully throughout this film. This is probably his most inspiring film to date. 2001 wasn't the only film that inspired him; Alien, Blade Runner and Star Wars (1977) all played a part for his inspiration. Now, there's no UFO's or aliens from another planets here. Interstellar is simply mankind racing through the cosmos in order to save the human race. Haters are going to hate and what they are missing out on is how thought-provoking and graciously blended this film is. It's also a visually splendor that captures the soul of our universe. Where Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Gravity showed us the fears of space. Instead, Nolan showed us the search for hope in the cosmos. \n\nShot in glorious IMAX 70 mm, Interstellar is a journey waiting to be ridden and a plot full of surprises, which I will not spoil. We are introduced to earth now as a mere Dust Bowl. In this near future, food and natural resources are at an all time low, while its citizens are starving and choking from this catastrophe. Nolan's first act explores the American farm belt and introduces us to widower Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), former test pilot. Cooper lives with his father-in-law ( John Lithgow) who helps him raise his two kids, Tom (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Murphy (Mackenzie Foy, outstanding). Murph is a rebel and outsider just like her dad because she refuses to believe that the Apollo space landing was a lie. In act two, Cooper and Murph end up finding NASA, but only in smaller form. Here, Cooper meets his former boss Professor Brand (Michael Caine). Professor Brand convinces Cooper to help lead a mission to space in order to find a new world, the Lazarus missions, to colonizes on. Cooper agrees, leaving behind two kids who may never forgive him, but this is where our journey begins. \n\nOn the Endurance, Cooper teams up with astronauts Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Brand's daughter; Romilly (David Gyasi); and Doyle (Wes Bentley). Ex-military robots TARS (voiced by the great Bill Irwin) and CASE also join the crew. TARS and CASE pay homage to a HAL type figure from Kubrick's 2001. This is where Nolan and his crew of specialist set in play the awe moments for the film. From traveling through black holes, to escaping waves the size of skyscrapers, to fighting on the icy scopes of the tundra. Movie lovers alike will simply applauded Nolan and his vision. But this vision couldn't have been completed without the help of his brother and co-writer Jonathan Nolan, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, VFX supervisor Paul J. Franklin and Hans Zimmer's exhilarating score. They all played a part in getting Interstellar to take flight. The thing that I loved most about this film is how realistic is truly was. Like in 2001, Nolan completely silenced anything out in space and incorporates music with it. This gives the film a since of realism and wonder. \n\nNext on the list are black holes, wormholes and the space-time continuum. The final act of the film shows Cooper coming to the realization that his two years in space are 23 years on earth. Cooper watches decades of video messages pour out in front of him from his children now adults (Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain). McConaughey is incredibly moving in this scene and completely breaks down. His performance is raw and will hit you hard in the heart. McConaughey has been on fire over the last couple of years with his tour de force performances in Killer Joe, Mud, Dallas Buyers Club, True Detective, The Wolf of Wall Street and now Interstellar. \n\nThis heartbreaking performance from him will deeply sadden you as you see time with his children slip away in seconds. Chastain and Hathaway also give award worthy roles as a daughter anxious to see her long lost dad again and another daughter wanting to accomplish something for her father. Although, at times, the film's intellect exceed its grasp Nolan always makes you think. Interstellar is never the less visually moving and breathes life into future sci-fi films. In the end, Interstellar is a must-take ride. So join the crew and explore the cosmos through space and time.",

From the questions asked at the beginning to the more questions asked at the end, you are taken on a journey of emotion, exploration and thought-provoking experiences. Starting with a seed and having it slowly grow throughout the film, its a film that really has to be seen by everyone. It's ambitious, visually spectacular, well cast and edge-of-your-seat gripping. Like 2001: A space odyssey before it, its a modern classic of cinema and quite easily one of the best films ever made bar-none and an instant favourite of mine.",

        {
            "content": "Christopher Nolan is something of an outlier in terms of the box office landscape. His success with the Batman franchise and his resulting fame has meant that his original works in the meantime have had an incredible boost while not being exactly what you would call box office draws. Inception has a baffling core premise even without all of the rules and technical babble that goes into actually making the plot move. And Interstellar is probably an even tougher sell, with an apocalyptic vision which doesn't involve the planet exploding around John Cusack and some science that can overwhelm even some of the best minds on the planet. But In Nolan We Trust, and he delivered with a hell of a movie.\n\nWhen Cooper (McConaughey) is offered the chance to save the human race from extinction, he takes it, despite knowing that the consequences may include never seeing his children again.\n\nWhat I'm always impressed by with Nolan's films is how he manages to take an incredibly dense and difficult subject and make us care about it. It's a trick that the best sci-fi creators manage to pull off, and what Nolan and his story team do incredibly well is find a central character to anchor the audience to. We may not completely understand every aspect of entering someone else's dream, but we know that if Leo is upset, we definitely should be too. We may not get every theory surrounding space travel and relativity and gravity and a whole bunch of others, but Nolan and company make sure that we feel every moment of Cooper and Murph's story along the way. And if Murph and Cooper's story was all there was, Interstellar would still be a great film. Their bond, their relationship, the way their story moves is so real and powerful that it pulls us through any hurdle in the narrative around them. But Nolan has more on his mind than that, and he tackles both the end of the world and a journey through outer space before the film is over. It's a huge undertaking and it fits the Nolan kind of ethos that he's not satisfied with just doing one thing. The way that the stories come together is probably the only bump in the film's story, and it only really comes at the end. But in the meantime, Nolan and his crew create a story that is surprising, compelling, clever and hugely ambitious as well as making time for some truly iconic moments along the way. That's the kind of movie that auteurs dream of putting together and it's more of a tribute to Nolan's constant stream of quality than the actual quality of the film itself that the critical reaction has been a little less overwhelmingly positive than some of his previous efforts.\n\nAs with the majority of Nolan's films, his lead male role is one that requires depth and range and charisma all at once, and Matthew McConaughey may be his best leading man yet. That's a big call when the comparisons are Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Guy Pearce among others, but it'd be a tough debate regardless of the eventual decision. Cooper is a salt-of-the-earth kind of guy living in one of the worst periods in human history. The planet is dying and he's stuck in a field that he doesn't understand and hates to be in, hemmed in by the fact that the human race has stopped trying to achieve and is fighting just to survive. So when he's given the chance to do something great, it's an offer that tears him in two, as he'd be leaving his children and home to follow the dreams that may not actually accomplish anything in the long run. McConaughey is incredible in showing that divide between father and visionary, and it's amazing that a blockbuster like this calls for the kind of range that McConaughey provides. There is a scene around the middle of the film which is emotional gut-punch and it's probably the most believable that McConaughey has been in his entire career, and it's amazing to see just how raw and powerful he can be. But he's not alone in the film, and the other central player is Jessica Chastain's Murph. Chastain takes over the role from Mackenzie Foy who plays her younger self, and Foy is a revelation unto herself in the role. But it's Chastain who makes the role so powerful. She is a tortured soul throughout the mid-section of the film and she finds fascinating nuance to show the glimpses of the pain that she's internalised so well. And when that wall gives way in the later sections, she absolutely delivers there as well, showing emotion every bit as raw as her onscreen dad. Chastain was in A Most Violent Year delivering an incredible performance there, and there aren't all that many performers that would be able to come through with two performances like those in their careers, much less in the space of a year. There are a number of other performers which contribute in huge way to the film, and Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine make another great father-daughter combination for the film, each of them leaving their mark in their own way.\n\nNolan has made a lot of the idea of using film over digital, and even though it's a debate that I don't think has a definite answer, it's easy to see the advantages of shooting this thing in Imax. There is a feeling of weight and scope here that is probably a combination of the actual film and the way that Nolan puts it together with Nolan newbie Hoyte van Hoytema that makes the entire proceeding feel like it's on a different level to the other film's competing with it at the box office. It's a huge film and it feels like it as well. It's a very rare find to have a director who can nail the emotion of Cooper and Murph, stage a thrilling action sequence like the one on the water planet and work with visual effects in the way the Nolan does. There is shot early on in the space travel section of the film where we find out exactly what Cooper listens to in his headphones, and it's probably the best single shot of the film, as it combines exactly the idea of the huge scope of space and the close look the film takes at the emotional journey in the film. It actually may sum up Nolan's approach to film in general, as he takes huge concepts and makes them matter to us on a level we can relate to.\n\nInterstellar may not be perfect, and the naysayers will find plenty of similar things to jump on the way they do for every new Nolan film, but there aren't too many filmmakers operating on the same kind of scale, or even thinking on it, that Christopher Nolan is, and for that I have nothing but praise for him.\n\nDefining Scene:\nThe water planet is an incredible detour, but the failed airlock followed by Cooper having to dock with the destroyed remains of their ship to get home is the topper for me.",

            "content": "Interstellar is a wholly original, challenging and enthralling film. Though because of it's length (nearly three hours) and ambition a lot of audiences will get up and walk out of the theater and say \"well that was long.\" Well, if that's the case then it's their loss.\n\nChristopher Nolan is an intelligent filmmaker. His films are frequently challenging and his style is technically innovative, slick and he always manages to bring something new to the table. Whether it's superheroes, magicians or tattooed men with short term memory loss, the material is elevated and sculpted to his own vision. However, he is often criticized as a \"cold\" or \"unimaginative\" filmmaker, whose characters lack depth and exist purely to deliver expository monologues. His latest film might finally silence those objections once and for all. Interstellar is a sign that this filmmaker is becoming more and more ambitious, one who is challenging himself to grow with each film.\n\nInterstellar might have space ships, interplanetary travel, space jargon and the fate of a planet against incredible odds, but it's not science fiction, it's closer to science faction. Working with his frequent collaborator (and brother) Jonathan Nolan, they've crafted a script that is character driven, wildly aspiring and authentically original. The story is equally complex and deceptively simple. The planet is in danger, and food is in short supply.\nThe future isn't the Orwellian Dystopia we are accustomed to seeing or rainy urban cityscapes, nor are there any roving biker gangs. Nolan's future will remind the viewer of The Grapes of Wrath more than anything. The contrast of the setting is reflected by Matthew McConaughey who delivers another stellar (not a pun) performance, playing a farmer named Cooper whose face alone speaks volumes. Anne Hathaway is steady and convincing and Nolan regular Michael Caine is great as always. The equally compelling compliment to Mcconaughey is the character of his daughter Murph. \"Character\" is a choice of word seeing as she's played by both the incomparable Jessica Chastain and the brimming young talent of Mackenzie Foy, whose future stardom shouldn't come as a surprise but an expectation.\n\nNolan, whose work on the Batman pictures illustrated the dark knight as a frustrated anti-hero carves a new kind of hero out of Cooper. He's a blue-collar hero, an everyman who's called to the frontlines to save the world. A man with a rebellious nature and unorthodox tactics add to his charm, so he's easy to like in the best sense. The world is in peril and the journey to save the planet introduces us to the metaphysical supporting character, space itself.\nEver the perfectionist writer and director, Nolan worked closely with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. Together they devoted substantial time to accurately generate imagery to bring the phenomena of a black hole and the travelling through it to life. The complicated nature of astrophysics are not dumbed down and yet they aren't reduced to layman's terms either. The visual effects are jaw dropping as expected, the journey of interstellar travel plays out with stunning clarity and precision. Celestial bodies are expansive and tangible and despite our limited  knowledge of what otherworldly habitats feel like, the settings in Interstellar feel plausible. The sound editing is another commendable characteristic throughout. Omitting typical sound effects when ships board or engage airlocks and occasionally explode, we as the viewers only see what happens. Emphasizing the lonely, terrifying vastness that is outer space.\n\nThe common criticisms of Christopher Nolan's films; they don't have developed characters, said characters are usually cold and unfeeling. Most commonly criticized was his handling of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character in Inception, the \"go to\" character with the sole purpose of exposition. Of course, there is some exposition in Interstellar, but thank god for that because we're talking about theoretical physics and space travel. Informing the characters, as well as informing the audience is a part of moviemaking. If people want to make that criticism about Nolan the same could be said for James Cameron's The Terminator, the explanation of time travel in Back to the Future, or the wedding at start of The Godfather when Michael Corleone tells Kay about the \"family business\". The exposition here is strategic, useful and important in the development of the film.\nSome odd sentimentality comes through over the course of the journey and feels either forced or out of place, particularly a speech delivered by Hathaway, where she defends the next step of their mission by rationalizing it because of love. It was an \"against all odds\" moment in the story but its handling feels clumsy. The resolution is surprisingly sentimental and has more in common with the finale of Robert Zemeckis's Contact than Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: a Space Odyssey, which seems to be the film that comes up the most as far as comparisons go. Although there are few complaints, the development of the first act seems rushed and too convenient to be true, but the film's resolution will satisfy any doubts you might have in the typical Nolan style revealing finale.\n\nWhen I mentioned that Christopher Nolan is a smart filmmaker it didn't mean he's a filmmaker that's also smart, but the he's smart regarding the actual filmmaking process. That's not exactly a revelation but an observation on his craft as an artist and an entertainer. Interstellar is easily the most character driven, humanized story he's committed to film. The picture's overall message of love and preservation may seem a bit obvious but it's also something we as viewers can relate to in one way or another. The problems of the world are also the problems of the people, down to each individual and the responsibility that bears can have a larger than life effect.\nThe running time might seem daunting to some, but there's enough meat on the bones for all to enjoy and your appetite for adventure, danger and emotion will be satisfied one way or another. Nolan conveys a universal message that is socially important and has substance and pulls it off with enough grace and ease that it avoids the trappings of familiarity. He is an intelligent filmmaker who has never appealed to the common denominator and probably never will. He's not afraid to challenge his audience with complex storylines and narrative constructs. If his movie reaches the smartest person in the audience, his film is a success.\n\nHe seems to have outdone himself with Interstellar, as is the case with his previous efforts to date, every entry in his filmography outdoes its predecessor. So that just leaves us with eager anticipation and a good experience to reminisce upon until the home video release.\nThe running time might seem daunting to some, but there's enough meat on the bones for all to enjoy and your appetite for adventure, danger and emotion will be satisfied one way or another.

If you let you go without trying to find sense to all the complicate science, you will find yourself immerse in this amazing journey.  One last note, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is breathtaking.",

But it never happened. Instead, it held firmly to the genre it belongs to and maintained that there is always a natural explanation, even when events seem to be supernatural. This was a welcomed approach (regardless of there being some liberties with the physics of blackhole/wormhole travel). I daresay Carl Sagan would have loved this movie.\n\nI only take half a star for some of the dialog being uninspired in the beginning, and for the scene where the young Murph gets invited into NASA and then wants to take a nap (after being so passionate about it that she'd punched a classmate earlier in the day?).\n\nOverall this movie was a fantastic piece of sci fi that will not soon be forgotten.

Not only is the Science Fiction genre something that I have a special affinity for, but the movie also happens to elicit very divisive opinions among critics and cinephiles alike -- all of which would normally inspire me into a drawn-out diatribe against my naysayers. In the name of brevity and for the sake of staving off my inevitable carpal tunnel, however, I'm going to try to be very simple and short here. Alas, I may have already failed in that aim with this lengthy justification. Anyways...\n\nPretty much everyone agrees that this is a beautiful film to look at. Stunning cinematography abounds and director Christopher Nolan continues to up the ante here in terms of his usually very strong shot composition and visual style. The stark visions of his far-off planetary vistas, as well as his treatment of an almost \"alien\" Earth -- a veritable dustbowl characterizing most of the surface -- make for dramatic, constantly-chaotic settings for these characters to inhabit, and provide nothing short of visual poetry. \n\nIn terms of visual presentation and design, the only drawback would be in the film's representation of wormhole travel itself. While in keeping with the space epic's more grounded tone and possibly adding to its scientific accuracy, these subtle images of a spacecraft's interstellar journey lack imagination and creativity, and do very little to hype up the audience for the staggering leaps these astronauts are accomplishing in the name of humanity (though don't get me wrong, the tension and emotional build-up take up this task quite well). This may be an old- fashioned consideration indicative of someone with Star Trek-ian/Wars-ian jumps through hyperspace in mind, but this IS a space epic after all. \n\nA space epic, indeed. Truthfully, Nolan does very little to hide his influence from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey on this production. His flattering homages to that 1968 classic can be seen in some of the more philosophical and theoretical aspects of the film. One of the more surprising examples of this influence though can been seen in the character of TARS, the intrepid crew's A.I. member. While admittedly a far more likable character than the HAL 9000 (TARS is programmed with one of the best bedside manners of any robot in all of Science Fiction), his obvious stylistic similarities to the former instills a certain amount of mystery and even dread in the audience. He sort of looks like the monolith from 2001 except with a digital interface and blocky appendages that break forth from his flat, rectangular form to allow his movement. TARS is one of the most likable aspects of the film, both in terms of his characterization and fascinating design.\n\nThe cast is brilliant. Matthew McConaughey is a terrific lead, and he endues a pitch-perfect amount of emotional honesty as the father who's trying to save the world, all the while knowing that every minute he spends away from his family makes his reunion with them less and less likely. Anne Hathaway is good overall, but has a couple of stilted monologues that try too hard to mesh emotional considerations with scientific ones. Nolan seems to be saying \"See. I can do emotion. Look here at this scientist who all of the sudden is trying to NOT sound cold and heartless.\" The result is rather forced to say the least. All-in-all, the rest of the ensemble gets nothing but thumbs up from me -- including an interesting, supporting turn by Matt Damon.\n\nOkay, now to the ending. Unfortunately, the last third of the movie kind of falls short for me. The plot takes a turn that, while not completely unforeseen, dispenses what has, up through the first two acts, been a very grounded reality, in favor of something rather hard to believe.  I don't mind the heady concepts involved in this climax. Under normal circumstances, I would welcome such an intriguing, metaphysical concept in my Science Fiction, however, this just doesn't jive with the seemingly grounded reality previously established in the film.\n\nOverall, it's a very entertaining film. Nolan gives the audience so much to chew on that the three-hour runtime almost whizzes by. This is certainly one of those movies you'd pop in to either test or show off the picture quality of your HD TV. It's kind of like Gravity, quite honestly.\n\nThat's it. I have to be done now. Sorry it went this long. Jeez!",

The movie is almost three hours long, and it truly feels it. The film feels like six different films, some good, some bad and .some merely average. I'm happy that it exists, it's a big scifi extravaganza, the type they don't really make anymore. Still, there's no denying that it's kind of a big bloated mess.

It has an incredible score that plays throughout essentially the entire movie, beautiful visuals, an interesting and captivating plot, great acting, great character and setting development, a heavy reliance on suspended disbelief, and enormously huge plot holes. Some people don't mind them but I have trouble with plot holes so big that they actively go against what has already been established in the story arc. Forewarning, the following sentences will contain SPOILERS that are as big as the plot holes they discuss. Now I won't get into the details on every single little plot hole and inconsistency because this review would become way too long. I will, however, touch on the two biggest ones, in my opinion, and both have to do with the conclusion of the movie so again, you've been warned. The first is the complete and total fail that is the time paradox proposed in this film, more specifically the 'bootstrap' paradox. This is based on the concept that critical content that the futures hinges on is actually acquired from the future itself. Of course, this theory is a farce but unfortunately many science fiction stories rely on it as its foundation. Theoretical physicists will disagree but they're just manufacturing job security (i.e. they're liars). I won't go into too much detail on the various examples of this paradox in the film but if you see it, it'll be painfully obvious which instances I'm referring to, as they point them out for you. The second fail is the inconsistency of time relativity, as they introduce it in the movie itself. It makes sense throughout most of the film... until the end, when Anne Hathaway somehow doesn't age. Nolan apologists will fabricate arguments to defend this or make excuses, just like they did in Inception, but the reality is that Nolan blew it here. She should've aged 51 years or more just like the rest of the people (outside of Matthew McConaughey, who was sucked into a black hole and of course survived). I mainly focused on the negatives with this review because those few negatives are what held the movie back from a perfect rating. If Nolan would've gotten out of his own way, this could've been one of my favorite science fiction films ever. Unfortunately, it was pushed back to the \"really good but not great\" category where so many other films reside.",

            "content": "Interstellar sucks and Christopher Nolan is slowly going down the path of bad directors/writers. Now the first half of this movie was actually not that bad. It introduced us to a very different problem that planet Earth is facing and for the most part it made sense. But as soon as Coop and his crew go through the wormhole the plot goes into a controlled spiral of bullcrap where things \"make sense\" but at the same time it still leaves you confused and I was REALLY confused by the end of this movie. It's rare that I ever get confused when I'm watching a movie. There is a point in Interstellar where Coop and Brand go onto a planet where an hour there is seven years everywhere else or some crap like that. And they get back to their craft and their team member is an old man by that time and even though this made sense it felt so unnecessary to even add that to the story where it wasn't even needed and even if it was needed that created a huge plot hole: See Coops daughter is at least 11 or something when he left Earth right? And they say that mankind's time left on Earth is limited. And this movie expects me to believe that it's been at least seven OR MORE years since they left and they still have time left to save the people on Earth? How much time did they have again? As much time as the script calls for I guess... If you are a fan of Matt Damon I would recommend that you not see this movie to save yourself from destroying his good image from your mind. Because Matt Damon is in this and he plays the most annoying and stupid character ever: \"Dr Mann\". Every word that comes out from this guys mouth makes me want to punch him in the face, rip out his vocal chords and toss them and his body into the sun. Because when we initially meet this guy he's been in hyper sleep for years in order to avoid aging too much. And when he wakes up he's actually quite tolerable. But as soon as he steps outside and takes his walk with Coop he doesn't shut up for even a minute and he's just throwing out all the stuff that Nolan wanted us to understand throughout the entire movie even though we got it right after Brand said it: \"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.\" HOLY CRAP I GET IT LOVE LOVE LOVE! Who cares? I mean do we really need to keep saying it over and over and over again? NO! You say it once and then shut your mouth. The thing I hate about Interstellar the most though is this: When Coop goes into the Black-Hole and starts communicating with his daughter using morse code. The robot TARS asks this conveniently placed question to try and explain as they're communicating with Coops daughter: \"Who put this place here?\", asked TARS, \"WE PUT THIS HERE! MANKIND PUT THIS HERE! WE MUST HAVE BUILT THIS IN THE FUTURE!\" says Coop. And all I have to say to that is this: HOW THE HELL DID YOU COME TO THAT CONCLUSION!? What evidence do you have that could possibly back that statement up? You said so yourself earlier in the movie that you need evidence to back these kinds of things up. You are a scientist so come up with a real scientific explanation. It doesn't matter that line of the movie \"explains the movie\" because it does't explain anything it just wants to distract us from the fact that Christopher Nolan and his brother were being lazy writers this time around. There's not much to like about this movie. And what little there is to like is blotted out by all the bad stuff. I mean one thing I liked about this movie is the message that they were trying to say to us: \"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.\" And that was a really good thing to say, but I felt that it was too obvious in the way that they stated it and they repeated this to us way too many times. And to Christopher Nolan if you ever read this don't just throw stupid lines in that are meant to explain things and do not expect me to just roll with it. Because the fact that you expect me to just swallow whatever crap you shove down my throat makes me not want to see your stupid, long movies anymore. I am dreading whatever crap-fest is coming from Nolan next. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It'll cause a headache and it's not worth your time.",

So four film fusion into something that I mostly enjoyed?\n\nI've gone back and forth between giving 3 or 4 stars and, as you see, have met myself halfway. It takes awhile for it to get started so if you don't have the patience or aren't in the right frame of mind the first 90 minutes are going to make you antsy. I didn't have a problem with it and the film had a nice tendency to either switch perspectives or get a little more exciting right as I was starting to think to myself that nothing too much was happening. Points for that.\n\nI won't be the person who can explain all the theoretical physics etc. but the film looked and felt real enough to me. The state of the Earth seemed very believable and everything looked just familiar enough with that dash of unfamiliarity to make it easy to relate too while at the same time making it identifiable as the future. I liked that we checked in on Earth - though if we hadn't I hesitate to think about how the pacing would have gone.\n\nOverall I enjoyed myself. The music was awesome but got a bit overpowering in a 2001 sort of way at bits but, again, I wasn't too horribly bothered. Definitely would be up to watching this again.",

I do like the idea and concept behind it, but the execution is a C+, maybe B-.\n\nWhile I appreciate its focus and plot never wanders from exploration and thus, we are not introduced to some supernatural force or being, the script does not evolve enough to be truly thought provoking.  Or excitedly entertaining.  In essence, it does get lost in the middle of; does this want to be more of an action film?  Or  a philosophical dialogue?  Or science fiction?  Ultimately it tries to be all 3 and does not wholly succeed.  For instance, the numerous scenes of Cooper sitting on his deck with a beer waxing poetic get very redundant, including the final one on his \"new\" deck.\n\nLastly, the film's final act does become convoluted and weighed down.  Also, as a couple of reviews have pointed out, vastly unbelievable even if you are suspending said belief in the first place.  It somehow becomes too simplistic but confusing at the same time.\n\nI will give it three stars for some of the \"action\" scenes, most of the cinematography though even that could have been better with the grand scale the producers thought they were on, and also the acting for the most part, though some of the dialogue is very forced.  Not a bad film but certainly not a very good one either.  And at that run time, not one I'll be watching again any time soon.",

Ironically, but also unsurprisingly, farmers have become figures of great importance. \nFamine has hit Earth with little chance of recovery, and future generations are doomed to starvation, eventually leading to suffocation and finally - extinction. \nOn one of these very important farms we find Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) - a former NASA pilot raising 2 children (Tom and Murph) - in the middle of a dust bowl during what seems to be the twilight years of life on Earth.\n\tOn a drive back to their farm, they spot a government surveillance drone flying over their property, and Cooper manages to down it and salvage it for parts. However, the questioned remained- where was the drone going?\n\tThat question ultimately leads them to an answer- an underground under cover NASA base in the middle of absolute nowhere. Oddly enough, it was a gravitational anomaly that lead Cooper and Murph to NASA, where an even greater mission was about to take place - with many, many more questions were about to be answered.\nTo keep a long 2-hour and 45-minute story short. Cooper- the former pilot - is given the task to lead the expedition for a new home planet outside of our galaxy and into unexplored space. \nUnfortunately, their spacecraft can't make a quick jump to \"hyperspace\". However, their mission involves going head first through a wormhole to explore 3 new planets in the hope of saving the human race.\nA few things to keep in mind: time and space is pushed beyond all limits we ever thought were possible.

            "content": "Having stayed behind on Earth for the far superior Contact, it's nice to watch McConaughey finally go for ride in Nolan's 165 million dollar NASA recruitment film. The film rests completely on the very capable shoulders of McConaughey and his ability to wring genuine emotion out of even the worst of the dialogue in this movie. If you're not a fan of his Lincoln Mercury car commercials, than it would be best if you sit this one out, since this movie is pretty much a one-man show. The charismatic single-mindedness that made you believe he could win that impossible case way back in Time to Kill is what carries the audience across the time, space, black holes, singularities, and strange dimensions that exist behind bookshelves, without it being too much of a drag.\n\nCertainly Nolan's visual imagination also helps, but the galactic canvas that we witness in this film somehow comes up short when compared to similar films like Contact, 2001, and 2010. The color palette for this film is quite sparse, never much deviating from shades of grey and white on the both the surfer's paradise planet with the gargantuan waves, and later the ice plant the Klingons will eventually settle as Rura Penthe. Nolan use of color in this film rarely deviates from the cold, B&W photography that makes up our own real-life astronomy. Chastain, bless her, does the best she can with what she has. She manages to bring the only genuine humanity to this film, offering effective opposition to the zealot-like optimism of her father.\n\nThe rest of the cast, surprisingly are on absolute auto-pilot, almost as if showing up purely as a favor to Nolan. Even Cain seems to be phoning it in, remembering his much better role in Children of Men. The stunt-casting in the movie calls allot of attention to itself, sometime for the better (as in Lithgow, a genre fav from 2010) and sometimes for the worst (when they unzipped Dr.Mann and I saw it was Matt Damon, I seriously broke out in derisive laughter). Poor Anne Hathaway is saddled with what is the worst monologue on the power and meaning of love I've heard in a looong time.\n\nCompared to Inception, Dark Knight, and Memento, this movie definitely rests closer to the bottom for Nolan. It's got the same problem as Dark Knight Rises with an ending that goes a few beats too far and seemingly rational man doing irrational things, all to be with Anne Hathaway. I know she's hot, but seriously, come on. The movie should have ended on Chastain and brought the drama home to her, but the last 15 minutes all feel like deleted scenes material from a special edition bluray. Instead of keeping it classy like Kubrick with an ambiguous ending, we get McConaughey stealing a Viper from some cast-off sets from Enemy Mine and jetting off into the cosmos. This after hanging out and drinking some beer with his old robot pal. Was all that really necessary? It's a good movie, one that entertains thanks to McConaughey and a nice B-plot with Chastain but dial back your expectations from \"movie of the year\" and comparisons to 2001.",

            "content": "Human relationships amid the complex world of Astronomy and Quantum Physics. Well I must be mad about science!\n\nHere's my take on INTERSTELLAR.\n\nAfter months of zeal and tremendous patience, Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" has finally conquered the screens; bearing the promise to test the uncharted horizons of space and time.\n\nThis futuristic sci-fi flick deals with the outer space exploration in search of mankind's next potent habitat after Earth's imminent apocalypse. Thus, it ignites the idea of an interstellar travel which in turn makes this young lad extremely appreciate the marvels of science.\n\nI'm a sucker for space films (talk about 2001: A Space Odyssey / Gravity / Apollo 13 / The Right Stuff to name a few) and \"Interstellar\" fits right in to the core of its infinite realms.\n\nTwo major things that create huge relevance and add solid layers to its outwardly complex storytelling- (1) its bold and casual way of explaining scientific and mathematical studies as if we've understood them our whole life and (2) its harmony with human emotions (they can even talk about love by not sounding too tawdry!). Thanks to Nolan and his team for making both aspects work for 169 minutes.\n\nI may not say that it is a great ensemble given the fact that some roles are underutilized. However, I do love how its three leads (Matthew McConaughey / Anne Hathaway/ and Jessica Chastain) and its select support (Michael Caine, Mackenzie Foy and Matt Damon) channel the message to their audience with the right amount of subdued characterization.\n\nIt's been a wise decision to witness its awesome visuals via IMAX 70mm film projection. Nolan has been an advocate of shooting his project with IMAX cameras and film rolls for its real worth. Hans Zimmer's score offers a new level of cinematic musicality (though sometimes sound mixing has ruined some dialogues). The surreal feeling of being into space has been heightened during its moments of silence. In return, my senses dictate as if I'm part of the grand scale.\n\nQuestions of great depth about the film are underway. Plot holes are being scrutinized. But in its truest form of entertainment, I believe it has served its purpose that well. The ride may be turbulent but it's all worth the wait.\n\nThis may not be the best Nolan film (keeping \"Memento\" on its top spot) but it conveys a whole new perspective about the relative existence of galaxy far beyond one's imagination. Pretty ambitious yet truly substantial.\n\nWormhole. Fifth dimension. Murphy's Law. 4.5/5 folks.",

            "content": "INTERSTELLAR is one for the ages. I like complex science films like Nolan's INCEPTION film but this one takes the cake for being original, intriguing and downright sad while maintaining hope for humanity. Matthew McConaughey is truly spectacular in this film as an ex NASA pilot turned farmer with two kids. He is a master at the craft of acting, this guy who burst onto the screens as the guy who says the now famous \"alright alright alright\" film quote from DAZED AND CONFUSED dazzles in this film.\n\nThe movie deals with a sort of complex narrative dealing with recently discovered new planets beyond our galaxy. Past NASA explorers found them in their journey but didn't make it back. The crops keep dying each year leaving farmers with no crops to make profit, leaving small hope for humanity. Enter ex NASA pilot Cooper (McConaughey) he finds a very secret NASA base thanks to coordinates he decrypted from his daughter Murph's bedroom (played by Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy). There he meets Professor Brand played by Michael Caine and his daughter Brand (played by Anne Hathaway) who essentially tell Coop to go on this mission to record as much data as he can from the newly discovered planets and come back in time to save humanity. He is told that he may not be back for two or more years and the scene where he has to break it to his daughter is heartbreaking. There is a twist to this mission, a very deceitful twist that ruins many lives but ruins Coop's life the most. I wouldn't call the film depressing but it is sad in a hopeful way. I like the on board robots that ride along the pilots to navigate them and to give them very useful information kind of like HAL in 2001. The robots named CASE and TARS also serve as the robot in individual space ship flying ALA R2-D2.\n\nThe questions that the film evokes are thoughtful enough to make us wonder what the future holds for humanity. There are times when I stumble on online or newspaper articles with headlines reading \"scientists find water on new planet\" or \"new planet discovered?\" Hell, even rich people have already paid for the first seats aboard a space shuttle that will take them to a new planet once it is possible, even though it is years and years far from happening. There are possibilities out there that maybe one day we will see what INTERSTELLAR already displays in this great film. The acting is SUPERB from the whole cast but am really impressed with McConaughey, I will never forget his performance as Cooper. To end this review I will say that as a film buff/movie goer there are rare times that I tear up when seeing a film, not actually bawl but just tear up. This film builds up to the possibility of Coop not ever seeing his kids again...ever, once the film gets to the point and Coop is able to see messages of his kids, I literally cried as if one of my family members died. It was emotionally powerful that it felt like an emotional gut punch and it was even more realistically heightened by McConaughey's performance. I loved this movie.",

            "content": "Visually, Christopher Nolan's 2014 sci-fi is a treat, but the story is a let down, especially in the final half hour when it descends into the completely nonsensical.\nSet in a future where the last generations of Earth are plagued by giant dust clouds and limited to farming labour just to keep the food chain going, a former pilot (Matthew McConaughey) stumbles by chance on a NASA base and the small group of scientists jump at the chance to tell him that Earth's days are numbered and they want him to lead a mission to find another planet on the other side of a wormhole capable of harbouring human life.\nThere's some dramatic moments when McConaughey has to say goodbye to his kids before heading out into the great void of the universe, but the scenes feel quite rushed.\nThe scenes in space are brilliantly realised, especially the journey into and through the black hole and the universe on the other side, consisting of phantom time zones, a planet formed entirely of ice and another where water covers the entire surface and giant tidal waves prevent any chance of life settling.\nIt's after the discovery of these uninhabitable planets that the film completely loses it's way. Taking us away from the meat of the story and the intergalactic space voyage in favour of following McConaughey's now grown up daughter (played by Jessica Chastain), now working for NASA and generally acting like a bit of a bitch due to her \"daddy issues\".\nThe 2001 (A Space Odyssey) inspired finale then goes off the scale, treating science as mere folly as it presents a moral that we should all trust in love and let it be our guide. Either that or NASA can't be trusted.\nIt's unfortunate that story descends into incredulity, the visual effects and production values, like Christopher Nolan's previous movies, cannot be faulted and some of the scenes are very well realised. Perhaps it's ironic that a film about black holes should have so many plot holes, as well as being so long that you may also feel that decades have passed while you were watching.",

I think the part I enjoyed most is that at the heart of it all, it's a father-daughter story.  Jessica Chastain gives such a moving performance as the grown up Murph.

It felt like 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact which means it's not a Hollywood shoot-em-up blockbuster so much as a meditation on today's hot science topics, paternal love and secular philosophy which is the stuff of great science fiction in my opinion.\nThe science is mostly legitimate, as an expert on relativity theory was consulted and even produced the movie. Check out the many videos online regarding the science of Interstellar, where Dr Tyson chimes in nicely there.\nThe plot's fulcrum is where sentiment replaces science fiction. It goes the way of Contact, and if you've ever seen Contact, you'll know what I'm talking about: It wrings out emotion on the micro scale of the relationship between father and daughter when in my opinion it could and should be doing something much more epic. So if you want a bro hang with some smarts, it falls on it's face because at its core it's basically a tear jerker. They marketed it right because you get that melancholic feeling in the trailers. \nI watch it on my own, because I have a daughter and I get it. The plot borrows from that famous Star Trek The Next Generation episode called \"The Inner Light\" (the one where Picard plays the penny flute and lives a lifetime in twenty minutes.) That much smaller piece of sci-fi writing is more effectively emotive, but Interstellar does spectacle and science very well and for that, I give it three and a half stars our of five.",

I used to think the journey would never end and that the destination better be really rewarding to make the trip worth it....it always was then and it was too at the beautiful ending of this great film.

            "content": "I find it funny how Christopher Nolan said in one way or another that he dislikes blockbuster films, and yet, that is all he has ever made, however there is one thing that can always be said, he puts a hell of a lot of effort into whatever he does and takes risks. 'Interstellar', even if you like nothing else about it, is a deniably very unique experience. If I needed more of a reason to hate 'Gravity',  this film serves up nicely as this film has what that film sorely lacked, characters to give a damn about, a good story- or just a story in general and spectacular special effects.\n\nI remember reading a lot about the cast for this film with one specific cast member they didn't want to spoil and I thought the actress who played old Murph was that person but I don't that was it, however, this cast does have some nice surprises and is excellently chosen. Seeing David Oyelowo in a small role was weird though, thought he'd have come back into play a little later on, but nope. If this story didn't have Cooper and Murph, there would be very little to care about as all the other characters are poorly written at best. I really couldn't care about Anne Hathaway's character because her motivation changes on a dime and her performance wasn't good enough to try to save it.  David Gyasi did a good job and I would have liked to have seen him in Hathaway's role instead and the other guy in the film had a stupidly written exit, it was his own fault as he was standing outside the craft for too long. The other actors were a nice surprise, which I won't spoil and I was surprised it wasn't Michael Caine as the grandfather and the actor who plays Cooper's son when he is older looks like he is trying to do a Jesse Pinkman impression. People were talking about Matthew McCounaghey getting another Oscar nomination for this and I can see why, the scene where he looks at messages from his family and starts to cry was a powerful moment in particular and he does an excellent job overall. The ending as well when he ends up where he is and starts to shout and cry again. Some might think that he was only in this because he won an Oscar previously but they were filming this long before that. Young Murph, who reminds me of a young Claire Danes, does an excellent job as well and her relationship with Cooper is really believable and seeing her throw that watch made me sad, I just wished she picked it up right there and then, it was an excellent moment. However, she also looks a little like Anne Hathaway as well and I wondered if that was going to be a plot point of some kind, but no, it's much different. TARS was a very nice addition, besides being a horribly designed walking fridge, he was funny and could do a surprising amount of things, I did find it odd that he spoke at first, reminded me of Lego, which is funny because the space station's thrusters reminded me of Lego as well, which is an apt comparison because whenever ships attached to the space station, it looked like models. \n\nEverything about the films craft is excellent. The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding, Zimmer was asked to create something unique and he has done that and all without reading the script, it's incredible. I knew Desplat was going to win the Oscar but if anyone else deserved it, it was Zimmer. It's powerful, awe-inspiring and totally unforgettable, it just adds so much to the film. I have very easily listened to its tracks on an hour loop, however, in the film, sometimes it was so loud I couldn't hear what some people were saying and at  some parts it seemed like it was so loud that it was even overbearing itself. The fact this film got a nomination for its sound mixing is weird, but hey, let's not knock what it did get nominated for because it was already robbed enough as it is. The visual effects were perfect and even without the 3D they had me on the edge of my seat, something that 'Gravity' wishes it could have done. The scene where Cooper falls into where he does at the end was quite terrifying, thinking that he would be stuck in a place with what looked like support beams for the rest of eternity was hard to watch but it all worked itself out before long and I don't care if my ship told me to eject, there is no way I'd do that in the emptiness of space all alone. The cinematography was excellent as well and very vivid, both on Earth and in space, even though sometimes around the house it had darkened areas around the corner of its lens, but I am nitpicking at this point. I also really liked the design of the suits, as well as Mann's. The film had smart transitions and I liked the wormhole explanation, even if 'Event Horizon' had done it. Before watching, I thought the surprise of seeing an old Murph would have been an accident caused by Cooper going through a wormhole but the way it plays out is still sad, even if they left the first planet too fast in a way that it felt like it just existed for that purpose. And I know it's a real poem but it made me laugh that it had 'rage' and 'dying of the light' in it as those were two of Nicolas Cage's films in 2014.\n\nThis film has a perfect build up and the first 40 minutes are on Earth, some feel that is too long of a time but it works excellently as we get to learn about our characters, even if I didn't think the writing in this film wasn't particularly subtle. And honestly, the biggest problem I have with this film is its writing. When I hear characters talking about, 'we need to adapt', and, 'repopulate', I felt like I was being bashed over the head with its theme and that was only after a few minutes, which, okay, might be a tad coincidental but when I read before the film that Cooper's daughter was called 'Murph' I was already rolling my eyes. I'm glad that they bring that fact up in the film though and even though there is an explanation for it, again, it didn't feel subtle. It was also weird to see him hijack something at the start and dismantle something that wasn't his, regardless of whether or not it's abandoned. Also, we see a little glimpse of his life before, in a dream he has, but we really don't know anything else about that part in particular. I didn't really like the ending either, the whole solution to the big issue is very cheesy and wraps up a bit too nicely, whilst taking place in a very Inception-y looking place. The ending just relies on a very overdone and silly theme that is so bad it verges on re-write territory, earlier in the film someone mentions something about love and Cooper pretty much shuts that down, which was good but to have it rely so much on that near the end is bad. It wasn't awful but for how serious and scientific the rest of the film was, looking back on the ending, the film should have been changed a little as it conflicts with itself. It also seemed like the film finally got back to its premise the closer to the end it got because it seemed like someway in the middle it forgot what its whole point was. They should have made Cooper just a single father with a daughter because I didn't even know his character had a son until the film started, all I heard about going in was Murph and all he went on about in the film was her, he had a clear favourite, it seems. Saying that, it was heartbreaking to see him lift up those covers in the truck again and not see her underneath, but it does go back to the old saying, 'daddy's little girl', but still, it's strange. The naming of the character 'Mann' wasn't particularly subtle either, it did make me laugh though that whenever they tried to tell Mann to stop; it cut them off mid sentence. This film has quite a few, very smart, twists which all add layers to the film, however, once again, I really feel like the ending was someone just writing down techno-babble, whilst working in the cheese,  on the page and just sort of expected the audience to just accept it and go, 'yes... Okay I get it'. I know they had a scientific advisor on this film with set guidelines on what to do but this is all science fiction, it really is. It has its moments in there but the longer everything goes on, it's all fantasy, I mean, there is no way a ship could attach to an out of control space station and that's not even the worst of it. Not to say that brought me out of the film but for anyone trying to say this is all 100% accurate, you're having a laugh, right?\n\nI thought this would try to be too much like '2001', I mean, just looking at the title of the making of video- 'Nolan's Odyssey', implies that, it even has some very '2001' inspired imagery at points but this is an excellently made film but just has a number of things that really holds it back. The film might have opened up second to 'Big Hero 6', enraging Nolanites everywhere but we can all agree it is just nice to see a director taking risks and in such a big Hollywood production, as well. This film completely buries 'Gravity' and is another film sorely underappreciated in the awful Awards season 2014. This film challenges our brains and really gives the audiences something to grab onto but I do feel the fact that another space themed film came out the year before is what really hurt this. I know I might have complained for most of this review but it's because I absolutely love everything else and I was totally invested in the film. I thought the running time was a tad long at first but I really can't think of anything to take out as it all works perfectly to make a one of a kind experience. However, people shouldn't just let an acclaimed director get away with whatever they want because there is a masterpiece somewhere in here but some last minute writing really hurts it but as it stands it's still excellent in its own right.",

Because he is proving that he is the best Sci Fi director since Stephen Spielberg and it isn't even close as far as his contemporaries are concerned. No ONE is touching him. If he keeps this up - he just may challenge Spielberg before it's all said and done.\n\nWhen it comes to something like this - Interstellar - I call this a faithful continuation of Contact starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConnaughey from the late 90's. This is sophisticated. This is heartwrenching. This is highbrow. This is true geek sh!t like no other. \n\nGravity was much more visually stunning - yes. But this film told a much better story. Great acting from all parties. Very solid story by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Paramount and Warner Brothers spent their money. And yes... this film will be going in my blu-ray collection.\n\n#McConnaissanceContinues...",

The entire movie weaves back upon itself very well while focusing on a central concern for humanity (our continued existence).   Visually, this is a stunning movie that is best viewed on a large screen.   The sci-fi concepts and technology are plausible representations of our current and near future world. The somewhat realistic use of space  phenomena, time, and gravity concepts make this a fun and interesting movie to watch and contemplate.   The movie over-reaches a bit with the concept of \"love\" and the visual representation of our 3 dimensions near the end is a bit hokey.  However, that does not detract much from a strongly developed, if not a bit long winded, story of relationships, humanity, space exploration, desperation, hope, and triumph.\n\nYou will be very pleased the cinematography and CGI.   The musical tracks can be a bit annoying and distracting early in the film as well. \n\nI highly suggest watching this movie.

I got the main jest of the film but the Nasa jargon went way over my head. Its also really long and I struggled to keep my eyes open, especially when there floating around space talking about things I haven't got a clue about. The main concept of the movie is that a bunch of Nasa boffins want to save the humans species by making them live in space because they can't see a long existence for humans on earth. McConaughey plays the main pilot on the space mission and he leaves his 2 kids behind to try and save humanity. Sounds simple but there are so many other elements which just made the movie confusing. In true Inception style, Nolan went way overboard with the storyline and he could have easily taken out an hours worth of footage. The beginning and the end were interesting but the main space mission was quite boring, until Matt Damon pokes his head out of the woodwork. For a Nolan film, I thought that it looked pretty basic, especially with such a big budget, but you do end up sticking with the plot because you want to see if he gets home. The ending also didn't make much sense to me because I really don't know how Hathaway was able to build a house in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, after much anticipation, I was pretty disappointed with this film but I'm sure that many other film goers will disagree with me. Watchable but not that great!\n\nRound-Up:\nAlthough I didn't really find this movie that amazing, the performances were really good from the cast and they made there impossible mission seem realistic. The little girl, played by Mackenzie Foy, has had roles in the Twilight franchise and the Conjuring so at 10 years old, she has already made a name for herself. She was a great addition to the cast along with Michael Caine and John Lithgow who also played there characters well. Anyway, I know that the main character McConaughey was really close to his little girl but I found it a bit weird that he didn't ask any questions about his son or his little baby. I also thought that Nolan could have done a better job with the robots which also looked very basic and the spaceships didn't have any attention to detail. At the end of the day, it's no way in the same class as the Batman reboot, which Nolan done extremely well and with movies like Gravity and the underrated Moon in this genre, I honestly think that it could have been simplified and a lot shorter.\n\nBudget: $165million\nWorldwide Gross: $675million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/adventure movies about a crew of Nasa explorers, trying to save the humans race. 5/10",

Interstellar is the latest addition to his impressive oeuvre and after the hype, anticipation and many excellent films to compare it with, Interstellar falls short of the mark.\n\nThis is probably Nolan's most divisive effort. The film itself is undeniably beautiful, exquisitely filmed with strikingly good special effects. The score is also fabulously haunting. Furthermore the locations used (Iceland) are amazing. In terms of craft, Interstellar is a winner.\n\nInterstellar's convoluted and ambitious plot, however,play against it. The initial concept is very interesting, a near future earth in which humanity has irreparably destroyed the biosphere and resources have depleted. The dust storms which ravish the landscape were particularly good. However the plot soon delves into the faintly ridiculous. The story feels both believable and a bit far fetched. At times the film feels like a science lecture, which ultimately alienates and confuses. The narrative and script feels a little inconsistent, with some sequences feeling unnecessary.\n\nOne major issue is the acting. Matthew McConaughey may be an Oscar winner but he was far from convincing, constantly muttering and overacting. Michael Caine also was disappointing. Anne Hathaway was decent but not excellent. \n\nUndeniably thought-provoking and impressively filmed, Interstellar is a mixed bag, sporadically entertaining but ultimately flawed.",

If you're hoping for a solid sci-fi drama with an emphasis on the sci part, you're probably going to be be disappointed. There's certainly lots of drama however, and central to it is the ludicrously massive Hollywood-esque ego of the writers, whose own gravity apparently exceeds that of the black hole that makes an appearance in the third act. This film is part \"Sunshine\" and part \"The Fountain\" (both of which are better, by the way), and while I wish I could say that it ascends beyond being a ridiculously egotistical piece about mankind's desperate stretch - both into space and up its own butthole - for survival, I cannot.

Really, just go ahead and make the comparison.  Skip the dawn of man first.  A strange signal is picked up from space.  A mission to Saturn (versus Jupiter in 2001).  They go to another solar system (instead of 'beyond the infinite' as in 2001).  At this point, the odd ending of 2001, becomes explained...well, sort of.  The lead astronaut is returned home and is younger than his daughter (sort of the Star-child now from 2001).  Basically, the monolith of 2001 is the wormhole of this movie.  It's orbiting Saturn, as in the novelization of 2001, but was Jupiter in the movie.  It's a well done movie with a well thought out basic story, but the similarities are so blatant that I'm surprised that both the estates of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke haven't sued for outright plagiarism!",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan unabashedly pays tribute to other sci-fi classics like Solaris and especially 2001: A Space Odyssey. What Interstellar lacks in 2001's artistry, it makes up for in emotional connection.  Despite its running time, it's a relentless and emotional thrill ride, with a surprisingly tight script. The end-of-the-world type scenario contains visuals that are frighteningly believable - reminiscent of the Great Depression. Dust is slowly claiming the land by covering everything in a dreary, suffocating blanket.\u00a0 The opening image sums it all up: dust, the toy spaceship and the books. Earth, hope and love.\n\nInterstellar contains one jaw-dropping set piece after another. The deafeningly intense journey through the wormhole, the waves-as-big-as-mountains tsunami, the battle for survival against a renegade attempting to dock a spacecraft, followed by the nail-biting touch-and-go recovery of the space station spinning out of control; all these left me in a state of amazement and wonder.\u00a0 Experiencing this film in the theatre is so mind-penetrating that it left me overwhelmed (watching it in IMAX is exponentially more-so). It successfully does what we hope epic Hollywood motion pictures will do: move us, surprise us and (hopefully) stir our souls. It is a filmmaking miracle that Nolan managed to combine so many elements into one epochal film.\u00a0There's enough substance here for at least three or four movies. Perhaps most surprising, however, is the electrifying score by Hans Zimmer which constantly has the viewer teetering between awe and fear - two emotions that work beautifully in science-fiction.\u00a0 Kudos to Nolan for trusting Zimmer to thrust the score to the forefront, daring us to confront it. (This bold approach undoubtedly owes a debt to Phillip Glass).\n\nAt the heart of the film is the touching family drama between Cooper (McConaughey) and his whip-smart daughter, Murphy. While we witness Cooper's heart wrenching decision to leave his family, Nolan suddenly cuts to the space shuttle blasting off and carrying Cooper into outer-space - it is only the first of many powerful and exhilarating moments.\u00a0(Not to mention, when Cooper checks to see if his daughter is under the blanket, but she's not there. Such a moving little moment). The human connection is a theme throughout the movie where one generation is trying to save the next. The desire to make contact with others is so essential to what makes us human. Our survival instincts is what makes us great, but when push comes to shove, it can also make us do otherwise unthinkable acts, as with the Matt Damon character (the only casting misstep in the movie).\u00a0\n\nThe daring third act is certainly not as ambiguous as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Nolan does ask a lot from the viewer. I for one, felt Nolan gave us just enough to accept the plausibility of affecting time through a fourth dimension while never cheapening the mystery and awe of the film's final moments. Interstellar's reach and scope is awe-inspiring and asks the question, \"What is mankind capable of?\"\u00a0 It is challenging artists to dream and scientists to explore... and both to pioneer.",

Breathtaking is the only word which can describe Nolan's outer space shots, and the use of practical effects over CGI works very well. In short, this film combines epic, perfectly executed sci-fi with often heartbreaking intimacy in a dystopic original way which more than makes up for some silly dialogue and over sentimentality. A truly original, great sci-fi movie. Take that Gravity (movie and force.)",

Made the mistake of watching Interstellar last night... the worst movie ever made. I'll sum it up. Earth is a bit dusty, farmer driving somewhere, see's cruise missile style drone flying over head, follows it in his truck (keeping up with it - really, those type of drones fly that slowly..) while driving through a corn field. Gets shitty old laptop out and then hacks the drone and starts flying it using his trackpad. Really, doing a figure of 8 with your finger on the trackpad accounts for the up/down left and right motion of a drone flying through the air? ok. Next up. Daughter says she has a ghost in her room. Books randomly fall off her bookcase. He walks off and ignores her. Then, later, during another unexplained dust storm, sand falls in three piles next to bookshelf. It must be a sign!! Definitely coordinates to an unknown location on earth! As it happens, its just around the corner. Dad and kid drive around corner to coordinates. Wow, theres a secret base! Dad and daughter are captured. We then find out that dad knows the head boss dude, who happens to now be head of NASA! AND as it turns out the farmer is THE BEST ASTRONAUT THEY EVER HAD, and they suddenly decide that he is the man for the job to fly out to a black hole that was put out near saturn by unknown entities, for unknown reasons, perhaps to save the planet, but who knows. A minute later, they are off. Flying off into the solar system and beyond. They fly through the black hole, and then once through, they have a meeting to decide what to do next. (really? there was no plan whatsoever by NASA before leaving earth on what the mission would be once they had gone through the black hole..?). Dad/farmer/astronaut literally says/suggests 'I could swing us around that neutron star?'. Crew says, nah, lets try that planet over there.... Long story short, the head of nasa lied and it was all a scam, there was no way to save earth and they were sent to colonize another planet, but the other nasa guy they find on the planet that was went out before them tries to kill them all, and I turn the film off. What a complete and utter waste of time!!!!!",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan is one of those guys that, after having found success with revitalizing the Batman film franchise, and superhero movies in general, has found, in the ensuing years, a group of people who hate him for one reason or another.  You could say that this is what happens when a filmmaker, revered for his independent endeavors, finds some type of success.  And I get that, but I've no doubt that some of these people are just being contrarian.  Not saying that some of these people don't have valid criticisms, it's just that it's become the cool thing, to some people, to dislike something just for the sake of it without ever having formed an actual opinion and letting themselves be guided by the opinions of others.  With that said, I've been a fan of Christopher Nolan for a long time now.  In fact no film of his, that I've reviewed, has received lower than 4 stars.  I think his Dark Knight trilogy is the best superhero film franchise in history.  I realize that's not saying much when there's usually a big drop-off at certain points in other superhero franchises.  The Toby Maguire Spider-Man had Spider-Man 3, X-Men had X-Men 3, let's not even talk about Superman.  I could go on and on, but I won't.  This brings us to Interstellar, a film that I was greatly looking forward to because, why wouldn't I?  And I do not want to say that I am slightly disappointed, because I thought the film was actually really very good.  It's just a movie that has a lot of concepts and ideas that it wants to get across, with almost 3 hours to do so, and yet it somehow doesn't find a way to properly get all of these ideas across.  This is a very ambitious undertaking and if it wasn't for the fact that Christopher Nolan was attached to it and his name carries kind of an anticipation from fans, then it wouldn't have surprised me if this film would've been a flop.  And I say that because, while the film does have some moments that could appeal to a wider audience, this is a very dialogue-heavy, character-driven sci-fi film.  With a heavy emphasis, on the most part, to the scientific aspects of the mission these astronauts find themselves in, and that is to find if there is planet that could host human life on another galaxy entirely, which, to get to, they have to go through a wormhole placed there by some 'beings' to see if these planets, scouted by other sole astronauts, are viable to maintain human life.  This isn't an action-film, there are no action sequences, though there are some tense and chilling scenes, but this is a film that's about science first and foremost.  Which is why I say that only Nolan could've gotten away with this in this day and age.  While Alfonso Cuaron's fabulous Gravity is thematically similar, that was more a story about survival against incredible odds than it was about space exploration and scientific subjects such a gravitational time dilation, time travel, among other debates of whether or not it is even possible to achieve this mission and get back on time before everyone on earth dies out.  A film of this magnitude, probably even more so than a movie like Gravity, which I thought was worlds better than Interstellar, requires some absolutely incredible visual effects.  And, you know what, if there's one thing that you can say about this movie is that it's visual effects are stunningly beautiful.  Not beautiful in a regular way, like how you look at a waterfall or a sunset, but there's an incredible amount of detail put into the visual aspects of this film, particularly during the wormhole scene, and that's something that, even if you hate Nolan and his entire crew, should be lauded.  As far as Interstellar vs Gravity goes, it's not even a fair comparison to be honest, since Interstellar goes to a wider variety of places, whereas Gravity stayed out in regular space.  Gravity is more impressive in the sense of how it makes space, if everything were to go wrong, as it did in that movie, like the most terrifying place to be stranded out on.  Especially when it must be so impressive to see out at all this nothingness and how truly small you are in compared to the vast greatness that is this universe.  Interstellar, on the other, isn't really about that, though there are its moments where it tries to portray that.  Don't get me wrong, this film is absolutely stunning and it's a testament to the visuals effects team that they pulled this off in such a believable manner.  That's the one thing about this film, at least for 90% of it, is that every situation presented in this universe is at least somewhat believable.  It's simply arrogance for humans to assume that this earth is gonna be here forever and in the future, there will be a situation where either humans simply die out like the dinosaurs or the earth will become inhospitable to the point we're gonna need to terraform another planet in order for the human species to continue.  I don't want to say a lot of that is negated once Cooper makes it out to the other side of the black hole, but that is something that we'll touch on later.  The film starts having problems once you get to the gravitational time dilation.  There's this one scene where the astronauts have to travel to one of the planets being considered for human life.  The problem is that this planet is slowly being pulled in towards this supermassive black hole named Gargantua.  The problem comes in the fact that the planet is so close to the black hole that every hour spent on that planet equals 7 years back on earth.  Keep that in mind.   The ship they're on, the Endurance, is outside of the gravitational pull of the Gargantua so each hour Cooper, Brand, and Doyle (the team sent down to the planet to recover a beacon and hopefully one of the scientists that activated the beacon) is also 7 years to the person they left behind, Romilly.  So the mission on this planet goes as wrong as it can possibly go.  Their spaceship is stranded after a giant wave hits them and fries most of their systems.  This gigantic wave also kills Doyle.  Once Cooper and Brand are able to get off the planet, after allowing enough time for the systems to reboot, and they return to the Endurance TWENTY-THREE years have passed.  So Romilly, the person that is left behind, is now 23 years older than he was when Brand and Cooper left.  This isn't so much of a problem as it relates to earth, I can get behind that, life goes on at earth, even if they're against the clock, literally.  Cooper's children are now grown-up and he's missed them growing up, he's missed the birth of his first grandchild, and he's missed his daughter growing up to become a NASA scientist.  The scene where Cooper watches his son's transmissions are some of the best moments of the film since it does capture how that one mistake cost them 23 years.  Matthew's performance during this one scene is excellent.  The problem comes in the fact that Romilly, now 23 years older, is really none the worse for wear after having spent all of that time alone, with no one else to talk to.  It must be bad enough spending years with other people knowing that you can't really escape or go home, but spending all of that time alone, on a spaceship, has got to drive a person mad, it could even drive them to suicide.  Yet, outside of some initial questions to Romilly about how he made it so long, or why he didn't put himself in cryosleep, they just move on from it, never to be mentioned again.  Do you realize the amount of mental power it takes for one person to spend all that time alone?  Granted, he performed some research on Gargantua, but he was still alone.  That was a little bit unrealistic to me, that Romily showed no psychological effects of having spent that much time alone.  It was actually really surprising that they discarded Romilly so quickly after that.  He's not really heard from again to be honest.  I mean he clearly has lines and everything, but he doesn't really contribute in any significant way to the film and its story.  The rest of the film sees this same theme of gravitational time dilation play throughout the film as the more decisions Brand and Cooper make, the more time passes on earth.  Let's just get this out of the way, when Cooper returns \"home\" he's supposed to be 124 years old.  That's how bad it got.  But I don't have a problem with that, even if it's a little odd.  The problem I have is when Matt Damon's character comes into the film, like 90-95 minutes into the film.  He's one of the scientists scouting the planets to see if it's habitable.  The problem with that is that there's a twist that comes along with that and that is that Brand's father, Michael Caine, the head of the mission, essentially knew that there was nothing that could be done to save the people on earth.  So the astronauts sent to see if one of these plants were habitable were essentially the future of humanity.  There's essentially a Plan A and a Plan B.  But Plan A was only a red herring.  Plan A is not possible to achieve, theoretically.  Plan B was always Professor Brand's intention.  Plan B involves taking frozen embryos and starting humanity anew on whichever planet ended up being hospitable.  That's not a problem.  The problem is that Matt Damon's character becomes villainous for literally no reason whatsoever.  I mean he essentially faked all the planet's information to make it look hospitable in order to ensure that he was saved.  Understandable enough, I guess.  That's human instinct, as his character even states in the film, but I don't there's enough of a viable reason for him to do the things he did other than just because.  It honestly felt so out of place in a movie that didn't need that type of character.  It also takes a big chunk of the film in order to run through this little side plot.  It does play into the end of the film, but I'm sure it could've been achieved through almost any other method.  Which brings  to the climax of the film.  If you've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey, then that's what this reminded me of.  There's an element of time travel and impacting the past, from the future, and I wasn't exactly in love with it.  I mean I guess it's a means to an end.  And it brings Murph's and Cooper's story full circle in a roundabout way, with Murph realizing that her father didn't just abandon her.  Cooper was the 'ghost' that kept knocking young Murph's books off the bookshelf.  He was the one that sent her the morse code to the formula that actually ended up saving humanity, in a way, as they all live on a space station off Saturn.  But it's the typical sci-fi, 'I sent myself here to tell them me from the past to go to this underground NASA station so I could then go back in time to tell my blah blah blah blah' stuff you've seen a million times before.  It's not that it doesn't make sense, because it does, it's just that it doesn't play out in a very satisfying fashion to me.  There's no denying that this film was clearly a labor of love for those involved.  But this is more the presentation of thought-provoking ideas as opposed to a great movie.  The cast is excellent, Matthew McConaughey continues on his roll of great performances, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are also pretty damn excellent.  The special effects are top-notch, the score is fabulous, but the script just does not come together in the way that you would expect considering who is involved.  The ending of Murph, now a dying old woman, finally seeing her father again was really good though.  While the science of the film is pretty damn interesting, and it's actually making me want to go and read some books on these themes and subjects that the film covers, this is just not a great movie.  It gives off the idea that it is great because of its thought-provoking themes, but it is simply not.  Don't get me wrong, this is still very good and I would definitely recommend it, it is, visually, a very beautiful film to watch.  But it's a little lacking in the story department.  But, thankfully, at 2 hours and 40-some odd minutes, this film is paced very well.  Never did I feel that it was going on for too long.  I'd still tell people to watch it, but it's not one of those movies that's gonna blow you away.  It was just missing something.  Its ideas and its story aren't as interconnected as they would like to make it seem.  Still, a very good movie and I do apologize for this long-ass review.",

Only Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon seem somewhat caffeinated and bring their \"A\" game, while the rest of the cast seem tired, world-weary and are doing their roles only as a favor to Nolan.  How this did so exceedingly well at the box office, except for the fact it was directed by Nolan, is a complete mystery.  As a lifelong sci-fi superfan, this is the type of film that gives the genre' a black eye.  It is neither enjoyable or even thought-provoking beyond the hammering theme that as a species we should shape-up immediately, be more ecologically-minded, enthusiastic and supportive about space exploration and stop treating everything as completely disposable.  Please, Mr. Nolan, take some time off and return to us refreshed.",

The film was both a storytelling and visual masterpiece and I loved how some of the scenes used traditional visual effects and models because it added some old-school charm to it. This is a film which people would talk about in decades to come and even come back to in the distant future just because of its theories. There was a bit of a cliche moment when *SPOILER* it was mentioned that love is one of the only thing that can transcend dimensions and even death but I kinda believe in it? It does give a powerful message about climate change, space exploration, humanity, philosophy and physics and I love how this film really makes one think.

I found it less accessible and rewarding than those two, however, overreaching in the third act to reel us back in after a few digressions. Most of the climax feels like an ill fit, too, discarding two hours' worth of rigorous scientific detail in exchange for a trippy, convoluted plot device and a fairytale ending. In a lot of ways, it's like a mainstream adaptation of the finale seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a clear inspiration, in that it's bright, blurry, colorful and confusing. Only this time, the static leads to a cookie cutter epilogue, not a blank canvas. Such complaints notwithstanding, I greatly enjoyed most of the ride to reach that point, even if it has a tendency to belabor a point. Nolan's vision of a near-death civilization on our home soil is vibrant and real. His emphasis on the pain of separation and the dizzying potential of galactic time-shifts are powerful and moving. It's a real visual stunner, too, making hay with staggering CG representations of theoretical deep-space star configurations that left me slack-jawed more than once. As a space nerd, that was very cool to breathe in, and seeing practical demonstrations of so many abstract concepts is wonderful. It's excellent at many things, frankly, but perhaps a bit too overzealous for its own good.",

And if movie ended at certain point i would still think this is a amazing movie but nope it didn't end it went more  shyamalan than  shyamalan went  shyamalan in Lady in the Water. And message of this movie was not good and not original it was bad very bad. But not the ending makes me angry true the whole movie Matthew McConaughey just didn't give a shit about his son especially in the end of the movie. This was so underdeveloped it was horendes to watch how true whole movie he says how much he cares about his kids A.K.A I only give a shit about Murph because there are connection between us and oh yeah i kind of like this kid ammmm whats his name mhhhhhh oh yeah Tom  he is kid off cool.

The movie's Dust Bowl sequences are charmingly quaint (especially in a sf setting), and the space exploration sequences have plenty of thrills, chills and spills, but the majority of the movie is pretty bleak, even for a Nolan film.  He even has to resort to Deus ex machina to pull off what little hope there is at the end of the movie.  This is a recurring problem for him as a director and it really hurts my enjoyment of his films.  In his superhero movies, it's almost forgivable, because no one wants the gimmicky Batman of the tv series, but in a hard sf film?  It comes off looking like a Nine Inch Nail video with space suits.  In fact, that's the same problem I have with Man of Steel:  too much grime.  I know the space race is over and NASA has been mothballed, but it's not so bad yet we need the director of Inception (a movie I hate) singing it a funeral dirge.",

You may be asking, \"Is it that good of a movie?\" Probably not, but it certainly worked for me.  Interstellar stars Mathew McMConaughy and is directed by Christopher Nolan.  The film takes us on a journey through space and time.  Mathew M. as Cooper is apparently one of the last and the best pilots that stumbles upon a NASA facility that has been looking for a new world for humans to live on.  You see, we have used up the resources on Earth to the point that it will not support life any longer.  He travels through a wormhole to another Universe looking at three planets that have been determined to support human life.\n\nNow, let's put on the brakes.  This is an almost 3 hour movie and to hit all of the high points would make this review just as long.  The movie is visually stunning and a lot of fun to look at.  Well acted by all parties.  Superbly directed(and I'm not particularly a fan of Christopher Nolan).   The music built tension in the scenes and the silence of the space scenes was effectively used to  emphasize what you were visually looking at.  Fantastic job!  There are a couple of plot devices that felt a tad mushy, but I was able to get around them with no problems.\n\nShould you go see it?  Oh yea.  Buckle in and go for the ride.

Add to that its superficially accessible yet inwardly deep and complex themes not about time and space but the bondings of humanity that exist beyond the physical realm and even the raw lifeblood of family. The film doesn't shy away from exploring with purpose, traversing, in the story, untold distances yet in fact places much closer than the stars. The film necessarily wades through some choppy waters at times that interrupt flow, not content, but the film is certainly a legitimate spectacle of sight and sound but more important a firm, graceful, deep, and satisfying journey through the human condition. No movie is perfect. Interstellar frequently comes as close as any, but sometimes -- infrequently -- drifts a little too far away. It's a film that, on the individual level, will either draw closer to or drift further from greatness as it's watched, studied, pondered, dissected, and enjoyed both the first time around and over the years and decades to come.",

            "content": "\"I'm not afraid of death. I'm an old physicist - I'm afraid of time.\"\n\nMagnificent. Fascinating. Absorbing. Breathtaking. Titillating. Mind-blowing.\n\nThese are just some of the superlatives that I could think of, after watching this masterpiece. It doesn't happen to me often that a film keeps resonating in my mind and I'm still pondering about it after a while. Not that you have to be puzzled about the mathematical content, because it's better to forget about that part. The theory of relativity is brought up once and a while, they end up somewhere in some fifth dimension and you'll be bombarded with theories about black holes and wormholes till you get dizzy. There were some things not really clear to me, but I restrained myself to find plot holes or doubt the accuracy of some mathematical assumptions. It would be quite pretentious to doubt certain statements that are thought out by more enlightened spirits than myself. Although I kind of lacked some imagination in the past to understand certain axioms from solid geometry. So I still have difficulties with the proposition that \"two parallel lines intersect with eachother at infinity.\" Firstly, I can't imagine the infinite. And second, those parallel lines will still be parallel even at infinite distance. No one on earth will ever claim that they do intersect there, because he once was at that infinite point and saw it with his own eyes. For me it was totally surreal mathematics, my limited intellect couldn't grasp. Hence probably that's why I flunked that exam of solid geometry. But that's beside the point.\n\nNolan managed to make an epic film. A mix of fiction and non-fiction. The set-up to establish a colony on an unknown planet in another galaxy (\"To boldly go where no man has gone before\" comes spontaneously to mind) is not really science fiction anymore, given at this time all preparations are made to try the same thing on Mars. But as they plunge into the wormhole, after which they'll be teleported to another galaxy, the non-fiction ends and speculations begin. How it works, is demonstrated in a playful manner, using a sheet of paper and a pencil. Just to keep it simple for someone like me and explain it in an understandable way. But I have to admit that the visualization of this utopian trip looks stunning. As a counterpart of this high-tech future story, there's also the human aspect whereby Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) has to make a difficult choice between his family and saving humanity.\n\nThe space trip is preceded by the melodramatic part of the movie which I normally would have described as the corny sappy part. But here I didn't have that feeling at all and the whole was brought well-founded. The sketched relationship between Cooper, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) on the dusty ranch, is explained in detail and in a sound manner. In gloomy conditions they try to grow crops. A project that is doomed to fail because fungi slowly eats away all crops on our planet. Cooper, a former astronaut who was employed by NASA, focuses on the agricultural sector now (because there is a need for the production of food, and not space experts) and has constructed a fully automated farm. According to Murph there's a so-called poltergeist who wants to deliver a message. Because of this phenomenon they discover a secret NASA complex run by John Brand (Michael Caine) who explains to Cooper his exodus theory and  asks him to lead this exodus as pilot of the intergalactic spaceship \"Endurance\".\n\nUsually the soundtrack of a film leaves me Siberian cold. But in \"Interstellar\" the composer Hans Zimmer created a perfect atmosphere with his compositions. Cooper leaving his family wouldn't be so impressive with the supporting organ sounds missing. Knowing Nolan you can also assume that the appearance of the film would be impressive. And it is. The interior of the Endurance, the landscapes of the three planets, the images of infinite space, the black hole Gargantua, the presentation of the fifth dimension and the trip through the black hole. It all looked very impressive and realistic. Nolan is also known as a supporter of limited-use-of-CGI and it wouldn't surprise me if they made use of huge settings interspersed with tiny elaborated scale models. The planet Miller I personally found the most successful and imaginary result. And finally I just like to mention the accompanying robots TARS and CASE. An innovative design with a humorous communication interface.\n \nWhat remains are the performances, with Matthew McConaughey as main figure. After seeing him  at work in \"The Lincoln Lawyer\", \"Mud\" and \"Dallas Buyers Club\" (for which he won an Oscar), you can only agree that McConaughey is a talented actor with a peculiar accent who leaves a mark on each film. Personally, I think \"Interstellar\" isn't his most impressive rendition. Yes, he's cut out for the emotion-rich family parts, but as an intellectual NASA astronaut I found him quite implausible. In contrast, I thought Jessica Chastain (as the adult Murph) and Anne Hathaway (daughter of Professor Brand) acted excellent. Casey Affleck (adult Tom), Topher Grace (Murph colleagues and for the umpteenth time in a fairly geeky role) and Matt Damon appear only briefly and each with a different important contribution. The only one who really should feel at home in this film is John Lithgow, for his participation in \"3rd Rock from the Sun\".\n\nI could repeat the superlatives I wrote down at the beginning because despite some developments that went beyond my understanding and an ending I wasn't impressed by, this is still a wonderful film that manages to blend both the scientific and the personal feelings of the protagonists perfectly. I'm still wondering who ultimately planted that wormhole near Saturn, that fifth dimension still goes over my head and how Cooper finally succeeded in sending the right information needed to Murph also seemed quite an achievement. And posturing about love as something scientific that knows no boundaries, was also an excuse to give it all a deeper philosophical tone. But ultimately, this is another SF that can be included in the gallery of all those other masterpieces.\n\nMore reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

As mankind heads into the wonder of the cosmic unknown, questions of love and family become as complex as theoretical problems of how to maneuver in a wormhole.\n\nThe filmmakers clearly want to bring some philosophical weight to the film, call it gravity.

I won't ruin the experience for you, but from here onwards the story dissolve into ever more ridiculous techno-babble and pure fantasy. At any moment I was expecting Gandalf to make an appearance.

Interstellar certainly doesn't exclude itself from Christopher Nolan's archetypal main protagonist, the widowed man who is motivated by his loss to embark on a grand endeavor. Despite filling a mold, previously occupied by Leonard DiCaprio in \"Inception,\" Guy Pierce in \"Memento,\" and Hugh Jackman in \"The Prestige,\" Matthew McConaughey flexes his dramatic muscles and, in doing so, provides another virtuoso performance to add to his \"McConnaissance\" repertoire. The score, provided by recurring Nolan collaborator, Hans Zimmer, perfectly supports - and sometimes carries - pivotal moments in the film. All in all, if you have three hours to watch a truly thought-provoking movie that will likely keep you up at night in speculation, \"Interstellar\" is a smart buy.",

            "content": "\"You might have to decide between seeing your children again and the future of the human race\".\n\nOver the years, director Christopher Nolan has carved himself a place among the Hollywood elite. His sophomore movie Memento still remains one of my top ten personal favourite films but it was his hugely successful Dark Knight trilogy and the teasingly elaborate Inception that most people identified with. As a result of these blockbusters, there was much anticipation upon the release of his Sci-Fi epic Interstellar. Many were so enthused that they were literally counting down the days till the film's release. The anticipation was so huge that there was bound to be disappointment as few films can ever truly deliver on such a basis of expectation. Interstellar has become prey to this and I can honestly say that I wish I hadn't listened to the naysayers and their feelings of deflation.\n\nIn the near future, Earth is on the brink of decimation from climate change - resulting in dust clouds, famine and drought. Humanity's last hope comes in the shape of astronaut turned crop-farmer, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who leaves behind his family to join a small crew of scientists and explore a wormhole in the far reaches our solar system. Travelling through this allows them to investigate planets which may be capable of sustaining life and possibly pave a new beginning for the human race.\n\nLet's face it, Nolan has never been one to scrimp on ideas or refrain from challenging his audience. Trying to tie your head around Inception or Memento, for example, were hard enough but he manages to go even further with Interstellar - and on a even grander scale. Beginning as a family drama, Nolan builds his characters and their relationships with a touching sensitivity - that he's not normally known for. As much as he's been able to bring a realism to his imaginative and convoluted films in the past, he's never really brought a deliberately paced, dramatic edge. He normally sets up his stall and fires on with it. Interstellar, however, shows him at his most restrained. He builds slowly and assuredly which, ultimately, add real scope to his overall vision. And that scope is astounding; he achieves the apocalyptic dread of a decaying earth before reaching for the stars and injecting hope and wonder. Of course, this is not before he forces you to get your thinking cap on and ponder the complexities of gravity, neutron stars, spinning wormholes, black holes and Einstein's theory of relativity. \n\nIn order to ensure the film was scientifically accurate, Nolan enlisted the help of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne - who acted as a consultant throughout. His theories may be challenging but they only add to how impressive the film's idea's are and how they're not merely grown from a Hollywood script - they actually consist of scientific possibilities. This alone, hugely contributes to Interstellar being more than your average science fiction yarn. True, these theories and possibilities can be hard to wrap your head around but by building three dimensional characters and having reliable actors to embody them, Nolan has enough behind his grand ambitions to make events believable and manages to explain a fair bit on layman's terms. That being said, there are some questionable moments whereby we are offered a hypothesis on how love can transcend time and space. Admittedly, this is misplaced and clunky (even laughable) but the magnitude and scope of the film is so vast and ambitious that it's easy to overlook. \n\nIt's occasions like these, however, that resemble a maudlin, schmaltzier touch more akin to Steven Spielberg (who was originally planning to make the film). Where it benefits from a Spielbergian influence, though, is in it's sense of wonder and adventure. Despite it's heavy themes, Nolan never forgets to entertain and (like Spielberg) delivers a real visual spectacle that reminds you of just how magical and escapist movies can be.\n\nThe film does, admittedly, have inconsistencies but they were not enough to bother me. If anything, I found the whole experience to fit wonderfully together: Hans Zimmer's marvellously emotive score echoes the ethereal work of Philip Glass and serves the film perfectly - bringing a real gravitas to the whole spectacle - and McConaughey, yet again, delivers a central performance of real depth to a character that could so easily have been swamped with the big budget and special effects.\n\nAdded to which, at a running time close to three hours, Nolan, seemingly, doesn't know when to stop. However, I didn't want him to. Any clock watching I found myself doing was only a result of not wanting it to end. It's visually spectacular and as much as I greatly admired Alfonso Cauron's Oscar winning Gravity for it's visuals, I thought it's story was found wanting. Interstellar, on the other hand, is narratively dense and the overall film that Gravity wishes it was. That being said, Nolan (and his co-writer and brother Jonathan) came in for some criticism in terms of their (almost indecipherable) plot and the holes therein. Personally, I think the criticisms are a tad harsh. Can it be deciphered? Is it too complicated for it's own good? Is it because it strives to be an intellectual voyage yet remain a crowd pleaser the reason it has split audiences? These questions are better left to the individual viewer but big budget spectacles, where they dare to challenge and entertain are hard to come by and on it's ambition alone, Interstellar succeeds.\n\nNolan's epic odyssey is an old fashioned mix of grandeur, sophistication and entertainment. The frequency on which he's transmitting hasn't been well received by everyone but, personally, I was fully tuned in.\n\nMark Walker",

Throughout this movie it talks about love and how important it is to us all. Matthew McConaughey plays the main character that goes off into space. His part in this movie was really great and he did fantastic in it. The CGI animation is wonderful and unforgettable. While watching it you can see the creativity put into it all. The sets looked wonderful and not too fake and pointless. Also, the costumes made sense and fit in perfectly with where they were and what they were doing. For example, in space they all truly looked like astronauts and nowhere near fake or anything. The movies main message was \"Love is all you need\" because almost everything that occurred in the movie was mostly based off of love.\n\tInterstellar was kind of a slower paced movie because it took so long to get to the point and include anything that they needed too. It was a longer movie which made it slower because they had so much time to fill. Also, the storyline and dialogue gave it more character. The movie keeps you thinking the whole time and asking questions like \"what is gonna happen next?\" or \"How did that happen?\" Interstellar will leave you wanting more. It has amazing special effects, acting and a great concept. For example, the idea of earth dying and us needing to find a new planet to live on in a new galaxy is amazing and unbelievable.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves suspenseful, sci fi thrillers. I would guarantee you will not be disappointed, and if you are then you might not be very into sci fi movies like these.",

This message was shown mainly through Cooper's relationship with his daughter Murph. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, channeled emotions that transmitted perfectly through the screen, and connected with the viewers on an emotional level. The plot was driven by their tumultuous relationship; scenes with the two of them, triggered emotions some viewers never thought they had. The storyline and dialogue were in perfect harmony. There was a balance of dialogue throughout the movie. In some scenes, the graphics were so outstanding that there was no need for dialogue, and Nolan recognized that. \nThe sets and costumes on this film were, literally, out of this world. The visuals of outer space, and different planets were unbelievably realistic. The costumes, mostly the space suits, were extremely practical, as well. The visuals and costumes exceeded my expectations. Even during the scenes when the group of scientists and explorers were in this space ship, it still felt so real. The pace of the movie was slow at some points, but at no time was it boring. The movie kept me thoroughly intrigued, and had me answering questions and analyzing situations throughout the cinema. The editing of the movie was seamless, and each shot was perfectly filmed. Some of the more dramatic scenes were filmed with darker lighting, and intense background music which just added to the powerful and mind-boggling scenes. The acting in this film was spot-on. Each actor had impeccable performances and were very relatable. Whether it was Cooper and his life-changing decision of leaving his daughter, or Brand, played by Anne Hathaway, with her love story, you felt connected to the characters in this film. Christopher Nolan was sure to put one of his trademarks, nonlinear storytelling, into this film, along with his distinctive camera angles.",

By making movies with complex and hard-to-grasp concepts, Nolan captures the attention of the audience and forces them to really think to follow the movie. The film was made with a camera shot that often shook and swayed, almost giving the feel that the viewer is really suffering on Earth and sifting through space along with the characters. The visual effects in this movie are phenomenal! Providing crisp clean images of distant planets, space ships, and special elements; Nolan gives each viewer a brilliant image of space. The quick switches between shots add a sense of confusion during tense scenes, and ultimately offer a rushed and flustered feeling to the viewer. With an underlying concept of love Nolan is able to make the audience feel for the characters and connect with them. The actors, especially Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy's intimate scenes together, did an unparalleled job of toying with your emotions. The excitement of this film and the amazing cinematography will not leave you in regret, but rather in awe due to the immense idea of the whole movie. Nolan often takes on a role of focusing on huge events such as the destruction of Earth. Playing with fears of the human race and turning those fears into complex ideas, this film will leave you with your head spinning after a mind blowing ending to keep you thinking. The layering of ideas in the film gives a sense much like the movie Inception, also by Nolan, and steals away the viewers' attention.

Earth no longer contains the resources we need to sustain life and we are forced to venture out into space and search for another habitable planet to call home. Underlining the film as a whole is the commonly brought up theme of love and the power it has over the universe. The idea that love binds us all together and possibly even contains the power to bend space and time itself is extraordinary. \nAlthough the overall topic is hard to grasp and understand at times, it is very well told. The scientific detail incorporated into the script is on a higher level of comprehension but is still good. Space has no boundaries therefore being the perfect candidate to theorize upon. \nThe way the ending pieced everything together is phenomenal.  Although the thought of Earth dying is unimaginable Nolan somehow brings everything together to make it all so believable and convincing.  The characters are very well developed to the point where you can imagine them existing in the real world apart from being in the film. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a former space pilot who is recruited by NASA to go back up into space to search for a new world that the human race can survive on. When caught in a struggle between seeing his two children again or saving the human race we are stuck on the edge of our seats throughout the entire film. McConaughey in this serious role executed the character so well we continue to root for him throughout the movie and to play the role of the hero by the end. \nThe visual effects in this film are absolutely breathe taking. While watching the film its not too hard to feel as though you are actually in space. The image of the planets they venture to are so diverse yet not too far fetched with our lack of knowledge in the space field and what it holds. \n\tChristopher Nolan has definitely outdone himself this time and left us speechless. It is not unlike him to take on such a huge topic and turn it into a masterpiece. Nolan is known for his in depth works involving the deep nature of truth.

The film not only portrayed an astronaut trying to save the world, but also a father leaving his kids behind.  One thing that I thought really had an impact of my feelings during the film was the soundtrack that went along with the movie. The louder the music got the more intense the movie was for me.  The angles of the camera during this movie made it even more memorizing, throughout the film I felt as though I was on the spaceship with Matthew McCnaughey.  Midway through the film Actress Anne Hathaway did a great job when she explained that they should follow her heart this drew many emotions and made me excited to see what would happen next. I think that the overall theme of this movie that love is everything was also brilliant. The story line was a lot different than a lot of other movies which was expected being a Christopher Nolan film. However the thoughts that the movie made me think were simply not explainable.

This movie is what could be the future of us (human beings). It takes place as humans trying to find an alternate habitat for a dying earth. It Takes place as what the future could bring and hard fought journey to get there .The storyline and dialogue run very smoothly throughout the movie for the most part. In some parts in can be slow but very few of those stretches appear. Now for the dialogue the characters throughout the film experience many hard fought problems and are forced to overcome them, this being expressed with very vibrant communication. Some of the sets that were created and used for this film were magnificent. They really showed how real space is and what it looks like for the average human being. For this film Christopher Nolan should receive very high praise for his great work of cinematography for this film. He went above and beyond the expectations of what I foresee as an average movie. To be able to portray space and create  a visual of what he seeds it as is mind blowing for me. Also how he carried the movie with is message is how every quality film should be made. The screenplay in my mind showed the advances of people in the future and how our world in the future could and this film showed how import quality actors/actresses help for  a successful film. Lastly the directors distinctive style was definitely shown in this movie. The classic Christopher Nolan with such a meaningful movie with twist and turns throughout the way.

Breathtaking scenery, gripping dialogue, and a stunning soundtrack only further add to the smart and complex storyline. While the space travel in the film carries the central plot and is backed by plausible scientific reasoning, this just provides a contrast to the actual theme of the movie: humanity. \n\n   The exposition of this three-hour film may seem slow, but is critical in understanding the film later on. Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a widowed father of son, Tom, and daughter, Murph, living in a tragic, yet realistic future for America. This is an almost dystopian world, riddled with problems like scarce food sources and dust storms.  Cooper is a former pilot and his skills are used by NASA in a mission to find a new planet suitable for humanity to live on. This sets him out, along with Brand, played by Anne Hathaway, a robot, and two other courageous explorers, played by Wes Bentley and David Gyasi. McConaughey's performance as Cooper is strong and emotional, evident in scenes that play off of his relationship with Murph. Hathaway, on the other hand, seemed like an awkward fit for Brand, going from lacking any emotion to drastically in search for her love.\n\n   The film is driven by a Dylan Thomas quote, \"Do not go gentle into that good night...\" which is brought up and repeated at various points in the movie, tying back to the main theme. Love, selfishness, and relationships, atypical themes to be included and portrayed positively in a sci-fi film, are what, at its core, Interstellar is about. Overall, it was an excellent movie and in order to be appreciated to its full extent, should be watched multiple times.",

It is a movie that you really have to stay involved with and paying attention to fully understand what is going on. The best part of the movie would have to be the phenomenon that Christopher Nolan leaves you with to think about. Being known for this, Christopher Nolan did an incredible job on getting his audience really involved into the film to the point where they actually have to think and create their own opinion on what is going on. Watching this film your mind goes a little crazy trying to process the idea that this movie promotes and forces you to think very hard and deep about it. The ending leaves you with something to go home and think about with what seems to be somewhat of a cliff hanger. Overall I would definitely give Interstellar a 4.5 out of 5. Almost the whole movie was perfectly constructed except for a few slow parts and confusion during the middle of the film.",

If you aren't able to follow the storyline to this movie, then you have missed some key events that have happened in the before scenes. This movie is packed full of foreshadowing from beginning to end. The scene of Cooper having a flashback to when he was a NASA Pilot, kind of told me that there was going to be more of that. Also the fact that \"The Ghost\" kept reappearing in the dialogues throughout the intro to this movie made me wonder what is was. \nThe storyline is amazing as well. The world is coming to an abrupt end and an underground NASA company has the blueprints to save the world or salvage humanity. Cooper is picked to restore humanity and insure it will not go instinct. His acting as a leader was on point as well. He had a well conducted crew on board. What was so interesting to me was Anne Hathaway's Character made a remark about love. She said love could be another dimension. That's quite hard to believe but Interstellar does not try to say that love is another dimension. \nIt's actually a beautiful metaphor! Often we use simple analogies to describe a complex phenomenon. Here they have done the exact opposite.\n They have used a complex physics theory ( that Gravity can transcend across dimensions) to describe a relatively simpler idea.\nThis movie gets you to think. It gets your creative juices going and I highly recommend watching. 4 Stars!!!!!!",

The cinematography, soundtrack, and sound editing were all phenomenal. The soundtrack was amazing; I felt it complimented the movie extremely well. It really increased the tension and overall it blew my mind. I also thoroughly enjoyed the special effects. The special effects and CGI looked very believable and added a lot to the movie. Something I also liked were the two robots, TARS and CASE. They were very well done characters that each had a personality of their own, and even though there were robots I liked them just as much as the main characters. \nAlthough the movie was long, the story was good enough to keep me interested the whole time. The story line progressed well and always had me guessing and wondering what was going to happen next. Some of the scenes had me on the edge of my seat. Watching it a second time I enjoyed it more because of all the small details I didn't notice before. I also really like the message it was trying to send. Although I won't spoil it, the movie had a deeper meaning and provides a good look into humanity. A lot of people are talking about the ending and why they liked or didn't like it and I have to say I really enjoyed it. One thing I would recommend is really paying attention, or you might miss some important details and leave the theater confused. I really liked the ending because it made you think about it. It was not just something that you can just absorb and not think twice about. The ending makes you think about everything that happened in the movie, which I loved. I would recommend every one watch it.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen. With the unclear ending, the movie is left open for interpretation which is the best way to end a film. Two people can watch the same film and walk away thinking two different things even happened. This brings about very controversial theories about the ending. The somewhat hidden underlying theme would not have been guessed through watching the trailers. \nNolan's very distinct style is visibly present all throughout this film. The dialog was very well put together as well as the sound track. These two factors are crucial yet overlooked for the overall performance for the movie. The sound track Nolan used adds to the intensity and dramatic effect of the film. Equally, if not more important is the storyline. The story line for this film is unquestionably outstanding; I am truly amazed in the talent of this director to even come up with a storyline such as this one. Along with these things, the set in which the movie takes place becomes very real to the viewer. The audience can feel what it is like to live in this time/different world. In addition, the special effects are terrific and out of the ordinary, making the overall film more intensifying. \nMy only critique would be the casting. I felt some actors/actresses did not fit in the role they were assigned. Anne Hathaway, Topher Grace, and Matt Damon all performed very well throughout Interstellar although I think different actors would have been a better fit. Other than the casting, this movie is a must see.",

            "content": "'Interstellar' is an incredible, thought-provoking journey that combines underlying themes of the strength of love and survival instinct with action. The main idea is that love has the power to bring people across the universe and through time, whether it is a romantic relationship, friendship, or family ties. There is also a focus on humanity and selfishness, which is seen through many characters including: Matt Damon's character, Dr. Mann, Anne Hathaway's character, Dr. Brand and many others. \nChristopher Nolan, the director, did a great job of creating a complex story-line that leaves the viewer constantly wondering what's going to happen next. He manages to get some really cool and unusual camera angles too, which majorly adds to the film. The atmospheres produced from the shots appear to be dark and cold to build the ominous feel. Matthew McConaughey, the actor who plays Cooper, displays raw emotion so well, which was important for the many high emotion scenes. The relationship between the characters and the viewer becomes quite intimate as the film goes on, due to these emotional scenes and dialogue. \nWhile it is a long movie at around two and a half hours, it doesn't feel long because it is fast paced. It's hard to lose interest with so much going on. There are quite a few plot twists that really add to the suspense and secretive feel of the movie. Another thing that makes this film great is that while it is science fiction and the viewer knows that while watching it, the information is based upon science that actually makes sense. So, when watching it the events seem realistic, making the characters actions more relatable. The shots of space looked realistic as well; CGI and special effects, for the most part, were really good, there wasn't so much that it took away from the story.\nOne of the prominent aspects of the film, the soundtrack, was amazing. It helped to add so much suspense and excitement to the experience. One negative, which did not affect me personally, but may have been a problem for others is because of the nonlinear story-line some people, might have had problems following what was happening. Similar to 'Inception', another Nolan brothers' film, some people just don't understand the twists and turns of the story and this could take away from the viewing experience. Overall, 'Interstellar' is definitely worth the watch. It is a phenomenal production that is one of those films that everyone should see at least once in their lives.",

I think the message the filmmaker is trying to send is that in the matter of a couple million years as people are getting smarter they are finding new ways to get to new places. I think this movie was very great because it had many challenges and many actions to understand what kind of pressure everyone in space was in. also how the time relativity was when they were in a different galaxy and then on the planet how crap goes wrong when they trust people very good movie. This movie was kind of long but every moment it had something going on and it was very good to understand how they start everything.

            "content": "Everywhere from the dialogues to the costume designs, Interstellar was a fantastic movie. It was both intellectually and emotionally satisfying. Christopher Nolan, the director of Interstellar, knew not only how to hit our emotions, but made us think as well.  For a director who tends to go on the traditional side, this seemed to be out of his comfort zone and I think he nailed it. Specifically the scene when Copper, or Matthew McConaughey, was trying to talk to Murph, Jessica Chastain, in the world behind the black hole. Nolan is also not one to get to the point, Interstellar definitely shows this side of Nolan. Reaching to almost 3 hours long, the pace of this movie was on the longer side. With a director like Nolan this is expected, also with such a dynamic plot line it is good to have a slower pace movie. On the emotional side, the movie was also hit a home run. Dramatic scenes in some movies can seem as though they are forced. The conversations between our main characters in dramatic settings was the exact opposite. When Copper and young Murph were talking before Copper departed, it felt like a real father-daughter talk. The acting form such a little girl was amazing. The conversations in a movie can make or break it and the luckily here, it made it. To add, the special effects and costume designs in this movie, were amazing. To elaborate, when professor Brand shows Copper the rocket they are going to send to space, the sparks and overall design were very realistic. The size of the ship was exactly like the real ones. The other special effect scene that stuck out to me was when they were going through the wormhole. The noise and \"galaxy colors\" in this scene were breathtaking. The costume designs were also very realistics as well. In the beginning of the movie Copper's family was dressed in ragged clothing they was covered in dust. The astronaut costumes were also very well done. Another thing, overlooked by many, is the soundtrack of a movie. The songs can dictate the entire movie's success. If you play a sad song during a happy moment or vise versa, it could confuse the viewer. The songs during Interstellar depicted the scenes very well. While flying through space the music was suspenseful and really drew us into the scene. To wrap it all up, Interstellar was a fantastic movie with genius screenplay and ideas.",

Although this plot line was made up the events that occur in this story really make you think and contemplate our very existence on earth and the idea of traveling in time and discovering unimaginable things. The sets and animations in Interstellar were awesome. They were realistic but also extremely creative at times when Cooper's group was traveling to various different locations in way outer space. The use of robots was extremely interesting as they had human qualities but could also perform certain things unlike any other humans. You will never become bored at any part in this movie. The way the film switches from Earth and to space is really cool and the correspondence between Coopers family and him is heart wrenching. I found this film to be extremely interesting as far as the action in it but also very emotionally heavy towards the end as you see Cooper struggle with the decisions he makes. The use of foreshadowing in this movie really makes you think and appreciate the complexity of the way it was written.

Later on a life threatening decision will have to be made if they are willing to safe the people of earth.  A struggling family is introduced possessing a father, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) along with his father in law and two children. McConaughey has a very convincing relationship with his two children. As a viewer we are able to understand and grasp the drama, fights, tears and love that take place between Cooper, his son and daughter. In my opinion, McConaughey was an outstanding choice to play the role of Cooper in the film. He displayed emotions almost perfectly. You were able to feel what he was feeling in most situations, such as having to say goodbye to his intelligent daughter Murph (Jessica Chastin) as he frantically longed to salvage their relationship. A character that I feel may have been overlooked in the movie is Professor Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway). Hathaway did a fantastic job playing a supporting role to McConaughey. She has been in many other great films, but something about her acting in this one was a little different from the others. She desired to see her father, professor Brand, but she had to conceal those feelings in order to stay focused and be able to finish the mission. I believe that she did a wonderful job presenting this to the audience and really added a sense of determination to her character. One thing that really stood out to me in Interstellar was the creative sets that they used. Inside the hidden NASA base was very interesting. It was almost sophisticated and had a hint of \"futuristic\" in it. Although the most creative was how the displayed the different planets that they visited throughout the mission, and the way the showed the crew going through the \"wormhole\" into what was supposedly another galaxy. Another addition to the movie that I found neat was the two robots Tars and Case. Tars and Case used as a help to Brand and Cooper on the mission. The way that the robots were constructed was unlike anything I have seen before. They looked sleek, clean and were overall just a great addition that was in the movie. The costumes used in the movie were kept simple, as they should have been. Overall I did find myself enjoying the movie, but many times I was confused about some of the things going on. I feel that there wasn't just one big plot in the film, but many small ones that you had to follow and it just became to be too many. I would recommend Interstellar to anyone that enjoys action movies with a little bit of a mystery added into it!",

The use of stark contrasts makes it visually stimulating, with heavy shadows, and bright light sources. The use of silence is extremely well done in Interstellar, adding to the realism of being in space. The score is very fitting as well, with orchestral arrangements that raise tension and create suspense for the viewers.

The effects were incredible and added an element to the movie that couldn't be achieved otherwise.  The explosions, sound effects, and the anti gravity were extremely realistic.  Overall, the acting is what allows this movie to be what it is.  Matthew McConaughey provides a great performance as a father figure who has to make a choice between his family and the human race.  At emotional scenes, his acting is very believable.  You can hear the pain in his voice, see the heartbreak on his face.  The great acting was a result of the casting.

This movie focused on questions that have been circling our societies mind for a while now, and makes us sit in awe as we contemplate what the future has in store.

Also I think they either could have made it more scientific and adapted to the environment in a more accurate way. The space suits that the astronauts wore were very impressive so the wardrobe guy did a very good job.  At one point when they entered into a planet to see if humans could survive, for every hour spent on that planet was equivalent to 7 years on earth.

In personal retrospect Interstellar was a heart throbbing adventure that gave this sense of passion for so many things. Matthew McConaughey (Cooper) was overpowering with his ability to portray such Hero, his role in the adventure created this amazing reality to just how much actors/actresses put into their characters. Though the respect reaches far past McConaughey's acting; Anne Hathaway was brilliant while playing Dr. Brand and Jessica Chastain/Mackenzie Foy gave Murph an outstanding image of brilliance and knowledge far past expectations. That's enough about an overwhelming obsession with actors, moving on to the Love factor.\n\tLove was a major piece in this emotional heart breaker. From family love to true love, it always finds a way. Call me optimistic but this movie was a demanding role, in the despairing scenes or in the happy scenes, love was a factor. In every scene Love was flashing like a strobe light. Except Love wasn't the only thing that made this experience remarkable; there are so many other pieces to the puzzle. \n\tThe visual effect for one was heart stopping, this is not coming from a scientifically accurate mouth but the space features were astounding. The planets were beautiful and vibrantly realistic down to the last drop of water. The sound quality wasn't the best during the action shots but once the scene settled down the voices were smooth. Moving back to special effects, the men did absolutely amazing and deserved their Grammy. \n\tAlthough Interstellar was an incredible movie, its competition was a bit aggressive. Between Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel, Interstellar was almost basic with its more depressing moments. Yet the extravagant, futuristic movie was amazing in more ways than one.",

            "content": "In the movie interstellar, it is jam packed with lots of suspense.  It is a space thriller that really gets your mind thinking. Matthew McConaughey who plays Cooper is set on a mission to save the world.  He does a really nice job of portraying a dad who cares about not only his kids but the rest of humanity. Also Matthew really made you believe the part he was playing. Throughout the movie there were many scenes were lots of emotion started to be shown and it made it really real for all of the people viewing the movie.  You almost felt as if you were there and that you were going through everything that he was going through. Anne Hathaway played Brand, which she was another astronaut chosen to go on the expedition to save the world.  She also did an outstanding job in this movie.  When you watched her character go through all the trials she had to face you could see the courage she had to keep going even when anyone would think she would stop.  As for the costumes I feel that they did a very good job. The space suits really looked like you could actually wear it in space, and as for the people at NASA they made them look very business forward with the neutral colors and like they were very professional. The sets in the movie were also really well designed.  I thought the house that Cooper lived in was a very accurate description of what he would live in if his character was actually a real person.   Also I really liked how the director went into so many different directions in the film. You never knew what was going to happen next and just when you thought the movie was over, something even more thrilling happened.  Overall this is an amazing movie, not only for SYFY lovers, but for anyone and is definitely worth seeing.",

It isn't entirely understandable because space and time is infinite, but what I can get through my mind is that gravity can go through a lot of things apparently. Now of course, there are explosions which are Michael Bay approved; however, I don't enjoy a lot of buttons in the spaceship sets. There is so much to go wrong with those buttons. The scenery is a nice touch with background music. It really made me felt like I was there. I felt I was in Interstellar, but maybe I am dreaming it too much. There isn't a clear bad guy, but the objective of the story is that they are trying to survive the dying Earth and perhaps find a habitable planet to thrive on. The acting was good, but I wasn't getting much from their faces. It is probably because they were confused as much as I was while watching this movie. There will be a couple of answers with many questions. I feel like this is could be a book, and the movie is showing what is happening in the book. There are quite a few conjunctions in this review, but you will be like \"and... or but...\" It is a cliffhanger on what actually happened. For any case, I highly recommend this to all people who love to think and who like space stuff in general, but don't go gentle to that night.",

The world is seizing to produce food and 80% of the air is nitrogen. Cooper is a pilot and an engineer who used to work for NASA. He takes off on a mission with three other people from NASA to find another planet that can sustain life. Before he leaves his daughter notices books falling out of the shelves in her room. She realizes that in Morse code it says \"stay\". And her watch ticks back and forth also in ways like Morse code. Even though Murph wants her Dad to stay; he leaves anyway in hope to save her and the rest of the population on earth. He and his crew go through a black hole to get to get to their first planet. They use hibernation machines so they can last much longer to get through their journey. The first planet they land on is nothing but water and they lose a crew member by a giant wave. The second planet they land on they discover a ship and a crew member from the previous mission before they were sent up. They revive him from the hibernation machine because he never set a wakeup time. The relativity in time is so great that Cooper wants to get back to earth before his kids die. The crew member from the previous mission wants to continue the search for a new planet so he tries to kill Cooper for it. He cracks Cooper's helmet and flies up to the main ship as Cooper is suffocating. Cooper's crew rescues him and the other man died from trying to dock onto the main ship which was still pressurized. They also lost another man from that planet that got killed in the old ship which exploded. With only two people left, Cooper and the other crew member along with their robot continue to a giant wormhole called gargantua. Using all their power to get though it Cooper releases Brand who is the other crew member from the main ship. While going through the wormhole Cooper has to eject from the ship because it was getting torn up by a bunch of flying objects. As he's flying through the wormhole in his seat he comes to the 4th dimension which shows his daughter's room in every direction. While looking through her book shelf back into time he pushes the books out to spell \"stay\" just like before because he didn't want his old self to go. And he put all the rest of the quantum data to get to another planet into Murph's watch by making it tick back and forth in as in Morse code. As Murph figures it all out, Cooper wakes up on the ring of Saturn with people from earth. He visits Murph who is now an old woman even though he never aged. After that he takes a ship and takes off on a journey to find Brand, his crew member again who has built camp on another planet.",

The food is beginning to get scarce and the weathers climate is changing into extreme conditions. Coopers daughter figures everything out before he leaves and tries to tell him the answer. Cooper didn't listen because he thought she was just making stuff up and overthinking. So as a result, Cooper left his two children to save the fate of Earth. I disliked his choice of leaving his children because, they don't have a mom anymore, and the only choice is the grandfather, who was really old and would die soon. I didn't like a lot of the special effects because some seemed unrealistic and pretty sketchy. The costumes for the movie seemed pretty average. The spacesuits looked legit, and everyone else dressed like a normal person does. The movies pace was a little weird. Was slow then fast and slow again. The angles were really good. They knew the way to angle everything, zoom in, and capture detail. The style of the movie was brilliant. The theme I got out of this movie was to trust. If Joseph was to trust his daughter, he wouldn't have to go through all the drama and scares he was in",

With this world getting overpopulated and majorly polluted, this movie brings out what is one of humanity's ultimate goals, deep space exploration, and this allows for a sneak peak of how it might be. The set allows for your imagination to take over and think of what The Universe is past just our own planet. While this might bring a tear to you eye, there is always a bit of hope that follows Mathew Mcconaughey through his major journey through this Universe. The special effects are one of the main attributes that bring this film to be as good as it is. It shows action, but never like seen before. With showing some major video effects, it will make you feel like you aren't just in a chair watching it; it makes you feel like you are in the space station with them. The scenery of this film is outstanding!  The scenes of earth spark emotion of doom. Now with the Earth being portrayed like this, it makes you feel like exploring deep space is the only option. What mysteries live beyond the barriers of our own planet? Should we even attempt to go out this far? What are some of the dangers involved in this? Interstellar touches every one of these question and will leave you with the perfect answer. With an ending that will warp your mind like never before, and leave you wondering how this could ever happen, and maybe even bringing a tear to your eye, but leaving you astounded by what the potential that man has. Christopher Nolan deserves at least a 4 star rating on this due to the special effects and emotion sparked by this along with possibly one of the greatest conclusions of any film I have personally ever seen.",

Allowing you, the viewer, to have the experience to create the ending yourself. This allows for the ending to not go wrong in a direction that you wouldn't be happy with. Interstellar was a movie that had meaning and went beyond just telling a story is what made it interesting to watch. Matthew McConaughey did a splendid job on his role being able to be dramatic at times and then also have humor in him as well. The movie overall was brilliant, with awesome special effects and soundtracks. Throughout the whole movie, the music they chose for the movie made the experience amazing. The music allowed for you to be in their shoes and you would be on the edge of your seat and it could switch to a very dramatic scene. The music also created very intense moments like for an example when Murph's brother was coming back in the car the music made that moment feel extremely intense. The storyline of the movie was also great; good plot twists are always good for the movie. I personally love movies that involve space, and just waiting to see what they find on the other planets was an experience I was having with the actors. The only flaw in this movie I would say would be the dialogue. During some parts of the movie you couldn't understand what they were saying, for an example when Professor Brand was dying it was hard to understand him. Lastly, the ending wasn't as great as I expected to be. It didn't have a strong emotional punch, because it ended a little bit too abruptly. Overall, the movie was great and it would be a movie that I could watch a second time.",

This well directed movie has great audio and music, with every scene the suspenseful music does a great job of making you question and leave you on the edge of your seat. Not only is the music a major part of making the movie so good, but also the audio, the background noise makes you feel like you are a part of the movie and puts you in the mood of the scene, whether that is suspenseful, sad , or happy. The camera movement was also very well done, every scene in space was slow moving and peaceful just like the way we all imagine space to be like. When things got suspenseful everything became fast pace and very intense, the camera movement, the audio, and everything else. The movie also has very well done effects in space and puts you in the movie making you feel like you are there with McConaughey. Not only is \"interstellar\" an intense movie is also mind-blowing and makes you question what's going on. The movie was very good with foreshadowing and flashbacks, towards the end, Cooper realizes he is still a part of his family's life and helps his daughter save the earth using morass code.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack reminds one of Philip Glass's soundtrack for Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi (1982), what with the organ-laden music. Digressing from the soundtrack, screenplay and cinematography are another strong suit of the film, with subjects front and center, communicating their significance to the audience. Even Nolan's action films use slow and steady shots to ease the pace of the film, to give the film a sadder and mysterious feel. Costume and dress was also great. The space suit designs that the scientist wear seem at least semi-practical. Now that brings up my next point: plot and dialogue. Nolan has a reputation for trying to take non-serious concepts and trying to give a more sober depiction of it. The dialogue is extremely irksome to listen to, mostly because what they say is extremely stupid and clich\u00e9. You wonder how the actors took themselves seriously. The storyline makes you wonder. Wonder how such awful dialogue and forced character progression was even tolerated for an expensive film. Mackenzie Foy's performance of the younger Murphy was plain awful, and I had no sympathy for her whatsoever. Jessica Chastain's performance was disappointing, the same women who did an amazing performance as Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - but who can blame her? The dialogue was so vapid that I found it wonderfully amazing that Matthew McConaughey was able to be convincing at all. But then again, ever since he came back from hiatus, his role in True Detectives has established him as a respected actor. The movie was average. Although the doltish storyline and dialogue was painful, the film was a feast for the eyes, and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack made it a reward for the ears as well.",

In an age when most \"blockbusters\" are regurgitated concepts, sequels, prequels, remakes, graphic novels, at least he is trying to do something different. Also, as with most Nolan movies, its very cold, with the human element never fully connecting for me.

The plot gravitates around a strong and dramatic family theme, but also spiced up with Nolan's progressive, plausible and intellectual take on Hollywood audiences. The static cinematography is another Kubrick trademark, which is associated with the \"one point perspective\", and also associated with the art house movie style, which Nolan has always been fond of. I consider Interstellar a movie that can't be put in conventional categories, but it can certainly be classified as a masterpiece.

In my opinion, the lack of clarity presented in the narrative by the Nolan brothers makes them come across as pretentious and silly, quite frankly. Granted, there was much more capability presented in the warped stories of Inception and Memento but for pete's sake, a fifth dimension that puts you back in time, at the back of a bookcase in your daughter's room? 2 and a half hours for this?!

Oh hell, let's just get this going.\n\nThe first thing I feel I have to point out about this epic flick is that the film boasts a damn-near three hour running time (as I have already mentioned) HOWEVER I personally never felt anything other than pure enjoyment as the filmmakers here have packed in enough humor, thoughtfulness, and intrigue to make up for your time. \n\nI connected with this film very strongly as I felt it was a very strong analogy for fathers moving on ahead of us to \"another existence\" in the hopes to make our inevitable journey less frightening. There were several moments that truly felt like the film was making personal messages to me on this topic (cuckoo? maybe.) But all that doesn't change the fact that, as a straight forward sci-fi adventure, the film still held the goods.\n\nThe film was packed full of gentle, yet epic, set-pieces that were scary in very personal ways. I'm talking about digging into some psychological phobias I was unaware that I possessed. Now how often can you say that a 200 million dollar blockbuster has made THOSE kind of feeling bubble up in you?\n\nThis all brings me to what I feel is a very apt film comparison in the 2000 Robert Zemeckis flick, \"Cast Away\". While this film is a bit faster paced I feel that it is safe to say if you are the kind of film-goer who was rapt by Mr Hanks sole adventures upon that mysterious island, you will no doubt be as entrance by Mr. McConaughey's adventures beyond the stars. I loved both of these flicks and can only hope that INTERSTELLAR has the personal staying power that Cast Away had and continues to have over me.\n\nNow, is this Christopher Nolan's best film? I'd say no, as of right now, but I will say that I believe it to be his most subtle and eerie work since 2002's underrated INSOMNIA...(Wait a second...Insomnia... Inception... Interstellar...hurm...a pattern...?)\n\nAnyways, if you find yourself with the time (and please, do yourself and favor and PREPARE yourself for this film. That means clearing your schedule and head space) and I believe you will be more than guaranteed a film that will not only have you running to your nearest Quantum Physics book but also rushing to find and tell those you hold dear exactly what they mean to you.\n\nP.S. Matthew McConaughey has, after this (no pun) stellar performance and his even better showing in the amazing True Detective, now become one, if not my favorite actor. The guy is good. \"Alright, alright, alright...\"",

The trailers weren't really doing much for me, but I knew that with Christopher Nolan at the helm, directing the likes of Matthew McConaughey, it could only be good. And turns out I was right. \n\nIn it's simplest form, Interstellar is a classic exploration/adventure movie. When it becomes apparent that the earth will soon be uninhabitable after dust storms begin killing off our food supplies, McConaughey's Cooper and his team are sent through a newly discovered wormhole to source a new planet to continue the human race on. But there is nothing simple about this movie, it will challenge you the whole way, complicated, but delivered in a way that simpletons like myself can understand. Although there are parts that I am still trying to wrap my head around now, that is kind of the magic of this sort of film. Nolan did it as well with Inception, they are movies that will be discussed for years to come. \n\nWell McConaughey is still at his top form, rivalling his Oscar winning performance in Dallas Buyers Club. Although at times it is hard to understand his southern drawl mumbling. But this also goes for some of the other characters in the film and seems to be a bit of a Nolan trademark, having his characters talk like this. This is one of the few negative things I have to say about Interstellar, but if I can't make out what characters are saying I can miss important things. For example there is a moment where Michael Caine's character is blurting out unrecognisable words, that could take a few watches to understand if you don't catch it the first time round. Unfortunately when sitting in a cinema you don't have the luxury of rewinding, and luckily for me my mate next to me understood what was said, and it was an important plot point in the story. Although I would have picked it up as the narrative moved along, I don't know why Nolan insists on these sort of performances? It's only a small niggle to me, but it brought on a big rant! It doesn't really take away from the film too much though. \n\nThe music and sound are incredible. Opting for a score with many a lovely Organ riff, it makes for a very haunting experience. \nVisually speaking, Interstellar is incredible. Searching these new worlds is just so much fun, and the space travel looks great, especially when they move through the wormhole. I saw this one on a Vmax screen and I recommend that you don't settle for less. This must be seen in cinemas. \n\n4.5/5\n\n'Mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here.' - Cooper",

I don't know if I've ever felt so bipolar about a movie before, but I can't deny the level of heightened emotion Nolan had me at, the brink of imagination he took me to, and yet the dullness intermixed within it and political statements were so much to throw me off I want to go down to 2 1/2, yet nowhere in between!  It's crazy.  I will have to revisit this picture away from the Lincoln Square IMAX and see how I feel then... a year later I did, after the ellipses, and above it once said 4.5, but it dropped to 4.  Between that it was 3, then I saw The Martian's zero imagination and it went back up!  This is exactly how Nolan movies feel, he is the master of mixing hair-raising moments with cringeworthy ones.  What the fuck was that whole dying Michael Caine plot twist where he kind of screwed them and all that plot complication?  Hello, we're traveling through wormholes to other solar systems, does anybody give a fuck about that old geezer back on Earth and whatever he might've misled them with?  Uh, no, but the film gets real busy caring about, blaring music and then making his words inaudible, supposedly an \"artistic choice\" - I think he was confusing himself with David Lynch making Fire Walk With Me, drowned sound in a nightclub making sense there, or Fincher's Social Network.  Another slap my forehead Nolan moment, who often compares himself to Kubrick... really?  REALLY?!  Oh god, speaking of cringeworthy, Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck as brother and sister, she's burning crops to force her point, eyiyiyi what a mess.  Don't get me started on Anne Hathaway, couldn't she be the one sacrificed instead of McConaghey, one of the few characters I like in this movie?  Did Matt Damon really need to be there?  Did any of this character shit need to happen to rip our interdimensional experience away?  NO!  And yet the experience was so wonderful, I was nonetheless enthralled when the film let me be.  I'm still curious how Spielberg's would've looked, I liked what I heard about his version of the screenplay before Chris Nolan jizzed all over it.  And thanks Hans Zimmer, I don't know if my eardrums will ever recover.  \n\nThe tesseract, which didn't at all seem to behave as one, is what genuinely caught me, and that's where most everyone else seems to have tapped out.  Too bad there are such narrow minded folks out there, because this is the heart and soul, the everything of the movie, the device that ties up all the loose ends while creating new mysteries.

The amount of work that they have put into this film is phenomenal. They literally made the worlds most accurate and stunning humanly made simulation of a Black hole for a film!\ni will say that Mathew McConaughey's performance was not up to scratch, or, more to the point I didn't like the choice of actor, his dialogue was too, quiet, and a little monotonous in some aspects, the Time capsule of his daughters room for example, his pleas for his daughter to see him became a little repetitive.\nI never cry in films, ever, but for some unknown reason the concept of your family grows older within two hours of 'your' lifetime, hit me, especially at the end when you see his daughter at her death bed. I do think that the end was a little rushed as the reunion with his daughter was very quick, and didn't seem like a realistic way you would act when you saw your daughter about to die. But i guess Nolan had spent 2 hours and a bit already sooooooo i'll let that one go\nA film is supposed to intrigue you, engage, pull at your emotions, feel a connection towards the characters, make you think about what you'd do in that situation, how you'd feel in that situation. and to me i feel like Nolan hit it right on the head!",

But man, if only all of the sci-fi films I've seen could be this immersive, this inspiring and inspirational, this cerebral, and this interesting. I hope this goes down as a benchmark for the genre, and not a forgotten, underrated classic. It deserves all the praise it gets. Even if Matthew McConaughey does do his usual shtick.

I really didn't care for the human race as much as I did for McConaughey and his daughter. Admit it: you rooted for Plan A just because you wanted to see them reunited, otherwise go for Plan B for the love of God, it's safer! The son was irrelevant except for the video transmissions. Those damn video transmissions were the climax of brain-overwhelming-counter-intuitive-raw-human-emotions I've seen in a long time.\n\nAs for the science, the time perception might send you into a thought spiral about real-life stuff, which is the best food-for-thought there is, imho. Think about how our brains currently perceive time as running faster than before, how some days seemingly run faster while others run slower and, more importantly, how it's a feeling shared by a lot of us (if not most). Also, how a couple of hours pased while I followed this train of thought which felt like minutes to me.  \n\nInsterstellar is not perfect because, like most time-travel movies, it doesn't bother to explain the freaking time paradox (leave it to his typical Nolany self, but I still love you, man, you continue to meet my expectations in a movie).",

For a while I was really into it, but then it takes the oh so predictable, overly complicated turn that Nolan has mastered (and yes, I understood what was going on).

Rage, rage against the dying of the light\", Nolan quotes Dylan Thomas and repeatedly he is using the words \"gentle\" , \"rage\", \"dying of the light\".\nThis poem becomes the pivot the film is built around. It is a poem of love, of fight for life, from son to a dying father. \"Interstellar\" travels the audience through galaxies, driven by love: for humanity, for life, for science, for children, for fathers, for Light, defying the gravity, the Time and Space.\nChristopher Nolan proved again his genius and, like always, he created a thought provoking masterpiece that does not allow the audience to be lazy, but invites us to think, to feel, to learn.",

It almost reminded me of Prometheus in that way, but at least in prometheus there were actual aliens which you would expect in a space odyssey. Also at least in prometheus the robot wasn't a fucking giant metal box with a computer screen. That was my biggest complaint. This movie is worth seeing, but in no way one of the greatest movies of all time like it is being rated and discussed like. A wonderful soundtrack and emotional family love story overall. 3.8/5",

By one of the best Director's, Christopher Nolan!\nFor anyone who still hasn't seen this, it's not a movie for the average person with an average mind! It's really complex and has a lot of science! If your expecting a crazy action movie with bad effects that are all green screend, and has no good story just a cool fake action movie! You will not like this movie! Even though it does have some amazing scenes! If you are still interested in watching the greatest Sci-fi movie ever made I recommend you to do some research on blackholes, wormholes, gravity, and our dimensions & time, before you watch it. Trust me it will make sense more after you do, if you have no idea how any of those work or are. Oh and I can not forget to mention that it has the greatest soundtrack ever. It will give you the chills at times and other times make you cry!! All I can say is that the movie for me was way to underrated because people where expecting a simple story with a lot of action! Which makes no sense to me because people give good reviews for movies that are just fake action for example, the new Fast and Furious. It really has no storyline just people driving cool cars and doing things that are impossible, but it still got good reviews because its just and action movie. There not supposed to be realistic or have a great story. But the problem I have is that when it comes too a science fiction movie, that is 1 million times more realistic, gets bad reviews by people because it doesn't make sense too there small brain's or it's not realistic, but they gave movies like fast and furious 100% reviews..... lol.

But it's fair to say that the rhythm of the movie and the way Chris treated the climax and the end of the movie, made me feel a little strange about the film in general terms. I bet if they're just tried to put more effort into the final sequences and cut at least like 30 wasting minutes, this would be one of the best pictures of the year so far. But Nolan didn't take a minute to take in consideration all these mistakes that most of their fans noticed like they were trying to yell us how big they were. Even if they were just a couple of things, they were big enough to disappoint one of two if us (like the unexplained crossing of the black hole, the fourth dimension, etc...)\n\nIn a few words, a pretty good movie.

            "content": "I managed to catch Interstellar the other day. Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there.\n\nI really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, \"we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?\" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was ok with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing.\n\nOverall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5.",

This was a hugely ambitious project by Christopher Nolan and although much of it was difficult to comprehend I just managed to follow the plot. With all hope of life on planet earth fading quickly Cooper leaves his two children to search for the possibility of life on another planet. While in space he receives word that it was never possible to bring the rest of mankind with them instead they were sent there to carry on mankind theirselves. Cooper and Brand refuse to leave their loved ones on earth to just die so they continue to search for the answer that will sustain human life on another planet. After communicating the answer to his daughter Murph on earth through another dimension Cooper is left for dead in space. Murph eventually saves mankind and Cooper is eventually rescued to witness this bizarre new world that mankind occupies thanks to his daughter. There he meets Murph who has aged greatly and is now on her deathbed. They  embrace and Murph tells Cooper to go save his colleague Brand who is on another planet waiting for someone to save her. Interstellar was an incredibly smart movie but also a story about love and mankind's will to carry on. I really enjoyed this movie and glad i decided to finally go see it.",

The ideas and intellectuality of the film overstay their welcome and lose you for moments along the way. I love that they made this with true scientific facts, but they ay have used too much (let the record show, I was not too confused and love astonomy, ect.). The movie moves way too fast in beginning, hard to believe for a marathon 3 hours, a touch too long. Characters are a bit overdramatic, I do not think Hathaway was right for the role, but that's just me. But enough about the shortcomings, I gave this film 4 stars because it took Gravity another step forward. I don't care who you are, this film should excite and inspire you about the future of space exploration. The main character asks \"why did we stop searching?\" and I completely agree. It's fascinating beyond belief and given a fun plot twist at the end that sends your head spinning, even if it is unrealistic. No, Interstellar was not perfect, but who cares? Give it a chance.",

            "content": "Interstellar is probably the most highly anticipated film of the year, setting it up for the potential disappointment that comes with a film as over-hyped as this one most certainly is, while also granting it the space required for it to grow in what ever direction it needs to, its dreams un-tethered to the expectations associated with an unknown director's work, and allowing for its final grand gestures towards cosmic significance to feel genuine despite itself. Coming off of a string of seminal films that have succeeded in establishing Christopher Nolan as one of the greatest directors of his generation, Interstellar builds upon an already established and credible legacy, leaning on the iconographic cache of Nolan's name in order to attempt the making of one of the most sought after goals in Hollywood: the making of a space odyssey. Inevitably, Nolan pulls upon such unavoidable inspirations and sources as Stanley Kubrick and George Lucas in order to do so, but is still able to instill his impeccably distinguishable touch into his own work, giving his audience a film that is cinematically compelling, even if we have seen its like before. While Nolan's new space odyssey doesn't offer any new avenue into the sci-fi genre, stumbling over the convolutions of plot that occur in the narrative's utilization of time travel, it's hard not to stand in awe of the film's technical mastery. Watching Nolan's film is akin to recapturing the innocence of our collective youth, ephemeral in its impermanence, playful in its mimicry of its forebears, and awesome in its genuine sense of wonder, still caught up in the dreams of childhood that we have long since been shaken awake from.\n\nIntersellar is deeply indebted, both in terms of narrative and aesthetics, to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and as such sets off in search of new territory from the well of Kubrick's pervasive influence on both the genre and Nolan's film itself. By taking the very best aspects of Arthur C. Clarke's original screenplay and Kubrick's authorial vision, Nolan attempts to neatly repackage what audiences have already seen in a way that is surprising, fitted to modern times and his own cinematic sensibilities. Essentially reformatting Kubrick's classic vision of the omniscient wonder of space to a contemporary, ecologically driven narrative, wherein earth is becoming uninhabitable and depleted of sustainable farmland, Nolan pulls on the grandness of the space odysseys of the 1970's and 1980's, inhabiting a dreamscape that was once pure fantasy made into a more tangible reality within the scope of his film. One of the most stirring aspects of Interstellar is its fascination and intimate love for deep space exploration, reinvigorating a dying enthusiasm for space travel and the sci-fi epic that has long lain dormant in our collective subconscious for nearly a decade, only to be reinvigorated once more by the majesty of film, propelling us out of our seats and into the stars. Interstellar is by no means Nolan's greatest achievement, unmemorable in its constant allusions and trace resemblances to such classics as Kubrick's aforementioned odyssey, but its level of visual tenacity and outright beauty is a marvel to behold, urging you to watch more closely, and revel in the silence of yet another small step for man, leaping into the void in order to reinvigorate our long lost love for celestial drama.\n\nProbably the most glaring criticism to be made about the film comes in the laziness of its many conveniences and contrivances of plot, most notably being the overly sappy and Kubrick-esque third act, wherein the familial drama that forms much of the film's thematic center is married to the fictive surrealism of the plot's poorly delivered sci-fi tropes. Granted, the climactic portion of the film that bears the brunt of a lot of this specific source of criticism looks remarkably similar to Kubrick's final sequence in 2001, but where Kubrick was driven by the camera, alienating and isolating his viewer's in the process of crafting some of the most well edited and composed shots in terms of cinematography, while alienating and confusing his audience in the process, Nolan's film is interested in the characters, their stories and connections to one another as important as Nolan's debts and connections to his audience. While certain aspects of the familial drama do feel Spielbergian in their overt manipulation of the audience's sympathies and investment in the film, it's also a thematic point of fundamental significance that serves to anchor the viewer's investment over the course of the film's near three hour run time. What's more, this familial drama is set up clearly in the film's script from act one, is seamlessly carried over through an emotionally taut second act, and finally grants climactic closure in a third act that feels well earned and genuine, sentimentalism carrying the drama and action throughout. As was the case in Douglas Trumbull's 1972 ecological fable Silent Running, Nolan implements genre filmmaking in order to tell a story of the warmth and compassion of humanism, setting his film apart from the cold, nihilistic detachment of Kubrick, and making Interstellar stand out on its own, definitively Nolan-esque. It might not be the most memorable film within Nolan's oeuvre, but it's certainly one of the year's best, populated by characters that are compelled by the cinematic vision of an auteur, and carried on the shoulders of the script's structural, if not scientifically cogent, mastery.\n\nWithout a doubt, Interstellar is a film that will be talked about for weeks to come, and will be the center of a lot of Oscar Buzz as we head into awards season, but it likely won't be the recipient of the Academy's final selections for artistic recognition. Nolan's admirable attempt at the space odyssey often feels a little too redundant in its wistful reminiscing of what has come before, leaving the viewer in a state of disaffectedness as the credits begin to roll, left with the knowledge that the film was in fact directed by Christopher Nolan, his name holding more aesthetic power and cohesiveness than the film itself, lacking the character of The Dark Knight and the clarity of Inception. The stylistic indebtedness that the film holds to the sci-fi heyday of the 1970's and 1980's is a welcome resurgence that strives to carry on the example set by Alfonso Cuaron's Oscar winner from last year, and next year's The Martian directed by Ridley Scott seems to be further promise of the genre's reemergence as critically and commercially viable. However, Interstellar's grandness might also be its downfall, just as big cinematically as Star Wars, Alien, or Blade Runner, but not nearly as vital, lacking a certain authorial urgency and heart that defines the three aforementioned classics, Nolan merely playacting as Kubrick in a dilapidated playground of adolescent exuberance, contented but not inspired. For all of its cinematic effectiveness on its own terms, Interstellar struggles to surpass its inspirations, treading water in the tidal pools of recursive nostalgia, the vast ocean of independent innovation lying beyond its comfortable recesses in the sand.",

            "content": "3.5/4.0\n\n\"Interstellar\" is undoubtedly writer-director Christopher Nolan's most ambitious and personal movie to date but nonetheless it is not the strongest addition his impressive resume (I still think \"The Dark Knight\" is his definitive movie). There is so much to admire here but the movie has its? flaws.\n\nIt is set in the future where earth is becoming more and more difficult to live in on food scarcity that is driving a secret NASA to find life on other planets through traveling through a black hole near Saturn. The movie's central idea revolves around the relativity theory and the difference in the passage of time through space.\n\nHere is what I liked; 1) the movie is undoubtedly beautiful to look at (a planet with gigantic waves is especially breathtaking) and seeing it in IMAX definitely helps, 2) one long sequence more than half through that showcases Nolan's directorial strength building up a great deal of tension (the scene cuts through events on an ice-cold remote planet and on earth), 3) the simple yet brilliant single-note score by Hans Zimmer, 4) the acting - Matthew McConaughey follows up his Oscar win with another great performance as a loving father willing to sacrifice his time with his kids for the good of humanity and Jessica Chastain (one of the best actresses around in my opinion) as the older version of his hard-headed yet smart daughter (MacKenzie Foy of the last Twilight movie does a good job as the younger version of his daughter), and 5) most importantly, in the midst of all the complexity: there is one simple message in the movie: love as a drive for one's actions portrayed through a father-daughter relationship.\n\nAt a running time of nearly three hours, the movie tests the audience. I watched the movie twice: the first time it felt overlong (could have easily lost 30 minutes or so with the first hour especially slow) and too complicated for its own good (at times it feels as if one is watching a complex physics lesson). The second viewing was far better as I got to admire nuances in the plot (watching it knowing what will happen) but a certain twist in the film's final act was still a far too complex and far-fetched. The second problem is Anne Hathaway (the film's leading lady) as MConaughey's space companion and the daughter of a great scientist (Michael Caine) who's the mastermind behind the mission. She is a bit one-note here and the character isn't properly fleshed out. \"Interstellar\" is a movie that demands a second viewing and I am sure you will like it more the second time. Nominated for 5 Oscars: Original Score, Production Design, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Visual Effects.",

I would imagine that any woman with an imperfect relationship with her father, whether that be because of death, abandonment, estrangement, or any other reason, would find the film fulfilling. It brought a lot of feelings and memories to the surface and then played them like violin strings. It was the good kind of hurt; the kind that eases some of that tension from grieving. That pain hasn't gone after eleven years and I don't imagine it ever will. It certainly grows easier to deal with, and a good cry is always a great release.\n\nRegardless of any other aspects, good or bad, one cannot enjoy a movie without relating to its characters on some level. The kinship I felt with Murph was the anchor for me. The film isn't about space exploration or Earth being no longer able to sustain human life; it's about the relationship between a father and his daughter.\n\nWith a 72% Tomato, this is Nolan's (as director) \"worst\" film. The film certainly has its issues, but I can't help but wonder if we're being too subjective because Nolan hasn't given us a masterpiece. It is thoroughly enjoyable and the pacing is excellent--quite important on a near-three-hour movie. One must suspend their disbelief a hair more than usual for Nolan's films, but a little bit of popcorn seems to do the trick.",

By the time it does there are already signs that, as writers, Messrs Nolan have fallen foul of one of the most common traps laid before them - namely they have failed to keep it simple. A knock on the door informing astronaut ace Cooper that his country needed him would surely have cut through the lengthy process he undertook to strap himself back into the cockpit. That and an annoyance with his bratty daughter's selfish attitude was already turning me away from a film that had an excellent premise, and with an unlimited budget should therefore have delivered more.\nFurther black holes of various types appear in the plot so whilst the effects are stunning at times I was always conscious of being in the theatre as opposed to being suspended in space. Quite the reverse was the case with the Kubrick classic 2001:A Space Odyssey, the film with which this has been so liberally compared. Although the Kubrick take on man's space quest was not simple in concept, it kept its feet on the ground at all times before hitting the viewer in the solar plexus at the end.\nFor me Interstellar was a fair effort but one that ultimately got lost in its own wormhole.",

The film is a masterpiece and a brilliant work of art, only flawed by it's own intelligence.  The movie had me feeling like a kid again, like seeing Jurassic Park or Star Wars for the first time.  It's so grand and unimaginable, you stare up at it and wonder \"how did they do it?\"  Then right when you think you've seen it all you realize you are in for so much more.  Interstellar is a magnificent ride that pushes the boundaries of what movies are and can achieve.  It doesn't just reach for the stars, no, it flies past them, through them, around them, and beyond to easily become one of the years best films!\n\nFilled with edge of your seat excitement and stunning visuals, Interstellar is a marvel of a film to experience.  An impressive cast and remarkable sets make the story rich and vibrant; equally matching the movie's technical prowess.  Not to mention some incredible science, most of which flew over my head, but if you just go with it and enjoy the films brains and brawn you'll realize you are in for quite the treat.  Interstellar is an intelligent and entertaining movie, an epic that is easily one of the best adventures to grace cinemas in the last decade of filmmaking.  \n\nChristopher Nolan's film is hard to look away from and by the end you may even wish it were longer.  The incredible worlds of Interstellar are fascinating and you want to explore them further.  However, each planet's obvious threat to the lives of the characters in the film is so overwhelming that I genuinely feared each one.  I often felt my body tensing up, becoming uneasy, and often being crushed under mountains of emotion.  The film is highly effective in its ways and brought me to pieces many times.  I admire it for not holding back and taking a hold of me as it did.  \n\nInterstellar just can't be compared to anything else.  Even if you don't like the story, or find it pretentious, too complex, or long... you simply can't deny the grandness of it.  The beauty of it.  The overwhelming sense of wonder and amazement in every frame.  The movie reaches higher than most dare to take their stories and for all those reasons it becomes masterful and magnificent! \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

            "content": "So I will not lie to you: I walked into the Christopher Nolan\u00e2??s latest film thinking it was going to be some slightly thought provoking space film with a star studded cast and not much more. In my mind, the three hour movie was going to be an offspring/wannabe of Alfono Cuaron\u00e2??s Gravity with a dark Nolan-esque twist. It\u00e2??s superstar cast mirror\u00e2??s Cuaron\u00e2??s motion picture last year that earned him a Best Director Academy Award so that combined with the space footage in Nolan\u00e2??s preview led me to a na\u00c3\u00afve conclusion.\n \nA na\u00c3\u00afve conclusion destroyed as soon as I stepped into the theater.\n \nI\u00e2??ve never experienced a movie quite like Interstellar. The entire movie made me feel like I was literally floating and spinning for three hours. A constant confusion yet amazement as to what was playing on the screen before me. The combo of the whole apocalyptic dust ridden world that needs intense saving mixed with a DILF ex-astronaut\u00e2??s emotional battle to leave his family for what could be hundreds of years Earth time made for a science fiction picture that kept you on the edge of your seat with an utterly confused look on your face. What set this movie a part for me from other space themed movies was how it focused less on outer space special affects (though it had its fair share of insanely cool shots of what is out there) and more on the actual physics and logistics of space travel and the emotional journey of the characters.\n \nMy brain does not perform on a science level. I took physics my Junior year of high school and though I walked out with an A- (only because we got to bring in formula notecards to every exam), no amount of high school physics could prepare me to wrap my head around some of the concepts in this movie. The whole \u00e2??I can leave to space and come back looking not a day older but you will be 50 years older than me because space time is measured differently than Earth time\u00e2?? thing is just something that I still to this day have trouble understanding, but that Interstellar helped clear up for me. The scene at the end with Cooper (McConnaughey), a still crisp adult, and his daughter, a now old woman, was breathtaking depiction of the power of time. If I had an issue with this movie it was that it was mega confusing at times. I found myself asking questions and trying to fill in the blanks and although sometimes I feel that once you confuse your audience, you lose them, this movie was an acception. I was confused, but it was a pleasant confusion. It was like eating something delicious and having no idea what it is. A pleasant misunderstanding that I never wanted to end.\n \nNolan chose to center his movie all on the power of love. A surprising move on our boy Christopher\u00e2??s part compared to his other films, but in my eyes that is what set it a part from his other work. Nolan wrote the screenplay along side his brother and we know from his other movies like Inception the way his brain works is unlike any other human on this planet. The guy doesn\u00e2??t even own a cell phone or have an email account; he\u00e2??s too cool for that. He much rather spend his time writing mind blowing screenplays about trying to attempt to save the human race by travelling to three possible life supporting planets via a black hole. Like it\u00e2??s whatever.\n \nThe character\u00e2??s emotional journey\u00e2??s and the intense conditions and imperative nature of the mission given to them made for an incredible combination. You could feel the tension that was laced in thoughts and actions mixed with their knowledge that it was their rightful duty to attempt to save the human race during the astronaut\u00e2??s journey out of our solar system. Hathaway and McConnaughey both tapped into their character's human nature so beautifully. The portrayed on the screen the battle between our duties to those we love and our duties to what we need to do. The breathtaking montage of Cooper\u00e2??s son\u00e2??s logged videos once he got off the first possible planet for life that made 24 Earth years go by was by far my favorite part of the film. Maybe it\u00e2??s because I was sitting in my tears by the end or maybe because of my prolonged crush on Casey Affleck who played the son once he got older, but whatever it was it stood out to me the most. It was raw, real, and the first incarnation of the movie\u00e2??s ultimate end message which in my eyes was love answers and solves all.\n \nAwwww, we got all sappy! How sweet. No, but really go see this movie. I am not talking renting it on demand next Spring in your PJs on a rainy day because you need to be mentally prepared for this. I am talking get in your car, mentally prepare yourself, drive to an IMAX theater, get a bag of popcorn (large because THREE HOURS PEOPLE), and experience this movie. That is the only word I can give it\u00e2??it is an experience.",

            "content": "So close to perfection, but just not there. As Christopher Nolan gets closer to fifteen years of directing his efforts continue to improve, resulting in what in my opinion is his finest film yet. Interstellar reminds me very much of Robert Zemeckis's Contact in how close it comes to perfection, but left a handful of critics with a sour taste in their mouth. What do I think that did that? That it WAS edging perfection, but just really seemed to lack something. Was it the acting? Well you could hardly call it weak. Strong performances from Oscar winners and nominees McConaughey, Hathaway, and Chastain made it incredibly difficult to choose a stand out performer, but to my surprise (despite my loathing of most chid actresses), i have to give that to the barely 14 year old Mackenzie Foy (since i can't give it to the robot). To my delight she did what most child actresses are unable to do. She portrayed emotion without making me angry, and actually made me care for her. In fact the only weak note I found with the acting was, much to my surprise, Caine. More of a lack of a character actually, I found it hard to believe that someone like him was capable of doing what he did. Was it the story? Very simply put, no. Nolan, par usual, wrote and directed like the most seasoned of all directors. Was it the visual/audio? God no, every moment of Interstellar was a masterful example of how a director can use modern technology to advance his film, and another classic Zimmer soundtrack that unfortunately seems might be one of it's only chances at an oscar. Then what was it? Well you could argue the lack of a love interest, you could argue that its too long and lost peoples interest, and you could even argue that the story didn't make sense, but nobody seems to be able to put their finger on the problem. The only problem I see, is like 2001 a Space Odyssey one of the greatest films of all time and didn't even win best picture, Interstellar is ahead of it's time, and like with 2001, one day people will look back at it and ask how it did that boyhood, or birdman movie win best picture instead of it.

Other times trying to create drama about problems with quantum physics. It needed about 75% of the ideas chucked out and to get back to simple storytelling, and to decide what that story is.

I loved the juxtaposure of two world-stands: living for a great, noble idea and living for the human contact, for the family. We should learn how to balance both and transfer energy from one to another. Besides, it's a homage to any director who spends much time away from home so he can create meaningful experiences like Interstellar certainly is. The science is good and believable, the insights about human nature are well-placed and relevant. It is ground-breaking in its cinematography aswell as in Nolan's grit to deal with a subject calm-headedly, with respect.

            "content": "This review is chalk full of spoilers.  You have been warned.\n\nVisually, it was well done.  It was pretty to watch.  But no amount of direction can distract me from the Gargantua sized plot holes in this sucker.  Putting aside the overly technical \"scientific\" stuff like time travel, hibernation sleeps where they stopped aging, the seemingly magical fuel that lasts for over 2 years of continuous movement through space with multiple landings and take-offs, none of the motivations make any sense to me.  The entire happy ending of the movie was based on Plan A, but the existence of plan A didn't make logical sense.  I fail to see Professor Brand Sr.'s advocation of building this giant spaceship that (as far as he's sure) will never work.  Why would he ever think that sinking the entire planet's limited resources into this ship, that only a handful of people even know about anyway, would be a good use of resources?  It just does not compute in my brain and I cannot understand Caine's character's motivation.\n\nThen there's Plan B, which we're told is the \"real\" hope for the planet; sending a bunch of frozen embryos up into space to start a new population that way.  We're ensured that they made sure to include lots of genetic diversity...what they did NOT ensure was that they sent enough women up on the spaceship to actually act as surrogates for all these embryos.  One woman.  That's it.  One woman is tasked with birthing a new population?  With the low success rate of IVF under the best of circumstances, let alone in space without any dedicated equipment or conception specialists, they were literally putting all of their eggs in one \"basket.\"  Assuming she does manage to get pregnant every time she's implanted and is quite happy to be barefoot and pregnant, space style, AT BEST the fate of womankind is to be no better than glorified breeding mares for at least the next several hundred years.  Whoopee.\n\nThese are just the most glaring problems with the overall plot (again, ignoring the technicalities of all the \"science\"), but the entire movie is so inconsistent with character motivations that it was distracting and completely jarred me out of the movie experience.  Hathaway dooms them to losing an extra 10 years or so when she decides to run AWAY from the giant wave that comes every hour or so and destroys everything so that she can retrieve the data.  WHY WOULD THEY NEED THAT DATA?!  Clearly this planet is not going to support our new humanity, would with the 70 story tall waves every hour.  What is her motivation supposed to be here?  Then, in another fine example of the insidious sexism in this movie she has to be damsel-in-distress carried back to the ship by the robot TARS (who, by the way, is the only character I actually understood the motivation for and found appealing.)  Silly women, when will they learn.  Later she waxes poetic about how her great love for Edmunds is probably some \"science\" that we just don't understand yet pointing us towards the right path.  I literally scoffed out loud.\n\nAnd Matt Damon...what?  What was his end game?  So he was sick of being alone, so he decided to commandeer the....empty space craft?  O....kay... The best part of that whole planet was when he was blown up mid-pompous sentence.  Sadly, the token black guy was (of course) killed on this planet as well, which is unfortunate because after TARS he was my favourite character.  I am still completely unclear on how that explosion came about though....did Mann somehow rig the robot to explode?  It's possible they explained this and I just missed it, but if his end game was to commandeer the space craft and leave them behind anyway, then what was the point of the bomb?\n\nFinally, the hail Mary that saves humanity is McConaughey transmitting the necessary quantum data to Murph over time using the second hand of the watch he left with her.  Now, I'm not a physicist, but wouldn't it take a hell of a long time to transmit that much data in morse code?  I can't imagine that that would be a tiny amount of data.  Also, all the views into the room were her as a child, and the watch was not morse coding, so how did it just happen to start doing it when she started watching it?  How does she know that this is the beginning of the message and not the middle of such a large message.  We never saw the adult Murph in the room from McConaghey's perspective...\n\nFinally, somehow Magical McConaughey survives traveling through a singularity.  Again, I am the first to admit that I am not a physicist of any kind, but I am fairly confident that there's no way that could ever happen.  They should have just killed McConaughey off.\n\nIn short, a huge disappointment of a movie that barely hangs together.",

            "content": "I will re-watch this once I get a hold of a copy. The cinematography is generally stunning; I stopped once mid-film to notice how tense I was. Then Matt Damon popped up and I was like \"wuh?\" Indeed, Matt Damon seems to blast into the film only to complicate things and just as quickly he blows an O-ring and explodes.  The short arc that features Damon and the tension between epic and romance vis academic dishonesty and honesty is as provocative as it is short and left unexplored. Anyway, the film's most phenomenal feature is its thematization of time via relativity theory. This sturdy theme really carries the film though it doesn't seem to mean much in the end.\n\nNow I am no physicist, but the bookshelf-shaped anomaly that began the movie, the signal from the 5th dimension, seemed a bit distracting. From the very little I know and can casually discover on the internet, gravity is a good medium for a dramatic event that revolves around the fifth dimension. However, it might have been just a bit overkill. In some sense, this movie is bookended by odd and needlessly inexplicable concepts. I hope that over-elaborate-for-the-purpose-of-being-correct science fiction plots aren't the way of the future. I will certainly be sad if science fiction loses its capacity to comment on society and human foibles because writers and audiences begin to mistake scientific plausibility for artistic excellence. The most nightmarish dystopia is one in which my students' insipid thesis statements are vindicated by all contemporary art (\"Moby Dick is a great work of art (or \"is relatable\" BARF) because Melville tried to be very accurate about whaling practices\"). BARF BARF. \n\nI like this movie almost as much as I like Contact, my favorite movie and a perfect example of a film with a fairly well-crafted science fiction premise and a meaningful artistic project.  Ellie's faithless empiricism nearly prevents her from being the first human being to journey through a wormhole. Yet, only faith can corroborate her claims about her journey. \n\nLike Contact, Interstellar is epic. Though I would have enjoyed learning more about humanity at this epic's conclusion. Instead, after watching this great film I learned that Matt Damon, once frozen, should never be thawed out.",

Interstellar is a visionary possibility of the future that the world might hold. And it was glorious.\n\nThe premise is thus: The world as we know it is coming to an end. A team of Explorers are finding possibilities of leaving the Earth in search for planets able to support our necessities. Our story follows an ex-astronaut who rejoins them in a grand expedition throughout the possibilities outside of our galaxy.\n\nI have to say, I love this movie. This was easily one of the best movies of 2014 for me. The acting here was great. Everyone's contribution just seemed superb. It was mesmerizing. I felt connected with these people since the first 10 minutes.\nThe world is alive with colour. The visuals are very impressive and very easily to lose yourself in them. This is why I harass a lot of movies with CGI; because when movies like these that come out and look great, this (and more possible outcomes) are the best to see.\n\nThe story-line is immense. It teaches a very profound possibility into the future of mankind. It is suspenseful, long, and riveting. Some can find it boring; since most of the movie focuses on the suspense and the longitude of the movie rather than the action. I digress.\n\nI recommend this movie to the fullest. I great spectacle to behold. Also, bring a butt cushion, because the sucker is about 2 hours 40 minutes long.\n\n10 out of 10.",

The inhabitants of Earth have turned to farming, as a sort of futuristic \"dust bowl\" has swept across the lands, devastating everything in its wake. Though the dust bowl is left unexplained (for good reason) it is an interesting way for Nolan to explore what future generations may have to go through, assuming the current one doesn't get its act together. After becoming comfortable with all of the characters on Earth, Cooper is sent into space with Brand (and two other characters I don't remember) to locate three planets that could possibly support life.\n\nThis movie is a technical feat. Nolan has always delivered in effects, always trying to make things look as real as possible. This means that Nolan generally tries to use practical effects, rather than CGI. And this becomes quite apparent throughout the film (he makes it pretty obvious in many scenes, such as when Cooper drives a truck through a corn field). The beauty and scale of the movie also really make the audience feel like the film is indeed an epic masterpiece.\n\nThough the movie boasts a very interesting story with excellent characters, the movie cannot be the true masterpiece it aspires to be. The theme of \"love is the only force that transcends dimensions\" is very cheesy and, honestly, done very poorly. The theme feels more like excessive weight that doesn't strengthen the movie, but bogs it down. I also have big problems with the how the movie resolves itself. From the first five minutes of the movie, I knew exactly what the plot twist was going to be. The movie was not subtle and made everything far too obvious. Though I didn't know HOW the movie was going to resolve itself right from the beginning, I knew after about an hour in when they introduced the black hole.\n\n(possible SPOILERS in the final paragraph)\n\nPlot twist aside, what really bothered me about the ending was the execution. The last fifteen minutes of the movie are utter garbage in every way. I only gave this film 4 out of 5 stars because I tried to forget how bad the ending was. The end of the movie is an unnecessary epilogue that ruins everything the movie was working toward. The true end of the movie, in my opinion, was when Cooper entered the black hole and finished his mission. The movie really should have ended when the screen slowly faded to white as a smile slowly developed on Cooper's face.",

This one is no different. \n\nI don't know how people didn't like this movie. I actually really like the ending, even though most people did not like it.

Sometimes it misses, but it is still a great movie no matter the flaws. \n\nThe one problem I had was the length. I thought that it could've been just a little bit shorter. If it was about 10 minutes shorter, I still would've been happy. But that is one thing Nolan does is make long movies. But unlike Michael Bay, Nolan can make long movies good.

With the plot so far out, the soul so profound and the subject matter so inspiring, only a master like Nolan could build the narrative to such insane heights, wrap things up sufficiently and still find times to move us to tears and drop our jaw by showing us things we never thought possible. Interstellar is a vivid, captivating, all-consuming assault on the senses. And the viewer is absolutely at the core of the experience. Each element has been created and tuned to allow you to express yourself anyway you wish, and give you just enough breadcrumbs to figure out the script's secrets on your own.

That comes down to a lack of imagination for a movie that borrows from multiple sources, has some seriously loopy physics and worst of all did not need its earth bound first act and accompanying incomplete world building, nor its extended epilogue which probably did not happen anyway, supported by at least one line of dialogue.(It gives an explanation, not the explanation for how Cooper found NASA.)

It has easily become one of my favorites of the year thanks to its great performances, beautiful visuals, and one of Hans Zimmer's best scores.\n\nSometime in the last few years, Matthew McConaughey has turned into an incredibly talented actor (yeah I didn't think I would ever type those words either). A lot of people scuffed at him playing an astronaut, but he works great in the world the Nolan's made. In this world, mankind doesn't need men to fly space shuttles anymore, but grow corn instead, and he fits in that mold perfectly as a pilot turned farmer.\nOne of the other people joining McConaughey on his journey through the stars is Anne Hathaway, an actress who continues to impress with each new role I see her in. She continues to do an excellent job with her role in Interstellar.\nAnother performance worth mentioning would be Bill Irwin as the voice of the robot TARS, whose simplistic design was fantastic and I like they didn't try to go to complicated with it. TARS is one of the few times you will get to chuckle in an emotionally heavy movie.\n\nDespite how much I loved the movie, I do admit it does have its faults so I can understand where some of the people who disliked it are coming from.\nThe audio is incredibly loud, so much so that some of the dialogue becomes hard to hear (I didn't really have a problem because often the parts that were muffled were repeated later). I do like how those moments contrasted the silence of the exterior moments of the ship in space, so I didn't mind them.\nThe third act was a bit hard to swallow (which happens with Nolan sometimes). I found myself asking \"Really? That's the answer\" a few times, but it at least made sense and isn't something you'll see coming a mile away. It took a little bit to convince me, but I ended up accepting it because I enjoyed the movie so much.\nEven with those problems, I still enjoyed it. It's a powerful film and I felt emotionally drained after watching it. Which, for me, feeling something so powerful is a sign of a fantastic movie experience. If you have the opportunity, I recommend seeing it in IMAX. The expansive space, planet, and landscape shots make the experience well worth the added money. It is almost a clich\u00e9 description, but I can't think of any other way to describe Interstellar other than...breathtaking.\n\n9 Reels Out of 10\n\n\"We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.\"",

I also really liked the robot tars he will be a very memorable character, but I have to say the best acting performance in this movie goes to Jessica Chastain she  killed it in her role. I thought John Lithgow Was pretty good as well haven't seen him in a long time.\nMicheal Caine played Micheal Caine as usual but he seems to be pretty good at doing this I kept feeling like he was Alfred to McConaugheys Batman.lol.\nsadly though there were alot of weak performances as well especially by Matt Damon who feels lifeless, Casey Affleck, David Gyasi, and omg the always terrible Topher Grace somebody pull a Paul Walker on this guy and help us clean up Hollywood of its trash. once again lol.\nThe Directing on this film was Great as we have come to expect from Chris Nolan add in some really good writing and production mix in some stunning visual effects and great sound editing with a pretty decent score and you get this a very well made movie which should be enjoyed and not over analyzed. Other then a few weak acting moments, some really loud noises and the runtime, the only other problem I had with this movie was that it suffered from what I call the Lord of the Rings ending, which is when the movie presents many points where it can end perfectly and leave you guessing or feeling good about it but doesn't and just keeps going presenting more questions that you have to answer but you don't know why. I kept feeling like no.... what? end now i like this ending haha \n\noverall I recommend this movie 100% worth the watch if you have 3 hours to spare. It's gonna look great on Blu-ray.  \n8 out of 10",

Nolan again demonstrates his unique ability to discuss complex subject matter, and simultaneously build a powerful narrative that can engage all audiences.  The complexity actually goes up a notch from Inception, and despite trying to make it as simple as possible for laymans, bringing along a mate with a Phd in Astrophysics will certainly help.\n\nFor those who simply saw Inception as a 'good film', Interstellar will again rank as a 'good film'.  This takes nothing away from the brilliance of the subject matter, in building a thought provoking discussion.  In some ways, I feel that this could have been built as a trilogy, which would have allowed for more self contained narrative structures, in a similar way to what Gravity achieved.\n\nRegardless, if only for the intellectual thought process behind it, you should watch this movie.  :)",

It's very clearly inspired by 2001, so your opinion on that one is a decent chart of how you'll feel about Interstellar.\nPersonally, I'm sort of split.  It's certainly a well-made film; the imagery is stunning and at times awe-inspiring, the performances are excellent (especially by McConoughy, who is proving himself as an actor with surprising force lately), and Nolan's tension filled hyper-real scenarios are as effective as ever.\nStill, it's a flawed film, especially if you're not usually into this sort of thing.  The science jargon can become exhausting, and around the third act the film starts to overstay its welcome.  Additionally, for as much as they over-explain things, there's a surprising lack of clarity in the story quite frequently.\nThis isn't Nolan's best film, not by a long shot.  It is beautiful to look at, and has enough emotional investment towards the characters to carry us through; but it's overlong and overcomplicated.  I liked it well enough, especially when it addressed the complicated nature of aging in space (something rarely shown in fiction).  It's an okay film that overreached its grasp.",

As soon as she started on about this, I was thinking \"bleurghhh, stop talking, you're ruining the movie\". Luckily McConaghy's character thought much the same thing and quickly cut her off.\n\nMovies that make me think are my favourite movies. This kept me thinking all the way through and for hours afterwards, including some probably valuable self-reflection. \n\nIt's probably because of the subject matter, but it's a 4-star for me, absolutely brilliant.",

So I for one was optimistic anyway, since I've adored the majority of Nolan's films so far.\nThis pros to this film is everything but the characters and story but that's just personal taste.

It worked for me. But for some it was terrible. Then again it is another opinion. The overall plot is Earth is drying and Coop (Mcconaughey) has to leave his children behind and find a new place to live in another galaxy. The visualls are stunning and the score is breathtaking. Overall Interstellar is great but it has nitpicky flaws thus 4,5 stars.",

            "content": "I have to say, I had pretty heightened hopes going into seeing this film. Those hopes were there for many reasons. Here are a few:\n\nIt's the first big sci-fi film to hit theaters since Elysium, and that was several years ago.\nIt's a Christopher Nolan film.\nIt's the next film in the Matthew McConaughey McConaissance, following Mud, Dallas Buyers Club, True Detective and The Wolf of Wall Street. All of which were great, and you should check them out if you haven't had a chance to yet.\nThe cast in general. Not only do you have McConaughey, but there's also Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and the creepy guy from American Beauty (the boyfriend who video taped the plastic bag blowing in the wind).\nSo, as you can see, I had pretty high expectations going in. This film was going to change sci-fi cinema for me. Well, the question you're probably asking yourself right now is: \"Did it?\" And the answer to that is: \"Well, yeah. I think it did.\"\n\nNow before you go saying that I said Interstellar is the best movie ever, let me go a little more into detail in what I mean when I say \"I think it kinda changed sci-fi cinema,\" what I'm really saying is, \"it might change sci-fi cinema.\" Or more accurately, it might renew an appreciation for a long lost genre. Because when viewed by anyone who's seen 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Sphere, or Sunshine, or The Thirteenth Floor or Dark City, it becomes clear that this film is following the classic conventions of sci-fi, and it's doing a great job. There's scientist on a mission to save a dying planet, there's robots with personalities, there's dangerous foreign environments, there's science talk of black holes and relativity--which Neil deGrasse Tyson has said the film \"Let's you experience [it] like no film has before.\" (in the movie relativity works as a  sort of unwanted time travel, people on Earth age faster than the people on the ship when they embark on certain planets in another galaxy). So all the things we want in an epic sci-fi film are here, and the best part is, Nolan makes it feel believable. He grounds the film in the father-daughter relationship, it's what becomes the heart of this movie.\n\nMy hope is that Interstellar will inspire other writers and directors to tackle the sci-fi genre with more vigor than just another post apocalyptic film starring 20 somethings as 17 somethings. After all, the working world is populated by adults, we deserve some adult movies, and this my friends, I am happy to report, is an adult movie. It's a must see. Get out there and get your ticket. But stay home if you hate robots and space ships. You'll find Katniss next door.",

            "content": "Wow! Interstellar is an incredible odyssey that takes off, goes boldly into new territories, and never lets up! Astonishing and daring, it boldly goes where no sci-fi flick has gone before.\n\nEarth is ravaged by dust storms. Food and resources are limited. Our American Everyman, played convincingly by Matthew McConaughey, stumbles his way into a research facility and onboard a mission to venture out into the universe in the hopes of finding worlds that can sustain life. But time is limited. Choices must be made. Everything is at risk. Can he succeed in this mission? Can he also find his way back home? How will things pan out in the far reaches of space?\n\nI admire Christopher Nolan for his efforts in keeping the intellectual mind, emotional heart, and adventurous spirit of film alive, which really shows here. Breathtaking visuals and interesting staging bring a visceral experience you don't want to miss, further elevated by a transcendent score from Hans Zimmer. The main principals perform commendably in fleshing out their characters. Entertainment is delivered with aplomb, providing its chuckles, thrills, chills, and awe-inspiring moments. Deeper themes are also discovered within this cinematic realm. I personally think the film works on numerous levels, whether it's a search for hope, a pondering of faith and logic, an exploration of the human condition, or a study of choices and bonds. Many surprises arrive, bound to bring genuine ubiquity to the table as well as support its ambition to be a true venture into the unknown.\n\nHowever, the film struggles from its emotional detachment. A degree of this is necessary in order to be consistent with the transcendentalist tone set here. However, it's in full tilt, which makes us feel less invested in the characters than in the mechanics of the ride. This also comes at the expense of a daddy-daughter relationship that is integral to the core of the film. There's also a sense of heavy-handedness within this film, making the soft moments extremely soft that it's hard of hearing and banging very hard and loud on the cannons when the film puts us in enthralling situations. A little extreme, eh?\n\nJust for the experience alone, it shoots up to being one of the greatest films of the year as well as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of our time...",

I feel like this movie was inspired by the movie Signs and recent Marvel hero flicks cause of all the obvious tie ins.  Still think this movie was pretty good and I wished that there could have been more scenes of the space ship doing stuff in space.  Most shots of the ship were from a rear view perspective, which was cool, but could have been shot from different places as well.  I also have this theory that coop actually didn't go back to his original home but an alternate universe where he traded places with another coop.  I know that sounds crazy.  You just can't watch these Nolan movies without believing something else going on behind the obvious. I give this movie a 4 out of 5.  Great story, Fantastic visuals, and fresh perspective on love is what gives this movie a fun time experience.  Go see it and tell me I'm wrong.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has built a strong reputation in the industry as one of its finest directors, having proven himself time and again on films such as the 'Dark Knight' trilogy and 'Inception.' He uses his tried and true approach on the marathon intergalactic drama 'Interstellar,' achieving mixed results. 'Interstellar' begins in the not too distant future, when famine and dust storms are widespread and it's clear humanity as we know it is quickly ceasing to exist. The story revolves around a pilot-turned-farmer named Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) who is recruited by genius Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who heads up a secretive NASA to leave his two young children to go on a mission to a far away galaxy in search of an Earth-like planet that could serve as a second home for the human race.\n\nThe gravity of the plot is enough to suck people into 'Interstellar,' but it's not enough to keep them engaged throughout the 169-minute runtime. Sure, there are plenty of action-packed sequences that come with any space journey, from near-death experiences on waterlogged and frozen wasteland planets to just the sheer challenge of surviving with other people along the way. On the acting front, McConaughey does reasonably well despite his mumbling stumbling southern drawl, and Anne Hathaway's no-nonsense Dr. Brand makes for a good character onscreen. Perhaps the best performance comes from Jessica Chastain, whose portrayal of There are also a host of familiar faces in minor roles, from John Lithgow to Ellen Burstyn and William Devane to Topher Grace, plus an unexpected Matt Damon sighting.\n\nOf course, acting is not everything. 'Interstellar' suffers from long, drawn out scenes that could easily be condensed, and while there is definitely an element of mind-bending scenarios explored, some of the things that unfold as part of the story are too much to take in. Despite these missteps, 'Interstellar' does boast some quality CGI, which should not go unnoticed.\n\nWhile it does not quite live up to its massive expectations, 'Interstellar' gives audiences a lot to think about long after the credits roll.",

            "content": "Of the films this fall, the one people seem to be most excited about is Interstellar. Not a big surprise: Christopher Nolan has ripped the big-budget filmmaking championship belt away from Steven Spielberg since the start of the new millennium, peaking with the Dark Knight/Inception. Interstellar, like Nolan's second tier efforts, is breathtaking to look at, and just misses its high due to holes in the story's foundation. I mean, I like Matthew McConaughey, but I can't believe he'd be a NASA pilot.\n\nIn some unspecified part of the future, a blight has slowly been destroying the crops on Earth. The earth is dying, including for farmers  Cooper (McConaughey), dad Donald (John Lithgow), Coop's son Tom (Timothee Calamet), and daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Donald and Tom are resigned to their fate, but Cooper and Murph are dreamers, believing in ghosts and space. One night, the pair happenstance on a NASA project led by Cooper's old mentor, Professor Brand (Michael Caine). With the Earth dying, NASA found 3 worlds through a wormhole, and wants Cooper to fly the mission with other crew members Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Brand (Anne Hathaway), the Professor's daughter. Cooper decides to pilot the mission, leaving his kids behind, knowing that wormhole science could mean age acceleration for Earth and possibly missing his kids growing up.\n\nInterstellar unapologetically references 2001: A Space Odyssey. It wants to be considered THAT good among the sci-fi elite. The movie's story is the weak link. It does have some parts that get it in the vicinity, especially grounding the space story in real pathos. The Cooper/Murph relationship is set up very nicely, with Murph clearly seeing her father as a hero and her best friend. The wormholes distort time in a way the audience can understand (Event Horizon can sue for a shot by shot remake), and the effect of the time warping are rapid and emotionally jarring. The hour or so build up to Cooper's fateful decision makes the separation painful and real. However, as the movie enters the wormhole, the plot is stuck between two worlds. It never quite builds successfully upon the effects of the Murph/Coop split until too late, and the space relationships were clearly left on the cutting floor to keep the running time below 3 hours, truncating any emotional effectiveness. As such, any parallels between humanity and science and space travel feel unearned, forcing Interstellar's science under the critical microscope, which will Neil DeGrasse Tyson will rip to shreds. Interstellar gets its main relationship right, and coasts on awesome special effects to cover up its logic leaps.\n\nInterstellar needs to be seen in the theater, preferably IMAX. The space travel is a spectacular creation. Nolan built several machines to simulate spaceflight without a green screen. The first images of the spacecraft passing Saturn are breathtaking in scope. The wormhole flight is pretty intense and Kubrickian. Ever wonder what a giant tidal wave looks like?  You won't anymore. Nolan even works a black hole into the proceedings. Each world is milked for maximum grandeur in either beauty or inhospitability.  Nolan is one of the best at getting an audience to marvel at the wonders he gives life, then unleashes them on the main characters. The director knows how to milk something as simple as a space station docking for maximum dramatic effect.\n\nMatthew McConaughey finally got to save the human race; good for him. His performance here has been described by others as a glue for the story as a whole, an apt description. McConaughey gets the audience to buy in on the pain of leaving his family and how every lost second weighs on him. This pain propels him forward to get the job done and keeps people riveted to the screen. There's lots of talent on screen here supporting the chill Texan - Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, John Lithgow, David Gyasi, and Wes Bentley (plus a fun secret). All of the actors on hand give their all, but the big key here is Mackenzie Foy, who has about an hour to sell how much she loves her father before they get ripped apart, and then sell the pain and anger towards him. Foy delivers in all of her scenes with the Oscar winner; although it's easy to get the audience on your side of you're a sad little girl, Foy sells love and sadness better than Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine here.\n\nI really wanted Interstellar to be my 2001. I like the Kubrick film, but it has too many flaws for me to put it among the elite. Nolan will have to settle, like 2001 for me, to be a stellarly crafted visual masterpiece with a story in need of another draft. We now know that Alfonso Cuaron + Sandra Bullock is greater than Christopher Nolan + Matthew McConaughey.",

I hope a lot of people like it, as I wouldn't want all that effort and commitment to go to waste, so just ignore my opinion! Go and watch it and make up your own mind!",

HOW EVER! There are alot of flaws with the movie. What really bummed me out is the fact that it is such a good film, almost perfect up untill about 1hr 20 mins into the film. it gets alot more boring, and poluted with very complex science but like i said Matt Damon performs a great role, and i really liked him, but then he died, and that chapter of the movie was over, and that was a great chapter of interstellar. also after that, matthews kids start getting more involved with the plot, and this is the worst part about the movie, i hated casey afflecks character and his whole family which is his wife, and son. i hate them all, didnt make himself and his family better for the audience. jessica chastain was a great casting choice, and has a breakthrough performance, but her man in the film, played by topher grace is so boring, dull, horribly acted, useless and just strait up cringe worthy in everything he does, im surprised he is in a Nolan film. cant stand him. but this films twist redeems the whole movie. the last 40 minutes of the film is so amazing! and it was my favorite part about the film. its kind of heartfelt, and i really enjoyed the way nolan and the writers really handled the ending. but i was expecting alot more from this film, kind of disapointed, but i really thought that matthew should have gotten an oscar for this role, he was amazing and played the role perfectly, the oscars really snubbed him, i dont get why. check out interstellar if you already havent, its worth a watch",

On a technical level this movie is a masterpiece, the real science behind the sci-fi makes this a future that seems truly plausible. For me it's the story that doesn't fully rise to the high level of the rest of the film, the narrative doesn't flow smoothly (pacing might gave been improved by leaving another 20+ minutes on the editing floor) and I've always found the end a bit jarring. Still, I have great respect for Nolan's ambition and Interstellar is well worth your time.

It starts off slow, the last 10 minutes are kind of wishy-washy, there are several plot holes and underwritten characters, etc., and yet it was an experience unlike any other I have seen, magnified by a 94-foot screen and booming sound system. There's a profound beauty to Interstellar that is literally out of this world that is hard to describe to someone who hasn't seen it. Nolan pairs the breathtaking visuals with hard sci-fi talk of wormholes, fifth dimensions and such, along with his humanistic philosophies involving mankind's continuing evolution and quest for love, which never quite fully connect together but certainly offers plenty to chew on. Meanwhile, Matthew McConaughey makes for a solid anchor on our journey into the beyond and back. Nolan aims for the stars on Interstellar, and though he may not reach them, he comes close.",

Our facial expressions are so heavily influenced by how we THINK we should look based on emotional representations in visual media.  Is this how people look when they're experiencing emotions?  Even if not, I just wanna look like Matthew McConaughey all the time!\n\n\"Interstellar\" is the only Christopher Nolan movie I've liked since \"Memento.\"  This sprawling space and time saga is set in the nearly apocalyptic future where food is scarce, farming is an essential though still blue-collar career, NASA has become SNASA (Secret NASA), and the smoonlanding (secret moonlanding) is thought to have been faked.  Cooper is an aeronautical pilot tapped for a dangerous mission of indefinite duration to find new life-sustaining planets.  His young daughter never quite forgives him for leaving, and his quest is one of survival and return.  \n\nI especially love the scene of Coop driving away in a cloud of dust, underscored by the space shuttle countdown.  Mackenzie Foy as young Murph is sweet and teary, and Jessica Chastain deftly takes her into adulthood as a tough yet tender space crusader.  Surprise Matt Damon (the best kind of Matt Damon) is tender and menacing as the \"destroyer of worlds\" - a recurring motif that I enjoy in Nolan's work.  \n\nThe movie has its nonsensical flaws, of course.  Wes Bentley's character is killed off way to quickly and anticlimactically because emotional plot point.  The one equation to save humanity is a mere deus ex machina McGuffin.  It's not explained in any plausible, scientific manner; we just have to roll with it. And dat Anne Hathaway doe.  So melt-your-face-off-brilliant in \"Les Miserables,\" yet so full of nothing in this.  Dr. Brand has gumption written into her, but Hathaway can't infuse enough life into a character with no compelling purpose or motivation beyond blah-blah-save-the-human-race-blah-blah-love-conquers-all.",

But for those of us into that kind of thing, Interstellar tastefully leverages experimentally verified science (like relativity) and theoretical science (like wormholes) to tell a story about people and what it means to be human.\n\nI also liked:\n* The robots. One of my favorite depictions of a working relationship between capable AI and humans. Also, great comedic relief\n* Depiction of future technology. Seemed like the movie was set towards the end of the 21st century. The tech was progressive, but seemed attainable 60 years from now, even for a somewhat apocalyptic society.\n* Theme of the supernatural just being something natural that you don't understand.\n* Visuals.

I think the realism captured adds a lot to the film and because of that it dose not look like Star wars or Star Trek where you know its not real (a physicist was consulted to insure that everything shown and done in the film are possible according to the laws of physics except for a few minor details). It really seems that the events of the movie could very well one day be reality or at least something similar. McConaughey as always steals the screen with a strong supporting cast including Anne Hathaway , Michael Cane, Jessica Chastain and John Lithgow.

The film's extreme length allows for moments of melodrama and pointless exposition to seep into the narrative, which causes the picture to stall in the second half.  Nolan borrows heavily and unsuccessfully from the late Stanley Kubrick's 2001 masterpiece rather than etching out his own path.  \n\nI'm not sure what has happened to Hans Zimmer, but his music score is aggravating as it strains for effect.  I had the same problem with his music to Inception.  One more technical point, the sound mixing to this movie was wildly uneven.  It was hard to hear certain lines of dialogue at different moments in the movie.  I've read other reviews that have mentioned the same thing.  Lastly, Matthew McConaughy is the reason to see this movie.  He keeps it afloat all by himself because his performance is first-rate and thoroughly heart-wrenching.  I bought the character's angst and arch all the way to the end.  He deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  I wanted to love Nolan's latest picture, but I came away unimpressed.

There are few things worth spending emotional energy on in life. Family, eternity, space & earth are all worthy topics in my mind. This movie has them all. Very compelling & very well thought out. Powerful. It's not perfect, but in an age of emotionless & watered down Hollywood this movie was a breath of fresh air for me.",

Perhaps this can be sensed, because the film is rather creepy and the characters appear to be in a chronic state of depression. It is also a film that leaves you feeling depressed; it is an emotional ride in pursuit of a false hope. Most people would like to identify with those that are saved, but we know it would not be like that. In this film, being saved depends on love. Love changes everything, and even finds a new planet - in Hollywood, that is. The film toys with our real situation, and teaches that there is a second chance, even after everything, and your loved ones, are gone, something that we know we can't have. It does so very skilfully, so it should be approached with caution. A lot of people are seeing it. If only the same resources and talent had been put into a film to teach sustainability and equity. As it stands, the film is a spectacular advertisement for denuding the earth, leaving its silent, cooperative population to starve and perish, and launching a chosen few, suitably downbeat in style, and privileged in nature, onto a nice, clean new planet and an amazing, white picket fence space station, where they can play a nice, clean, white game of baseball.",

            "content": "Despite an ear-splitting soundtrack that often threatens to drown out important dialog, Interstellar is a profound hit, a love child of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Contact. Its effects are special, its casting top notch, and its meaning sufficiently ambiguous. In other words, this is a fairly typical Christopher Nolan movie.\n\nIn the movie, Earth is suffering through historic blight so bad that huge dust storms block out most sunlight and cause major breathing problems for the humans. (And probably the animals, too.) Such has been the sad state of affairs for some time; America in particular has become an agrarian society. Unfortunately, it's a failing society, and it's only a matter of time before the planet is uninhabitable by mankind.\n\nEnter ex-scientist/pilot Coop (Matthew McConaughey) who's now a single dad raising two precocious kids along with his father in law. Through a series of plausible coincidences, Coop and his daughter Murphy stumble upon plans to send a manned mission to another galaxy by use of a wormhole - and those in charge want Coop to be the pilot. The idea is that the spacecraft Endurance, piloted by Coop, will fly through the wormhole and land on one or more of three potentially life-sustaining (according to data sent back by probes) planets. Once a suitable planet has been located, citizens of Earth will be transported via space stations - assuming NASA scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) can solve the gravity-is-a-harsh-mistress problem.\n\nAboard the Endurance with Coop are scientists Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romily, and Doyle, along with robots TARS and CASE. That they do enter the wormhole and come out in a wholly different galaxy (the movie should have been called Intergalactic, right?) is not a spoiler. The trouble is that at least one of the three planet candidates is very close to a large black hole, ominously named Gargantua. What if this planet is the best alternative to Earth? Can't be safe to be so close to a black hole; luckily, the planet's mass is large enough to keep it from passing Gargantua's event horizon, so all is good. Well, good as I can make it without explaining what troubles Coop and crew run into, and that could ruin things for you, dear viewer.\n\nIt's possible some will find this movie to be a little overplotted (yet too vague), with a surfeit of exposition to help things along. This is necessary in part, though, because of two different timelines - that of Coop in the far-off galaxy and that of Murph back on Earth itself. And this is because of a time slip that Coop encounters that slows time for him relative to Earth time, to the tune of one outer-space minute equalling several years on Earth. \n\nAdmittedly, there were moments when I felt like I'd missed something - that's attributable to how quickly Nolan propels the plot and to how damnably loud the soundtrack is at times. Hans Zimmer's score is excellent, but clearly someone figured that turning it up to 11 was the way to go. I mean, why allow an intricate plot get in the way of booming, sweeping sounds?\n\nAlso, like Kubrick's 2001, the final twenty minutes can be puzzling. There's not much more that can be said about this that won't reveal something important. I found it fascinating and satisfying and in keeping with the rest of the movie. Perhaps not all loose ends are tied up at the end, but I'm one of those who feels that's a good thing. \n\nNolan's Interstellar is spectacle supported by solid science and a fertile imagination. If the Academy Awards included only five nominees for Best Picture, this film probably wouldn't make the cut - but it should be among the top ten for the year and thus earn such a nomination, along with some for sound and effects.",

But when we put it next to Inception or TDKR, it cannot stand up. And the reason for that is that there are not enough wow moments. In fact there is only one real wow moment and that happens while docking with the endeavour. Some of this is compensated by building a lot on the family relationships but its just not enough to push it into the 5 star bracket.

As such, it's unabashedly right up my alley - it is thoughtful, adult sci-fi fused with weighty character drama, both visually unique and conceptually brain-frying.

Yes, Matt Damon's portrayal was lacking and the dialogue was bad. I think the choppiness and other aspects that moviegoers found negative is because there was too much story crammed into the time frame. In my view, this story would have been great if told in a mini series of 6 or more hours. For example, a more in depth explanation of earth's problems and how they came about would have been interesting to set the stage. Also, unless you took physics 101 and 201, understanding the relativity issues might be a distraction. I thought that about 1/3 into the movie the dialogue got fast and complicated in trying to explain technical bits, and ignored proper character development that would have helped with the latter part of the plot about Plan A, Caine's character and Damon's character, and eventually some of the ending. Otherwise, a very thought provoking movie.",

The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a former military test pilot selected to lead an exploration mission to find earth a new home as it's slowly dying. The film costars Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jennifer Chastain, and a high A-list Hollywood actor that is meant as a cameo but actually has a big role in the movie. I'm not saying who it is in case you want a surprise. But McConaughey gives a heartfelt performance that finally allows me to say he's a great actor after discovering his talent in last year's Dallas Buyers Club. But that aside, Interstellar has amazing visuals, dramatic performances, an exciting plot, great character development, superb directing from Christopher Nolan who happens to be my favorite filmmaker, and a pounding score from Hans Zimmer. Interstellar surprised me, is a great film, and I highly recommend checking it out, especially in IMAX.",

            "content": "Interstellar is an outstanding depiction of the unimaginable: finding inhabitability beyond planet earth. Set in the future, Matthew McConaughey leads a team of space researchers through a wormhole billions of light-years away to find the best of three possible planets that earth's civilisation could be transported to as a global Dust Bowl renders the earth unliveable. \n\nThe film takes us on the space journey of a team of astronauts aiming to find a new inhabitable home and the difficulties that come along the way that pushes every astronaut to their highest limit - the possibility of never seeing their loved ones again. In an all-star Oscar-winning cast featuring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon, Michael Caine and Ellen Burstyn, Interstellar aims to rectify the often too many bog-standard sci-fi flicks with a good, enticing story but terrible acting that have come to define the genre. \n \nWhat is rarely displayed in this picture is the personal side of science. The astronauts make the heartbreakingly difficult decision to pursue their mission compromising their chances of seeing their family. Science isn't as clear-cut, simple and fact-driven as we may think. We really empathise with the astronauts on their plight across our solar system.\n\nIt's disappointing to see Anne Hathaway cast in this picture. Honestly, she is perfectly nice to look at. But she really contributes nothing to this picture other than being the daughter of the intellectual mastermind heading the mission from earth. Her acting ability is unnatural and not appropriate in what is a very serious movie. I mean she has come so far in what a career can achieve from the Princess Diaries movies, but I could see any other actor taking her place in this movie. I would have liked to have seen Maggie Gyllenhaal take on the role of Brand. I believe she would have been able to demonstrate a degree of vulnerability and empathy we needed to feel for her character that Hathaway was unable to convey.\n\nThe standout performance of this picture is Jessica Chastain. She is more than just an example, she is a leader in never giving up on a career as a struggling artist whose perseverance and talent has prevailed through an industry that is, apparently, focused more on making money rather than nurturing talent. \n\nBut what we all know that the 'McConnaissance' is in full swing. McConaughey is able to convey an allure of mystery and complexity required for such a character. Although I can't see McConaughey mastering comedic roles in the future (as we've seen from the unimaginative, predictable rom coms he starred in early in his career), he definitely nails these moody, disturbed and damaged characters in the last few years so well. \n\nJust to finish, I'm surprised this picture wasn't released in 3D. It's better than Gravity (both acting-wise and plot-wise) and the cinematic experience one can only imagine experienced of this movie in 3D in terms of time-shifting between galaxies and other worldly environments, 3D would, almost certainly, have created a unique viewing. I guess movie studios are really moving the motion picture industry in a new direction and Sci-Fi is back in fashion as we have seen in the high box office returns in Gravity and Interstellar and undoubtedly in the new Star Wars film next year.",

While Interstellar takes no shame in its influence from 2001 : A Space Odyssey (from narrative techniques and deliberate long shots to its score's hauntingly beautiful organ chords), it takes full advantage of modern sensibilities and hosts some spectacular deep-space thrills. What's more, as has been the case every time I've seen the man in a film thus far, it cements Matthew McConaughey as one of my favorite big stars working today.\nI must admit, however, the film isn't quite perfect. There are a handful of moments where the acting just doesn't reach the emotional heights that the story deserves, and the technobabble (though probably much more scientifically-backed than, say, Wars or Trek) can drag to the point of tedium and convolution. The ending, which I won't spoil, may also divide viewers depending on their expectations, though I imagine, much like Inception, this film will reward repeat viewings.\nThis all said, and much to the filmmakers' credit, these nit-picky moments cannot take away from how masterful the film is on a technical level. The truly great scenes aren't just great, nor are they scarce; there are probably half a dozen sequences that, through a miraculous combination of sight and sound, literally made my jaw drop. Flipping trucks and explosions are cool, but they don't make you cry and contemplate your existence (..unless you really like flipping trucks...then again, I do live in a world where you can hear someone claim the human-to-wolf transformation in New Moon is \"the most beautiful thing I've ever seen\" the same year Avatar came out.....moving on). \nInterstellar amounts to a satisfying (if occasionally flawed) epic of adventure, sacrifice, and humanity's place in the universe, and its highpoints confirm the existence of something that I can only call pure cinema. \nSee this in theaters.

I really don't know how I can truly explain just how BIG I mean when I say BIGGEST, this film has pulled out all the stop with regards to size, scale and stakes.\n\nInterstellar wears a lot of its influences with pride but it is when the drama and action kick into gear that is when Nolan pulls ahead of the pack by giving us large scale, all or nothing, do or die sequences. Whether it's a fist-fight on an icy planet, mid-space explosions or mountain-size tidal waves everything has been structured to make sure that you're not just on the edge of your seat but that you are holding your breath trying not to pass out from lack of oxygen.\n\nThe soundtrack, much like the rest of the film, borrows from other science-fiction\nmasterpieces and Hans Zimmer, as always, does an excellent job. The only real issue with the film though is the soundtrack. Often it is very overpowering and at times when important pieces of information are being delivered to the audience. Sometimes it was so loud that I could not hear what was being said and had no idea why a character was now doing what they were doing.\n\nTo read the full review click on the link below:\nhttp://tiny.cc/ar3tqx",

But you knew about relativity\" will stay with me for a while) but this is without doubt a very fine movie indeed. Actually a story of small, human interactions and relationships, Interstellar is played out against a proper Space Opera background. The plot unfolds slowly and deliberately, taking us from a small US farm during a major global crisis that threatens to doom the human race, out to a last ditch expedition to find a habitable planet. The thread that weaves this epic plot together is the story of Cooper, a one time test pilot, who has to make the agonising decision to abandon his family and home in order to try to save humanity. There's some forgivable pseudoscientific gobbledygook but Christopher Nolan manages to transcend this and carry the audience with him on this amazing voyage of discovery. There are some obvious comparisons to be made with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Nolan doesn't hide these or shy away from them. There are some nice nods to that film in both the concept and design. I did like for example, the realisation of the slab-like robots which hark back to 2001s monoliths. There's also the idea of unknown aliens trying to send a message to humanity. As with 2001, this is dealt with in a suitably cryptic manner which forms an important plot point. Special mention must also be made of the stunning soundtrack provided by Hans Zimmer. This is a fine example of the screen composers art and ably demonstrates what a master of this form Zimmer is. This movie won't be for everyone. There's no alien threat or rampaging monsters but rather it is a thought provoking fantasy about human endeavour and family bonds. I loved this film, feeling it more than lived up to the hype and it further demonstrates how good both Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey in lead roles when given material that they can rise to.",

Likewise seeing Interstellar on 70mm real IMAX was something to behold.  The story was not nearly as good as Dark Knight or Inception, but it had its moments and the visual story was impressive.  At times a little overpowering with music to tell us how we should be feeling, but at the same time, it was hard not to get caught up in it all.

However, a painfully predictable plot combined with a few too many overdrawn moments prevents Interstellar from transcending goodness to greatness.

As all the film's mystique seems lost, the finale attempts - with slight success - to bring back the awe and wonderment. The climax also brings a long overdue \"reveal\" which many viewers will have already figured out. This reveal is further drawn out by a borderline insulting play-by-play explanation unfit for a film attempting to be an intellectual journey. Interstellar finds itself hindered by its own ambitions. Falling short of high-brow and too complex to be considered mindless fun; Interstellar digs itself into a pit of displacement.

Another visually resplendent masterpiece which may not be his strongest film to date, but it is definitely one of the best science fiction films of the decade thus far (up there with \"Gravity\").\n\n\"Interstellar\" tells the story of a post-apocalyptic Earth, where food have become a scarcity, resulting in wars, population decrease and a general drop in way of life. When Cooper and Murphy start digging around a strange occurrence in their room, they come to a secret base holding the might of NASA. Cooper then ends up piloting a dangerous mission to find a new suitable planet for the inhabitants of planet Earth to occupy as their own homeworld slowly dies.\n\nThe film has a typically star-studded cast that includes a mixture of new faces and Nolan regulars. This cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Topher Grace and David Oyelowo. This cast, despite often being required to speak some convincing technobabble, eases into some often deep chararacters quite comfortably and make quite an unimaginable story feel so plausible.\n\nHelping the plausibility is the involvement of astrophysicist and author Kip Thorne as a scientific consultant. The film covers a lot of quite heady science, including wormholes, black holes, time distortion, general relativity, gravitational pull and 5-dimensional universes. In many movies, these films could be raised in a manner that would only confuse any but the most educated audiences, but Interstellar is able to accurately portray them while keeping the plot accessible to a layman audience.\n\nThe only issue I had with this film was some of the sound mixing. Supposedly, Nolan did this on purpose to accurately portray life in space, but it does, in my view, occasionally your mind out of the Interstellar world as you wonder whether the cinema/your home sound system has developed a fault.\n\nA brilliant space film. 9/10.",

The premise is simple enough.  What lies beyond our known dimensions?  As a human race, we are explorers.  Film is the perfect medium to imagine and explore such a question.  The knocks against the film are mainly film structure subjectiveness.  How anyone can tell such a broad and big idea and make it accessible to general audiences is an extremely difficult challenge.

Something disjointed almost cyclical. And he managed to do so with a power and emotion that I rarely see in movies.

I'm not giving spoilers, I think most people that made it through had some pharmaceutical or movie enhancing edibles to get them through, I did not. I love science-fiction and I'm huge fan of the genre and people that know me will tell you that I will watch just about anything to absorb the experience and see what the intentions of the writer and director were trying to accomplish. I don't know how something with so much money thrown at it could have achieved its initial success but if you read the critic reviews you'll see that they seem to know how bad it is but yet give the director of past because he is trying to preserve 70 mm film which I do appreciate. That is the only reason I went to see it was for the 70 mm film experience and that it said a window that covered three hours that I needed to fill. I love Matthew McConahay I don't think that they used him very well on this film.

All team with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway on the board will discover not only new worlds but also an unspoken truth. Interstellar combines action, universe, sense of humour, science and special effects into a great spectacle. Moreover the music causes matching atmosphere during watching the film. In my opinion an end is very unpredictable and makes that you would go willingly watch it again. If you look for a good science-fiction film, go and see for yourself.

            "content": "\"WOW\", \"What just happened\", \"Mind blown\". These are just some of the many phrases that came out of people's mouths after watching the movie Interstellar. Oscar nominated 3 times, Christopher Nolan, did an amazing job yet once again. Interstellar truly did live up to the standards and as always Christopher Nolan did not disappoint. This movie is not your average save the world find another planet kinda of movie. The movie plot was well thought out with an amazing storyline. if you have not seen this movie yet you must go see it now! it is truly mind-blowing. if you have seen Inception, another work by Christopher Nolan, then you must definitely watch this movie. \n\nThe movie starts off with a single father ,who is a farmer, Cooper with his two children and his own father. Cooper, along with his daughter, stumble upon a secret meeting and cooper is sent off to rescue planet earth. in this film our planet is devastated with famine and it will not be long until everyone starts dying off. it is up to cooper and 3 other scientists to find a suitable planet for everyone on Earth to live. a return back home is not guaranteed which leaves cooper's daughter heartbroken. \nThe casting for this movie was excellent. Matthew McConaughey  did an outstanding job and made every line believable. Mackenzie Foy did a great job as well. in this movie she played Murph the daughter of Cooper. Both her and McConaughey did a great job establishing a believable father-daughter relationship. \nThe cinematography for this film was out of this world. Fun fact many people may not know is that this film was filmed not using any green screen at all. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job because instead of using green screens they used projectors to project onto walls so that the actors could actually feel and see what they had to put on a great act. This is not a surprise that the cinematography for Interstellar was very good just like it was with Inception.  The crazy flips and turns of the cameras and edits were unbelievable. The fact that green screens were not used definitely made this movie amazing and very believable. \noverall, Christopher Nolan did a great job yet again. You can not go wrong with a movie choice that Christopher has worked on. every minute of the movie was well paced and kept you on the edge of your seat. It was great that even though this movie is lengthy, it did not drag out.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan is the director responsible for two (or three, arguably) modern movie masterpieces: 'Momento' and 'The Dark Knight'. Some may want to count 'Inception' in that category, but I will take a pass. I will also pass on 'Interstellar' - but not for lack of trying. \n'Interstellar' does everything a blockbuster should do. It does everything a sci-fi action/thriller should do. It does everything a cerebral film should do. It just doesn't do ANY of the singular things exceptionally well to the point of groundbreaking (see, 'Avatar'). This movie checks of all the boxes of what makes a great movie, but doesn't take us to that next level of movie-watching.\n\nThe story is that Earth is literally dying, and this time there is no coming back from the brink. Humans must leave the planet. Enter a group of pioneers sent into space to journey through a found wormhole. I love the very idea of this premise, but 90% of everyone is already lost lol. And that is where 'Interstellar' falls a bit short. For a science guy like me, deep space explorations is no new frontier; one can watch any number of space documentaries  on Youtube in full HDwith impressive computer simulations - or, the one can watch the excellent revamped 'Cosmos' series starring top physicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson (my favorite scientist lol). These shows explore the concepts of wormholes and black holes - dark energy and dark matter on a daily basis.  Nolan's film does the same - but hey, we get to see and hear this all the time on the internet. The film version offers a heart-wrenching family narrative to go along with it.\n\nThe TRUE star of 'Interstellar' is science. Mainly, gravity. Deep space is a terrifying place! Our scope of knowledge pales the further out we go; and once Quantum Physics enters into the equation, we know NOTHING. The laws of physics - of time, of space, of...EVERYTHING, changes at the quantum level. And all of that apparently happens near black holes. Once the action gets near a black hole things get very bizarre. That is where the film truly 'shines' (pun intended lol).\n\n For a film this EPIC in its scope and presentation it REEEALLY needed to push the cinematic envelope. 'Interstellar' deserves as much credit for its space-time cosmic physics as it does for its seamless CGI. The space scenes (and sound effects, I might add) are breathtaking - BUT, truth be told I was more Floored and Stunned by the perilous beauty of 'Gravity' - and that took movie place a mere few miles from Earth! For a movie that literally FOLDS SPACETIME in half and travels to distance galaxies (and at one point traveling INTO A BLACK HOLE!) - .I was still a bit underwhelmed. Not saying it isn't impressive, but it didn't break any new movie ground. Not in the same vein as say 'The Matrix' did back in 1999. Or 'Jurassic Park'.  \n\nFrom a critical point, the biggest slight against this movie was its tech-babble. Apparently people lose interest listening to how time bends and warps based on gravitational pull. I FIND THIS ALL FASCINATING! I actually enjoyed listening to the technicalities of interstellar travel - the effects of a giant black hole has on time as much as the next science lover. The REAL slight to this movie is that the general populace isn't nearly as scientifically literate as we SHOULD be - and that is a shame. Deep space travel is something that every developed nation on Earth should give credence to - a topic that came up in the movie.\n\nThe acting is effectively stirring and emotional. There are plenty of 'Oohs' and \"Ahhs!'. A few plot twists. A sarcastic (and extremely resourceful) robot brings  surprising humor to the 'weight' of the movie (pun intended) - and a guest appearance by an A-list actor added a nice surprise. Christopher Nolan's career cache is so remarkable that we expect to be WOWED every time out. \n\nOverall,  'Interstellar' is a masterful movie. Just not a Masterpiece.\nGRADE: B+",

McConaughey turns in one of the best performances that I have ever seen him give and his supporting cast (Hathaway, Caine, Affleck, Chastain, Bentley, and Damon) are also superb. The scientific aspects are fascinating and the science geek in me was very entertained for stretches. Nolan's depiction of the fall of humanity feels realistic (even if it's a tad preposterous) and hits home. Also, as McConaughey drifts further and further away from his family, you feel it. Well done, for the most part.\n\nThe Bad: At just under three hours, the film is too long. I personally don't usually mind lengthy films, but at times it feels drawn out for the sake of drawing it out ... especially near the end. Eventually, all the bad luck that the crew faces starts to wear on you. It feels near constant and also puts them in situations that they get out of by performing impossible feats or suddenly have a stroke of good luck instead. Lastly, the technical aspects will lose some. While I enjoy hearing people chat about time/space distortion, relativity, event horizons, and quantum physics ...

Incredible action scenes with a score that just ratchets it up an order of magnitude in drama - perfectly deployed score.

There are other things that can be nitpicked, sure. The huge reveal in the story is very telegraphed, it's slow-starting, the themes are stated really obviously through dialogue, there's a long section where the story seems to be falling apart. A couple of really huge physics plot holes. Does it suck? Of course not. It's awesome. But it's also not the greatest story ever told, though it is clearly trying to be. One pleasant surprise in this is Hathaway. I thought she would stick out like a sore thumb in a bad way, and she completely nails her role. This is a supreme case of a director going for the jugular and cramming a ton of intellect in, so it's really, really hard to distill into a review, but the basic point is, it's like The Fountain or Gravity, it's great because of its ambition, but unfortunately, it is also flawed because of that same ambition.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan guns to out-2001 2001, and (a bit unfortunately) to out-Contact Contact. To my considerable surprise, I feel as though he may have succeeded. This movie is one of grandiose scope, pitting the immensity of concepts like human extinction against deeply personal, intimate characterization carried by solid performances (with the odd exception of an inexplicably lazy and mumbling Michael Caine). The sense of stake and scope in this film is perpetual, with themes of loss, personal sacrifice, and the incredible risks at stake hanging over the proceedings like a funeral shroud for humanity. The scenic tension is amplified by excellent visual effects, a haunting and moving instrumental score, and interplay between both personal and macroscopic human affairs. It's a story of humanity clinging to survival by its very fingertips, and feels that way throughout. There is one unfortunate break in this tension, however: The film's gross misstep in making it clear that the matter is already settled. The use of \"documentary interview style\" footage near the beginning makes it clear, within the first handful of scenes, that everything works out, and it leaks the sense of anxiety like a crack in a space helmet. Even with this factored in, I still found myself strangely unsure, not quite able to fully invest faith that things would turn out all right when so much was going wrong.  Unfortunately, for a viewer less  caught up in the tone, this ambiguity isn't as likely to take hold. Nor are several science fiction cliches that are about as subtle and unpredictable as a landing strip. That said, the moving and human heart of the film, while treading at times into mawkishness, forms a strong foundation.",

Until this one! \n\nAt the one hour and 45 minute mark of this movie I started texting my daughter. This was our conversation. Me:  We are at the movie Interstellar. It;s boring and stupid and depressing. I guess you have to love sci-fi. Your dad looks engrossed. yuck! Me (again): And just when I thought it couldn't become less believable! Me (again): It has become ridiculous! My daughter:  Hahahaha MY mom. Texting during a movie? It must be bad! Me: Right-you laugh while I sit HERE on my birthday! (YES-it WAS my birthday!) My daughter: Hahahaha  Me: In th dark! This might be the most nonsensical movie I have ever seen and it started around 5:30. When WILL it end??? Me (again) And now they are going for the kill the puppy ending? My daughter: Hahaha Happy Birthday, I love you! Is it over yet? Me (an eternity later) We are home. THANK GOD!!     \n\nWhen I left the theater, after he shook his head over me texting during the movie, my husband pointed out to me that if had taken physics and understood it, that I would realize there was REAL science behind much of the movie.

This movie has galactic effects similar to GRAVITY, an in-depth, layered story line like INCEPTION, a worldly, mankind-saving plot like ARMAGEDDON, & parallel time dilations that precisely make up the movie BUTTERFLY EFFECT. Nolan somehow was able to wrap all that up in one film, while also making the connection between physics & fate. This movie is an IMAX MUST SEE as he absolutely nails the realistic effects of space, extra dimensions, & gravity.

However the characters' behaviour, lurching from incoherent to plain dumb had me completely baffled.\n\nNolan asks his audience to accept that these space farers are the brightest and the best Mother Earth can produce. Yet they behave like total imbeciles at most every opportunity. \n\nClearly the director has invested heavily in devising an expansive plot that explores some of the most awe inspiring implications of the laws of relativity and space travel. However the story and characters seem to have been sprinkled on top, long after the cake was baked. Like so many throw away films, almost every twist and turn is driven by a really smart person doing something really stupid.\n\nAfter going to the extreme of making an astrophysicist co-executive producer, Nolan would have done better to recruit someone that understands something a little more down to earth - his characters.\n\nThis however isn't Nolan's worst sin. When it comes to getting a little carried away with his storylines the man has form. Would Batman really have hung up his cape because the Joker goaded him into it? Did Leonardo Di Caprio really need to go 7 levels down in Inception? In Interstellar Nolan drives right off the reservation. \n\nThe result is a glorious, occasionally mesmerising, sometimes baffling, often ridiculous, disappointment.  \n\nIf you haven't seen it, you should go but when you get to the end sequence you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. One word - books. (You'll see)",

Believe it folks I finally saw Interstellar (2014)\nThe Good: This film is without a doubt the most beautiful, fantastic  looking spectacle I have seen this year. Everything from the grainy CINEMATOGRAPHY used in the beginning of the film; to the masterful shots of our vast and beautiful universe. The SOUND in the film is quite remarkable even though a couple of times it had small hints of Nolan's Inception. The CAST was ok, but no one; other than Mathew Mcconaughey, delivered a slamming of the dunking in their roles. The film moves at a fast pace in order to get to the good parts. Extremely difficult questions about life and the universe are tackled with satisfying answers. Oh and I almost forgot; The Robots are AMAZING!! I love that Nolan chose to have pragmatic robots for this universe. My favorite was TARS\n\nThe Bad: The film is far from perfect but its still going to fall in my top ten films of this year. I think the movies' fast pace is necessary because of it heavy themes but it is also to the film's detriment. Sometimes the pace of the film leaves too many plot holes; which at times affected the character relationships and the world building. \nCAST: i felt that Anne Hathaway had no place in this movie; in fact most of the well known faces kind of took me out of the film. \n\nThe Ugly: There was nothing ugly about this film. that is all.\n\nI Highly recommend this film despite all its flaws and Anne Hathaway!",

His use of the word \"Love\" may have come off well in the script, but on screen I wanted to laugh out loud. Nolan is gifted, and one of the few working today that actually is, but he's not impressing me with this one. And I think that's what upsets me the most. I feel he was leaping to impress, and to entertain, but forgot one of the most basic principles of exceptional movie making. \nHaving faith in your audience. \nAfter Hathaway's character began to explain the breakdown of the current scene they were in, and then transition to an overly descriptive explanation of the next scene to come, I almost walked out from feeling so intellectually insulted. I felt like I was inside of a grown up version of Dora the Explorer. Nolan insists on holding the audiences hand the entire way through, and in doing so, misses it's intellectual punches along the way.

They may in fact be unknowable by our species. Yet this movie presents them in an way that allowed me to suspend my disbelief. The director kept me engaged with beautiful and mesmerizing imagery of what these situations and celestial bodies might look like in person.  \n\nThe movie is unique because it deals with the fact that time is limited for our species and General Relativity tells us that gravity and relative motion affect time. They both come into play if you try to travel long distances. You lose time with those you leave behind and the time lost in your frame of reference accelerates when you are in a larger gravitational field than earth.  For a space traveller, in most cases, time passes on Earth quicker than it does on your spaceship.  This movie will show you what that means and how that feels.\n\nIt's an intense, suspenseful, memorable, terribly sad, and epic drama.  It has a wicked twist to it as well.

In a time where 'Gravity' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' are popular its good to have something a little more cerebral, and its good at the spacey visuals, and the other dimension was very cool, even scary. Soundtrack was a irritating blend of 2001 a space odyssey and Titanic. Intelligent film making. But melted brain.",

            "content": "Admittedly lukewarm on Nolan films (with the exception of Memento), it took me a few weeks to decide to watch this film.  I very much enjoyed the premise and the foundation of the film.  I thought the father/daughter relationship dynamic was well done.  We got a good understanding of McConaughy's character, and I had no problem with NASA's \"solution\" to the problem.  So far, so good.\n\nI thought the messages back and forth was a good idea - wish they had stuck with that a little better to continue the family connection and better understand how Earth was getting worse and worse, but not a big deal.  The investigation of the first planet was fine, except for Hathaway's idiot character that couldn't see a 1,000 ft wave coming.  But I was still enjoying the film at that point.\n\nThen, came Matt Damon's entry into the movie - and with it, Nolan's biggest flaw reared its ugly head.  Nolan is not great at developing characters or having them make \"believable\" choices at times.  Matt Damon's character fell right into this trap.  His character was truly pointless.  *SPOILERS AHEAD FROM HERE ON* Was he concerned with humanity?  If so, why signal the beacon?  What was killing McConaughey's character going to accomplish?  Why not just tell McConaughey that Plan A was a lie, and the planet was inhabitable.  It was a waste of a 1/2 hour to be honest.\n\nThen, it felt like Nolan just started making shit up, and eventually painted himself into a corner.  Anybody with a brain knew McConaughey was the \"ghost\" by the 2nd time little Murph mentioned it.  It was as obvious as Bruce Willis being dead in Sixth Sense - YOU DIDN'T FOOL ANYONE WHO WAS PAYING ATTENTION.  But, to actually, literally, 100% go the deus ex machina route more egregiously then I have ever seen it presented, was lazy and embarrassing in my opinion.  And, Murph being \"The Chosen One\"?  Yeah - we've never gone THAT route before (Matrix, Avatar, etc).  \n\nOnce again, I got sucked into the trap that is Christopher Nolan.  Much like The Dark Knight, the foundation of the movie was well done and intriguing;  but, Nolan's inability to stay the course, develop his characters throughout a movie, and his awkwardness in trying to deliver a sensible ending ruined a potentially very good film.  I believe, in all, this is Nolan's weakest film to date.\n\nGrade = 4.5/10",

The Nolans have done an excellent job of using this medium to communicate a wonderful message about being human and facing the challenges of the future. When we do go out into space we face off against Nature which doesn't care if we survive or not. The good and evil we experience we will bring with us as we spread across the universe. Dr. Mann was an excellent example of the fears and selfishness that hold us back as a species. I thought the cast did a great job with this heavy material that could have easily turned maudlin in lesser hands. Special kudos to Mackenzie Foy who played the young Murphy. The girl has fantastic acting chops and worked well with McConaughey's Cooper. The visual FX were stunning on the IMAX screen complimented by a stunning score from Hans Zimmer. The music becomes a character in moving the narrative forward. I loved it so much I had to buy it and put it on replay on my car stereo. \n\nSPOILER ALERT!  The highlight of this movie for me was to discover that Nolan didn't have advanced aliens or a god rescue humanity from this disaster. That would have been such a huge letdown so it was very exciting to have the savior of our species be our future selves. This was a positive, life affirming message to leave the audience with as we walk out of the theater. I look forward to the Blu-ray so I can add this film to my personal library.",

Not for the movie goer with a short attention span, this is more 2001 then Star Wars.  In terms of performance, well, nobody does anything special but then they don't do anything drastically wrong. Yes, there's a message but as already said, it's not a new one but messages run through Interstellar in more ways than one.",

However, once the experience was over, I wondered why they made it? It's not that Interstellar is a bad movie. The production value is high, the acting works well, and the script . . . well there's the problem. The script just isn't deep or specific enough for me.\n\nThe best parts of Interstellar are the scenes between the father and daughter. There's a deep connection there between the characters, a good sense of a specific relationship that is still universal, the love between father and daughter. However, the final scene of that relationship (I won't tell you what it is) is rather dissatisfying.  Also working for this film (for the most part) is the sound. Yes, it's damn loud but it helps create such a visceral response in the audience. Best example: when the spaceship is leaving the Earth there is this bone rattling (I mean, it physically SHOOK the audience) sound of the rocket engines, and then when it finally left the Earth's gravity and entered outer space \n\n. . . dead quiet. But not wanting to let go of a good thing, they use the same sound level in another part of the movie when the spaceship is in trouble (again), and it only got in the way of the audience hearing important dialogue. I mean, I \"think\" it was important dialogue because I couldn't understand a word of it, AND in turn, I couldn't understand what was happening in the movie!\n\nAlthough Christopher Nolan has great ideas and a good eye for visuals, the script seems more of an outline for a movie leaving this audience member feeling a bit underwhelmed. And the \"science moments?\" Yeah, I know, there's a whole group of scientists out there who get their equations all in a bunch if you don't get the science \"right,\" but every \"science moment\" they have in Interstellar stops the action, it's not incorporated into the film as well as it needs to be. I ain't kidding. Every time they started talking science I felt like somebody walked on with a giant dry erase board and I was back in junior college sitting through another boring lecture. Don't get me wrong, getting the science  \"right\" is important but you must make it a part of the action, and not just shove it down our throats because you're afraid  that Dr. deGrasse Tyson will jump on his iPod show and get all \"better than thou\" on us \"uneducated,\" low life movie goers.",

Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, and Michael Caine also are grand in their respective roles.

It questions and raises theories and concept that we may or may not heard before in our high school science class that somehow may have also not taught in a university college as well. In terms of filmmaking, Nolan has outdone himself again for being an ambitious talented auteur that is not even mimicking or plagiarizing other directors unlike some if you know who I am talking about. The all-star cast gives us a very memorable and sometimes unforgettable character relationships ever to put on film, spanning more than 50 years on Earth and less than a month on space? Of course, the soundtrack is electrifying and intense, the visual FX is state of the art, and yes don't get me wrong about this, I gotta admit after a few hours just seeing the film, I now have some theories and thoughts about the last 30 minutes of the film which will put some people away if they're not into the film, but for me, I dig it. \nInterstellar, in my own personal opinion without looking at other people's review, is arguably and debatably the most realistic and accurate 100% pure science fiction EVER on the history of cinema. In quite some time, I might put this film on my great movies review maybe not this time. Though with all that saying, I am gonna put Interstellar so far in my #2 on my top 10 movies of 2014 along with Boyhood as my #1. Trust me and believe me on this one, I doubt any more movies I watch in this coming days leading to the last week of 2014 where I reveal my top 10 will never replace Interstellar on my top 2 position. Interstellar must be seen on the biggest screen possible and if you can't or no time, you got to wait for the blu-ray release and see it on your HDTV to truly feel the spectacle of the stellar of space.",

I also thought the balance of the scenes in the last five minutes was off - too little payoff for what we'd been waiting for, reunion-wise, too much Hathaway. Yet I found the film mostly to be absorbing, thought-provoking, and often thrilling, in a few sequences - and not just action ones. I loved the stuff where they debated their options. TARS is absolutely fantastic and steals every moment he has. The film resonates with me because I remember a time when kids looked up at the stars and dreamed of exploration, as opposed to now when kids look down at their screens and dream of more data allowance.",

I also have to admit that I wasn't sure how confident I could feel with Matthew McConaughey as the lead role. Nolan had better come through this time.\n\nI'm happy to report that while it's not as awe-inspiring as his other films, Nolan managed to pull off an incredibly ambitious experience that celebrates technology and the human spirit. Unfortunately the characters are drawn in the broadest of strokes so none of them were very memorable. I had almost completely forgotten that Wes Bentley was in this movie. That being said, McConaughey does his McConaughey thing but somehow makes it work here. Anne Hathaway actually does a good job in delivering a full character, despite what feels like limited screen time. The true reason to see the movie is the spectacle of the visuals, and they're flat out amazing. I will say that there is underlying mystery in the story that almost anyone who watches movies will be able to figure out within 5 minutes. That being said, when the mystery was solved, where the story went afterward was a complete enjoyable surprise for me, and really shocking if you've watched any Christopher Nolan movie before. Just when you think the director might be going full on Hollywood, he delivers an ending that reminds you of exactly who he is.\n\nIt does feel a little long, clocking in at close to 3hrs, and I'm still not 100% sure I understand the ending, but I'd definitely go see it again, maybe in full on IMAX to really get all those Nolan visuals in my face.",

Honestly I doubt that Steven Hawking and Neil Tyson Degrassi really understand this movie. That's not because of plot holes or poor exposition but because it is based around concepts which are themselves mind bending. Here time dilation, gravitational anomalies, and supermassive black holes are just the beginning leading up to paradoxes that make Doctor Who seem straightforward and understandings of time and space that we don't yet have the ability to comprehend. In other words there are things in this movie which are not explained because they simply cannot be.\nBut that matters less than you would think. You'll probably understand the who and the why of the story even if you don't always understand the how. What is important to understand is that the earth is dying. Society is trying to rebuild itself after some unspecified cataclysm, but world population is dangerously low, the farm belt is In the midst of another dust bowl, and though few realize it yet our crops are on the verge of dying. Our only hope is to follow messages from unknown beings to new worlds in another galaxy. And it's going to be one hell of a trip, both for the handful of brave astronauts and the people they leave behind on earth.\n\tPut simply, Interstellar is 2001 A Space Odyssey without the long stretches where nothing happens. Not to say that the story is the same beyond the general outline of mankind exploring the cosmos and a mysterious force guiding us. Yet there are so many things about Interstellar that draw the viewer's mind back to that classic of sci-fi. From the often majestic, sometimes hallucinatory visuals of alien worlds, interstellar phenomena and spacecraft gently floating through the void, to the ever present themes of distance and isolation, to the black, slab shaped robot with an attitude like HAL 9000, it's clear that Kubrick's 2001 was very much on Christopher Nolan's mind when he made this. \n\tBut don't let me give you the impression that this move is all high concepts and deep themes. Interstellar is also a fast paced, suspense filled thriller with all the action, twists, and cutting edge special effects one has come to expect from Nolan. The action scenes are nail biting and visually stunning, with photography clearly influenced by last year's Gravity. In the third act the revelations and close calls come so quickly one after another that the tension builds until you're sure the climax is just around the corner, and yet it keeps on going, tenser than before. \n\nBeyond the suspense and the excitement it's the emotional dimension that gives this movie its impact. Because the heroes aren't going into the unknown just to save humanity, they're going to save the people they care about; their children, parents, mentors, the ones who can't even know if they're still alive. And as corny as it may seem, Interstellar makes a good case that more than gravity or even time, it's love that's the most powerful force in the galaxy. In the end you'll likely have as many questions as answers, but that's OK, because the whole point is that there is so much we have yet to discover, and yet that will never stop us from trying.",

This is a good theme. But why I did not give five star? Here is why.\nThe \"Interstellar\" theory relies on maths, however, not yet understood by most of the audience. Nolan tried his best to make it real, however, instead, making it unrealistic. It is more like a \"fiction\", instead of a motion picture predicting our future. In other words, it doesn't strike me strong enough to become the best science fiction movie of Nolan, after the astonishing imaginary Inception, which go beyond imagination, far away from reality.\nTwo things hit me in this movie. First, when Cooper saw the video from his \"old\" son, it is the touchest moment of the movie. Second, the sound effects and background music is as good as Inception, probably setting a marker for Nolan's films.",

I thought about it and have some issues with it:\n\nCooper drives a truck at high speed on roads and corn fields on a flat tire which never disintegrates or becomes more damaged in any way.\n\nCooper takes control of a military grade drone with a laptop and high gain antenna, which he just happens to have with him along with the necessary encryption codes and frequencies (which constantly change using \"Spread Spectrum\") and land the drone even though it flies some distance away without the high gain antenna pointed at it making it out of range for a simple laptop wireless.   \n\nThe drone is powered by solar panels which will provide enough power to run a farm.  Apparently we solved the energy crisis just in time for the food crisis. \n\nAll the automated farm equipment descend on the house but stop just short of doing any damage.  One massive harvester is seen lumbering through the corn field with out doing any damage to the corn.\n\nDust storms block out all visibility but never enter the car vents or clog the air filter even though it's being sucked into the engine at 300 cubic feet per minute.\n\nDust falls on the floor in lines about one inch apart.  Cooper recognizes the pattern as binary code and realizes they represents coordinates (latitude/longitude) but needs to work out the location on paper because even though he can recognize them on site he can't read them.\n\nLatitude and longitude in binary looks like this:\n 01001110 00100000 00110100 00110101 00111010 00110001 00110101 00111010 00110010 00110010 00100000 01010111 00100000 00110001 00110000 00110010 00111010 00110100 00110101 00111010 00110001 00110110 \nthere's not nearly enough floor space.\n\nWe learn that the world wide food shortage has ended all wars.  Really?  People riot for injustice but roll over for no food!\n\nCooper and his dad often drink beer on the porch at night.  If corn is the only grain that can grow on the planet where does the beer com from?\n\nCooper is chosen to pilot the ENDEAVOR because he's the only one with experience as no one else has made it beyond the simulator.  So how did they get the ENDEAVOR up there in the first place?  How did the original 12 astronauts make it?\n\nNASA is now a super secret organization because people would be opposed to the government spending money on space exploration when people are starving.  So how did they get that spaceship up there without anyone seeing all those components being launched?  And even though the International Space Station is clearly visible from Earth no one notices this massive space ship in orbit?\n\nProfessor Brand is the only one working on the gravity calculations on which the fate of the world hangs.  There are a number of \"Self aware\" computers walking around but no computer resources are dedicated to solving this problem.  Later he tutors a 10 year old who grows up to finish the equation, but seriously; shouldn't have they given this a little more priority?\n\nThe RANGER lander has the ability to land on planets and take off again to return on it's own, so why did thy need to put it on the top of a rocket to get it to the ENDEAVOR when they left Earth?\n\nPlan \"A\" is to move the human race to the other side of the wormhole to a new planet.  Plan \"B\" is to repopulate the human race on a distant planet using fertilized embryos.  Where did they get all those embryos from without people noticing?  Wouldn't this require women on the other end to be implanted without the aid of a medical facility?  Doesn't the success of plan \"B\" necessitate the success of plan \"A\"? Doesn't that make Brand one REALLY popular woman?\n\nWhen free floating in the spaceship Brand is seen floating toward the ceiling then changing direction without touching anything.\n\nWhen landing on the Miller planet they discuss how gravity and time are related with time moving slower with higher gravity.  While they get kudos for tackling the subject, 130% of Earth gravity is no where near enough to dilate time on the order of 1 hour to 7 years.  A ratio of 1:61320.   The time shift would have slowed down the rate of data transmission so much that 10 minutes worth of data would have taken just over a year of recording time on Earth before they knew what they had.  Also dilation effects radio waves differently then it does time.  It changes the frequency, in this case drastically.  So Earth would not know what they were listening to nor would they know where to look for it. \n\nPlanet Miller has huge slow moving  waves but no moon to cause them.  Is the gravitational pull of the black hole strong enough to create large title waves but leave the rest of the planet intact? Did no one think to bring binoculars to look at the planet from space and notice \"Hey, it's nothing but water!  We better not land there.\"\n\n Was Miller a moron?  Did he really think that landing on an all water planet with huge waves so close to a black hole was a GOOD idea?\n\nBrand wants to go to the third planet because that's where her boyfriend is.  A character never introduced or plot line ever developed but somehow Cooper figures it out anyway.\n\nCommunication is possible from Earth through the wormhole to the other side and even though Earth has been receiving environmental data from planetary sensors from the other side of the wormhole communication from the ENDEAVOR to Earth is impossible.    \n\nCooper receives a message from his son who tells him he wanted to name the first grandchild Coop but it was a girl.  We later find he had a son that he named Coop.  So Cooper has a grandson named Cooper Cooper.\n\nWhen on Mann's planet they get around with the help jet packs attached to their forearms by holding their arm perpendicular to their bodies with their forearms raised in the typical \"Strong man\" pose and holding them in this position while lifting their entire weight off the planet.  Something I've only seen Olympic athletes do.\n\nMann is a man who is insane is an allegory for man that is insane which is the back story for the movie.\n\nThe computers on the ENDEAVOR will risk their existence because they have to do what their told but ignore Mann who repeatedly tells them to auto dock. \n\nProfessor Brand confesses the gravity equation can't be solved without going into a black hole which can't be done which we all know will happen next.\n\nWhile in the black hole the beings that created the wormhole construct a tesseract so that Cooper can explore the past days of Murphy's childhood so he can communicate with Murphy, give the answer to the gravity equation thus utilizing the worn out \"Time paradox\" without which the movie (and all mankind) wouldn't exist.\n\nSo the amazingly intelligent beings, seeing mankind on the brink of extinction, construct a wormhole near Saturn that leads to a black hole near 12 planets, only one of which can support life, and construct a tesseract inside the black hole so ONE man can look into his past and give the binary form of the gravity equation solution onto a watch that will be discovered by his daughter many years later who will solve the equation allowing mankind to leave earth in space stations using the same contaminated soil that's destroying all the food but somehow has no effect in space.  Sure, why not?  Why did they put the wormhole all the way out near Saturn?  I mean they can reach into a black hole, construct a time paradoxical tesseract so we can give ourselves the key to our survival, why didn't they just dial 911 or something?  Or put an intergalactic doorway on earth that pops out on the good planet?  Why not put a flashing neon sign that says \"Good planet this way.\"?  I'm beginning to  think these beings DON'T have our best interest in mind and are just screwing with us.  Maybe THEY'RE the reason the Earth is dying to begin with. \n\nMurphy is seen transcribing the binary equation from the watch into Morse code, a form of communication that has no provision for higher math functions.\n\nAfter solving the gravity equation Murphy then takes decades of hard work and throws it all in the air leaving someone else to pick up the mess, put all the paper back in order and figure out just what the heck she's yelling about. \n\nAfter giving the equation, Cooper ends up back in the Solar system in the path of a rescue vehicle proving the Beings could have easily moved mankind off earth to the good planet whenever they wanted.\n\nCooper wakes up back on Cooper station and egotistically thinks it's named after  him.  Apparently nothing was named after him.  Maybe he should have tried harder.\n\nCooper's daughter insists on seeing him even though she's too old to go to him and apparently was in suspended animation at the time she was told.  \n\nBrand land's on her lovers planet despite having no experience piloting a severely damaged spaceship that's being torn apart all the way there, and find's the remains of her lover over 100 years too late and even though being exposed to the elements still finds enough to bury.  Mann survived just fine in the suspended animation unit but he can't?\n\nCooper decides to risk his life by going back through the worm hole to live out his remaining years all alone with Brand, a woman who gave him no encouragement, instead of using his fame and notoriety to get any hot babe he wished.  \n\nApparently it's really easy to steal spacecraft in the future.  No guards, alarms, sensors, cameras, radar or anything else that would make someone say \"Hey, what's he doing?\"\n\nDespite being 100 years more advanced, flight control systems of spacecraft have not changed since Cooper's day.  Something akin to the Wright brothers being able to fly a 747.",

The \"all-star\" cast couldn't help this debacle! the only reason I gave this a half star is the soda I had was delicious. ...End of world? dust storms? mankind trying to survive?Elysium did that all ready! Crashing space station rogue astronaut? gravity did that and got out of danger without a retarded robot! epic space scenes? not! Discovery and through the wormhole had better cinamography!!!!!! \nif u rated this more than one star your IQ is lower than even you thought! Hollywood's not even trying anymore!!!! and keep taking ur money! the director should have killed off mcconawho and had Matt damnit in a polygomous relationship with Anne have her way and Mudd's daughter to save the human race would have been better . \nget the hell out of here and give me my money back!!!!!!!!",
