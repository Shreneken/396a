People say things like, \"Oh it's because you don't get dead pan humor\" Shows like The Office (American) and Modern Family use dead pan humor from time to time and it's hilarious, but these movies just aren't funny. The writing isn't funny ergo what's on screen isn't funny either. The only reason people find movies like this funny is because you don't expect vampires to behave in this goofy manner so people's expectations are subverted and they find it humorous which is fine, but just because expectations are subverted by satire does not make it inherently funny. Dry humor can be very funny, the Office or Shaun of the Dead are a prime examples, but this isn't it in my opinion. People act like it's funny because it's ridiculous but instead it's just ridiculously unfunny. Nothing clever to see here",

What I got was one of the funniest movies of this year or any year for that matter. The jokes where brilliant and more importantly, they were frequent and consistently brilliant. I loved the interaction of the main characters with each other and the supporting characters.\n\nEach of the main vampires had their moments and were all equally funny. The movie even had werewolves and they were also hilarious. I was also surprised by the special effects which were really well done.\n\nAt one point it did feel like the jokes were getting old, but just as I had finished that thought, the movie changes and ends brilliantly. Even though there isn't much of a story, it doesn't really matter for this movie. Just watching some of the hilarious chaos that ensues in their everyday life is enough.\n\nThere are not many movies that make me actually laugh out loud, but this one did on several occasions (usually comedies, even great ones, just keep me grinning through out). This is easily one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had at the cinema.",

Firstly, I already said here, and not only once, that it's almost impossible for me to take vampires seriously, and because of that, this film could be perfect for me, after all, a comedy is not to be taken seriously, right? Yes, but also, another thing I already said before: a comedy only needs to be funny, and Taika's sense of humour rarely worked for me. I recognize how well the film is written (it's coincidentally the second mockumentary I saw in three days) and how good the performances are (especially Vladislav, made by Jemaine Clement), but as the humour isn't that effective, I was a little distant from that universe. In other words, I had the same feelings as when I watched a film by Wes Anderson, but for different reasons.",

            "content": "Absolutely hilarious vampire spoof from New Zealand's finest!\n\nWriters and directors Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's horror comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows (2014) is a delightfully light hearted spoof of all things vampiric. They parody and play around with Bram Stoker's iconic monster the vampire from blood draining to not appearing in mirrors with charming New Zealand accents and dry humor. Waititi and Clement's writing feels refreshingly clever and silly, so What We Do in the Shadows always remains playfully lighthearted in spirit Waititi's Jojo Rabbit or Clement's Flight of the Conchords.\n\nTaika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's direction is simply magnificent to behold. What We Do in the Shadows is filmed like a documentary, but for making fun of these pretend subjects, much like Rob Reiner's influential mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap. Cinematographers Richard Bluck and DJ Stipsen's hand held camera work keeps the camera moving in wide angle shots like you're really there, while diverting to interview segments like a documentary. It really is like several interviews with various vampires for a black comedy laugh. The entire feel of the film is like going out for a lark with your friends like Shaun of the Dead or The World's End with a bit of edgier moments like Trainspotting.\n\nIt's super funny to see these archetypes of vampires get parodied like Max Schreck's creature like Nosferatu, Bela Lugosi's gentleman Dracula, Christopher Lee's bloodthirsty Horror of Dracula, Frank Langella's romantic Dracula, Klaus Kinski's Nosferatu the Vampyre, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's vampires from The Interview with the Vampire, Gary Oldman's monstrous Count Dracula and his romantic Dracula, Richard Roxburgh's rockstar Dracula, Robert Pattinson's Twilight vampire Edward, Alicia Silverstone and Krysten Ritter's Vamps, to Luke Evans' handsome sympathetic Dracula. I'm sure there are other vampires referenced too if you look hard enough. \n\nAs a fan of vampire horror films and vampire lore, What We Do in the Shadows spoofs the classics, while adding a contemporary locale of charming Wellington, New Zealand in the backdrop. Ra Vincent's production design is fun for the modern flat in New Zealand reimagined as a group of vampire mates living together in bloody filth.\n\nTaika Waititi's friendly vampire Viago is very cute and funny. He's like Frank Langella's romantic Dracula mixed with Bela Lugosi's charming gentleman Vampire, but with more frills. Waititi hilariously said that he based Viago off of his mother. Jemaine Clement's vampire Vladislav is cool as a Vlad the Impaler type, clearly making fun of and homaging Gary Oldman's Dracula. Jonny Brugh's try hard vampire Deacon is a blast with his psychic suggestion and bat transformations. Ben Fransham's vampire Petyr is an awesome parody of Max Schreck's Nosferatu and Klaus Kinski's Nosferatu the Vampyre. His hideous appearance, shadowy nature, creeping around, and vicious bloodlust are wonderful tributes to the first film incarnation of a vampire. I appreciate how closely they matched Max Schreck's make-up and costume from Nosferatu for Petyr.\n\nCori Gonzalez-Macuer's hipster vampire victim Nick is a funny parody of Twilight's modern vampires I'd say. Stuart Rutherford is fun as their IT pal Stu. Jackie van Beek is lovely and sympathetic as Deacon's human familiar Jackie. Her righteous indignation over not getting turned into a vampiress is a riot to watch. Elena Stejko is pretty and cool as vampiress Pauline The Beast. Rhys Darby's supporting role as the alpha male werewolf Anton is so funny. It's nice to see Jemaine Clement cast Darby as he was hilarious in Flight of the Conchords' show. Ian Harcourt's polite zombie is a quaint cameo during The Unholy Masquerade sequence. Lastly, Child actresses Morgana Hills and Morag Hills are seriously adorable as the young vampiresses seeking out pedophiles to kill and drain their blood around the Wellington area of New Zealand.\n\nFurthermore, Plan 9's music is quite funny itself with plenty of old timey folk music stuffed in here for a chuckle. Editors Jonathan Woodford-Robinson, Yana Gorskaya, and Tom Eagles splice together historical footage and pictures with recreated scenes for a funny mockumentary feel. The joke pacing and conversations cut quickly to keep the laughs coming for a breezy 86 minutes of vampire frolicking and feasting.\n\nIn short, I simply adored What We Do in the Shadows. It's honestly up there with Taika Waititi's greatest films like Jojo Rabbit or Hunt for the Wilderpeople.",

The narrative certainly rambles, as most mockumentaries do, but the charm of this movie is in its quirky characters and top-tier special effects despite its low budget. There's a lot to like here, but its mileage will vary wildly from person to person; it's a cult classic for a reason.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like Interview With A Vampire by way of Drop Dead Gorgeous.\n\nSetting: Horror\nPlot: Mockumentary\nTone: Dark Comedy",

I have to say that while there are a couple big laughs, there aren't as many as I'd hoped for.  However, the movie is relentlessly likable, and while the laughs it does have aren't huge they are pretty consistent.  I was mostly at least chuckling through a lot of the movie.  There is some clumsiness to the production that comes from something this low budget, but in a lot of cases they work around these things or use them to their benefit as best they can.  It's not perfect, and they did polish up on these ideas later on, but for a starting off point it's so eager and just likable I really enjoyed it.",

Has the world flipped upside down? And I'm not the only one who didn't find it funny. I'm amazed that people have such vastly different senses of humor. I actually don't blame the creators for the viewers' absurd overreaction. I'm sure the writers never expected people to say it is the funniest film they've ever seen. The humor is just okay, but in a bad sort of way, where the jokes just don't land. Like a bad comedian. Critics are now saying the same things about how JoJo Rabbit is just not funny.\n\nAre the people who found it so funny all from NZ? IS this some sort of exclusive NZ humor? I doubt it.

Amongst all (sub) genres, comedy-horror is one of the hardest to get right; the film needs to be both a proper comedy and also a proper horror movie to really work, and take both genres at face-value. Shaun Of The Dead executes this near flawlessly; What We Do In The Shadows does well, but not quite enough for me. The documentary format - whilst a good joke - means it leans more on the comedy, and hence isn't really horror enough. The horror elements play almost as Hammer at its worst, which may or may not be intentional, but distracts from the nuanced performances. Some of the gags are brilliant - the verbal comedy, the physical, the nods to other films and especially the good natured, self aware fun with the rules and tropes of vampirism. Occasionally it hints towards bigger themes - homophobia, for instance. That would be a good fit; vampire stories are almost always about sex or sexuality in some way. The 'coming out' scene is inspired; the scenes of bullying in the street both funny and moving. But the theme never quite takes the theme far enough; it feels like one of a bunch of ideas thrown at the wall until something sticks. The film lacks an ultimate emotional punch for which it strives, and I'm left with the feeling that the newly-launching spin-off TV series might be the best format for this. It's good, of course, and has much re-watch value and quotability ... but the director had better ahead of him.",

Then pretend there is a documentary team following them around as they engage in their usual routines (which include nightclubbing and hunting for victims).  NZ superstars Taika Waititi (director of Boy, 2010, and Thor: Ragnarok, 2018) and Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords), co-directed and co-star alongside Jonny Brugh and a few other familiar Kiwis (Rhys Darby appears as a werewolf).

Well, it is laugh out loud funny... yeah, I am going to go with that. \n\nOkay fine, good acting, excellent story and premise, fresh takes on well-worn tropes and plenty of surprises. An entertaining time that has regained my faith in a tired genre. But really it is very funny check it out,",

Between two fantastic directors, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, you cannot go wrong with making a movie about vampire in modern New Zealand. When these two bright minds decided to write and direct a mockumentary, it was bound to be an instant classic, \"This is Spinal Tap\" meets vampires. This film is chalk full of situational comedy, smart humor, and intricate setups and punchlines. Being vampires, there are a few things that are different, one being reflections. These vampires love to go out and party, and to do so, they need to look good. They find a way around not having reflections, by crudely drawing each other with crayon on little pieces of paper. It's this kind of humor that I think is fantastic and really makes this movie what it is, a masterpiece. Being a mockumentary, the movie pokes fun at documentaries by not taking itself seriously and using movie tropes to bring even more humor into the scene. Being able to break the fourth wall makes for some fun interaction. This movie sets itself apart from other vampire flicks because of its originality and the direction it takes. It doesn't deal with your average vampire plots like living forever, running from hunters, or terrorizing the public. Instead, it deals with normal, everyday things like living with roommates, making friends, and even ex girlfriends. Charm radiates throughout the entire hour and a half and it never drags.",

Seriously, he's just an all-around hilarious dude. The premise of the film is truly cool. Vampires are a seriously overdone concept by this point, so finding a way to make it unique is commendable. Going the comedic mockumentary route was an unexpected stroke of genius. It led to plenty of laughs. I appreciated how different each character was. They varied in age, from 8,000 years old to fresh newborn vampire and all had some quirks that made them special. I loved how they bonded with the human, Stu (Stu Rutherford). Jermaine Clement (Vladislav), Jonathan Brugh (Deacon), Ben Fransham (Petyr), and everyone else involved are all funny. They also do well to throw nods to other vampire films, from the stuff like Blade and Lost Boys down to Twilight. It's clear the filmmakers had a blast playing with the vampire stereotypes.\n\nWeaknesses: Though it only runs for 85 minutes, there are a handful of moments that seemed to drag. The plot is nothing special and is mostly forgettable. It's as if the focus was on the jokes, which did make for a funny film, just not one that does much more to stand out. As great as most of the characters are, there are a few who don't do a whole lot and seem to kind of just be there.\n\nOverall: Takia does it again. There's something about his brand of comedy that just works for me. This movie is filled with laughs and nods to vampire history and it does so in a natural way. The cast is hilarious and the mockumentary style gives us something unique at a time when that's hard to come by.",

            "content": "fluent vocal finesse..\n\nWhat We Do In The Shadows\n\nWhat We Do In The Shadows is a plot driven comic horror about a documentary set in a New Zealand about a vampire community residing among the society. It aces on weaving out a physical comedy and is performed hilariously too by each cast and is probably the highlight that draws in most of the laughs. \n\nIt isn't confined with an urge to offer episodes of various gags and sketchy sequences and it also doesn't suggest that it doesn't contain it. It is brimmed with such gullible sequences with sadistic humor and sensitive tiny notions that draws in a chuckle every now and then. Since it is of documentary nature, there exists very little room for technical aspects like background score and cinematography, although is edited well enough and is of shorter runtime too that factors in effectively. \n\nWaititi is flat out hilarious with a self-obsessed Clement and emotional Brugh and combining them you'll get the apt bittersweet bonding of a group of friends that contrary to its premise is more humane. The primary reason it works is that it doesn't rely a lot upon its eerie concept, it undeniably is more than its concept, it's frankly quite mature. For amidst all these series of jokes and tactics, it barely focuses upon the difference of the species and creates its own irony within its dark bubble. \n\nWaititi's execution is what fuels this fluctuating tale where his key is when he allows the audience to breathe and so to its characters to sink in the awkwardness imputed within the conversations. The narrative is adaptive, gripping and hilarious if not layered or thought provoking but its fluent vocal finesse and verbal sparrings makes it worth the wait. \n\nWhat We Do In The Shadows isn't anything out of the box but what it is, is well aware of it and pulls out the best as an homage to the entire concept.",

From there, we see some spoofing of classic roomie arguments, going out on the town, accepting new friends, and the ever-present danger of burning to death in the sunlight. Y'know, normal roommate stuff.\n\nThe jokes are clearly the centre of the film; the plot is secondary. This is fine, except that they don't land as consistently as they need to. Jemaine Clement has that low-energy comedic style that I just don't find all that punchy. It's not that it's bad, it just doesn't land consistenly enough to be great.\n\nThe characters are fun, and the acting by Waititi, Clement, and Brugh is all solid.

I love how they played with all the tropes of traditional monster movies, but make everything feel like the mundane nonsense that normal people deal with all the time. It set the tone early by starting us off with the sweet Viago played by Taika Waititi. He already was playing against all expectations and I was laughing almost instantly. The other main characters were also delightful, and were perfectly cast. Each one had their own unique personality, and it made for some hilarious interactions. In the past I have enjoyed some mockumentaries, but in general I just lightly chuckle. What We Do in the Shadows stood out from the rest because it brought big belly laughs for me. In fact I almost had drink spraying out of my nose when Jemaine Clement perfectly delivers a particular line comparing a virgin to a sandwich. I like how they integrate all the tell-tale signs of a documentary into this movie, even to the point of having new people to the movie asking why the cameras and equipment are there. There was a certain point where I thought the movie was starting to wear thin as though they didn‚Äôt have much more to do with this idea, a common problem in other movies in this genre, but then things picked back up with a new twist to the story. The writing makes What We Do in the Shadows work. It is clever, and they don‚Äôt miss a single opportunity to put a twist on your expectations. There are so many quotable lines in this movie, because the dialogue sticks with you. I like the fact that they don‚Äôt even waste time addressing how the world is oblivious to the existence of all these undead creatures. It‚Äôs also hilarious to me that someone will casually say they are a vampire hunter in conversation as if they just said they are an accountant. There were some moments in What We Do in the Shadows where it seemed to hit a lull, but most of the time it ran on all cylinders, and did not disappoint.

The three main vampires Vladislav, Viago and Deacon, played by Clement, Waititi and Joanathan Brugh are a perfect mix of outrageous and understated and old fashioned and 'hip' and play off each other brilliantly. There are also appearances from Rhys Darby as Anton, one of the werewolves, Ben Fransham as Petyr, the nosferatu style vampire and the introduction of Stuart Rutherford as Stu, the human all the vampires are strangely fond of.

            "content": "If you've had your fill of vampire films like the TWILIGHT series, there's one more such film that you need to sink your teeth into. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS sticks a perfectly honed wooden spike right into the heart of this film genre.\n\nDone in a mockumentary style √† la THIS IS SPINAL TAP, WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS follows an unseen camera crew as they profile a quartet of bloodsucking preternatural beings who share a house in suburban Wellington, New Zealand. Viago (co-writer/co-director Taika Waititi - BOY) is our genial tour guide on this exploration of this \"highly secretive society\". At age 379, he's one of the younger members of the house but, as the group's de facto leader, he tries to run an orderly ship. In a house meeting around the kitchen table, we see him chastise fellow house-vamp Deacon (age 183) for not doing his share of the chores. Deacon, we learn, hasn't washed the dishes in five years. The camera quickly cuts over to a sink and countertop overflowing with blood-encrusted glasses and dishes. Vladislav (co-writer/co-director Jemaine Clement - TV's FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS) is older at 862, but he's also taken to task for literally leaving a bloody mess on the sofa. Viago tells him that if he's going to eat victims there, he should at least put down some towels. Who knew that vampires could have such mundane concerns? And then there is Petyr, the loner of the group. At age 8,000, the Nosferatu-looking character is pretty much left to his own devices, living in a concrete coffin in the house's dark basement.\n\nEach character is so different yet so familiar, which is what makes them endearing. Through the use of faux archival footage, artwork and home movies, we learn a lot about their colourful backstories. Vladislav is formally known as Vlad the Poker, in a wink to both his famous namesake, Vlad the Impaler, and to Facebook's now rarely used poking function. A one-time master of hypnosis, his powers seem to have faded over time though he's still very much the party animal. Deacon, we learn, fancies himself as the sexy bad boy of the group who loves doing erotic dancing. We also learn that he used to be a Nazi vampire but, as he tells us while we see photos of him taken back in the day, \"after World War II, things were hard for vampires, and for Nazis, and especially for Nazi vampires.\" You can't help but laugh at his deadpan delivery. Meanwhile, Viago tells us that he moved to New Zealand for love. Unfortunately, by the time he arrived in Wellington, the love of his life found someone else. Viago can't seem to get over her and, even though the woman is now 96 years old and living in an old folks' home, he still worships her from afar.\n\nWhen they're not sucking the blood from or chomping down on their victims, the guys pretty much keep to themselves. At night, they roam the streets of downtown Wellington looking much like faded pop stars or male prostitutes - take your pick. We are also introduced to Jackie, a suburban wife and mother who is Deacon's servant. She's hoping he will give her eternal life in exchange for bringing him unwitting sacrifices but being the rogue that he is, he just strings her along, purely satisfying his own, and his friends', lusts. The juxtaposition of the strange and the familiar is hilarious.\n\nProblems for the vamps start arising when Petyr decides to turn one of Jackie's marks, an ex-boyfriend no less, into one of their own. Nick, like Jackie, is a total loser but he takes to his new \"life\" with great relish, doing cartwheels as he's learning how to fly and telling everyone that he's a vampire. Of course, very few people believe him. His antics start to wear very thin on the guys and his future seems limited until he brings his best friend, Stu, back to the house to meet the guys. A computer nerd who doesn't seem to be fazed by anything, Stu introduces the guys to such modern conveniences as Internet searches, Skype, eBay, texting and scanning. Stu becomes their \"human\" friend and the guys make a pact not to kill him.\n\nThis could have been a one-note movie but Waititi and Clement are able to find every parallel with everyday life and turn it upside down with wonderful, tongue-in-cheek humour. An encounter with a pack of werewolves plays out like a scene from any gang movie except that these canines behave as if they're enrolled in a 12-step rehab programme. \"We're werewolves, not swear-wolves\" they chant in unison when one of them talks trash to the vampires.\n\nWHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS was created on a meagre budget US$1.6 million and most of that appears to have been spent on makeup and fake blood. In an interview given after the film's screening at the Sydney Film Festival, Clement said that they shot 150 hours of film because they were giggling so much during the production. (Thankfully, the final cut was judiciously edited down to 86 minutes.) Although there was a script, it was just used as a guideline for the actors who ad libbed their scenes and riffed off each other. It seems to have worked because the dialogue has a definite reality TV style to it.\n\nSince premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014, the film has gone on to win nine audience awards at festivals around the world. It also won the coveted Grolsch People's Choice Midnight Madness Award at the Toronto International Film Festival last September.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the film will be screened in two languages. Interestingly, the Hong Kong distributor decided to dub the dialogue into Cantonese. My Cantonese isn't good enough to know whether it was worth it and I'd be curious to find out what local audiences think. In any case, this is a great film that deserves to be seen.",

I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.\n\nDefinitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.\n\nQuite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a clich√©, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept. So I still recommend it because it is worth a watch.\n\n6/10",

Not only is it hilarious, but it is one most funny and original films of of the year also.\n\nThe directors, who both star in the film, are fantastic in their roles. As director and actors they both show great comedic talent. The film, with its quick and witty screenplay, is great when it comes to rewatchability. It's fun, laugh out loud funny, relying on visual comedy and jokes for the whole audience instead of crude humor which is what is mostly used these days.\n\nOn the negative side the film is short on story. It is definitely a slice of life with only the synopsis of \"vampires living together.\" This is a problem for all films like this (Boyhood, Fury) but is still fascinating despite that. The film seems more like a pilot to what would be a fantastic series, but even though that's not the case it will suffice.\n\nOverall What We Do in the Shadows is laugh out loud funny. It is definitely hilarious and one of the funniest movies of the year. The film is original, unique and unlike anything put to screen before. This director has big things ahead of him.\n\nRating: 7.9 (B+)",

There isn't exactly a plot per se, more like a string of hilarious vignettes as we follow the vampires' attempts to go clubbing (which they can't do unless they are invited inside), their rivalry with a gang of werewolves (which are easily the funniest scenes), and of course, feeding on human blood. The improv skills and chemistry the cast has with one another comes across so genuine you'll swear they really are these characters and their deadpan delivery had me in stitches. There really isn't too much more to say as it's impossible to describe just how funny and in-the-pocket this film was without seeing it for yourself, but you will need to have a pretty twisted/dark sense of humour; we are dealing with vampires here after all!",

It has a smart plot, fascinating world-building (as we later learn, this is a world where werewolves, zombies, and hunters all coexist in a fragile ecosystem, and while humans are aware of their existence, not much has been done to essentially conflict with them, despite the fact that all of them do feed on humans, which was a major plot hole), and interesting characters. I can see why director Taika Waititi won the director's chair for Thor based on this film. I would enjoy seeing a sequel to this film, but it's in no means the best film I've seen. I would have enjoyed more humor, more world-building, and more conflict. Often times, the film felt like it held back from going somewhere each time to just play it safe, but it is an otherwise fun and clever spoof.",

            "content": "This vampire mockumentary by New Zealand indie director Taika Watiti was on my watch list for a long time since it's release 2015, as the film was gardening a lot of positive reviews after earning a lot of awards at Sundance and other international and local film festivals. And now about two years, with the indie director going on to handle Hunt for the Wilderpeople (which has also HEAVILY been on my watch list also) and jumping straight ahead into big budget filmmaking, handling a new entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Thor Ragnarok, I figured i'd give this film and his filmography finally a watch and see if his New Zealand comedy would be something I could get with. Now before continuing, I should preference comedy films that, for the most part, come from the National Lampoon: Animal House era (I.E people like John Hughes, Harold Ramis, John Landis, and others), Monty Python (both in the TV Show and films), Annie Hall from Woody Allen, or most of Mel Brooks filmography are the type of humour that I laugh the most to. In other words, comedies for me work  when it is over the top and silly but more when the story and characters are set up well and the humour is delivered in-character and through well done performances and timing/editing. It does admittedly sound cynical, and it's fair to point out, but I've always found those comedies work for me. And in the case of 'What We Do in the Shadows', I'm happy to report Taika Watiti and 'Flight of the Conchords' creator Jemaine Clement have crafted a surprisingly fresh vampire mockumentary that while has some faults in it from making it more than just being great, is still incredibly well executed and adds a charming tone to it (and fun fact to learn that Taika Watiti is actually a pretty great actor too!)\n\nAs I mentioned before while some faults in the film such as minor budgeting and consistent prop uses, sadly somewhat thick however well executed story that I think would've benefited from developing its characters fully to keep it more engaging as the film already was, and the humour becoming repetitive in the last half, they aren't enough to hurt the film at all. Because thanks in part to a fantastic cast (with Takia Watiti just seriously stealing the show), comedy that despite its minor shortcomings near the end is incredibly funny and executed through the characters of the film, a clear love and admiration for vampire lore present through the film, a very silly but still yet engaging mockumentary tone that never feels out of place and consistent with the world being shown, surprisingly well done special effects and intricate sets, and a story that keeps you engaged the whole way through despite it's shortcomings also. \n\nSo overall, I really enjoyed Taika's sophomore indie film very much, and appreciate the comedy was all in-character and not absurd or too self-referential. I'm very curious to see how his films 'Boy' and especially 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' fair up but so far I'm glad I got around to sitting down and watching this and his films in general, as he's actually impressing me quite a lot and might even be becoming one of my new favourite comedy directors working right now next to Edgar Wright. Though I can't make that claim now, I will say i'm glad he's getting work because he definitely deserves it. And What We Do in the Shadows is a really great, though still flawed, mockumentary I can see myself re-watching again.",

Playing like a day-in-the-life snapshot of these goofy, out-of-touch creatures of the night, the comedy is structured with a loose plot connecting a series of clever bits and sketches. \n\nWhile many of these humorous observations of vampire lore have been made before, the script and cast are so funny and likable -- and the punchlines have the benefit and freedom of going balls-to-the-wall, crazy over-the-top -- that this movie ends up being one of the most original comedies in recent memory. \n\nIts often intense gore may turn some off to the film (even I think it goes overboard in places), but so many of the laughs are dependent on the violence as a means to mock it's use in the films it lampoons. \n\nIt's a great watch -- offering many interesting, modern-world scenarios in which to place the centuries-old protagonists. It also features the same kind of refreshingly-awkward humor you'd expect from Flight of the Conchords (that series' creators wrote and directed this gem). The first few minutes may seem a bit obvious in the joke setup, but be sure to stick around for some hilarious vampire shenanigans.",

            "content": "\"What We Do int he Shadows\" puts a huge spin on it's genre, creating a documentary style film about a fictional world of vampires as they travel the streets at night and sleep in their home together during the day. This plays out almost like a wholly dialogue driven feature, with just one difference, everything. This is a very clever (albeit oversaturated) story that i really enjoyed. About halfway through the film you get the sense that they have nowhere else to go with the story and that definitely shows in it's mere 20-minute running time. Well scripted and plotted out well enough, this film has a little something for everyone to \"sink their teeth into.\" To mockumentary fans, this film could be their dream. To myself, \"What We Do in the Shadows\" works very well at what it sets out to do, but ultimately falls a little flat in some aspects. A very fun and slightly original film that I can recommend watching around Halloween.",

Co-written and co-directed by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Concords fame, it features  understated humour, sharp dialogue and clever skits, similar to Flight of the Concords.\n\nWhile the budget was obviously fairly low, the cheapish production values don't detract from the quality of the movie.

It also makes the movie feel much more \"real\".\n\nSolid performances all round from a cast whose only known names are Jemaine Clement and Rhys Darby (also of Flight of the Concords fame.

            "content": "I've always been suspicious of the easy, instant, and unquestioned coolness and sexiness of vampires. Every screen representation of vampires portrays them as outsiders, but as cool outsiders. What We Do In the Shadows is about a group of undead, uncool outsiders, which makes them the most relatable vampires I've ever seen. This is the most delightful and hilarious comedy I've seen in years. Have I laughed as hard at other recent comedies? Yes, but none have had such a lasting effect on me. I saw this movie in theaters back in February of this year, and I still smile whenever I think about it.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows was co-written and co-directed by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, who also play two of the lead characters. Clement is best known for being part of the funny folk music duo Flight of the Conchords. He starred in the HBO series named after the duo. Taika Waititi wrote and directed some Flight of the Conchords episodes. The movie is shot as a documentary that follows four vampire friends and roommates in New Zealand as they prepare to attend the Unholy Masquerade, the biggest social event of the underworld.\n\nThis movie has an incredibly lovable band of misfits for its main characters. Each character portrays a different style of vampire. Viago (Waititi) is a foppish 18th century vampire, like Anne Rice's characters in Interview with the Vampire. Vladislav (Clement) is a medieval, feudal tyrant, like Vlad the Impaler (if he really was a vampire). Deacon (played by Jonathan Brugh) is a 19th century Romantic era vampire, like Dracula, and Petyr (played by Ben Fransham) is a monstrous Nosferatu style vampire. Their dynamic is thrown for a loop for when Petyr turns one of their intended victims into a vampire. This new vampire is Nick (played by Cori Gonzalez-Macuer). He is young and hip and trendy and takes to being vampire very well. He walks down a busy sidewalk shouting, \"I'm Twilight! That's me!\"\n\nThis is a horror comedy that is heavy on comedy and light on horror. There is not much gore but there are some bloody scenes played for laughs (Viago bites someone then can't control the wild spurts of blood). The gags are very funny and clever. The vampires love going out but can't tell if their outfits work because they don't have reflections. Once they go out, they have to get the bouncer of a club to invite them in since vampires can't enter any place they're not invited. Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon all become obsessed with Nick's blandly average human friend, Stu, who shows them how to use the internet, which leads to many laughs. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is when the vampires run into their natural rivals, a pack of werewolves led by Rhys Darby, who also had a part in the Flight of the Conchords series.\n\nAll of the vampires have backstories, hopes, and regrets that feel real and make them fully developed characters. The scenes of them having arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes help, too. What We Do in the Shadows has loads of charm and delight but is also sincere without being overly dramatic. This film loves its characters and never makes fun of them. The pathos is genuine and well earned. This isn't disposable comedy; jokes are great, but jokes with memorable characters are better. Whether you like horror or comedy, or both, or like vampires or are indifferent towards them, like me, What We Do in the Shadows will deliver on every front. When I make Best of 2015 list, I know this movie will be included, and I wouldn't be surprised if I watch it next Shocktober, too.",

The thing is that I wouldn't actually know how to go into an in-depth review without spoiling some of the best bits in the entire movie.  I'd most definitely make a shitty professional movie critic, as I'd have to review all types of films even if I cannot accurately describe the film without giving some of the best bits away.  It's almost like the blurbs that appear in the poster, they all say the same thing.  And that's really all you need, honestly, when it comes to this film.  It lampoons, yet also pays great respect to, the vampire genre and all its tropes and silliness.  I think the closest we can compare it to is, honestly, Young Frankenstein.  Though I think the latter was definitely more a loving tribute to not just Frankenstein films but the entire Universal horror films from the 20s and 30s.  Young Frankenstein is one of my favorite comedies of all time, so I don't make this comparison lightly.  Stylistically, of course, they are two different films, but that's what I can compare it to if I had to.  The film takes a look at these 4 roommates, vampires of course, and their difficulties in adjusting to the modern world and all its differences from the world they knew.   One of the roommates accidentally, Petyr (or Nosferatu) turns a guy, Nick, into a vampire and so the roommates have to guide Nick through this transition whereas Nick helps them adjust to modern life.  It sounds simple, but it definitely gets results.  There's a lot of really funny visual gags, lines and exchanges that are simply too many to mention.  It's a smartly written film on top of that and the cast is pretty damn great, top to bottom.  With that said, I do think that the film, near its climax, just before the Unholy Masquerade, slows down a little bit.  I don't wanna say that the film ran out of material, but it just slows down.  It doesn't last long, of course, and it gets right back on track, but it is something that is definitely a negative in the film.  Perhaps the only negative of the entire film to be honest.  I'm trying to find out if there's anything else about the film that I disliked and I'm having a hard time coming up with one.  I think that, unless I missed some other film, this might be the best comedy I've seen in 2015.  It's really that great of a comedy.  Very little to complain about and I highly recommend it.",

So the dry comedy subgenre doesn't usually do it for me, unless we're talking \"Arrested Development\" or anything Christopher Guest related - then I'll completely zone out and bathe in the wonder of the straight-faced one-liner delivery.  Because in some ways, a well-crafted, deliciously complicated scenario akin to something you'd find in a particularly good episode of \"The Office\" can be just as potent as a quick belly laugh a la \"Scary Movie\".\n\tMockumentary \"What We Do in the Shadows\" has much more in common with \"Best in Show\" than it does with \"Young Frankenstein\", its lightly sarcastic demeanor interlacing with the fixtures of the macabre with comedic radiance.  Such results would hardly be a possibility without Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of \"Flight of the Conchords\" fame), who co-direct and co-write with such witty adeptness that the broad premise of the film never feels broad because the tones and textures of the movie itself convince and thoroughly delight.\n\tThe \"We\" in the title refers to a group of vampires being followed around by a camera crew.  Occupying the same bungalow (or to be more scientific, den) for years, we are introduced to Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), and Petyr (Ben Fransham).  Viago, aged 379, is the \"father\" of the house, demanding his roommates attend group meetings to discuss things like the kitchen sink problem (no one has washed the dishes for five years), while he, in the meantime, mopes around about his long-lost love; Vladislav, at 800, used to be a hypnotic sexual demon in the same vein as Dracula, but has since lost his magic touch; Deacon is the young, wild one of the group (he's a spry 183) who first got his immortal kicks as a Nazi vampire, while the ancient Petyr (8,000) intimidates everyone as the household's Nosferatu.  We also meet Jackie (Jackie Van Beek), the group's human servant who hopes her handiwork will lead to her turning, and Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer), a twenty-something who was supposed to be a meal but ends up becoming a member of the household after Petyr inadvertently transforms him.\n\tI can write as much as I want about \"What We Do in the Shadows\", but never will I be able to capture the rhythm, the attitude, the genius of its humor.  The ensemble is made up of skilled comedic performers, and the writing is endlessly clever (we can start with the vampirical hatred of the local werewolf pack or the annual get-together the undead throw to celebrate their undeadness, for starters).  I found myself as quick to laugh as I was ready to sit in awe regarding the successful audacity of everyone involved.  No one, no one, would decide that the best subjects of a mockumentary would be a group of self-serious vampires, and yet here we have one, a hilarious gem, no less, as sharp as the wooden stakes the focuses of the film so greatly fear.  Clement and Waititi have outdone themselves.  A find.",

The storyline is quite original and the different characters brought different flavours to this somewhat weird and wonderful film. Its based around three vampires who live together as roommates. They have to deal with day to day life whilst getting various victims to come to there house so they can feed. One of there victims introduces them to modern life and they end up going to night clubs and exploring the Internet. The whole concept is very well put together and at such a cheap budget, they really did do a good job. It does get a big silly after a while but you have to take it with a pinch of salt because your really not supposed to take it seriously. The fact that they are blood sucking vampires who take to a very normal Nick, who doesn't really say that much through the film, made me laugh along with the servant who is dying to become a vampire. Anyway, it's a light hearted comedy about a friendship and brotherhood which has a unique, vampire twist. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nWere do I start with this film? I recognised Jemaine Clement from MIB3, Dinner For Schmucks and Muppets Most Wanted but I haven't seen the other actors before. The film was also written and directed me Jemaine who has a extremely weird sense of humour, which I saw in Tongan Ninja. The main vampire Taika Waititi, had a brief role in the Green Lantern but this has to be his real shot at fame. He also wrote and directed this movie so you have to give him credit for that. Anyway, I doubt that there will ever be a film like this, made again so it's worth a watch for its originality and warped humour.\n\nBudget: $1.6million\nWorldwide Gross: $7million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about 3 roommates, who happen to be vampires, who are shown modern day life after turning a young 20 year old into a vampire. 6/10",

            "content": "For far too long has the vampire subgenre been given the darkly romantic treatment complete with questionable dialogue, gratuitous sex scenes, and bloodsuckers who all look a bit too similar to each other. Vampire spoofs have also been made a number of times, but none of them have sunk their teeth deep enough into the source material in order to turn these dark creatures into hilarious characters. Enter New Zealand's greatest talents since Peter Jackson: Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement. The duo behind the comedy band Flight of the Conchords have created a genre masterpiece that puts the efforts of most professional filmmakers to shame. 'What We Do in the Shadows' is simultaneously one of the funniest genre spoofs in a long time, and one of the greatest vampire films to have graced the screen in years. Waititi and Clement, who also star as two of the mockumentary's bloodthirsty flatmates, waste not one second of their audience's time in delivering comedic gold. Unlike most genre spoofs, jokes and gags aren't enough for Waititi and Clement. Their clever ideas and neat spins on horror tropes give each laugh a sense of true originality. The best jokes happen throughout the film's first half, which brilliantly introduces the characters, sets up the world in which they live, and hilariously explains why vampires prefer virgin blood. As with most comedies, however, the film's narrative is a bit shaky. It falters just a bit towards the end, causing the jokes to become less frequent, but never unfunny. Beneath all the blood-drenched mischief, Waititi and Clement are sure to keep in touch with the emotional context of the characters. The joys of living forever and drinking human blood are explored in hilarious detail, but the sadness behind it all is never ignored, giving the film a fair and surprising amount of sentimentality. If the film's humor is icing on the cake, then its emotional heft is what Waititi and Clement sprinkle on top of it to make it look all the more delicious. The result is an unmissable feat in comedic filmmaking, uncommonly fun genre fare, and quite possibly the best horror comedy since 'Shaun of the Dead'.",

Ahead of the vampire social event of the year, The Unholy Masquerade, Petyr decides to make young Wellington native Nick into a new vampire, who introduces the guys to modern culture. They take martial arts lessons, they bid on eBay, they finally get a TV. And there's still time for them to have a series of altercations with a pack of werewolves led by Clement's old Flight of the Conchords manager, Rhys Darby (\"we're werewolves, not swear wolves.\")\n\nIt's a one-gag concept, but one executed brilliantly. Like This Is Spinal Tap, Shadows hangs its central idea over a mock-documentary framework, with a narrative so slight it's barely there. And like Tap, it succeeds through likable characters (murderous creatures of the night though they are), a gag-ratio with many more hits than misses and buckets of charm - not to mention blood, guts and viscera.",

The film is such a great idea and the characters are so fantastic that its a great film just for those reasons alone, however I found there was a slight lack of substance in some places. I don't really like comedies that much anyway though... Performances are great and dedicated, the actors seem to really invest in their characters and there seems to be an almost improvisational element to certain scenes where the actors give such good performances that they disappear into their characters. Good film but not my sort of thing, really.",

A parody of vampire movies isn't simple to make, just ask the directors of Vampire Sucks, but in What We Do in the Shadows Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi manage to direct a funny and engaging film about vampires. Clement and Waititi are known for the TV series Flight of the Conchords which Clement has starred in and helped create, while Waititi has directed a couple of episodes. These New Zealand directors also write and star in this film which was mostly improvised (they had over 120 hours of footage which was later edited to under 85 minutes). This is perhaps one of the funniest mockumentaries I've seen since Borat and many have compared it to This is Spinal Tap (but I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't seen it yet). It is very witty and it plays around many of the vampire genre conventions, but it does so with a fantastic sense of humor giving each one of the vampires a distinct personality. It also centers on the day to day domestic life these vampires lead as they live together in a flat and are given specific chores in the home. So in a way it almost plays out as a sort of spoof of The Real World as well considering they have arguments about someone not doing the dishes, or are always giving each other advice as to what to wear for the night, or even making sure they clean up the mess they leave behind from their victims. It's about friendship and learning to live with each other. I was a huge fan of Only Lovers Left Alive which was another engaging vampire film that took a unique spin on the genre, but this is much lighter and is played entirely for laughs. I had a great time and laughed throughout the film.\n\nOne of the best things about this vampire mockumentary is that they decided to have these four vampires living together in a flat despite being completely different from each other and coming from different backgrounds. There is Viago (Taika Waititi) who is over 300 years old and who came to New Zealand to pursue a love interest, Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) who was once a powerful vampire from the Middle Ages who lost most of his powers to someone he calls the Beast, Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) who is the youngest of the group and who refuses to wash the dishes saying that vampires shouldn't have to, and then there is Petyr (Ben Fransham), a vampire over 8000 years old that looks like Nosferatu. The film centers on these vampires following their every day routines while they are being filmed by a documentary crew. There are several instances where they talk to the camera explaining who they are. While we follow these characters they run in to some other creatures like werewolves, zombies, and even witches, which makes for some funny scenes with quotable lines. Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stuart Rutherford also play supporting roles in this film but I don't want to get into too much detail because it is more fun if you simply enjoy the wackiness of everything unfolding before the screen.\n\nMockumentaries and vampire films aren't perhaps something most audiences would be interested in considering they have been overdone in recent years, but the combination of these two genres make for a very entertaining and funny movie. What could've very easily been a one punch joke and lost most of its steam during the first 10 minutes ends up stretching out very well and the jokes continue to feel fresh and inventive. In other hands this could've simply worked as a short film, but Waititi and Clement manage to keep the humor coming throughout the entire 80 minutes. It is a perfectly executed film with many memorable scenes. There is even a scene that seems to be parodying the hall way scene in Inception so there are a lot of different funny things going on in this movie which mostly involve parodying vampire genre conventions.    \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

It's packed with laughs, nearly all of them intentional. In this mockumentary from New Zealand, we follow the lives of aging vampires in need of a little humanity to give the fresh blood and a new reason for living. Jermaine Clement, of the immortal Flight of The Conchords, is orgy-loving bloodsucker Vladislav, who's been living for 862 years and hasn't learned much of anything. His longtime buddy Viago (Taika Waititi), a child of 379, tries hard to some of his past, particularly the Nazi parts. And then things leak out.\n\nAs co-directors and writers, Clement and Waititi save real zingers for the rest of the vamps they share a pad with. There's Deaconn (Jonathan Brugh), the young, 183-year-old rebel, and Petyr (Ben Fransham), a literal old bat at 8,000. No need to worry about keeping track of everyone, just feast your eyes on the bloody dishes in the sink and that poker that Vladislav carries. Often What We Do In The Shadows is like a sketch stretched to movie length but who cares when you have a comedy this sensationally funny.",

            "content": "Great comedy can come from the most unlikely of places, both in terms of location and subject matter. How about vampires? Are they funny? They can be. They've been fodder for many big-screen comedies over the years. How about a vampire comedy from, oh... say, New Zealand? Believe it or not, that's the combination you get in \"What We Do in the Shadows\" (NR, 1:26) - and, as the movie's poster makes clear, it is hilarious! \n\nThis is a mockumentary about four vampires living together in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand. They've invited a film crew (promising not to eat them) into their house to document the vampires' daily lives (actually, nightly lives) and their preparations for the annual Unholy Masquerade ball. The vampires have a variety of backgrounds and personalities. The one who addresses the camera most is Viago (Taika Waititi, who also co-wrote and co-directed the film). He was \"a bit of a dandy\" before he became a vampire three centuries ago and now basically acts as the group's housemother, calling a meeting to discuss chores, for example. Vladislav (Jemaine Clement, the other half of the film's writing-directing team) is the ladies vamp of the group and, back in the day, was much feared for his habit of \"poking people\" (a winking homage to the real-life Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration for the legendary Dracula character). The group's youngest member is Deacon (Jonathan Brugh). He's less than two centuries old and he's the most impetuous of the four. Oh, and he used to be a Nazi.  The fourth blood sucker is 8,000 year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham). He's the oldest of the group (looking like the vampire in the classic silent film \"Nosferatu\") - and he's also the crankiest. He usually just stays in his closet. \n\nMost nights, the three youngsters of the group go out to clubs looking for victims (and sometimes harassing the local werewolves), but sometimes they have a dinner party - a phrase that takes on a whole new meaning in this case. Deacon has a human servant named Jackie (Jackie Van Beek) who helps out the housemates by doing everything from cleaning up blood that has been spilled in their house, to helping them get new victims. Deacon has promised Jackie that, after a certain period of service, he'll make her a vampire. One day Jackie brings a couple old acquaintances, named Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) and Katherine (Ethel Robinson) to the house for one of those dinner parties. After playing it cool for a while, and then briefly toying with their guests, they attack. They suck Katherine's blood, but Petyr gets a hold of Nick and turns him into a vampire.\nNick ends up moving in to the house. The guys teach him about being a vampire (important things like - don't tell everyone that you're a vampire!) and he helps them get up to date on modern technology (including cell phones, the internet and Skype). Nick starts bringing his best friend, Stu (Stuart Rutherford) around to the house. That's usually a big no-no amongst the children of the night, but Stu takes it all in stride, and they all really like him, so they decide that it's cool. But that's not the end of the story. This situation comes to a head (along with a long-standing feud between Vlad and a rival vampire whom he calls \"The Beast\") at The Unholy Masquerade. All that, along with a few zombies and other \"predeceased\" creatures thrown into the mix (not to mention a pivotal encounter with that pack of werewolves) and the movie has an ending that is to die for. \n\nA lot of the comedy in \"What We Do in the Shadows\" comes from the juxtaposition of the vampires' politeness and their brutality, as well as the matter-of-fact way that they talk about their lifestyle and nefarious nocturnal activities. A good example would be Jackie driving in her car, casually discussing the merits of eternal life as a vampire, or Nick talking about the ups and downs of being a vampire and ending with \"It sucks.\" Whether the comedy makes you laugh out loud or you simply find it quietly amusing is a matter of individual personality, but most people seem to agree that, no matter how you define it, this movie is very funny - and very clever. It goes to show that filmmakers don't need millions of dollars, big-name stars and an elaborate story to make a quality film. A great concept, properly fleshed out (no pun intended) and a few creative and talented actors will do.  This movie is like a great amusement park ride. It's scary, fun and unique - and as soon as the ride is over, you want to get right back in line and enjoy it all over again. \"A-\"",

The movie follows them for a few days throughout their lives and how they deal with anything from house chores, going out, eating, etc. It's really well done and has that New Zealand dry sense of humor that was very present in \"Flight of the Conchords.\" I would take a look at the trailer and if that interests you then definitely give this one a look!

Think the mixed of Behind The Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon and a bit of Cabin In The Woods and you will get this vampire twisted-genre film that pokes fun at several vampire references and will make you laugh like crazy from start till finish. There are some SCARY make-up and jump scares here but overall the film is more of a comedy so don't go in expecting any of that kind like Housebound as well as the GORES. While the plot may not seem to be fully developed enough but as long as it can crack you up all the way through with several laugh-out-loud moments, plus making fun of the genre you love, that's just all it takes for me for a successful horror/comedy film [A]",

They have \"flat meetings\" at which they discuss mundane topics like the shirking of chores (one guy almost never washes the blood-soaked dishes when it's his turn). They obsess over what to wear when they go out clubbing. One of them even knits. \n\nThey have occasional run-ins with their arch-rivals, a pack of werewolves, but these are rarely more than taunting and name-calling. Mostly, they're a nice, polite, group of guys who just happen to be vampires.\n\nThings get shaken up a bit when they invite a young, newly-minted vampire to share the house, and he and his best human buddy, a taciturn systems analyst named Stu become one of the gang. \n\n\"What We Do in the Shadows\" is the funniest film I've seen in ages.  I rarely laugh out loud at movies, but this was a rare exception. From goofy sight gags to clever dialogue, the humor just keeps on coming. Not everything works - buckets of blood get old after a while and I'm not a big fan of fight or chase scenes - but things move along so quickly that even if one scene misses, another laugh is always just around the corner. \n\nThe big surprise here is that for a comedy about vampires, this movie is actually quite sweet.

            "content": "Humour of the darker and more subtle variant typically works best for me. What We Do in the Shadows is not only clever in its writing, but also highly effective in its comedic timing.\n\nThe mockumentary approach isn't exactly a new thing, but it's very well executed here in terms of camera work, flow in dialogue and set design. The premise of four vampires living together in a flat and dealing with undeath rather than life is a delight to watch and follow even though it's mainly played for laughs. The main characters Vladislav, Viago, Deacon and Petyr (even though not getting to do as much) are portrayed superbly by Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh and Ben Fransham, and each have their brilliant moments. Viago for instance is the archetypical gentleman who makes sure his victims have a good time before placing his fangs into their necks. I figured that Vladislav would be my favourite character, but I grew to love all of them as a whole, convinced they've been friends literally forever.\n\nOne thing that bothered me though was one of the side characters. Nick, played by Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, is visiting the four vampires unknowingly being prepared to become dinner for them. When he finds out, he is reacting kind of stiff to the situation. But then again how would one react if it actually happened. Without spoiling he becomes their friend in a somewhat complicated manner and he grows from there, pulling off a good performance for the rest of the flick.\n\nThe film even briefly get into the main characters' background and introduces other creatures further ahead, such as werewolves and zombies, as I'm sure we're not used to see them in fiction. I wouldn't mind if the movie put some more time to them as well, such as a couple short interviews, as I don't think that would detract too much from the main storyline.\n\nLastly I'd like to mention that the film makes clever use of visual and practical effects. They are quite well made, few in between and mainly shown in glimpses, which keeps in tone with the rest of the film. Related to that What We Do in the Shadows even contains effective horror scenes, blending seamlessly with the rest.\n\nIn short it's a wonderful movie and you should watch it if you're the least bit interested in vampire lore.",

A surprising amount of warmth surfaces amongst this pseudo family of sorts. It isn't a movie in the traditional sense. That is, it doesn't present a self contained story. It's more of a series of gags strung together. That might irk some. However the account is so brief (86 minutes) that the lack of a strong narrative isn't a problem. The unique mix is somewhat odd, but it generally works. An apt point of reference would be the documentary This Is Spinal Tap, except well ya know it's about vampires instead of rock musicians. The script has a very high ratio of jokes that really tickle the funny bone. Although the loosely constructed picture doesn't immediately feel like a comedic classic, it's solidly written. Repeat viewings should give this a longevity that will make it an enduring cult movie for many years to come.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

It seems like it's constantly right on the verge of doing something really hilarious, but can't quite flip the switch. The landscape is ripe for this kind of a satire, too, with so much empty romanticism hovering around the fantasy genre. Most of the fun comes from picking apart the hallmarks of the bloodsucker game, exposing them for the lame parlor tricks and absurd handicaps they really are. Mystically swapping a plate of noodles for worms, for example, to the mild annoyance of the victim. Failing to enter a nightclub because the bouncer doesn't explicitly invite them in. In most films, these would be appetizers for the main entree, but in this case there's no second course.

            "content": "A common predisposition when it comes to genre pieces - particularly horror and its subgenres - is the \"Oh, great. Another ****ing [insert a movie's particular genre/subgenre here] movie. I wonder what 'new' things this'll introduce to the genre...\" which is said - more often than not - in a delicious cocktail of contempt, weariness and cynicism. And its a rarely proven wrong predisposition, especially when it comes to modern horror. But this predisposition has never cropped up when it comes to horror comedies that come out of New Zealand. Why?\n\nIt's because the Kiwis know how to make horror comedies, and prove to be about as close to an art form to them as to how the shaky cam effect is an art form to someone attempting to emulate Parkinson's disease. From Peter Jackson's hilariously exploitative and baffling Braindead (1991) to Jonathan King's 'splatstick' Black Sheep (2006), and most recently, Gerard Johnstone's haunted house caper in last year's Housebound, filmmakers that dabble with horror comedies in New Zealand have been consistently hitting it out of the park. And What We Do in the Shadows doesn't fall short.\n\nThe problem with the horror genre is exactly the aforementioned predisposition; introducing something new. Movies that break the norm - The House of the Devil (2009), The Sacrament (2013), Starry Eyes (2014), The Babadook (2014) etc - are quickly picked up, dissected, and then praised for their particular unique qualities. By taking ancient vampires and placing them in a modern setting, directors and writers (and actors) Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement craft a seemingly brilliant tale with enough potential in What We Do in the Shadows to give its vampyre competitors a run for their warm supply of blood.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows sets itself apart from other horror comedies due to the heart that is injected into the film. By stacking an absurd amount of varying years into the 'ancient' bit of the age of each of the vampires, then placing them into a flat, Waititi and Clement are effectively grounding the vampires in 'realism' for the intended mockumentary angle; they share - more or less - the same problems that their less sexy human counterparts have, and with the distinction being that they're, well, \"shit-sucking vampires\", the filmmakers effectively provide several funny spins on the already macabre vampire premise.\n\nFurther aided by the colorful characters, their nuanced characterizations, eccentricities and personalities being projected amazingly through the performances of Waititi, Clement, Jonathan Brugh, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and their chemistry with each other and the other actors, What We Do In the Shadows is a much better investment than the usual watered down vampire schlock.",

Petyr was also very hilarious and this is one of Jemaine Clements' best roles. From start to finish it is a belly full-a laughs. Rhys Darby is also extremely funny as the lead of the werewolf pack. Some may criticise the hand-held camerawork and the bleak aesthetic, but I think you're missing the point. In fact that is the whole point of them.

So I got to see it, and it was actually way better than I thought was going to be. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement, and Rhys Darby are really good, and they having a lot of fun in this with each other. The three of them have really good chemistry together and bring a lot of laughs. There's not much of a plot going on and was more or less just a way to introduce a bunch of skits, but it didn't really bother me as I was having a great laugh watching the skits, so I was forgiving on that. I really like the characters in this, and I really bought why it's being filmed, which is definitely more then I can say for half the Paranormal Activity films.

            "content": "What We Do in the Shadows. This movie was hilarious! The premise is that a New Zealand documentary film crew is granted access to a flat owned by a small sect of Vampires. These vampires show the crew some of their day to day lives and events leading up to the biggest event of the year, the Unholy Masquerade. This seems mundane but the plot is riddled with moments that lead to humorous conflicts and situations. And the cast plays these moments with a great sincerity and genuine casualness that makes the film great.\n\nThings I Liked\n\nJemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. Both of these comedians are responsible for the hilarious Flight of the Conchords series. And the casual matter of fact humor translates into Shadows as well. They play two of the leads Vladislav, 800+ years old, and Viago 400 years old, respectively. They both have hilarious interactions and asides to the camera, Clement's Vlad is a hilarious as he emits failed sexual energy and moments of, as I call it, \"vampyric impotence\" where he struggles with his abilities following a humiliating defeat from \"The Beast\". Waititi plays Viago, who came to New Zealand after and old love but got rerouted in customs and took too long to get there. He is the \"mother hen\" of the group making sure chores are done and that the house is in order. He is very sweet natured and has a sense of regrettable disgust in killing humans. The pair make the movie as they interact with the other characters.\n\nThe Tone. The movie has a sense of dark mystery usually associated with Vampires. Which when contrasted with the action makes things that much funnier. The tone of the film is an interesting combination of dark, mysterious, mundane, routine, and funny. There are many humorous twists on the traditional mythical vampirisms and imagery and they are just so out there that you can't help but laugh as they appear.\n\nTwist to the Genre. There are many moments that play at the traditional vampire films AND the traditional mocumentary moments. From the cranky old man of the group looking like Count Orlok, to the fact that the crew filming is suddenly in danger when someone realizes they aren't vampires. There are jokes about werewolf pack etiquette and trouble with hunting and eating humans. It all works very well and keeps the film interesting and entertaining, especially when you know the cliches and can laugh at them.\n\nThings I Didn't Like\n\nPace. Ok, I didn't really dislike the pace, but there were a few moments that dragged. This is a normal problem with comedies. They either work or they don't and in this case a lot of the film works. But there are a few moments where things don't move along and feel like they were just inserted for not reason other then the writers and directors thought it would be a funny moment. But this is a minor complaint.\n\nLack of Time with Minor Characters. There are a number of minor characters that get introduced, then we get a tease as to some of their background, and then they are gone and we don't hear much more from them. And while it doesn't really ruin the movie, it is something just made me want more. I was bummed when the movie ended and I could have watched another hour of just these side characters interacting with the leads. If this is the biggest problem I had with a movie, then you know that I must have enjoyed the hell out of it.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows is hilarious, fun and thoroughly entertaining. I enjoyed the hell out of it. This is currently the best movie I have seen this year and I would watch it again in a heartbeat. If you enjoy some satire and are sick and tired of all these effin' vampire movies that do the same old thing, then I highly recommend this one. It is fun, original, and unlike anything I've seen in a long time.",

Its striking originality, inventive humor and hilarious performances make this movie an awesome satire which is easily establishes it as the most horrifying vampire movie among the comedies and  the most hilarious comedy among the vampire horrors. \nBased on the already clich√©d mockamentary genre What We Do In The Shadows is a \"journalistic investigation\" covering the uneasy life of four vampires living in New Zealand. A social and very personal study on four generations of vampires, the plot is as energetic and inventive as a real comedy should be. By humanizing his characters, directing duo Taika Waititi and Jemeine Clement extract enough amount of funny moments coming from issues such as who is going to clean the dishes in the next century.  \nThe charm of What We Do In The Shadows is hidden not only in its nicely paced story, but also in the ability of its characters to deliver horrifying performances with a mix of spiced-up weirdo humor. As telling more about the story would reveal some funny spoilers related to the character, I would limit myself to saying the accents of these guys combined with their vampire age are a huge part of the fun in the story.\nAs a conclusion, it may be a surprise to many who are normally focused on Hollywood comedies that What We Do In The Shadows could be labeled not only as the best comedy of the last 12 month, but as the most original fun since The Hangover or Ted. It is just that type of comedy that demands your attention and delivers a smart, sharp dialogue-driven entertainment which could definitely be used as a fine example that comedies are not necessarily filled with idiot clich√©d gags. Definitely a must see !",

            "content": "What We Do in the Shadows (2015) - I've spoken time and time again about my growing distaste in the modern comedy genre. It's gross, un-creative and mostly recycles the same bland jokes, leaving me with the same bad after-taste one would get from eating at a junky fast food chain. So low and behold, what I would consider one of the funniest movies in recent memory somehow gets released in February of 2015... Who knew? Mostly known for their work on \"Flight of the Concords\", Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi direct and stars (along with other Concords regulars) in this horror comedy. Shot in a \"mockumentary\" style ala \"This is Spinaltap\", the film centers around the hijinx of four room-mates who deal with everyday problems like: who's on dish duty, paying the rent, going out clubbing... Oh, and did I mention they're vampires?... \n\nFrom it's opening moments, the movie introduces its characters and world and wastes no time at all making you laugh. Each character in the film represents a personification of the classic monster from different eras of writing, lending to a culturally diverse set of immortally aged characters which plays into the fun. The movie basically runs on one joke, it just so happens that the one joke is so damn funny it'll have you in stitches until your nose bleeds. My immediate take away from the movie overall was in how likeable this cast is. Make no mistake, these are vicious killers and monsters... But my god are they charming. This is thanks in large part to the devoted cast, who are equally having fun with their respective roles while also bleeding some of their own likeable personalities into the characters. Fake bad accents and all, you completely buy this New Zealand based lot as creatures of the night.\n\nWith that said, the movie isn't without its detriments. The \"mockumentary\" shooting style both helps and holds back the film from potentially utilizing some of its gags more effectively. Though I did have fun with the characters interacting with the camera-man, thus breaking the fourth wall... It does suffer a little from the \"found footage\" symptom of \"why are they shooting this now? Why isn't this shot normally?\". The visual effects are very simple but get the job done well enough and in most cases actually make the situations more funny. The real issue here lies in the almost transparent plot. As I said, the movie runs on essentially one really well told joke which results in the film losing steam in its third act. The pay-off doesn't feel quite a strong as the set-up which dilutes the experience slightly as a whole.\n\nWith that said, I do strongly urge everyone to check this movie out whenever it becomes available to you because it's rare that you get a comedy this well executed and dare I say \"smart\". It re-introduces vampire lore in hilariously situational ways that will have both the horror and comedy fans grinning ear to ear. It's charming, cute while also not pulling any punches with grit and gore. Not since \"Shaun of the Dead\" has horror and comedy come together this well, it'll have you laughing all the way to your coffin.\n\nGRADE: B+",

Mockumentaries on the other hand I love (when done well) When it comes to mockumentaries, anything and everything goes, there are no real rules, as long as it's somewhat believable, interesting and makes us laugh usually a mockumentary is well received. Give anything some interesting characters and a reality storyline and it's usually enough to make us want to watch. I personally had never heard of \"What we do in the shadows\" until a friend asked me my thoughts, after watching the trailer I had the film in no time ready to watch.\nViago, Deacon, Petyr and Vladislav are four housemates who rent a property in New Zealand, they have lived together for a very long time and know all there is to know about each other, the guys have one thing in common; they are all vampires and each of them is between 100 and 300 years old, never aging from the time they were originally turned. The film follows three of the group as they go about their daily business from their eating habits to their cleaning habits even introducing us at one point to their enemies. Along the way they meet Nick who is turned and decide they need to show him their world and how to survive it on a day to day basis.\nWhat we do in the shadows is a laugh a minute, literally. Line after line of jokes, wit and humour never end. Being a mockumentary film the character development is quite strong, you do actually end up feeling sorry and getting involved in each of their lives and the journey they undertake. I personally thought the characters were fantastic, each had their quirks and quips which made them stand out for their own reasons. Starring Jemaine Clement (Eagle Vs Shark, Flight of the Conchords) as Vladislav. Taika Waititi (Eagle vs Shark, Boy) as Viago. Jonathan Brugh (How to meet girls from a distance) as Deacon. Ben Fransham (30 Days of Night, The Ferryman) as Petyr and Cori Gonzalez-Macuer (Eagle vs Shark) as Nick. The guys were brilliant, funny and captivating, never taking themselves too seriously but seriously enough to engage you in their mishaps and adventures.\nThe film is based around a short film made by the same people in 2006, being a mockumentary the camera work is pretty much hand held camera work, but it works well in its style and you never feel you're missing anything. The directors, writers and actors who all worked together have done an outstanding job in making some good fun lighthearted entertainment. Not really one for the younger kids and the teens won't really get all the hidden jokes throughout but I think mums and dads who have a slightly warped sense of humour will love it.",

The TV series The Office has had great success in recent times and the likes of Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap has made a lasting impression on people since it's release in 1984. However, Waititi and Clement have came up with a new (and strangely obvious) idea on how to gain more mileage from this particular style of filmmaking. Why has no one tapped into the lore and dark myths of vampires and used it for laughs? Granted, some films like Vampire's Kiss in 1989 had an outrageous Nicolas Cage using his couch as a coffin and (famously) eating live cockroaches and Roman Polanski's 1967 The Fearless Vampire Killers had found a cult status but vampire's, probably now more than ever, are in very hot demand what with the Twilight movies and HBO's True Blood. We can't seem to get enough of them but we are still taking them all very seriously. As a result, this film comes at a perfect time.\n\nFor a project of this nature to work, though, you have to be up on your vampire knowledge and the pop-culture surrounding them. By this, I mean from Bram Stoker to Anne Rice; Blade to The Lost Boys and not forgetting Nosferatu along the way. You also have to open to the ways and needs of a vampire's existence. If you are all of the above, then sit back and allow this film to sink it's teeth in and deliver it hilariously satirical comedy. \n\nFirst and foremost, the characters are brilliantly written and every one of the actors deliver brilliant performances. Each of our vampires have their own style (or lack of, as the case may be); we have the 379 year old Viago (Taika Waititi), the dandy gent of Anne Rice.\n183 year old Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), the cool rock star type al la The Lost Boys.\n862 year old Vladislav (Jermaine Clement) who riffs on Bram Stoker's work and 8,000 year old Petyr (Ben Fransham), hiding in his darkened room and resembling the Max Schreck of Nosferatu!\n \nAs they co-habit and flat share, they argue about domestic duties and who's turn it is to do the dishes. Deacon hasn't done them in five years and anal-retentive Viago would like his flatmates to give some consideration for the decor and furnishings by putting newspapers down before feasting on their victims as the arterial spray can cause quite a mess. They even knit a scarf for their human friend who they all agree not to feed on. \nIt's these exchanges with each other that provide genuine laughs and as they scour the New Zealand night scene for \"food\" they must rely on doormen to invite them into nightclubs as they can't enter on their own accord and have run-in's with the local Werewolves who are so gentlemanly and well mannered that they don't want to be known as Swearwolves.\n\nAdmittedly, there are periodic lulls but, thankfully, they're brief and when the laughs are delivered they can be genuinely side splitting. I can often be very critical of both horror and comedy as I often find that they either try too hard or simply don't have the material but What We Do In the Shadows really hits the spot with sharp and observant humour, \n\nA hugely successful medley of of a filmmaking style and pop-culture sub-genre that is, without a doubt, one of the silliest and funniest films of 2014.\n\nMark Walker",

I have never seen a minute of Flight of the Concords so I wasn't sure of what to expect in terms of content or comedy, but I mostly enjoyed myself. I don't have a ton of stuff to say about What We Do in the Shadows, but there are stretches where it's very funny, but there are also stretches where it seems to overstay its welcome and very short runtime. As Mark Kermode would say, this movie passed the six-laugh test. It may start off a little shaky but it quickly finds its feet and tone, and then stays in its sweet spot for about another 40 minutes. That first half is witty, smart, and actually somewhat creative. Taiki Waitiki is easily the best of the cast; everything ranging from his facial reactions to his spoken delivery is perfectly solid. He also happens to be mostly what holds the second half together. The second half isn't bad, it just tends to repeat jokes from earlier in the film and therefore feels less clever. I still laughed just enough, but there are some sequences that are notably less engaging to the point where they just cross the barrier into taking you out of the experience. Again, this isn't very often, but just enough to make an impact. Overall, I'd say that I enjoyed What We Do in the Shadows, but it seemed like it worked better for people that familiar with and fans of the creators' humor. Some of the problems that I had don't quite seem to be completely shared given that large portions of my audience was laughing throughout. I guess in that case, you'll either like this movie or you'll like it a lot. 7/10, pretty good, one thumb up, above average, etc.",

What We Do in the Shadows is a bloody-good time at the movies!\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n+ Some of the jokes had me dying of laughter. They were clever sand unique. The humour in the film is really smart, with chuckles all over the place.\n\n+ The mockumentary style worked perfectly, and was well executed! Probably one of the best of its genre. \n\n+ The characters were loveable! They were all well developed and were different than what I've seen in vampire films before.\n\n+ The atmosphere was creepy but fun at the same time. \n\n+ There were tons of references to older vampire movies. It payed homage to classic and recent horror films too.\n\n+ The pace was extremely fast and the whole film was entertaining. I never felt bored once.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Here's where I took off most of the points. The jokes weren't consistent at all. There were periods up to fifteen minutes where I didn't laugh at all. This is unfortunate, because the parts that were funny were hysterical!\n\n- The ending felt completely abrupt and came out of nowhere. By the end, I said \"that's it?\".\n\n- There were a couple of jokes that fell flat for me.\n\nOverall, What We Do in the Shadows is a hilarious, creative and utterly entertaining comedy with incredible jokes and a cool atmosphere.

It's a simple day in the life kind of mockumentary for these small group in a flat in New Zealand.\n\nWhile the takes on vampires isn't necessarily fresh...I'm talking about partying at night and avoiding the cliches we've come to know...everything comes out as a joke.  The closest film I can relate this to is Four Brothers.  \n\nFlight of the Concords worked so well on a platform of music and sketches, so this comes off as a drawn out television show with a bunch of different events that would have worked well in short spurts.  \n\nAt only 80 minutes long, this offers every cheap and hearty laugh you'd expect from a group of guys who do well at their craft.",

            "content": "When you think of New Zealand there are certain things that spring to mind, unfortunately most of those things now tend revolve around Hobbits. Despite New Zealand being used as the backdrop for Tolkien's fantasy world its still not really the first place you'd associate with vampires, especially vampires living in the suburbs of Wellington. So it was admittedly  kinda surprising to see a vampire movie emerge from the island of Kiwis, but not just a vampire movie...a vampire comedy mockumentary.\n\nPut basically this film takes the popular reality TV concept and blends it with the popular slightly romantic vision of vampires (Anne Rice type vampires) whilst also adding other ghouls and mythical creatures in a bare bones hyperbole of blood. A camera crew stays in a decrepit house with four vampires and follows their daily routines trying to exist in the present day. The film crew have been given special permission to film these ancient creatures of the night as they prepare for a special event, a special ball...the crew were also given assurance they wouldn't be eaten.\n\nThe four vampires are a mixed bunch from the distant pages of time. Viago (379 years old) is the main vampire who talks to us most of the time, he was an 18th century dandy, a wealthy man who is prim proper and pedantic and likes the house clean and tidy (the Lestat de Lioncourt of the bunch). Deacon is the bad boy of the group...or so he likes to think (183 years old). He's the young rebellious rock n roll leather pant wearing vampire who thinks he's hot stuff, the irony being he clearly isn't. \n\n'If you were a Nazi after the war...uh-uh'\n'If you were a vampire'...*shakes head*\n'If you were a Nazi vampire! no way!! I was outta there!'\n\nVladislav is the second eldest vampire (862 years old) who grew up during the medieval ages and was a tyrant. He's the most dated and out of touch vampire, HE is the sexual deviant of the bunch, the ladies man. His appearance is more in line with the traditional romantic vampiric appearance (the Gary Oldman/Coppola vampire of the bunch). Then lastly there is Petyr who is the eldest vampire at 8000 years of age. This guy is obviously a homage to the Count Orlok character in the F.W. Murnau film 'Nosferatu'. He doesn't say anything but merely nods or hisses and is virtually more animalistic or creature-like than the others.\n\nSo apart from the usual vampire-esque things you'd expect to see what is different about this movie? Well for one its all filmed with hand held cameras because its a reality show, not exactly a new idea but it makes the whole film look very realistic in terms of a reality show that is. They have clearly gone out and about in Wellington and filmed on the fly with real unknowing people which makes things more intriguing and fun. In fact its hard to tell at times if the people we see are in the movie or simply real folk unaware they are being filmed.\n\nSome of the main things that really stand out are the extremely humorous little chats the vamps have with the cam crew (ala Big Brother) as they bicker about each other and whine about life in general. It is absolutely hilarious to watch these guys moan and take the piss out of traditional vampire lore turning it into annoying everyday situations. A really clever aspect is the fact vampires don't cast a reflection...so how do they know what they look like? This is clever simply because you've probably never even thought about that. Vampires tend to look very glamorous in certain movies yet how do they know they look glamorous, they might look like shit. So we are presented with a brilliantly funny sequence where these vamps must draw each other in certain attire and make dummies to put the clothes on, so they have an idea of how they will look when they cruise the town at night.\n\n'I think we drink virgin blood because...it sounds cool'\n'I think of it like this...if you're going to eat a sandwich...you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it'\n\nThen there is the issue of how to kill and drain a victim without making a mess on the carpet and furniture. How do they get all their clothes cleaned, washing up all the blood stained cutlery and dishes, how to find victims/virgins, keeping their vampire skills honed, general entertainment, coping with modern technology, flying through windows, trying to hypnotise victims when they're glued to the TV or a laptop and getting to grips with a new vampire and his human friend. The answer to many of these things being a female human slave who acts like a personal secretary with a shopping list of victims which is a fantastic twist. \n\nYou wouldn't think a film like this would have many special effects and if they did they'd be crappy, but you'd be wrong. OK there aren't lots of effects everywhere, they are sparse, but what we do see is cleverly done and highly effective in a tacky kind of way. We see the vamps flying around and hovering, Viago rises from his bed in that classic vertical manner, the guys change into bats, there are of course classic practical blood effects and most impressively we see the guys able to walk (and fight) up the walls and across the ceiling. One scene in particular shows two of the guys fighting up the walls and across the ceiling in one shot and it really does look fab (a rotating set I'm guessing). I must also add that the sets are really atmospheric too, again clearly basic but they work so well.\n\nThe only thing I didn't quite like about this movie was the adding of other creatures of the night such as werewolves and zombies especially. I guess the werewolves I can accept but the way they are presented and acted out by the cast just doesn't quite work as well I think. The vampires have a clear distinction between themselves, you can send up different variations of vampires and there is so much you can do. With the werewolves its not really the same, one werewolf doesn't really differ from another, the jokes tend to be childish toilet/animal gags and they don't have any kind of distinctive look, they just look like regular boring humans. Of course once they turn things get a bit more exciting but then you lose the comedy aspect and it obviously becomes more of a genuine horror which you don't really want here. As for other monsters such as zombies that was a step too far for me, that felt like they were pushing it too much. \n\nI loved the cast in this film I really did, each of the three main vampires are really well portrayed and highly amusing throughout. In fact I can't even say which vampire was my favourite because they were all tops. Each actor had some very funny dialog and they are all gifted with amusing rubbery faces which helps. I won't lie and say its a perfect film that is full of laugh out loud moments from start to finish...but its damn close. Considering this came out of nowhere, the cast is unknown (to me), its a New Zealand made film (no disrespect) and the budget appears to be small...its a fine comedy that deserves much kudos. Its like...'Spinal Tap' but with vampires.\n\n'When you get four vampires in a flat obviously there's going to be a lot of tension, there's tension in any flatting situation'",

The reason it works is largely due to a witty script with a decent gag quota which takes rules and conventions in the vampire movie genre like they cannot see their reflections in the mirror, or that they can not come in unless they are asked and push them to their logical and surreal conclusions. The writers, well aware that the film can easily drift into a one-joke film stretched out too thin, have kept it sweet and under 90mins. The vampire comedy is hardly a tough category to compete in (as anyone who's even heard of Lesbian Vampire Killers or Dead And Loving It will attest) but we have finally found one where they managed to successfully fused horror with comedy on screen in an unforced and more than dignified manner.",

A documentary crew come in to examine the life of these creatures as they try to find virgin blood, antagonize a group of werewolves and train up newly created vampire Nick. A series of mishaps occur, leading to a series of hilarious situations.\n\nWriter/director team Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement also star in this mockumentary comedy, alongside a local cast including Jonathan Brugh, Ben Fransham, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, Stu Rutherford, Jackie Van Beek and Clement's \"Flight of the Concords\" co-star Rhys Darby. All were accomplished enough to bring forward brilliant comic timing.\n\nThis timing, alongside the quality of writing, is the main reason this movie is so hilarious. Yes, some of the jokes do edge towards sillyness, but this sillyness is a step above the cliched Hollywood style of humour that gets churned out every few weeks.\n\nI don't want to elevate this film too highly too early, as I haven't done any rewatching yet, but I must say that very few films have made me laugh this consistently throughout the film. This alone puts this film up there with \"Airplane!\" and \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" (though maybe a tiny rung below the latter).\n\nA very funny film that nearly everyone needs to see.

        {
            "content": "Serving as a critically acclaimed horror comedy mockumentary, What We Do in the Shadows sounded like a very original concept.\n\nUnlike most horror comedies of today, What We Do in the Shadows does not take itself seriously nor does it become a juvenile spoof film. It tries for nothing but humour, and most of the time it succeeds. This is partially because of just how much fun the makers of the film are willing to have with the material. Instead of getting caught up in the story, What We Do in the Shadows unfolds like a series of sketches cleverly crafted into a single narrative through the most simple means. The lack of narrative may frustrate some viewers and the thin characters may do the same, but those are two things you cannot expect from a horror comedy mockumentary. There are strong characters not on the level of depth but purely in terms of being effective comic creations, and it's all about the laughter. It is hard for comedy films to just sit back and have fun these days, and although What We Do in the Shadows is also a stylish piece of filmmaking, it certainly remains focused on playing at its comic gimmicks for all it can. The one problem I found with this was that there is only so long that the gimmick can stretch on for in What We Do in the Shadows before it finds itself repetitive. The story is clever enough, but I could not help but feel that it was like a sketch comedy stretched to feature length. It sustained itself well enough to pass off as sufficient comedic entertainment, but the value of the film comes from the way that its narrative essentially sorts itself into segments. There are many sketches that unfold over the course of the mockumentary, and viewers who do not get lost in the comic nature of the film should hopefully still find it to be a sporadically funny film as that is how it succeeded for me. The gimmicks of the film do not milk themselves for too long as the running time of What We Do in the Shadows is a mere 85 minutes, but there certainly was potential to do more with the film. There could have been countless clever cultural references to enhance the humour of the film, but it ends up limiting itself simply to concept gags without really going into examining just what it takes to turn horror into comedy. The simplicity of the film is admirable and the fact that it manages to achieve everything on a cast of mostly unknown actors is very respectable, but the script in the film is just very loose which is a problem.\nWhat We Do in the Shadows succeeds not so much on the written material but the way that directors Taika Waititi and Jeremaine Clement do with it, as well as where the cast manage to take things. Things move along very quickly and the atmosphere is consistently humourous due to the way that it really makes things feel lighthearted. In that sense, What We Do in the Shadows is a really easy film to watch as it does not demand viewers sit back and analse why it is supposed to be funny but rather throws them into remorselessly quick witted situations which are shamelessly dumb in a smart fashion, though some of the jokes circulate the film so consistently often that it can be repetitive. Much of the humour in What We Do in the Shadows is so upfront with its simplistic ridiculousness that it can be hilarious at times while ridiculous at others. But all in all, it remains an entertaining feature full of the best kind of silliness offered by modern day sketch comedy. What We Do in the Shadows knows how to have fun without complicating itself. It may not push as many limits as it could for a film which is so clearly in debt to countless vampire films, but it is certainly good old fashioned fun.\nNo stranger to being stylish, What We Do in the Shadows manages to hold some effective visual humour. Effectively using clever special effects to play with the abilities of the supernatural beings of the story as well as strong makeup and costumes, What We Do in the Shadows is a film which is fun knows how to make use of a small budget through minor technical means while establishing that the important focus of the feature lies with its script. The general mockumentary style of the film is a really clever way to approach things because it allows viewers to get a more open view of the characters who themselves have to put on comedic personas to keep viewers entertainined at the antics of vampires connecting to the real world through the means of camera. The film certainly portrays an all new way to look at the lives of vampires in a clever way, and frankly it is certainly one of the most original vampire concepts in a long time as the genre has become one which all too often succumbs to tropes and lacklustre horror reliant on blood and gore while What We Do in the Shadows actually diverts those concepts in a clever parody manner which does not go to the ridiculous extent of being a spoof but rather manages to maintain narrative integrity all while really going into hilarious territory. Frankly, there are some really funny moments in What We Do in the Shadows, and even if they are not as consistent as you might hope, they make the feature entertaining as a whole.\n\nSo What We Do in the Shadows is essentially an extended sketch comedy built on a series of gimmicks tied together by a loose plot without much in the way of consistent innovation, but the utmost simplistic joy of the stupidity in the feature and its genuine sense of comic energy makes it worth plenty of laughs",

Very clever film making as well as comedy. For those of us who love Wellington, i can tell all others that there are a host of 'in jokes' in the locations chosen, the placement of events and the people who just appear in windows and cut away shots. A very clever and funny link to a wonderful city. Just go and laugh your heart out, but be careful who you are sitting next to!!!",

The dynamic coupling of Taika and Jemaine is the NZ deadpan equivalent of someone like Lord and Miller, only with a hell of a lot more absurdity. As with L&M, it's more than just sight gags. There's actual wit permeating the dialogue and everything that happens is in benefit to the genre or characters, respectively.\n\nI'll wait for How to Train your Dragon 2 and Interstellar before making any ludicrous claims, but from how great WWDITS is, it has severe clout in the 'best of year' category for me.",
