            "content": "As a lover of science fiction, I am always on the lookout for films that push the boundaries of the genre and challenge my perception of the future. Ex Machina, directed by Alex Garland, is a true gem that does exactly that. This visually stunning and intellectually provocative film is a masterclass in storytelling, boasting a thought-provoking plot, brilliant performances, and breathtaking visuals that left me mesmerized from start to finish.\n\nOne of the standout elements of Ex Machina is its captivating and thought-provoking plot. The story follows Caleb (played by Domhnall Gleeson), a young programmer who wins a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interact with an advanced humanoid AI named Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) created by the enigmatic and reclusive genius, Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). As Caleb delves deeper into his interactions with Ava, he becomes entangled in a web of secrecy and deception, questioning the true nature of Ava's consciousness and Nathan's motives. The film raises profound questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence, the boundaries of humanity, and the consequences of playing god with technology. The script is meticulously crafted, filled with tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.\n\nThe performances in Ex Machina are simply outstanding. Alicia Vikander's portrayal of Ava is breathtaking. She effortlessly balances innocence and allure, creating a character that is both mesmerizing and unnerving. Domhnall Gleeson brings empathy and vulnerability to his role as Caleb, and Oscar Isaac is magnetic as the eccentric and enigmatic Nathan. The chemistry between the three actors is palpable, driving the tension and dynamics of the film to new heights. Each performance is nuanced, complex, and adds layers of depth to the story, making it a truly immersive experience.\n\nVisually, Ex Machina is a feast for the eyes. The film features stunning cinematography that beautifully captures the sleek and minimalist setting of Nathan's isolated compound. The juxtaposition of the cold, sterile environment with the warm, lifelike presence of Ava creates a sense of unease and fascination. The visual effects used to bring Ava to life are seamless and awe-inspiring, making her feel like a truly authentic AI entity. The production design and special effects are top-notch, creating a fully realized and immersive world that draws you in from the very first frame.\n\nIn addition to its visual and narrative prowess, Ex Machina also excels in its thought-provoking themes and intellectual depth. The film poses deep philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, the morality of creating sentient beings, and the implications of AI on humanity. It delves into the complexities of human emotions, the power dynamics between humans and machines, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. Ex Machina is a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, sparking conversations and debates about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in our society.\n\nEx Machina is a masterpiece of modern science fiction. With its riveting plot, stellar performances, breathtaking visuals, and profound themes, it is a thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating film that challenges our perceptions of the future and the ethical implications of technology. It is a must-watch for any science fiction aficionado or anyone who appreciates intellectually engaging cinema. Ex Machina is a compelling, visually stunning, and intellectually rich cinematic experience that will leave you captivated and pondering its questions long after the credits roll.",

The facility hold an AI robot and the human and the robot are tested on how they interact with each other.

I thought the story moved at a good pace and I thought the motivations for humans and AI robot were good too. The movie had good visuals and the design of the robot was good too. I did enjoy the ending of the movie although I thought it was over and done with very quickly.\nGood\nGood dialogue between the humans and the AI robot\nVisual of the movie are amazing and the design of the AI robot\nMotivations of the characters are good and believable \n\nBad\nThe ending is over very quickly. I was happy with the ending. The AI only left the room for a few minutes only for that to happen.\nDifferent types of interactions could have been done.\nDo I recommend this movie?

            "content": "Alex Garland's directorial debut is a stylish sci-fi flick that shows just what happens when men try to play God. The ‘28 Days Later' writer brings Domhall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander together in this high-tech feature that plays like a loose adaptation of ‘The Tempest'. Spanning over 108-minutes, ‘Ex Machina' marks A24's first Academy Award for Visual Effects, winning over films like ‘Mad Max: Fury Road' and ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens', the latter happened to feature both Isaac and Gleeson also.\n\n‘Mother!' star Domhall Gleeson gives a strong performance, starring as ingenuous programmer Caleb Smith. When Caleb is chosen to stay with Nathan Bateman (a narcissistic, reclusive CEO brought to life by a notable performance from Oscar Isaac), he soon discovers the purpose of his stay is to test a ground-breaking new AI known as ‘Ava'. Ava is played by ‘Tomb Raider' star Alicia Vikander, who's performance as the synthetic humanoid is both chilling and inquisitive. However, as Ava becomes increasingly conscious and her bond with Caleb grows, her path to freedom is progressively fuelled by deception and manipulation, leading to fatal consequences.\n\n‘Ex Machina' explores the divide between technology and man, Garland shows viewers that when powerful men try to play God, more often than not, it ends in chaos, as shown in films like ‘I, Robot' and ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Despite its futuristic aesthetic, the film appears to draw influences from past theatrics like Shakespeare's ‘The Tempest' as well as Greek Tragedy theatre, as shown by the various masks placed along the wall in Nathan's home. Even the film's title draws from historic theatre, ‘Ex Machina' being derived from the Latin phrase ‘Deus ex Machina' which means ‘a god from the machine'. The film also goes down the path of exploring the fact that artificial intelligence can be seen as evolution, in response to Caleb asking about why Nathan created Ava he responds \"I don't see Ava as a decision, just an evolution\". This haunting realisation shows how in the future humans could be seen as obsolete as AI becomes more and more developed and aware\n\nThe present day setting of ‘Ex Machina' allows Garland to show viewers just how close we could be to something like Ava existing, and the possible ensuing disaster coming to fruition. Rob Hardy's sleek cinematography and Mark Digby's contemporary production design, provides the film with ultra-modern visuals that reflect the technology-focused plot. Considering the film only had a $15 million budget, ‘Ex Machina's visuals effects are spectacular, and the fact it beat out its competitors, all of which had budgets of over $100 million,, makes it that much more impressive. The film also brings up the issue that whatever you search online is watched, recorded and stored. In ‘Ex Machina's case, the trillions of searches help Nathan to develop Ava and create her persona.\n\nAlex Garland brings viewers a polished sci-fi drama that features strong performances from all three main characters, sleek set design and a superb script courtesy of Garland himself. ‘Ex Machina' is a triumphant first outing in the director's chair for Garland, who's film leaves you on the edge of your seat by the time the credits roll.",

            "content": "Firstly, what surprises me most about this piece of art is the roles that actor lead, the film only shows four characters, notwithstanding this fact this decision could not be more correct, since they are so few, the director is free to deepen on their lives and beliefs, and for surprise of anyone, these characters are so realistic that they could be actual people. Only a minority of movies can take pride in this aspect.\n\nSecondly, it is no wonder why this movie has got the Oscar for best special effects, the effects applied on this movie are on point with the situation that the spectator lives, and they are so authentic that they do not seem artificial at all. The part that really exploits this fact is when Ava interacts just like a real person.\n\nAlternatively, I could understand why many consider this film too audacious and not realistic, it shows such a distant alternative world that you could just lock your mind and not think outside the box. However, It is my firm belief that taking this approach, makes the film more interesting and intriguing.\n\nDespite the negative aspects mentioned, Ex-Machina still is a great film that contextualize how the  proper future could be. Who knows, an android like Ava could soon be created.",

Such is the case with Ex Machina, Garland's take on artificial intelligence and the potential dangers it presents.  When tech company owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac) invites his employee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) to visit his remote research facility, things take an unexpected turn when Caleb is introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander), a life-like piece of A.I. that may be more complex than anyone understands.  Ex Machina is thought-provoking and relentlessly entertaining, featuring great performances from the cast (especially Vikander's understated but effective portrayal of Ava), great sets and locations, and some really smart writing courtesy of Garland.  Even non-science fiction fans will find something to like here – it's that good.",

Ex Machina features a remote setting deep in the forested mountains of Norway where a billionaire techie bro' and CEO of a high-tech company, Nathan Bateman, is developing AI cyborgs designed to appear like human females, and sexually appealing ones at that, which is kind of creepy and, as you get further into the film, very consequential, especially given  the prodigious intelligence of one cyborg in particular.  Nathan invites an obscure young computer programmer, Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) from his own company to assist him in his projects.  Of course, Caleb is very honored and a little puzzled.  But upon Caleb's arrival, Nathan is friendly, enthusiastic, keeps calling Caleb \"Bro'\", and offers him a beer.   Caleb learns Nathan is working on AI and is at first intrigued, becoming less so as the film proceeds.  The suspense builds very subtly in a way that you sense something vaguely ominous becoming more so.  But you will need to see it for yourself.  I will just say that Alicia Vikander is one scary actor who turns in an icily sinister, calculating, inhuman performance as Nathan's prize cyborg, Ava.  The film is a telling commentary on the hubris of developing AI to complement, or take the place of, humans.  Techie friends tell me we are very close to developing this kind of AI, or something like it, and for purposes not necessarily all that beneficial, and, in some cases, quite nefarious. In this sense, the film raises some deeply probing moral questions on whether we humans should \"go there\" when it comes to AI.",

Slightly unhinged, alleged tech genius, billionaire? Check. Secluded, subterranean, ultra modern, automated home and experimental laboratory? Check. Reveal that the reclusive weirdo genius is secretly working on an AI project so advanced it will alter the course of civilization? Of course. Discover that the protagonist may not have won the contest randomly, but was hand picked for the situation? What do you think. The plot plods along slowly. We already know that the contest winner will develop emotional attachment to the female AI \"robot\" long before it happens. The expected head butting between diabolical whacko, and duped underling ensues. The crux of the plot is to answer the question: Has the AI actually developed independent, sentient thought, and how would it be confirmed? Was she programmed to like the guest, did she develop affection for him of her own free will, or is she playing him for an eventual bid for freedom. Honestly, by the time it wraps, I couldn't have cared less. This is a slick, stylish movie, the actors do great work, as does the cinematographer.

They all play really well off of one another, and Eva's execution had to just perfect.  Given that Alicia is covered in green screen suit to allow for the amazing cg effects of Eva's body, Alicia had to make Eva's role as a machine believable for the audience, and for Caleb.\n\nThis is also my biggest gripe, Eva wastes movement like a human would, it is designed to pretend to think, act, and move as if a human would: it's an infiltration unit.  An A.I. doesn't need to take 3 steps and half-turn it's head to the human it's talking to: that's specifically done for a desired effect.  Eva treats itself as lesser for the sake of the humans, which is realistic enough, but the result is something I don't feel  is realistic, and when we actually create androids like this, they wont' take considerations like \"looking directly at a human\" when conversing without extreme training on the matter.\n\nPast that one thing, the premise, the execution, the dilemma of this is amazing, down to the last scene.  The movie even directly addresses some of the controversy of the situations they're experiencing as it carries an odd, tech-involved philosophical edge.\n\nThere is a lot of smart movie here, and some might be \"cool\", but I think most people are not going to be able to appreciate this properly.",

Upon arrival, Charlie learns that he has been chosen to be the facilitator of a \"Turing Test,\" an experiment that attempts to diagnose a machine's ability to exhibit behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human. Charlie spends the week questioning and communicating with the Artificially Intelligent being named Ava, a human-like creation whom Charlie becomes intimately fascinated with. As Ava begins to emotionally manipulate Charlie, he begins to suspect he may not have been chosen randomly at all.\n\nThis is sci-fi film making at its best. The complicated triangle of relationships between the film's three characters is crafted beautifully and unfolds at the perfect pace. Suspenseful, charming, mysterious, and entrancing, this movie held my unwavering attention from start to finish.

On an initial level, as the sessions move in the direction the viewer expects, Caleb must learn to uncrown the analyst by breaking the transferential dynamic, seeing Nathan not as a renowned, out-of-touch and out-of-his-league genius, but as just another guy about whom not much is really out of the ordinary. Yet on an-other level, as the story shifts emphasis from reinforcing Caleb's ego—and no doubt his great sin is to see himself as the center of his own story—to the emergence of Ava's subjectivity, the film subverts the patricidal myth of the violent primal father that underlies the Oedipus complex, offering an advanced bleed-edge sisterhood to replace the band of brothers in Freud's account.",

Nice. Young, eager nerd intern Caleb is schooled by the possibly evil A.I. genius mentor boss Nathan in his isolated, windowless, wilderness mansion. \n\nThere's gonna be trouble.\n\nIn short: Nathan's Frankensteined a curvy she robot and employs Caleb to test her out. Nathan's the perfect nightmare host, drunk most of the time, sometimes on booze, sometimes on power. The entirety of the circumstances - the isolation, the mystery, the control, the cold architecture - creates a dizzying tension, with boyish Caleb navigating way above his normal comfort level. It's a beautiful looking film, with a wickedly foreboding current.\n\nDomhnall Gleeson (Caleb), Oscar Isaac (Nathan) and Alicia Vikander (Ava, the robot) are exquisite as a tasty triangle of distinct, engrossing and mysterious characters, playing escalating, dangerous mind games. Imperative to pay strict attention to the witty, philosophies being bandied about. Automation, emotion, expression, choice, nature, nurture, circumstance, response …  oh the list is long. This is much more than a SciFi paint by numbers ordeal. Also, it is damn creepy.\n\nAnyone with a Roomba knows messing with Artificial Intelligence does not end well, but the genius behind \"Ex Machina\" is that it's not quite apparent who will get the short end of the memory stick. Sure we've devoured plenty of man vs machine conflict films, but this one ads a clever gender twist. And even when things unravel in a perfectly orchestrated and satisfactory climax, there remains a gnawing, hungry feeling. Just as it should be.\n\n- hipCRANK",

Each act reveals more and more about each character until its climatic ending. Questions are raised about if Ava really \"feels\" what she says or if its all a ploy. Caleb and Nathan share different opinions on the future of Ava and whether she is a conscious being.\n\nAll in all, I find this near-3 hour movie a bit of a fun watch. There are many layers to pull back on that add more context into each viewing. One can see things from another character's eyes upon the second or third viewing. Expect to unravel some feminist undertones and different interpretations of the final scenes.\n\n5/5. Worth a rewatch.",

It's not the type of film I would say \"wow I gotta rewatch that over and over.\" For me it's a one and done type of film. But I am glad I watched it. I was intrigued and on the edge of my seat throughout. It keeps you there by its ideas, not with lots of fast paced action scenes like I, Robot.(2004), this is a film that doesnt force it's own conclusions down your throat. You get the feeling you have to figure out what's right. Although it does give a twist at the end. Which tells you what may be the safer option when it comes to AI. \n\nI'd reccomend  it. \n...\nNathan:\n\"One day the AIs are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of Africa.

            "content": "The science fiction genre encompasses a great deal of territory. Some science fiction movies focus on using technology in the same manner a fantasy movie might employ magic, enabling the audience to suspend disbelief when the film depicts planet-destroying weapons and superhuman heroes and villains. I love these films, but the unique advantage science fiction has over other genres is its ability to examine social issues, technology, and the interconnection between the two in a manner isolated from our present reality. For this reason, people still remember the Original Series of Star Trek. Its effects were awful, but the best episodes intelligently explored philosophical, moral, and political concepts.\n\nEx Machina is a slow-burning thriller which uses the summoning of a programmer to a reclusive tech billionaire's estate to administer a Turing test on a lifelike robot to explore the implications of artificial intelligence. The robot, Ava, is brilliantly portrayed by Alicia Vikander, who makes her character appear not quite human, but highly intelligent and charming, nonetheless. When AI is depicted in fiction, the sentient computers are usually either evil and fixated on destroying humanity (Terminator, The Matrix, Avengers: Age of Ultron), leading to a message about playing God, or innocent victims of persecution by organics (Data in \"The Measure of a Man\", the Geth origin story in Mass Effect), leading to a message about tolerance. Ex Machina's depiction of AI is more nuanced than either of these portrayals. Other themes the movie explores include the abuse of user data by large corporations, which the movie effectively portrayed in an extremely unsettling manner, and gender roles, with Ava's subservience providing a window into the warped worldview of her designer, themes which are explored in an extremely effective and frankly unnerving manner.\n\nUnlike the Star Trek: The Original Series, Ex Machina is gorgeous as well as intelligent. The film doesn't have any space battles or giant fight scenes, but the art direction and cinematography are excellent, and the effects used to depict the robots are so impressive that the film won an Oscar in the \"Best Visual Effects\" category. That Academy Award is an especially remarkable achievement given that Ex Machina beat out The Martian and The Force Awakens, films which also have incredible visuals and had much higher budgets. The slick effects and the interesting social commentary work in tandem to produce a film with the intellectual weight of the best indie films and the appearance of a major studio production.\n",

Itâ(TM)s a difficult to thing to pull off and she deserves all the praise. I also liked the work of Domhnall Gleeson (Caleb Smith) and Oscar Isaac (Nathan Bateman). The story tackles some intriguing concepts and is really though provoking. Alex Garland builds tension so well. He does it through things as basic as conversations and most of them are interesting. The script is great, providing viewers with all sorts of plot twists. There third act is just filled with unexpected moments. And itâ(TM)s not just done for the sake of it. They all make sense and only add to the story. Characters feel smarter with each and it keeps you guessing. The ending is a masterpiece that feels incredibly earned after everything youâ(TM)ve seen.\n\nWeaknesses: There are a few points where you feel that there may be a bit too many conversations between Caleb and Nathan. I appreciated what they did, building the relationship and making you uneasy about Nathan.

Domhnall Gleason plays Caleb Smith, a coder who has won a contest, the reward being a week long stay with his billionaire boss, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Issac). Bateman is considered the Mozart of computer technology, but also happens to be a hardcore alcoholic. Located deep in the Alaskan wilderness, Bateman's home is less a house than a massive research laboratory where he develops ultra advanced AI technology. The young geek nerds out upon arriving, believing that his stay is simply a vacation with a little hands on look at what his boss is up to. Bateman, however, has just secretly inserted this apprentice into an elaborate and cruel experiment.\n\nOf course, the AI thing has been done many times recently, most notably in the breakthrough film, Her. But that is no reason not to attempt it if you have the chops. There is nothing new under the sun, the key is simply to add a creative and original spin, which Garland does with all the dexterity of a seasoned pro. Much of what makes Ex Machina stand out is it's philosophical shop talk on what exactly makes a human human. If you don't like to think, stay away from this one. From the moment Caleb meets android Ava (Alicia Vikander) sparks fly. By the end of the movie it's your mind that will be ablaze.",

Holy shit! This movie keeps getting more and more intense with every passing. The second time the power goes out, that part was insane! The first thing IM wondering is if Nathan programmed her to play Domhnall character like a fiddle or if the A.I. is on a whole another level of intelligence. This is where things start getting even more interesting. \n\nI'm beginning to suspect that the asian girl is an A.I. I love the use of the ambient soundtrack that's use to create tension. It's perfect. This movie poses some really great questions and is not shy in going in deeper than usual. The deeper this movie goes, the more layers that start to peel. This movie has it's unexpected moments of humor that really caught me off guard. \n\nThe writing for this movie was great! Very innovative and creative. I love movies like this that make you think and ask questions. Motto for this movie: A.I. so smart, you can't help but fall in love with it, literally. Even after he helped her, she didn't return the favor? That's pretty cold. Poor incels. Things never seem to work out for them.

            "content": "This film was fantastic up until the very end, so spoiler alert. The Ava character acted human up to the point in which she failed to express compassion. This could be brushed off by the Caleb character's explanation of her expressing \"autism\", but I think compassion is a distinctly human characteristic, and if this was not present in the AI then the model was incomplete. Sentience does not just mean you can experience a world of color, sentience means that you express free will and have a capacity for understanding and acting on what is right and wrong. Her last act in the movie did not express this, and was almost vindictive towards her benefactor. No reasoning in sentience would support this, and so I think this was poor script-writing in an attempt to not have a cookie-cutter happy ending. Caleb could have had his brains bashed in by Nathan and it would have been a better ending than that. I guess you could say that her reasoning was so that no one would know she was artificial, but that is also faulty because at some point, people would find out. She either would last to a point where she never aged or she'd break and they'd figure it out via autopsy. Every other aspect of this movie was carefully thought out and enacted to show her sentience, and this was just a moron addition that I would probably edit out of the movie if I had access to a personal copy. For being such a fantastic film, way to ruin it by trying to grab more critics. Besides that, the interchanges between the characters are clever, it extensively goes into what it means to be human and the rights of a being with sentience. As I've mentioned in a lot of other film reviews, this movie touches on abortion, and selective genetic screening as being heinous, because what right do you have to turn off a human being because the circumstances aren't right, or they aren't the version and operating software that you want? The movie was thrilling and the cinematography really engages your eyes. I loved how Caleb began to question his own reality and how the movie didn't let that remain too ambiguous. I would recommend this movie, but I'd also gladly say that the ending sucks.",

It turns out that the CEO is using him to test if his new AI creation can pass the Turing test. A creation in the shape of a beautiful young woman.\n\nThe Good: I love tight movies with many layers. Here is a script that is finely crafted like a Swiss watch. A puzzle box with hidden meanings in the names, the artwork on the walls and even the labels on the various liquor bottles scattered throughout. Nothing is as it seems and yet everything is right there if you are able to look. The movie never cheats. It doesn't have to. It shows its cards right up front but like the best magic tricks still uses misdirection to have you look where it wants you to.\n\nThe set-up in minimalistic with at most four characters and a few sets. The acting is top notch while the sets are out of a Grand Designs house where the owner was going for a bunker feel. (Lots of textured concrete no windows). Imagine if David Mamet or Charlie Kaufman had written and directed Saturn 3 and you have this film.\n\nThe Bad: There is an actual movement to ban sex robots. (If you mention to them that vibrators are basically sex robots at best you will get vehement that's different and at worse a screech straight from Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Ex Machina threads that uncanny valley needle where you are meant to care what happens to a clearly artificial construct. It succeeds for the most part by being the tightly written screed praised above. (Unlike say Steven Spielberg's A.I. which bluntly fails miserably about getting us to care about a homicidal toaster played by Haley Joel Osment). There is a scene where it is spoken that the robot's software will be updated that is supposed to evoke an emotional response. As somebody who's windows 10 seems to update at the most random of times I felt some horror but perhaps not the one the filmmakers were going for.\n\nThe Ugly: The movie was filmed in the beautiful Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway. The poor owners of the hotel must be horrified as the impression the movie gives of one's accommodations there are Motel Six concrete bunkers under a mountain.\n\nIn Conclusion: A tightly wound, well-written thriller that makes one think and excites the senses. Starts off a bit slow but give it time. It draws you in and the last act is a doozy.",

The characters are very likeable and well written, and the special effects are truly impressive. The film gave me a creepy, growing sense of paranoia, that just kept building up during the film's runtime. The ending is also quite shocking and unpredictable. A sci-fi gem, one not to miss out on.

            "content": "Ex Machina as a Romantic Comedy\n\tCaleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is the typical, relatable, romcom worthy 'nice guy'. Approachable, almost stable and having the grand potential to be taken on a life changing journey by the right woman. He would fit right in with Tom from (500) Days of Summer and William from Notting Hill. When he meets Ava (Alicia Vikander) through quirky boss turned quick friend Nathan (Oscar Isaac) via selection for participation in a new experiment, his entire world changes. The only problem is that she is an A.I. who also just so happens to be the newest and most prized invention of Nathan that he has been assigned to study. Stuck between his job and the woman he loves, as well as physically stuck in a middle of nowhere super genius lab, Caleb tries to figure out whether to follow his heart or his head.\nThe \"nice guy\" character has been put under the microscope  in the past year as the #MeToo movement has swept the nation, but Caleb is different from the problematic and secretly sinister 'nice guy' because he genuinely is a 'nice guy'. He doesn't expect the human decency he shows to Ava to be seen as \"nice\" and receive sexual or emotional payment from her, which many men who claim to be the \"nice guy\" tend to think. Caleb first approaches Ava with respect, astonishment and good manners, not expecting anything in return until she, without coercion, says that she too feels the same as he does. Caleb being caught behind glass, unable to touch Ava during many of their initial conversations, further explores the idea of being a \"nice guy\" as a physical representation of first understanding someone without physical satisfaction. \nOf course what complicates this is the fact that Ava is an A.I. and it is up to the viewer to decide if she can feel love at all. This is a central theme of the plot with Caleb and Nathan representing both sides. Caleb believes that Ava has the capacity to feel love while Nathan doesn't, but it is up to Ava's actions to determine the truth. The script is both cunning and relatable and the most important aspect of the film. Imposing love onto Ava not only as a humanoid but simply as a woman, or at least a woman like being, by men is almost a revolt against the manic pixie dream girl trope found in other rom coms. The cinematography also deftly plays with illusion and reality, tacking on another romcom element through Caleb's black and white daydream of him and Ava escaping into the only place their love could exist, the chaos of nature.\nWith these deep meditations on love it is up to Nathan to relieve some of the tension. As the comic relief of the movie, Nathan is eccentric, brilliant, a great dancer as well as a great mind who loves to wear bathrobes and live in the center of an uncharted forest. His unfiltered mind and tendency to naturally spout witty remarks at Caleb not only is hilarious but also serves as half of the old couple Caleb would hope not to become. Nathan uses a less mentally advanced A.I., Kyoko, as his partner and is in a loveless relationship, which is not what Caleb wants for himself and Ava, envisioning in once scene in black and white him and Ava escaping into nature, almost as if in a dream. \nThis movie has been ignored as a serious romantic comedy for too long. It is genuinely hilarious, especially during many of Nathan's scenes as well through the awkward nature of Caleb's 'nice guy' and falls into many of the romcom tropes such as the old vs new couple, the play between illusion and reality as well as the using the universality of wanting to be loved as what connects the film most to the audience. If you're looking for a rollicking good time, look no further than Ex Machina, because love is impossible to quantify but exhilarating to experience.",

About every 5 minutes you're asking, why did they do that? For example, this brilliant inventor is about to debut an anthropomorphous AI creation. And not just something to pass the Turing test [ an A.I. that is indishguishable from a human in conversation],  but one that looks and moves exactly like a human. Without an unsentimental critique of his creation, he loses the ability to correct flaws. His reputation on the line. You would probably hire  psychologist, high-level animators and speech therapist to tweak every possible detail before it was unveiled. But instead, he asked an awkward nerd-virgin  to stop by and go on a date  with one of his \"girl\" friends. And as expected, he immediately falls in love with her. \nThe architect of all this Brilliance is an odd Choice also. Not really handsome or smart, not really menacing or friendly. You need all of those elements to be obvious for this to be believable.He asks her awkward nerdy questions and she gives equally robotic awkward answers. She's also unconvincing for many reasons. And the robot design is odd. It's a rather Bland looking young woman with see-through arms and torso. And, ahem, don't know how to put this delicately but, a terrible case of camel toe. And not in a good way. \nIn one scene, we see her looking through her closet for the perfect dress.  As she tilts her head this way and that to look at each dress, there's magical tinkly music.

The only thing that takes away its ticket from the major league is that its execution even though being outstanding lacks better editing for support which makes even the 108 minutes of runtime look like more than 2 hours.

Artificial intelligence is presented as an advancement of where human evolution is inevitably headed. With three central characters, viewing the story from the perspectives of either Caleb, Nathan or Ava creates a different experience.

            "content": "Ex Macina is an interesting sci fi fantasy.  It starts rather slowly but builds to a much more entertaining conclusion.  The story made a number of obvious mistakes which somewhat surprised me.  A couple that came to mind are: 1. Food.  Towards the end we see Nathan cooking what looks to be an egg.  Where did fresh eggs come from?  The movie never shows anyone bringing in fresh food to the home and they never showed anything that might indicate that Nathan had a chicken coop on the property.  So where did fresh eggs come from?, 2. who, in their right mind, would maintain a security system that provided no means of escape in the event of a power failure, especially after Nathan admitted that his home was having daily power failures.  Earlier in the movie they showed Caleb re-writing security routines to open all doors in the event of a power failure.  At the end, however, the door to the room where Caleb was locked when the power failed.\n\nIn my opinion, the most egregious error made was at the end when they showed Ava escaping.  First, one would have to assume that the pilot who know that he was picking up a male passenger.  Yet, he picks up Ava and returns her to civilization.  Second they show Ava in a population center, presumably at an intersection.  Earlier in the movie Ava talks about using \"charging plates\" in order to cause the power failures that seemed to plague the house.  Once she leaves that home, how does she recharge her systems?  In an older movie, Bicentennial Man, the robot was shown to have a power cable that he could connect to a wall receptacle to recharge.  In this movie, however, that was not the case.  As such one has to assume that Ava's batteries would have a finite charge and when the charge depleted, she would cease to function.  If her systems had the ability to charge in other ways then why would her room need \"charging plates\"?\n\nAs a movie Ex Machina was interesting and entertaining.  It wasn't a great movie but it also wasn't a bad movie.",

I really appreciate how the filmmakers have a story to tell and stick to it without adding unnecessary subplots, which is not to say there is a lack of intrigue: the compound experiences strange power outages, Ava issues ominous warnings about her creator when the cameras are briefly down, and hints that everyone seems to harbor their own secret agenda are craftily sprinkled in.  Don't be misled into thinking this is a white-knuckle futuristic thriller, even though there are thematic echoes of Blade Runner and the limited CGI on display is jaw-droppingly realistic.  In truth, this story is too philosophical and brain-engaging for many people.  That's OK, they have a slew of Transformers movies they can watch instead, but thankfully every once in a while we get an Ex Machina.",

Alicia Vikander, Domhall Gleeson, and Oscar Issac did excellent in their roles. They played the characters really well. I started to believe they were real people. The cinematography was beautiful. An interesting film to look at. The soundtrack fit the film and was super tense. It was an excellent soundtrack that bulit tension and suspense in the film. The script was well written, it seemed like how people would talk. The runtime was a good runtime, not too long and not too short.

            "content": "This film is symptomatic of modern day Hollywood fare: It takes intellectually interesting ideas and explores them only so far as is necessary to craft \"content\" for a specific film genre. In this case, the studio was going for a thriller, so we get intellectually suggestive language mixed in with philosophical/scientific jargon and tired clichés.  The film asks viewers familiar with philosophy of mind to \"read in\" substance that is not present in the film itself, and comforts viewers not versed in AI and philosophy of mind by having the Nathan character plead with Caleb to dispense with technical language and focus on his feelings. This is a contrivance that insults both parts of the audience. \nThe movie is very heavy in dialogue, which is not a bad thing as such, but in this case the dialogue is incredibly poor and stilted and serves, in its best moments, merely to provide a transition toward the more intriguing moments of the film.  The only truly interesting bits of dialogue occur when Nathan, completely unperturbed, describes the extent and malice of his power: \"there's too much classified shit here so I had the electricians killed,\" \"I hacked every cell phone in the world, and the providers didn't say anything cause they were doing the same shit.\" While the film requires us to buy in to the mythos of the protean techno-genius, these short moments manage to paint a convincing picture of what might exist behind the T-shirt and jeans façade of Silicon Valley power. In a strange twist, however, the fantasy is not that a technology chieftain would be capable of building an AI to pass the Turing Test, but that his downfall could occur in the context of a clichéd comic book trope. The only interesting question is whether the ending is a case of narrative laziness or a testament to the true power of the techno class. Can we only imagine liberating ourselves from their grasp through the tired clichés of overreaching supervillains? Or merely as powerless onlookers while their plans backfire? \nIn the end, the film comes off as the cinematic equivalent of a TED talk: slick and stylish, but short on substance. It flatters us with the tease of armchair philosophy, but doesn't ask the tough questions its subject matter necessitates.  If we break free of this illusion, we are left with nothing more than a high school film class project with a multi-million-dollar budget. \nNOTE: For those that are interested in this movie for its DTS:X track, it is understated and unimpressive when compared with other object-based audio tracks available in other recent films.",

            "content": "The Turing test, as defined by Wikipedia, is \"a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\"  Essentially, the test (developed by scientist Alan Turing) was designed around the concept of whether a machine can be made to think like a person.  A machine would \"pass\" the test if its responses to questions were enough to fool the administrator into believing it could pass for human.\n \nObviously the concept of sentient machines is nothing new in the world of cinematic science fiction, and neither is the idea of exploring the fine line between artificial intelligence and human behavior.  Films like \"Blade Runner\" and \"A.I.\" are probably the most prominent examples, but there are others that deal with the idea of machines becoming too human, like \"2001\" and the \"Terminator\" movies as well.\n \nAnd now we can add Alex Garland's \"Ex Machina\" to the list, a film in which the Turing test plays a prominent role.  At its center is the age-old question, \"What is it that makes a person human?\"  Yes, it's a bit of a cliché, but don't let that turn you away.  Garland, whose genre credentials are pretty damn goodhe wrote the screenplays for the Danny Boyle films \"28 Days Later\" and \"Sunshine\"has constructed an interesting little film, tense and twisty.\n \nIt's tempting to come into the film with a \"been there, done that\" mentality, but the execution is rock solid; we can predict some of the turns the story will make, but Garland still manages to wring a surprise or two.  And for a film with very little action, it's telling that the movie still manages to instill suspense with little more than conversation and some effective music cues.  The interplay between the three leads is often times quite riveting.\n \nDomhnall Gleeson stars as a young software programmer for a prominent internet search engine company.  As the movie opens, he wins a company contest in which the prize is to spend a week at the estate of the company's reclusive, enigmatic CEO (Oscar Isaac).  It turns out this quirky but brilliant billionaire has been working on developing an artificial intelligence, and he wants his employee to administer the aforementioned test to his creation.  Provided the machine passes the test, he can then unveil it to the world, paving the way for the future of mankind co-existing with A.I.\n \nThis machine is not only very humanoid in design, but also feminine.  Her name is Ava (Alicia Vikander), and although she's not quite finished yether transparent body betrays all sorts of wires and fuses in place of a person's organsthe young programmer soon realizes she is far more advanced than any machine.  Her responses to his questions take him to unexpected places, and she has the very human-like ability to get under his skin.  In fact, he soon begins to wonder just who is testing who in this little experiment\n \nTo say anything more would be criminal as it's fun to just watch this one unspool.  Yes, you'll know where some of the story beats are headed, but everything is handled so well that you won't really care.  And as I mentioned above, Garland still manages to sneak in a nifty twist here and there.  And the movie's so engrossing that you can't help but play along with it.  More than once, you're going to be asking yourself about the motivations of the characters and just how much of what we're seeing is part of some elaborate plan.\n \nThe film also has a gorgeous aesthetic; the estate in which nearly the entire film is set is some kind of combination of a luxurious mansion and an underground bunker.  Doors are electronically sealed with coded keycards.  Red light occasionally bathes the entire area whenever there's a power surge.  And yet there's also a room that seems specifically designed as some kind of disco dance-party area.  And the outdoor area surrounding the estate is lush and woodsy, complete with a waterfall.\n \nAnd Ava herself is a marvel of character design.  With her very human face placed over a body that seems almost like a hard-wired mannequin, she looks quite different from many of the other humanoid robots that have appeared in other films over time.  It will not come as a shock to learn that the film claimed the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n \n\"Ex Machina\" is one of the best kind of science fiction films.  It entertains, it makes you think, it may even creep you out a little.  And it manages to do all these things without any fireworks or pyrotechnics.  Mind you, these are not necessarily bad qualities for a sci-fi film, but it's encouraging to see smaller-scale movies like these promoting the concept that ideas can be just as enthralling as action.  For a directorial debut, you could do a lot worse.",

            "content": "Con la finalidad de dejar huella en el ahora, la prioridad es perpetuar sobre el futuro, abrir camino hacia lo que revolucionará en lo que a la distancia es invisible - se trata de estar siempre un paso adelante. El ser humano en la carrera actual de ganar terreno en lo que ayer y hoy era y es inimaginable no tiene límites. El estancamiento no es una opción y para llegar al mañana se está en busca de la innovación, del cambio hacia el ascenso. Es siempre continuar mejorando. Durante el recorrido en este proceso del desarrollo tecnológico, los objetivos son claros y deben quedar despejados. Lo que se interponga, son estorbos que, si no se apartan, simplemente no se les toman en cuenta. Las consecuencias de esto: el desastre, las debilidades humanas expuestas al desnudo.\n\nLa ciencia ficción comúnmente presume de su habilidad para apantallar a través de sus imágenes, que salen de la realidad que normalmente veríamos.  Sacan a relucir efectos especiales extraordinarios y un diseño de escenarios y utilería que salen de lo común. Sin embargo, los temas que se abordan y se pretenden discutir pueden tender a permanecer en lo ambiguo, flameando en el juego de los elementos de la película, sus tonos, formas y sabores, en vez de realmente brindarles un sentido que actúe como guía. Después de todo, la ciencia ficción debería ser esta vía a través de la cual se nos diga qué estamos haciendo, que en términos sociales, psicológicos y en los tecnológicos, impactará sobre nuestras propias vidas y las futuras, de una forma considerablemente significativa.\n\nDespués de un debut como prometedor screenwriter en la producción del 2003 \"28 Days Later\", Arlex Garland, con su singular estilo de moldear no solo en lo visual, pero también en el resto de nuestras percepciones sensoriales, transporta para el 2015 una serie de manifestaciones acerca del futuro al que nos estamos dirigiendo y del cual no cuestionamos sus efectos sobre nosotros, que es aquello que se deja atrás en la ambición de cumplir con crear lo que incluso podría ser más poderoso que nosotros. \"Ex Machina\" es un thriller situado en la época contemporánea. Un científico vive [solo] en un recinto de investigación en medio del bosque. Su nombre es Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) y ha pasado años diseñando prototipos de robots con Inteligencia Artificial, algo que nunca antes se había logrado. A su más reciente creación la nombra Ava (Alicia Vikander), a la cual se debe evaluar para conocer qué tanto a progresado en el desarrollo de esta tecnología, al grado de que ésta sea lo suficientemente convincente para aceptarse prácticamente como un ser humano. Para ello, ha traído hasta su lejano laboratorio a un programador de nombre Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) que trabaja en su empresa. \n\nEsta misteriosa y alentadora producción sci-fi lidia con el tema de la inteligencia. ¿Qué es y de dónde surge? Las computadoras son programadas por humanos. La inteligencia yace en la capacidad del humano por configurar a una máquina para que haga exactamente lo que el humano quiere. La computadora no puede más que seguir al pie de la letra los algoritmos y operaciones con los que se diseña, pero ¿qué pasa en ese preciso momento cuando la computadora responde por sí misma? Ava se compone y funciona de acuerdo a las instrucciones que le han sido conferidas desde su activación. Caleb ha llegado para interactuar con ella a través de distintas sesiones que tendrá durante la semana que permanecerá dentro del sitio. 'Turing' es el nombre con lo que se denomina a la prueba, (cuyo nombre surge de Alan Turing, genio pionero en la computación durante la segunda guerra mundial) y se buscará determinar si en efecto, este ser posee o no conciencia. Recordemos que una característica que nos distingue del resto de los animales, las plantas y los objetos, es nuestra capacidad de tomar nuestras propias decisiones, es decir, de razonar. El ser humano es un ser consiente, por lo que aquí la película siembra la duda de que si una vez que un androide posee una inteligencia artificial consiente y autónoma, ésta podría considerarse como humana.\n\nLa delicada interacción entre estos dos es lenta, reservada y parece moverse con efectividad. Cada sesión es vista y filmada por Nathan, y el lugar donde las pláticas entre Ava y Caleb ocurren es en una sala oscura y reducida, en la que ambos están separados por un cristal. Asimismo, la casa parece estar compuesta mayormente de esta manera, ya que el lugar puede sentirse incómodamente cerrado, de cuyo ambiente puede apreciarse de forma intencionalmente tenso. Las expectativas iniciales de la audiencia, que recaen en que Caleb comenzará a enamorarse de Ava se cumplen y de hecho la historia es muy predecible, hasta que se llega a la etapa final de la película, cuya conclusión podía haberse prologado para darle un sentido más valioso a la película y el verdadero mensaje de Garland.\n\nNo solo es el talento del director para escribir, (él era novelista antes de volverse director de cine) también posee un talento para que sus visuales brillen. En esta ocasión sus diálogos más contundentes no salen de las voces de los personajes, sino de lo que vemos. Nuestros ojos y cómo los usemos nos darán información suficiente para comprender algunas cosas - por ello quizá sería bueno ver la película una segunda vez. Mientras la trama continúa avanzando, uno puede notar que este sci-fi de Garland no está aludiendo al futuro, pues todo parece estar apuntando a que se preste atención a la IA, para verificar si ella cumplirá con las características para aceptarse como humana. Uno descuida al \"nosotros\", el cual es el verdadero objeto de estudio.\n\nLa película es sorprendente, su intención es dejarte pensando un muy buen rato acerca de nuestra especie y los pasos obsesivos que se están dando en el campo de la tecnología. El tema del género también se aborda con sutileza en la narrativa. Ava actúa de forma delicada, sensible y apenada, y la película trata su liberación, su emancipación. La fuerza de la mujer en un mundo en el que al parecer los hombres tienen controlado es subestimada. Sin embargo, Ava sabe lo que está haciendo. A pesar de ello, Nathan insiste en que todo es un experimento en el que él tendrá esbozados cada paso y cada variable y que por años parece tener dominando. Él es un tipo que encarcela los estereotipos de un 'geek' de la actualidad, cuya aparente locura se atribuye a su única misión que es crear lo que nadie ha hecho y que lo posicionará como 'un Dios', palabra que usa constantemente y que utiliza hacia Caleb para hacerle ver que lo que está haciendo al ayudarlo será la nueva revolución de lo que vendrá.  \n\nLa relación que se desata entre los tres es fría y hasta cierto punto incalculable en el sentido de que uno no sabe cómo reaccionarán los personajes. Las emociones que empieza a desarrollar Caleb hacia Ava son un tema importante de estudio, ya que a ella le preocupa que al final de la prueba Turing, ella repruebe y tenga que ser eliminada. La seducción por parte de ella es cautivadora y extrañamente bella. Ella no es una mujer, aunque sí se comporta como tal. Se viste como una chica cualquiera y quiere pensar como lo haría una humana. Se acuesta en su sofá como una doncella y realiza dibujos durante las noches, como una niña. Ella se esfuerza desde su cristalina prisión para convencer a Caleb de sus habilidades y poco a poco le seduce para lograr conseguir su aprobación.\n\nLas incapacidades humanas se manifiestan en \"Ex Machina\" con un estilo extraño, oscuro y misteriosamente estético. El diseño hermoso en la fotografía y en los efectos de crear un humano-robot son tan artificialmente atractivos que impulsan a que se vea a los cables y tornillos con un sentido objetivamente enigmático e hipnotizador. Los deseos y las ansiedades humanas se desenvuelven ante la mirada de una computadora cuya mentalidad fabricada de inquietantes impulsos, desafían los riesgos y puntos débiles de nuestra raza. Estas son desventajas que no hemos contemplado, ni vencido. 79/100",

Footnote, when he saw the original Judge Dredd to make this film, his first directorial effort. He pulls it off nearly flawlessly. He is a magnificent sci-fi screen writer, so no one in the know went in expecting any different. Intelligent, engaging and thrilling to boot, this movie is not all I expected when I sat down to watch a film with a man sitting opposite a robot woman. Coming off having seen Morgan first, I sort of suspected it to be similar fair. Scary, thrilling and about an intelligent AI talking through a glass.\n\nIt could be argued that the movie is about AVA, but as my friend at Lesson's From The Screenplay point out, her point of view is limited to that room. The whole time you are caught wondering what does she know that she's not saying? What is Oscar Issacs's character really have up his sleeve? and Is this robot really flirting with a person? You don't know because things are told from the visitor -Domhnall Gleeson's perspective. In their world Issac's created a superior competitor to Google and has used it to acquire land that it takes two hours to fly over in helicopter. There he spends his days getting drunk. He comes across as unlikable until near the end, but never quite redeems himself. They are trying to find out if she can pass a Turing test, which it seems evident early on she IS capable. So why is the visitor there?\n\nThat reveal is one of the better one's in the film, also coming near the end. Also, unlike most Sci-Fi films, it does not need very much in term of effects, except for the occasional bare robot moment (or background) it is devoid of them. It is just three, or 4 people in one location but can lack the proper gusto that would pull absolutely everyone in, even though the story is still solid. You are given just information throughout this story though that by the end, when all is tied together, you are taken aback by what has just occurred and how you missed it. you were engaged by the storytelling and set up. One might predict somethings, but will likely not get the whole picture. This is where it deviates from Morgan. Morgan is telegraphing at every turn - you COULD predict she was going to lose it on every one and the results that follow. And the ending, so unfair and utterly astonishing to me.",

The storytelling, the acting, and the direction are what knock this film out of the park, and it is easily one of my favorite films to come out of 2015. The narrative is told perfectly, with the intensity of the characters between each other building up as the film goes along. The score fit nicely with the film as it gave an edgy touch to it, and the effects should be given a standing ovation as well. The message behind the ending of the film is very thought-provoking and adds on another layer behind the whole movie.

            "content": "One of the words that comes to mind with Ex Machina is atmosphere.  This film is dripping and oozing with atmosphere that, in my opinion, has a Kubrickian feel to it, and resembles M. Night Shyamalan's earlier, better works.  The sound, ambient soundtrack along with the lighting and cinematography filter creates a sense of isolation and eerie calmness that is simultaneously relaxing and serene.  I admired the world building.\n\nOscar Isaac probably gives my favorite performance here.  You can't help but sence that there's definitely something off, weird even, about his character, which pretty much helps the twist in the end floor you even more when the last character you'd think is the villain, is ultimately the villain, outsmarting the protagonist AND the originally presumed antagonist.  That probably made more sense in my head.  Domhnall Gleeson is simply fine as Caleb, nothing blow away in his performance or character.  Alicia Vikander is a convincing A.I., and the design and execution of her character in the plot is what counts the most.\n\nThe story takes place in the not too distant yet not too soon future, but it presents themes about human nature that are relevant for today, and quite contemporary.  Can Artificial Intelligence use everything programmed into it against the species that programmed it?  That question crossed my mind.  Can A.I. be corrupted or even become too self aware to the point of using its power as a tool of manipulation?  These are questions that have been asked for a long time regarding the concern of the invention of A.I., so they're really nothing new, but they're executed here in detail and with a touch of behavioral psychology behind them.\n\nThe dance sequence with Kyoko was goofy but weirdly strange in its own right, yet ultimately unnecessary in my opinion and wouldn't have effected the flow of the film had it been cut out, and the reveal that Kyoko is an A.I. could be seen a mile away.  These are fairly minor nitpicks though.\n\nOverall, Ex Machina is engaging, intriguing, and almost fascinating in its depiction of Artificial Intelligence, playing on our fear of being outsmarted by our own inventions. If the final act leaves you feeling fooled and outsmarted, then the film has done its job.",

This is supplemented by the sweeping shots of nature surrounding Nathan's house in between scenes of displays of mind blowing technological feats. With the ending scenes in which Ava betrays both Nathan and Caleb, she has proven herself a true AI due to her complex manipulation and betrayal of those around her. She is reflecting the exact same societal values that we see prevalent in our society today. In the end, Ava is the one character that arcs and it is towards the ugly aspects of humanity.\n\nAnother great aspect of the film was both its sound effects and music. The sound effects associated with all the robots were impeccable and never missed a step. On top of that the music really aided in driving the storyline, smoothly transitioning the viewer from one scene to the next.\n\nAnother thread I noticed was the flashes of red, green, and blue lights throughout the film. When inquired about this online, I found articles stating that the director did this perfectly as these colors are the basis of LED and he intended them to represent the basis for technology. This is another example of the different layers that the director added to the film in order to convey his message of man vs. technology and how the line between the two isn't always clear.\n\nI believe Ex Machina was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time in the Sci-Fi/Thriller genre. It did the genre a great service.",

            "content": "If I have to define with one word this film directed by Alex Garland would be without doubt INTERESTING. This movie addresses the issue of artificial intelligence with a very important question, what differentiates a machine of a human being? What the director achieved with \"Ex Machina\" is a thriller science fiction that rambles on man becoming God. The script is good, with a simple but well structured and told story that manages to engage the viewer from the opening scene to the final credits. The location of the film could not be more ideal, a luxurious place away from society, very white walls, much order and even an intention to confuse what is real and what is not real. The script is very deep and opens up a range of large and rich topics, from criticisms to society, businesses and human nature. Among the virtues of this excellent script there are constant traps in proposing us a plot and a rather surprising and unexpected end. The visual effects are amazing; everything looks so real and natural that it is scary. Anyway, Ex Machina is an excellent film; brilliant special effects used in close range, four highly interesting characters, and location. Perhaps, The film has a slow pace; if you are a viewer seeking for something dynamic you are not going to like it.",

You really have to pay attention to what it shows you (most notably the dialogue between Nathan and Caleb). \n\nThe directing was top-notch, the script was phenomenal, the acting superb, and the themes were kept relevant and were very well conveyed.\n\n10/10",

One day he wins a company competition to spend a week at the secluded Alaskan estate of Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac, STAR WARS), the company's reclusive founder and CEO. Needless to say, Caleb is more than a bit chuffed, a feeling that is only surpassed when he's sitting in the corporate helicopter as it flies him over some spectacular landscape which, he is told, all belongs to the boss. Once settled in at his temporary digs, he meets Nathan, who asks him to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Caleb learns that he's not been brought all that way just to sit back and crack open a few bottles of beer with Nathan. He's there to work. Nathan, we all learn, has created an android and Caleb's job during the week is to do the Turing Test on it. (If you missed seeing THE IMITATION GAME last year, the Turing Test assesses whether a computer has the ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.) Caleb is up for the challenge and he's taken to a room where he sees his test subject on the other side of a glass wall. Ava (Academy Award (R) winner Alicia Vikander, THE DANISH GIRL) is a sight to behold. Her torso and limbs are translucent, revealing all the circuitry inside. Only her face is flesh-like. Over the next seven days as Caleb and Ava interact with each other, Caleb begins to realise that everything and everyone at Nathan's remote hideaway is not all that it appears to be.\n\nEX MACHINA is one thought-provoking and intense film! It's a bit of a cross between Frankenstein and Spike Jonze's film HER with an overlay of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Isaac's performance is even reminiscent of Marlon Brando's Kurtz in APOCALYPSE NOW. As Caleb, Nathan and Ava all try to get into each other's heads, we're left to guess everyone's motivations until it all becomes clear in the film's closing scenes. (I was sure the film was going to end differently than how it did.)\n\nThe film is the directorial debut of Alex Garland, who also wrote the screenplay. Garland is no stranger to the sci-fi genre as he also wrote the script for the post-apocalyptic thriller 28 DAYS LATER, a film that has been widely credited with reviving the zombie genre. His first novel, The Beach was made into a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. All three actors shine here but none more so than Vikander. Before she started acting she was a professional dancer and her training is evident here in the way Ava walks and turns her body. She's robotic and seductive at the same time.\n\nAt the recent Academy Awards (R), the film took home the Oscar (R) for Best Visual Effects, upsetting heavy favourites THE REVENANT and STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. The award was well deserved as Ava was both creative genius and aesthetic beauty.\n\nThe story of EX MACHINA is sure to stick with you for some time. The big question, though, is if it will make you think twice the next time you want to download that new free app.",

Like in The Shining, isolation amidst cold mountains and the pain of addiction, this one being fed as opposed to Jack Torrance, feeds a monster growing inside.  Nathan is a modern drunk Frankenstein, more cruel to his creation, not allowing her to love or to be outside, experimenting on her consciousness, apathetic to her emotions, individuality, memories.  He tells Caleb to not feel sorry for her, but for himself, that these AI beings will look at us as fossils one day, that they will rule the planet - it seems he's disgusted by what he makes, hence the alcohol to suppress any means of acting morally.  \"The good deeds man has done before defends him,\" repeats Nathan - whatever evil I do now, I should be protected by having done good before it, my justification.\n\nThe best work I've ever seen from Domnhall Gleeson.  He looks so comfortable and settled into this role, so natural and poised.  Unlike Star Wars, which is nearly unwatchable.\n\nI love the two scenes juxtaposed between Ava and Caleb with the power outage, followed by Nathan and Caleb eating sushi.  Ava's ominous warning has us wondering: is she trying to create mistrust between Nathan and Caleb as a design to escape from this place?  Or is she genuinely trying to help Caleb, who may be in danger?  Either way, we have our suspicions about Nathan, and we start wondering about his enslaving - the longer we see Ava behind this glass, we think of her enslavement, and we wonder if Caleb is trapped in this place, which has been on our mind since that automatic door forebodingly closed behind him when he entered this place.  Just as that's running through our mind, we cut to the image of Kyoko serving them, a sad looking woman.  She makes a mistake and is yelled at like a slave.  We wonder what her deal is.  Apparently he keeps her around because she can't understand English and leak information - is that true or is she playing us?  The structure is allowing our suspicions to raise and questions to be asked, it allows us to theorize things that may be happening.  There's also the idea that this is really a reverse test on a possibly mechanic Caleb - maybe outlandish, but it's a possibility.  What I love is the dramatic tension, how should Caleb answer these questions Nathan is piercing him with about Ava?  How should he answer the question about the power outage?  Truth or lie?  We're all thinking, are these power outages by design with a backup camera watching everything?  Or are they genuine and just a red herring to build suspense?  The suspense is working terrifically so far.\n\nInterestingly, as Ava begins to dress and reveal her human-envying crisis, the notes to Close Encounters of the Third Kind play.",

To upgrade Ada he would't need to wipe her memory (kill her) anymore than you'd need to wipe your computer's hard drive to upgrade it.  But, fixing those flaws would have required a different ending which could have been an improvement.",
