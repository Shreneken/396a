Jackson) and a man who claims to be a sheriff. Hoping to find shelter from a blizzard, the group travels to a stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass. Greeted there by four strangers, the eight travelers soon learn that they may not make it to their destination after all.",

            "content": "Perhaps the best remake yet of 1982's The Thing.  A taught, claustrophobic/paranoid death fest during a winter storm, starring Kurt Russell with music by Ennio Morricone.  Essentially a group of people trapped inside a 'facility' in the middle of nowhere, distrusting each other, killing and being killed off one by one, as adeptly handled by Tarantino as it was by Carpenter.  You can argue that this one has women in it, but most of them are easily counterparts to the chess computer, while Daisy is not a woman at all but the Thing in itself.",

And on top of a great story, setting, and dialogue there is phenomenal acting from Sam L. Jackson, Kurt Russel, Tim Roth, and the rest of them. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "A brutal, mean-spirited modern Western.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino's Western mystery drama The Hateful Eight (2015) is a fearsome picture with sterling direction from a true lover of Westerns. The bloodletting is like a Sam Peckinpah film with limbs being hacked off and heads getting blown open. The gripping drama and intriguing mystery pulled me into Tarantino's strange Western. His visceral action and absurd black comedy sensibilities makes for a thoroughly enjoyable picture. The Hateful Eight is an underrated Tarantino film that I have only gained enjoyment and appreciation for over the years.\n\nWriter Quentin Tarantino ensures The Hateful Eight is an uncomfortable watch with vile language and evil men constantly spewing cruel hate. He feels particularly mean-spirited as even the seemingly just black hero gets treated horribly by the surrounding racists with the N-word being thrown around with venom alongside sickening swears and heinous insults. Tarantino does not shy away from the hard dynamic of Northerns and Southerns in a post-Civil War era of America being portrayed. Quentin Tarantino's script is witty for his dark humor and I never saw his twist coming. I do appreciate Tarantino establishing how and why the haberdashery was set up in such a particular way in his neat flashback reveal. It is very clever.\n\nEditor Fred Raskin lets the tension build and atmosphere hang in uncertainty. You never know when the blizzard will pick up or a character will quickly draw a pistol in sudden rage or deliberate strategy with Raskin's sharp cuts. His smooth flashbacks and reaction cuts of characters is enthralling. The Hateful Eight is 188 minutes long and felt half that length upon revisiting it as it's all character driven with high stakes.\n\nCinematographer Robert Richardson shoots gorgeous wide shots on film of the natural mountainside and endless snowy backdrop. Visually, The Hateful Eight reminded me of old Westerns like Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence or Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Tarantino takes the sweeping epic wagon journey of John Ford's Stagecoach with various weary travelers stuck together due to tense wintery conditions from John Carpenter's The Thing. Tarantino's homages range from Spaghetti Westerns like Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker to even Agatha Christie style murder mysteries with suspects trapped together.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is ultra cool and conniving as the sympathetic Major Marquis Warren. It's hard to see Jackson have to suffer racist characters insulting his awesome and inspired black hero Major Warren. He fits his role with an intellectual deductive reasoning like a good detective and a violent tendency to outgun or outsmart his nemesis in every maneuver and moment. Jackson is clearly having fun saying Tarantino's outrageous dialogue and acting out his ultra violent gunplay.\n\nKurt Russell is very funny as the paranoid and confident John Ruth the Hangman. Russell was just born to play in hardened Westerns. Jennifer Jason Leigh is truly crazy as condemned criminal Daisy Domergue with her racist ranting and vile cunning as she plays the men against one another. She's so funny in The Hateful Eight and a good sport about pretending to be beat up or bloodied up for a lark. Her singing is pretty and she's just lovely in The Hateful Eight as an insane and ruthless crook with a lack of morals.\n\nWalton Goggins is hilarious as the Southern racist Sheriff of Red Rock Chris Mannix. He's a superb foil for Jackson's Major Marquis Warren. He steals many scenes. Demián Bichir's pleasant and suspicious Señor Bob is fun, especially opposite Jackson's Major. Tim Roth's friendly hangman Oswaldo Mobray just immediately feels like he has ulterior motives. Michael Madsen's mysterious cowboy Joe Gage just feels sinister immediately. Bruce Dern's bitter old racist Confederate General Sandford \"Sandy\" Smithers is excellent. He's truly vile and hateful in a fun performance, especially when he starts cowering in fear and disgust at Samuel L. Jackson's ruthlessly inflammatory story about his son.\n\nChanning Tatum is chilling as the charming, calm, and confident gang leader Jody Domergue, ready and waiting in hiding. James Parks' complaints as stagecoach driver O.B. Jackson is quite funny, especially when he has to go out in the cold. Zoë Bell is super sweet and friendly as Six-Horse Judy. Gene Jones' pleasant old man Sweet Dave is nice like Dana Gourrier's playful Minnie Mink. Keith Jefferson is sympathetic as the poor black man Charly, unfortunately gunned down begging for life.\n\nProduction designer Yohei Taneda creates an old wooden stagecoach and cozy wooden haberdashery for The Hateful Eight's main set pieces. Art direction from Richard L. Johnson, Benjamin Edelberg, and Kil Won Yu come out the gate swinging with the beautiful Jesus statue shot with the stagecoach rushing past on its way to hellish scenarios. From snow covered backdrops to ornate interiors, The Hateful Eight looks striking. Set decorator Rosemary Brandenburg stuffs the haberdashery full of furs, snowshoes, blankets, whiskey, and an assortment of candy and other knick-knacks for authenticity. \n\nI love the practical gore effects from Greg Nicotero. Composer Ennio Morricone delivers another brilliant Western film score. His music sounds ominous and haunting. He builds a sense of foreboding that does not let up until the quiet conversations. I love Ennio Morricone's film scores for all of his iconic Western films, especially the ones directed by Sergio Leone. I loved hearing Jennifer Jason Leigh's cute country folk song on acoustic guitar too.\n\nCostume designers Carole Zacek, Courtney Hoffman, Jonny Pray, Tricia Yoo, Joshua Coleman, Bob Moore Jr., and Marina Marit deliver cool outfit after outfit. From Union and Confederate uniforms or fur laden cowboy gear, The Hateful Eight gives each man and woman a totally unique Western costume. The hardened looks and old era facial hair from make-up artists Greg Funk, Heba Thorisdottir, and Molly Tissavary look awesome. I loved Samuel L. Jackson's mutton chops.\n\nOverall, The Hateful Eight is underrated and underseen among Tarantino's illustrious filmography.",

After a while it gets tedious watching all the different ways to kill people.

Long movies are hit or miss, and this one is a winner. You dont feel it dragging on, the story is engaging and keeps you feeling a whole range of emotion. There's action, comedy, mystery, history, drama all wrapped in one. Follow Samual L Jackson and Kurt Russell in a snow covered adventure. Also the people doing the set design do a fantastic job.

            "content": "The Hateful Eight is a fantastic western tale of deception that I loved. Only Quentin Tarantino can fill almost an entire movie with just dialogue while still being captivating and engaging.\n\nFrom start to finish, this film is filled with witty dialogue and dry humor that had me genuinely cracking up. The characters are all stereotypes on a comedic level, but when the writing is this good, they become much more than that. Each character had some level of depth and uniqueness that gave this somewhat dry and slow plot a spark that continually kept the flame of the story burning.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is brilliant, this movie was directly written for him, and he makes use of every second of screen time he is given. His comedic delivery is excellent and towards the end of the movie his slyness and witty detective work are mesmerizing. Kurt Russell is hilariously stupid and his relationship with his captee (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is hilarious, sweet, and sometimes demented. Walton Goggins was so damn funny here; this is my favorite performance by him. He makes this movie, and the ending resolution would not be the same without him. Tim Roth was awesome, and all the other gang members were great too. The only one that kind of stuck out was Channing Tatum. I do not know if it was my bias of his based on his previous work, but I did not buy him in this film. Felt really out of place and unnecessarily cast on his name sack alone.\n\nDespite the slow pace and long runtime, this film is an utter masterpiece that keeps the viewer engaged and constantly curious about what the true motivations are behind each of our eight characters. The chapter-like structure is fantastic and there are some Pulp Fiction elements here in terms of storytelling order which I loved. While this may not be Tarantino's best film, it is still an incredible product and another classic added to his filmography.\n\nScore: 90%\nVerdict: Excellent",

The first hour is just characters introducing each other, with the same people using the same introductions multiple times. The movie is set up to be a high-tension murder mystery but then quickly changes into blatant violence. I know violence is Tarantino's thing, but the sudden change in tone of the movie was too abrupt, especially because the set-up for the first half was so long. Then the violence half wasn't anything special, almost all of the characters die from close range bullets. Overall, it's just a bad movie that made me feel guilty for making my partner sit down and watch the whole thing.",

The movie takes great pride in its brutality, which I can appreciate. But at times it comes off as a bit edgy, even for Tarentino standards. My main fault with the movie is pretty much all of the characters have some quality that makes me not want to root for them. But looking past that, very solid film. 7.8/10",

Although not the same exact time period as Django — that being antebellum South, this being postbellum West — it was too similar and I had wanted something completely different; It's not like Tarantino comes out with a film every year. The Tarantino film I've probably seen the least amount of times, The Hateful Eight pleasantly surprised me on this most recent viewing, scoring an (85), anchored with the acting from a phenomenal cast. I mean, every single actor elevated the so-so plot. Kurt Russell (and his John Wayne-like accent), Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, and Bruce Dern all deserve praise, but Walton Goggins as Chris Mannix was by far the stand-out here. Part Western, part Murder-Mystery, the film's plot and structure was still strange and overindulgent. This does not need to be a 168-minute movie. An issue I had was when John Ruth (Russell) determines that at least one-person is in cahoots with Daisy (Leigh), why doesn't he just shoot her in the head? I get it, he's John \"The Hangman\" Ruth, but it was really stupid he would keep her alive after this revelation. Either 1. Make her \"alive\" bounty worth more than the \"dead\" so it gives him a financial motive, or kill off Ruth before he ever acquires knowledge of conspiracy. While Samuel L. Jackson's overall performance is excellent, there were moments after he had been shot in the groin where he acted as if he weren't in any pain whatsoever. The quintessence of the overindulgence in THE came with Tarantino's narration — it simply wasn't necessary and didn't add anything to the film, as is so often the case with such narration. The film also has a thrilling, original score. At an (85), The Hateful Eight actually has the second lowest of all my Tarantino scores (Deathproof at (84) is the lowest), but if you follow my lists, you know that those are very high overall and a testament to QT the god.",

Thanks to minimal locations (i.e. a singular log cabin) the characters are fleshed out very well and equally well portrayed by their respective actors, Samuel L. Jackson's performance was particularly good. Tension in this movie was also something that made it so good, as the movie went on the atmosphere in the cabin got increasingly tense and leads to outbursts of signature Tarantino-style action. The movie overall feels very well-rounded and makes a rewarding watch when coupled with its smarter storytelling. What you need to keep in mind however, is that this movie is an extremely slow-burn, as in the movie is powered by dialogue. Because the movie is so long the vast majority of it is made up talking and only bursts of action in the last hour and a half. This is by no means a bad thing once you get into it, but could be surprising if you expected a Django-type western from Tarantino or even a classic one.

It feels so different yet so similar. The characters look like the ones in Django and there is liters of bloody blood. Strange thing: No feet! But it really innovates. It's sort of a \"Then, There Were None\" except there is so much style, complexity and a so much interesting, stressing atmosphere. I was glued to the screen for 3 hours because of these elements. I mean Ennio Morricone was at his level. The complexity of the storyline is surprisingly rich. Divided in six chapters, I loved the way everything was brang to us. Lots of surprises and twists. The acting is on top. And that's pretty much what I had to say about it.",

The Hateful Eight should not be compared to Django Unchained or Pulp Fiction or anything else he's done. It should be reviewed as a movie on its own and it's a brilliant movie. \n\nThe Hateful Eight, like many of his movies, has a lot of interesting characters that keeps you guessing to the very end. NOTHING in this movie is predictable and I love that. And like many Tatantino movies, you become emotionally invested in almost every character in no time at all. There are endless small things he includes about each character that never appears to be exposition. And again, I love that. It's a lost art.  \nEven the characters you only see for a short time, you become invested in: Minnie, Six Horse Judy, Sweet Dave and Charly, are just people who enjoy their jobs, enjoy people and want only to please their customers at Minnie's Haberdashery. Poor O.B. is a great driver of a team of horses and is willing to go out in the cold time and time again. - You become invested emotionally in the bad guys too. There is \"Bob\" the cold-blooded killer and gang member, who can play Silent Night on the piano and can enjoy a good cigar. The highly racist General Sanford Smithers, who only wants to give his son a proper tombstone. Daisy Domergue, the notorious gang member can play guitar and sing well, and you can see the love between her and her brother Jody (for a brief moment). And the main characters, no matter how gruff and crude, you feel for too. John \"The Hangman\" Ruth is a cold-blooded bounty hunter, but he picks of two freezing people in the snow, wipes some food off of Daisy's mouth, and doesn't like to \"cheat the hangman,\" so he's a fair man as well. Oswaldo Mobray is played by Tim Roth, so of course, he's eccentric and likable. And Major Marquis Warren goes through life a wanted, unappreciated war veteran, who carries a fake letter from Lincoln to help make his way through life in \"white America.\" \n\nLike most of Tarantino's movies, it is watchable over and over and over. You learn something new and see something you didn't notice before with each viewing.",

I feel like Tarantino is trying too hard to shock us with his use of gore. We watch someone's head explode and we're supposed to be impressed. \nThe forced oral sex scene is where the film takes its downturn. It's disturbing, unnecessary, and made me lose all respect for Samuel L Jackson's character so I was no longer rooting for him.\nHowever, the performances were excellent from the entire cast.

The violence is particularly sadistic, even for Tarantino. Violence in his older movies didn't bother me because they had more of a black comic tone and were more satirical in general, but in this movie it was entirely gratuitous.

The film that I expected to see was just another violent, comedic drama, and by no means is it not. However, the Hateful Eight also ended up transforming into an exciting and intriguing murder mystery, with an unbelievable amount of well-used tension. The ultimate star of the show is obviously taken by Samuel L Jackson who displays a true standout performance. Jackson's performance is paired well with the tense relationship of Kurt Russel's and Walton Goggins' characters. The story's location could not have been more perfect, a snowed-in shack, in which inevitably highly raises the tension. However, the pacing does seem quite slow for a film of this magnitude, which does not help justify it's 3 hour run-time. All in all, it may not be his best work, but, it is still a true Tarantino. \n8/10",

            "content": "The story of this movie take place in Wyoming after the time of Civil War in United States. Due to hazardous blizzard and several incidents, bounty hunter Marquis (Black) rides on a wagon with John, who is also a bounty hunter (White) and Chris, who claimed to be the new sheriff in town (White), along with John's prisoner, Daisy who is a famous criminal (White). The blizzard got harder, so they decided to stop at Minnie's Haberdashery which is a place where people stays during the extreme weather. When they arrived, there were four travelers there. They are Joe who claimed to be a ransom guy who is gonna visit his mother (White), Bob who claimed to be Minnie's substitute during Minnie's vacation (Mexican), Oswaldo who claimed to be the hangman in town (white) and General Smithers who is a famous southern general arrived here to prepare his son's funeral (White) . During the time that everybody gathered in the shack, people split into two groups. One group represent the north side, Marquis is the head of the group. One group represent the south side, general Smithers is the head of the group. As Oswaldo suggested, the pub side belongs to the north, the fireplace belongs to the south and the dinner table is neutral.  As a consequence of a few incidents, Marquis and John starts to have their suspicions that the travelers are colluding with Daisy. Due to a quarrel, Marquis killed Smithers. While everyone focused on the murder, somebody poisoned the coffee and that caused the death of John. Marquis and Chris interrogate the rest of Travelers and figured out all of them are in Daisy's gang. Right at this moment, Cody who is Daisy's brother, have been waited in the basement the whole time sneak attacked Marquis and injured him. After the Crossfire, Marquis and Chris killed all of them beside Daisy.  Since John has the nickname of \"The Hangman\" and Daisy is John's prisoner. Marquis and Chris hung Daisy.\nThis movie mainly tackled the racial equation problem. There's a detail that is interesting. In order to prevent Daisy getting saved by her crew, John disarmed Joe and Oswaldo. After that, Joe moved to the table from the fireplace. Even the most innocent character in the show—Minnie who got killed by Cody while setting up the trap for Chris, put up the sign of \"Mexicans and Dogs are not allowed\" before. She did end up getting rid of it—because she start to allow dogs in her house. The climax of the movie is when Marquis and Chris teamed up against Daisy's crew. They hated each others guts until that point in the movie. Marquis is the black soldier who killed almost forty-seven southern white soldiers. Chris is the son of the southern rebel army leader. They are two people that viewers probably never thought will be on the same side. After Marquis killed the rest of Daisy's crew besides Daisy, she tried to parley with Chris who she knows resents black people. Between the choices of view and justice. Chris chose justice and hung Daisy with the help of Marquis. This ending hinted the wish that director have wish of white people and colored people can be treated equally.\nPersonally, I love this film. Beside the storyline, the setting of the film is great. Please imagine a Wild Wild West sight taking place in a little shack in a blizzard with all the relationships between all these characters. Hints are also used frequently in this movie, although the first time might be hard to notice. However, after watching it a second time, even smallest thing in the movie means something. Jellybeans on the ground, Jesus's statue and two horses all hinted at something in the end however not understandable at first. If we do not watch it a second time, we will not know the beauty of details in this movie. However, there is are few flaws in the movie. There are a few slow motions clips in the movie and this movie is already three hours long, so that somehow makes it exhausting. Another flaw is actually a mistake they made in the script.  Minnie hates Mexicans nevertheless she welcome Bob in the shack. All in all I think it is great movie.",
