It has a pretty generic story, starring some young people who don't know the consequences of their actions and end up running for their lives, but this doesn't make the movie bad already. The problem was the predictable motivation of these characters. The film also has a flawed script with the tiring repetition of predictable phrases like \"what the f*ck\" or \"move, move\". To finish with the negative aspects, it results unnecessarily long, having action only in the final 40 minutes. Not gonna lie, it had its entertaining moments because of its special effects and its film locations, which resembled the Area 51 that many people have in mind. It was quite fun, but as it has more negative than positive aspects, I feel obligated to give it a 5, which means a \"Rotten\" score.",

            "content": "This one's almost a good movie. The most entertaining parts of the film take place at Area 51 itself, where the production values and the atmosphere are so convincing that one could think the real Area 51 could look like this. What they find there is something of a mixed-bag, since although we did not know for certain what they would find, we are not surprised.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment is the characters who, in spite of some fecklessly colorful dialogue and behavior, come off as generic frat-boy types. What's curious is that although the main characters spend most of the film planning or discussing how to break into Area 51, they do not seriously seem to consider the magnitude of what they're saying, even when one of them insists that the penalty for getting caught is 15 years in prison. I forget, also, if they ever mentioned an escape plan.\n\nThe pacing is another issue. Too much time is spent on the heroes planning and talking about motion sensors, and arguing about protagonist Reid's (Reid Warner), immovable determination to invade the base. After an hour, especially with such uninteresting characters, this feels like too much. There are a handful of moments pre-Area 51 that work. There's the scene in which the young heroes break into the home of a base employee and must sneak back out after the family comes home. But even then that's sort of minimal-level suspense. If we had cared more about the characters, or sympathized with their motives, scenes like this would be more.\n\nI admit to being confused by the camera footage perspective of the film, which at some point shows multiple people splitting in several directions, each with a camera recording for the audience's benefit. Since these cameras are likely destroyed or lost by the end of the film, how can anyone see it? Are we seeing what the cameras are seeing as they're happening? Found footage veterans will know the answers.\n\nMy recommendation? Give the characters more involving motivations, let those motivations guide the plot in unexpected ways, and spend a reasonable amount of time planning, invading, and encountering Area 51 and its inhabitants.",

As you can figure out from the title, Area 51 is the story of 4 guys who develop a sudden craving to not just learn about area 51 but to visit it in actuality. It's filmed in the currently popular mock documentary style and opens with interviews of the 4 guys' friends by an unknown person. Then the movie cuts to the guys' home made camera footage. How this footage was obtained, in light of the concluding events, is unknown as well.\nThe advantage of the guys' jerky home made movies is that it covers up the movie's low quality special effects. The guys prepare for the mission but are curiously unprepared for what they are convinced that they will find at area 51.\nIt's pretty fun and fortunately short at 1:30 and has a mild political undertow to it.\nBesides the lack of cinematography, what really hampers the movie is the dialogue. There are enough f-bombs in it for WWIII. Typical dialogue is: \"(f-bpmb) we've got to get out of here. (f-bomb) did you see that ? (f-bomb) we've got to get out of here (f-bomb)....\" ad nauseum.

            "content": "The first thing I did after watching \"Area 51,\" directed by Oren Peli, was to check the picture's budget. I was horrified that five million dollars was put into the film but it looked like it had a budget of about five thousand dollars. It is very student film-by one who is meant to fail the class because he or she does not understand how to set up elementary elements, like how to create tension or suspense. This is key because the genre is sci-fi horror but the result is, for the most part, boredom.\n\nIt starts off on the wrong foot. People talk directly to camera about how three friends-Reid (Reid Warner), Darrin (Darrin Bragg), and Ben (Ben Rovner)-had gone missing ever since they decided to break into Area 51, a government facility that supposedly house extraterrestrial evidence. This is a mistake because it signals to us that it is one of those so-called found-footage pictures where it all goes terribly wrong in the end-meaning there is likely no survivor. Already we get the impression that it is a pessimistic film.\n\nOne might be tempted to compare this work to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez' \"The Blair Witch Project.\" After all, they have more than a few similarities: three protagonists, characters going on a journey in search of proof, and they come to regret their decision to plunge carelessly into the unknown. But to make that comparison is an insult to the 1999 classic. That film has plenty of memorable scenes. It may frustrate many at times but one cannot stop looking at it because there is a quiet menace underneath the desperation of the characters.\n\nHere, just about everything comes across as forced and false. For instance, as the protagonists finally arrive at the facility, one can barely see anything. The break-in occurs at night so it is very dark. In addition, the hand-held camera shakes so relentlessly that it is dizzying and we are unable to appreciate the environment or marvel at the government's secret area. There is an exchange among the characters that the point of them going on this mission is to show the public what is hidden. I found it ironic that in the end it shows us nothing of substance.\n\nThe visual effects during the latter half are ugly and fake: floating meteorites, seemingly conscious liquid, spaceships-even invisible extraterrestrials (how convenient-it must have been so expensive creating invisible aliens on screen). One of the problems with these images is a complete lack of imagination. These are things that we have seen before in better television shows and movies. Peli's film does not bother to be creative or offer something new. It takes tired images and formulas, chews them up, and regurgitates them. Then the filmmakers, through our eyes and brain, expect us to digest these recycled trash. Don't you find that insulting?\n\nHalfway through the picture, something in me-one who knows better-wished that I were watching the Season One finale of Chris Carter's \"The X-Files.\" That one episode is everything this movie is not: sharply written, imaginative, envelope-pushing in terms of the medium, the performances are memorable, and the revelations stick with you like a sentient goo from outer space.\n\nFilm-Review.org",

The film itself follows many of your typical beats (it goes pretty much exactly where you think it would go. No real twists, turns, surprises, or even scares). You know your movie is in trouble when the douche-iest bro is the only one who starts talking sense. I wasn't crazy about Paranormal Activity, but at least it used it's minimalistic settings to its advantage (Here we get to explore your typical office, locker room, office staircase, and a few tunnels), was competently made, and actually had some scares. Not to mention the CGI and effects in Area 51  (when there are any) are super weak. There are a few pieces that could have come across as clever in better hands. In the end, Area 51 is just a bunch of stupid 20-somethings wandering around, doing nothing, with absolutely nothing happening until it's predictable and laughably bad ending finally comes around. A very unimpressive, boring, and dull film that travels in a straight line from beginning to end. Area 51 could have been a really cool film, and it's premise does hold potential (even if it has been done before). Unfortunately, this is just your dime-a-dozen, paint-by-numbers, lifeless and listless found-footage style movie. No wonder it never got a theatrical release.",

There's a party scene where it's implied the story's lead is abducted/probed by aliens, and they've told him to come to Area 51 or something. That would be interesting if it ever came up ever again. Getting the characters to Area 51 is the easy part when writing a movie like this. You have a trio of people going in, and the driver waiting outside who changed his mind about going in.\n\nOkay, so, why not just write it as a band of misfits who develop a strong fascination with Area 51 and decide that they want to see inside? It would lead to less wasted time, and more time for us to be scared while they're actually in Area 51.\n\nTruth be told, I have no real overall opinion on this movie. See it if you like or don't.

            "content": "I think I have gone on a rant on why I love found footage films many times before, so I am going to avoid that here. Despite, the failing hype around the genre due to some really terrible made movies, you may expect something else from this one as its a return to direction from writer/ producer of the Insidious series, the unfairly cancelled brilliant TV series The River - Oren Peli. The man behind the camera of the 1st Paranormal Activity, the film which arguably started this craze (yeah I know Blair Witch!). Of course for a fan like me, this film was awaited on completely different level as its combined two of my favorite genres (found footage & Aliens conspiracy). Ghosts and aliens scare me, and classic terror tropes work wonders on me! Ever since the overrated \"Blair Witch Project,\" we have been deluged with similar-themed films; most of which fall way, way short of being anything but tiresome. So enter Oren Peli with his own take on the concept, but in his favor we have the mysterious and always-intriguing Area 51 as the backdrop. That fact alone is precisely why I decided to give this film a look. But unfortunately, just like every poor film of the genre, the film lacks any depth & adding to the mix is the poor finale. It suffers from the same exact problems by stuttering towards the end! The story follows Reid (Reid Warner) who after a 'calling' during a pool part convinces his friends Darrin (Darrin Bragg) & Ben (Ben Rovner) to take him to Las Vegas & help him break into the mythical government facility Area 51 in order to expose the presence of Aliens on earth. Along with them on the ride is fellow conspiracy theorist Jelena (Jelena Nik), whose deceased father was an ex employee at the facility. So we get the usual footage of people driving to desolate areas, where they are confronted by suspicious looking people, they talk to other people with whom are also obsessed with the subject matter, and this happens for the majority of the film! For most early parts, the film delivers quite the ride as audiences follow these guys on Vegas and its surrounding. Some investigations and interviews set the tone right, and not in overly silly way. Characters are also pretty decent and likable as though they are real life friends. Unfortunately, it soon arrives at familiar territory of hazy shots and mindless running. The scenes in the city or desert are identifiable, but when it is stranded in dark corners, the movie loses the momentum significantly. Script is also numbingly bland as characters would yell the same thing over and over again, this is especially true when they are repeatedly shouting, \"We gotta go\". With both visual and audio decrease in quality, it just turns into a confusing escapade. At first it appeared that Peli might have done it right. Blending actors and sets with real people and locations associated with Area 51, the set-up is intriguing. Even the process in which these filmmakers attempt to foil some of the high-tech base security systems, seems plausible. So far so good. But it is when the title characters break into the house of an Area 51 / S4 worker and steal his 'card', eventually actually getting inside the top-secret facility, that the movie becomes completely unbelievable and downright ridiculous. Everything that follows is what we have come to know, and depending on how you feel about these shaky-cam movies, love or hate about the concept. Cinematography is to be expected from this kind of found footage flick, it's rather elementary, but there are a few good shots with modified vision. At several scenes the film builds up the suspense pretty well, these are not all translated into thrilling moments. It almost seems like it has problems in latter half, resorting to cheap alien gimmick and nullifying its early decent production. There are some decent and pretty good Area 51 alien movies and \"documentaries\" out there, but this one is just not one of them. It's just more of the same old, same old found footage where nothing worthwhile happens until the last 15 minutes or so and even when something does finally happen, it's a huge disappointment. For what this was hyped up to be, it was a huge disappointment, but I wasn't surprised honestly. If you want to waste an hour watching the build up to a half hour of creative and decently ambitious and exciting found footage, then go ahead. Just know that it takes awhile for things to start. If you're looking for visual aliens, this really doesn't offer any probably so they could save on the budget which must have been pretty low. On the whole, 'Area 51', has a presentable start with more engaging use of the found footage, but it falls to the same issues and ends up like the rest without accomplishing much, but given the exciting story set-up, Peli really should have given us a whole lot more than just another camcorder film. In fairness, I think some people will enjoy this. I did not! Trust me there are some good movies out there for example REC (Just 1 & 2) Cloverfield, V/H/S series, Grave Encounters (the original & the sequel), The Tunnel Movie, & of course the original Paranormal Activity trilogy (not the shameful sequels). Disappointing!",

To be fair, the slow burn does eventually catch fire and there's lots of screaming and heavy breathing and dark tunnels and running and what-not. The relatively tense final half-hour is clearly the reason that very smart producer Jason Blum thought this would be a solid follow-up to \"Paranormal Activity.\" It's that first hour that is the reason it took six years to (barely) get released.  There's no tension or action for the longest time and \"Area 51\" might have been better served as a short film or episode of an anthology series in that the entire first-hour of set-up could have been cut to five minutes. It makes sense for Area 51 to try and replicate the Paranormal Activity formula. Peli wanted another hit, so he repeats himself here, only instead of ghosts and darkness, there are aliens and darkness. Peli tacks an abrupt ending on the same film that caused over five years of grief and countless days of edits, re-edits, and obvious uncertainty. There's no creative leap to enjoy and little filmmaking finesse to study. Instead, it's more of the same, and in the five years \"Area 51\" has been sitting on the shelf, every studio and aspiring horror moviemaker has beaten Peli at his own game.\n\nVERDICT: \"Not So Hot\" - [Negative Reaction] These films are truly terrible films. They are not the worst things ever made, but they are definitely awful and should not be seen by anyone. (Films that are rated 1.5 or 2 stars)",

            "content": "In 2009, Oren Peli all but reinvented the indie/found footage horror film with his sequel-spawning Paranormal Activity.  I'll remember the experience of seeing that film for the first time for as long as I live; sans expectations, I sauntered into the screening happy as a bird...then wobbled out 90 minutes later on shaky knees.  Watching two people sleeping and an invisible demon on the market for a human body to call home was apparently enough to break me.  Peli had tapped into horror's golden mantra - that less is more - and executed it to perfection.  Nothing happens in Paranormal Activity, yet it's one of the most effective horror films in recent years; the sound of footsteps slowly ascending the stairs or the mere accentuation of a static buzz, alluding to the next 'scare', is enough to destroy at least your next three nights' sleep.\n\nNow we have Area 51, Peli's long-delayed and anticipated (in some corners, at least) follow-up about a group of kids planning to break into the eponymous base and discover some of the American government's most closely guarded secrets.  The film sets itself up in pretty much the same way every found-footage flick does nowadays: three guys, one of whom unrealistically films everything they do, and a pretty girl who enters the frame later on and clearly has a stronger connection with one of said guys than the other two.  Remember Earth To Echo, or Project Almanac?  Exactly the same formula.  But at least they were better films.\n\nEven in attempting to look at this from a stand-alone perspective, i.e. ignoring Paranormal Activity completely, it's a hugely underwhelming experience.  Whether it's nitpicking or fatal, there are simply too many problems breaking up whatever semblance of a structure it has.  For starters, the characters are idiots.  Case in point: they've just broken into someone's house - someone whom they know to have been tangibly responsible for an ex-Area 51 employee's death - so what do they do?  Continue filming, of course.  When you're hiding behind a shower curtain with the house's owner mere inches away, of course you keep your blinking camera on.  But do they at least wear gloves? I hear you ask.  Ha!  Of course they don't.  One would be right assume they're smart enough to have a little moment and decide it's at least best to roll their sleeves down, but no.  Not even when they're IN AREA 51!  I mean, blimey.  Seriously?\n\nMore problematically, though, it isn't scary or thrilling.  Even slightly.  Perhaps Peli's intentions this time are less geared towards getting under his audiences' skin, which certainly feels like the case throughout, but if so, what are his intentions?  What kind of response is he attempting to elicit?  What is he actually trying to do with this film?  It takes about 70 minutes for something to actually happen involving the mysteries of Area 51.  When it does, it's unclear how we're supposed to react.  It feels like, despite the delays in getting this thing made, they still weren't sure how they wanted the third act to play out; what they wanted the kids to find.  It's rushed and generic with nothing to evoke even a little excitement.  Essentially, the moment the kids get into Area 51 is the moment the film truly dies.  How's that for depressing?",

So when it didn't came out for years, I did start to forget about it, until I saw that it was on Netflix which I was very curious about Area 51. As it turns out, Area 51 is not as groan inducing as Chernobyl Diaries, but it might as well be forgotten. The acting is not nearly as good in this as in the director's previous film Paranormal Activity, and is just average. The characters are lacking any development that I didn't care about anyone or wanting them to survive. The first hour of it is so boring that I kept looking at how much progress I got into it many times. Most of the time I get why it's being filmed, but there's times that makes no sense about why it's being filmed, and that it could've made a bit better if it wasn't found footage. Things actually start to happen in the last 30 minutes which there are some cool effects in it, but even that was lacking in thrills. I like that there's no jump scares, but it doesn't do anything remotely scary that I start to wonder if it was even a horror film at all. It has an unnecessary ending that is just like any other horror film. For Chernobyl Diaries, there can be a good horror film from it which frustrated me that it was not good, but for Oren Peli's Area 51, I can't see how they can make a effective horror film and is just plain forgettable.",
