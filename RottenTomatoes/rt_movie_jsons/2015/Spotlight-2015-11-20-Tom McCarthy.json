Led by editor Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton), reporters Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Matt Carroll and Sacha Pfeiffer interview victims and try to unseal sensitive documents. The reporters make it their mission to provide proof of a cover-up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church.",

Spotlight is a haunting film that dives deep into the horrors of the subject matter which it deals with. This reminds me of the recent article about the Dalai Lama tongue-kissing a young boy. This is really disgusting. Our government should be more concerned about the misconduct of religious leaders. We need to be more concerned about our children.",

            "content": "The horrific instances of abuse committed by members of the Catholic Church takes centre stage in this harrowing drama from Tom McCarthy (\"Stillwater\"). \"Spotlight\" only details the abuse that occurred in Boston, but McCarthy ends the film with a chilling list of places where other major scandals within the Church have taken place, a list made up of 105 U.S. communities and 101 other locations across the globe.\n\nMike Rezendes, Walter Robinson, Sacha Pfeiffer, and Matt Carroll are the reporters behind the damning Boston Globe article that recounted the years of abuse perpetrated by members of the Catholic Church in parishes throughout Boston. Taking place over the course of seven months between 2001 and 2002, the film follows the reporters of the Boston Globe's Spotlight team as they investigate the alleged abuse committed by members of the Catholic Church. Speaking to survivors, lawyers and members of the Church, the team uncover a decades-old conspiracy in which the Church willingly covered up the crimes committed by members. What follows is a shocking series of events that not only shook the Catholic Church, but also the religious scene in Boston.\n\n\"Spotlight\" features knockout performances from its entire ensemble cast, featuring stellar turns from Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson, Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes, and Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfieffer, with the latter two going on to receive Oscar nominations for their performances. Ruffalo, Keaton and McAdams are joined by a star-studded cast, with Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, and Stanley Tucci starring alongside them.\n\nMcCarthy and Josh Singer (\"The Post\") pen the film's Oscar-winning screenplay, taking an incredibly sensitive subject and working it into an effective script that doesn't feel exploitative. The film derives an intense and riveting drama from a distressing issue that is still present in the Catholic Church today, with a harrowing report revealing that there had been 330,000 victims of abuse from 1950-2020 in the French Catholic Church alone.\n\nThe film also highlights the importance of journalism and how journalists have the power to uncover conspiracies like the abuse in the Catholic Church or secrets about the Vietnam War as seen in \"The Post\". However, \"Spotlight\" isn't the first film to detail the heinous acts committed by members of the Church, films like Francis Ozon's \"By the Grace of God\" and Pablo Larra\u00edn's \"The Club\" both point out these horrific acts and the impact they had on victims.\n\nCinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi (\"Black Mass\", \"Stillwater\") creates easy on the eye visuals that, despite their monotonous appearance, make this a visually pleasing film. Takaynagi's visuals work with the film's shocking and sensitive story to create one of 2015's best films. Even though \"Spotlight\" could be considered boring by those who dislike dialogue heavy films, the thought-provoking subject matter keeps your attention for the entire two hours, with audience members wanting to learn details alongside the characters themselves.",

            "content": "I find it baffling that I would feel the rush of trying to get paperwork from a courthouse or get excited with people trying to write spreadsheets based on the tedious process of going through ministry records. For some reason, McCarthy did it. Spotlight is a film about exposing priests as child molesters, and the Cardinals, Archbishops, and Bishops defend their younger siblings, getting them out of trouble. The journalists at the Boston Globe are dedicated not just to finding the truth and bring justice to the molester priests but help save future victims of the abusers.\nHollywood doesn't consider authenticity a priority, yet McCarthy sees how it is important to study the film being created. It starts out as a Jewish man purchasing a local newspaper. He decides it would be best for the Boston Globe's spotlight team to expand the knowledge on the molestation cases from priests like Fr. Geoghan. They begin investigating, reading documents, talking to victims, consulting experts and lawyers. They would check facts, confirm them, and re-confirm them. It was a tedious and monotonous. It would be difficult to make this cinematic, but McCarthy used montages to show us their progress overtime. The film is also a visual departure to most of the other films I see these days. The colors are muted, lighting is soft and flat, the music is subtle, and the camera work isn't fancy. The actors don't show exaggerated expressions rather, they focus on realistic faces of frustration. This is to represent the slow, monotonous, and tedious process that the journalists must go through. In the end, they publish the paper and expose the molester priests.\nSpotlight is the most authentic film about investigative journalism. There isn't a single moment where someone rushed into the office screaming, \"I have proof!\" Rather, the journalists soldiered onto heaps of paperwork, finding patterns in the ministry records, talking to lawyers who have fought for the victims, and interviewing the victims themselves. They had to overcome the Church's attempts at hiding documents that are opened to the public. They had to go through clips of previous reports, clips they have buried, and lawyers who refused to talk for career preservation purposes.\nVloggers discredit traditional news sources, calling them biased. This resulted in an image of a man, who mustn't be defined by his father's mistakes, as the sins of the father are not the sins of the son, but also the achievements of the father are also the achievements of the son. Politicians are also trying to take down news giants like ABS-CBN and arrested Rappler founder, Maria Ressa for spreading false news. ABS-CBN and Rappler has been trying to show the dark side of Former President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign in drugs. Vloggers show a brighter side to it, even if it isn't all true. They can get away with this, as they aren't regulated by law to confirm any information they get. Despite all the harsh problems and setbacks, journalism in the Philippines has gotten a victory through Maria Ressa's Nobel Peace Prize in journalism.\nJournalists go through a lot. And I think we should give them the credit they deserve. Either by telling an accurate and authentic story of the previously unsung heroes who helped bring justice to molester priests and helped the future victims, or by giving awards and recognition to those who persevere despite the constant setback, like Maria Ressa's Nobel Peace Prize in journalism.",

The actors do a fantastic job at displaying these tough emotions. Mark Ruffalo has some exquisite emotional expressiveness that is subtle, restrained, but still suffocating. The twisted dichotomy between church and governance is encased in journalism, while still being as informative as any documentary could be, and yet, remains absolutely thrilling.",

It's amazing, shocking, and terrifying and this movie does a fantastic job keeping its wits about it and not fancifying a story that needs no dramatization. The acting is bang on from a utterly stacked cast and the dialogue is magnetizing. Just as much as the Spotlight news story, this movie had to grapple with the journalistic integrity of handling subject matter that affects thousands upon thousands of victims. To my eye and as a former Catholic, Tom McCarthy handles that responsibility with flying colors and made a movie that not only is gripping and well made, but is an important tool of awareness.",

            "content": "Spotlight is The Movie about the hard working Investigative Journalists at the Boston Globe, and the Effort to bringing a story that the Catholic Church has tried to Bury for Years.\n\nNava Medikonda | 4/5 Rating | 80%\n\nBased on a true story, \"Spotlight\" by Tom McCarthy uncovers the horrors that have been hidden, and tampered with, when Priests in Boston have Molested Children. 4 Journalists that work in the \"Spotlight Team\" have brought the story back, a story that changed the world.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is easily 2015's best picture. The film casts Mark Ruffalo,\nMichael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James as the 4 investigative journalists. Each character is comparatively different, but the chemistry on screen fits perfectly.\n\nThe movie itself isn't anything special. Its has a dry theme, with a important and worldwide message. However, the film does not ever fail to produce telling an important story that helps overrule the dryness to the film.\n\nThe film's setting takes place mostly entirely in Boston. We get to see parts of the then-current Boston Globe offices in Dorchester, Boston, Fenway Park, and the Boston Public Library.\n\n\"Spotlight\" represents the investigative unit at the Boston Globe.\n\nIn the film, the journalists decide to sue the Catholic Church for sealed documents that will help write the story they want to write.\n\nIn real life events, as matched with the film, the spotlight team were put down in the sense of rejection/demotivation by people who were victims of the horror, the lawyers who were only doing there job, and the other workers at the Boston Globe.\n\nTo the world of Journalism, and the world of news, the story of \"Spotlight\" is one of the stories that people hope to watch/read. Real news, true journalism, the truth, a movie that exceeds regularity. Expected as it is, this is one of the stories journalists want to tell, its one of the big stories in ones career. Its one of the stories the world doesn't want to hear, especially the people who are very picky on what's written, but those people will read what's being written eventually, and soon will come to find out the truth.\n\nThe film emphasizes nobody can get away with child molestation, or any type of abuse. It emphasizes collecting all the facts will certify that justice is done.\n\nDuring the film we see Michael Keaton's character, the leader of his investigative team fighting his own battles. At some point in the film he says, \"we got two stories here, a story about generate clergy, and the story about a bunch of lawyer turning child abuse into a cottage industry, which story do you want us to write? because we're writing one of them.\" At many points in the film, we see Keaton's character desire to accomplish his goal, to finish the story that needs to be told. We learn that all 4 of the journalist's will keep pushing for the story they need to tell.\n\nThe goal, the objective is front and center. There is no hiding what is trying to be done, the film doesn't try to get the journalist's to look for something they want to research. The horrors that need to be uncovered are present, and they are waiting to be told by a committed investigative team.\n\nBeyond doubt, there is a momentum the film carries as the team of 4 build their case, and uncover the story they know was not taken seriously.\n\n\"Spotlight\" was shot on a Digital, ARRI ALEXA XT Camera. The film has a runtime of 2 hours and 9 minutes, and has an R rating.\n\nThe performance in this film is amazing. We get to feel what its like as a journalist, the struggle, and the desire that news people tend to go through everyday when trying to find a story.\n\nAt some point during the film, the conversation of The Boston Globes subscribers was mentioned as 53% catholic readers. Making the story that's being investigated, a potential negative impact on TBG. The problem with news in modern day is people don't want to hear an equal side or neutral news. There may be journalists who tell a story from both sides, but people chose to read news from a source they know that tells them the story from the side they stand on. \"Spotlight\" does show how certain people in the catholic community have reacted to the paper after being published.\n\nBy the end of the film we feel good, we feel thankful that a strong team was put on this investigation. We can understand why people may have felt the way they felt, and potentially what it may have been like as a child to be pestered by a priest in the wrong way. We accept and agree that only telling more stories can uncover the truth that has been hidden, and the people who want to share their stories feel confident to allow readers to acknowledge what was once history.",

Even if it didn't do much for me, which it did, it would still be appreciated for what it set out to do and would have been applauded for trying.\n\nIt took on a very heavy subject, that is still very much relevant today, and does it in a way that's riveting with a strong emotional core, strong insight that illuminates and tells of stuff that we didn't know (that leaves us shocked and very angry) and not fall into the trap of having too much of things that we knew already. It also never feels mawkish or preachy, traps that it also could have fallen into.\n\nWhile it is a deliberate and relatively slow-paced film, it didn't leave me bored for a second, instead gluing me in with its excellent performances across the board, how it tells its story, it's beautifully balanced screenplay and sheer class. Tom McCarthy's direction has all the class and professionalism that 'Spotlight' needed.\n\nOther strengths are the way it's filmed, it's very atmospheric and evocative in its detail and the cinematography is gritty and ravishing. The music fits beautifully, 'Spotlight's' script and story are engrossing and quietly intelligent and the characters are written compellingly.\n\nActing is excellent across the board. Both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give career-best performances worthy of award recognition, particularly Ruffalo. Michael Keaton's performances here and in the previous year's 'Birdman' are his best in years, a very commanding turn. Brian D'Arcy James are up to their level.\n\nOverall, a riveting and brave film that does wonders with a difficult subject matter. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This film brilliantly shows what an Ensemble Cast is cause no one really stands out in this film,  everyone is equally amazing. McCarthy's Direction feels genuine but it's really just great. One of the best aspects of this film, though, is for sure the Screenplay. It's masterfully written and really throws you right into this disturbing revelation about the church. This film is important.",
