The film also suffers from some plot holes and inconsistencies that were later explained or ignored by the subsequent films. The film also fails to live up to the expectations and hype that surrounded it.

            "content": "The Force Awakens is a decent entry point to a new series. Firstly, the VFX, sound design, score and 'secondary' features of a good movie are very well done. The characters are more or less unique and flavoursome in their own right, particularly Finn, a deserter stormtrooper with an exciting arc set up for him. These characters are backed by good performances - actors are clearly passionate about being in Star Wars and do their best when the script challenges them.\nHowever, the main feature of any movie, the story, is disappointingly weak. Despite some very interesting setups which leave you hanging on for more by the end, it requires investment into the next installments which may (or may not...) satisfy.\nIt's essentially a retelling of A New Hope, but arguably deals with these same story beats worse. This also means it does not take risks, something that The Last Jedi takes in the extreme opposite direction. It drip feeds interesting plot points and ideas but does not deliver by the end, leaving viewers wanting for the sequel. This could be seen as a good or bad thing...Although with the benefit of hindsight I would say these setups do not deliver, sullying a lot of the experience of The Force Awakens for viewers coming back after the conclusion of the sequel trilogy. \nThe basic but timeless story however is why it is so rewatchable and digestible, held together by good action and performances. \nThis film is decent as a Star Wars sequel, and middling as a standalone movie. 3/5.",

            "content": "The Force Awakens marks the first Star Wars film produced after the franchise's acquisition by Disney, and it served as a highly anticipated return to the galaxy far, far away. The film's director, J.J. Abrams, had big shoes to fill, and overall, he did a commendable job of bringing the Star Wars universe back to life.\n\nOne of the most positive aspects of The Force Awakens was its cast. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac all gave compelling performances as new characters Rey, Finn, and Poe, respectively. Harrison Ford's reprisal of Han Solo was also a highlight, bringing a welcome dose of nostalgia to the film. The chemistry between the actors was believable and helped to drive the story forward.\n\nThe film's cinematography was also impressive, with lush landscapes and detailed spacecraft designs. The action scenes were well-choreographed and visually stunning, making for an exciting viewing experience. Additionally, the film's use of practical effects over CGI was a welcome return to the techniques used in the original trilogy.\n\nHowever, one criticism of the film is that its plot felt overly familiar, following a similar structure to the original Star Wars film. The villain, Kylo Ren, felt like a copy of Darth Vader, with a similar costume design and an obsession with the dark side. The film's reliance on nostalgia also made it feel at times like a retread of previous films rather than a fresh take on the Star Wars universe.\n\nAnother issue with The Force Awakens was its pacing. The film had a lot of ground to cover in introducing new characters and setting up a new story, and at times it felt rushed. This made it difficult to fully invest in the story and the characters.\n\nOverall, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an enjoyable addition to the Star Wars franchise. While it may not have taken many risks in terms of its plot and character development, it still provided a thrilling action-packed adventure with a great cast and impressive visuals.",

            "content": "One of the year's most hyped films, a culmination of millions in marketing, and a very loyal fan base promised to bring record crowds to cinemas this December to see Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens.  With director J.J. Abrams at the helm of the first of the new trilogy, as a fan himself, he decided to take things back to Star Wars' roots.  While most love the film, and critic and audience reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, some tout the film as a redundant and uninspired rehash of the original 1977 film.  I can understand this opinion of the film with the same basic story arc and a larger, more lethal version of the death star. But, I never really went into the film expecting anything different.  This is a continuation of the series as a whole and a way to bring back long time fans, as well as create new ones for today's generation. What better way to do that then go back to its roots but have the technology to better portray the more fantasy elements.  Luckily, it didn't go too C.G.I. crazy and come off plastic and fake looking like most of the environments in the prequel films. Instead, we find a perfect balance of old and new!\n     I can very easily say I liked the film significantly better than any of the prequels (and even better than Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi, but not quite up to original Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope. And, it doesn't touch the perfection of Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back.)  Overall, this most recent Star Wars is a wonderful marriage of the two previous trilogies, a wonderful introduction for new Star Wars fans, as well as fans of the original trilogy, too.  I really enjoyed seeing the original characters again after not seeing them in their respective roles since 1983. I also loved the new characters and their interactions with the original characters and the Star Wars universe in general.  Both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do a good job in their new character roles and they look like they are having a blast, too!  Seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo with Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill was all quite nostalgic and it garnered a ton of audience applause too!\n     Is the setup a bold new and original script? No. But, it's a damn good film nonetheless - exactly what I wanted and more!  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, even for a moment, and that is something rare with today's films. It had enough heart and comedic sprinkling to make it more human and approachable for today's audience.  I was captivated from start to finish and that is what a big blockbuster like this should do. J.J. Abrams pulled it off wonderfully.  While he isn't directing the next two films in the trilogy, he is still producing, involved, and most importantly, excited as a fan himself for future installments!",

If this was a stand alone movie it would be a All Time Classic no question. But because it is a Sequel and part of a franchise I has to be judged on different merits. A Sci-Fi, 2010's, Adventure Classic. It's lack of originality is what holds it back from being an All Time Classic.",

The action is well done. The story is more than passable. It is essentially a mirror image, soft reboot of A New Hope. Though I don't think that's great, I think it does work well, and brings some familiarity as a way to jump back in. I would have been fine with it if what proceeded was better. So I see this as a middle of the road entry, not great, not terrible.\n7/10",

In order to tell these new stories fully they would have to sandwich movies in the middle of Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens, but of course they don't need to do that (though the Mandalorian has now done a little bit there, sort of), allowing our own imagination to fill in the gaps, with a few hints, in much the same way fans, casual or otherwise, did upon first watching the original trilogy way back when, as indeed this movie does too. So, I would like to suggest that the prequels are now redundant. Having just watched the original trilogy, though annoyingly with all the extra gumph George Lucas tacked on to it for DVD and Bluray, the Force Awakens feels as though it really does belong, and works very well as a story occurring 30 years later. Much of that is attributed to the way this movie was filmed, using a lot of practical effects, as opposed to relying entirely on CGI. There was something that really did disappoint me when I first watched it, leaving me quite shocked, a character's general absence, however in retrospect, later, I was able to appreciate all other aspects of the movie, character development, story progression, etc, and began to question if I really needed what I thought I was going to, and wanted to see.",

            "content": "Disney revives Star Wars to charm new audiences with a story that's all too familiar.\n\nDirector J.J. Abrams (Super 8) directs his sci-fi adventure Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) with a heartfelt love of Star Wars. His visual style captures the grandeur of Star Wars' scope and the splendor of the wide shot vistas and earnest character driven story. Cinematographer Dan Mindel recaptures that old magic in his stunning ultra wide shots like Rey on her speeder blazing across the deserts of Jakku in search of antiques in ruins and purpose in life. The use of red and blue lighting for the Han and Kylo scene is quite beautiful. The Force Awakens happily uses many lovely close-up shots of Daisy Ridley's expressive face. There's some awkward fast zooms and a cluster of indecipherable action sequences, but The Millennium Falcon's evasive flight and Rey versus Kylo's lightsaber duel are brilliantly shot.\n\nAbrams was surprisingly apt for directing Disney's Star Wars sequel opener, but he clearly should have been given the entire trilogy, so that he could create a coherent story across these movies. Producer Kathleen Kennedy made the baffling decision to have Abrams direct the first and third movies, while Rian Johnson directed the second, destroying any narrative structure or coherence across these pictures. Abrams loves the practical sets and puppets with the mystique of The Force. He revitalized Star Wars' magical aura for an entire new generation of children to enjoy. I could not help but smile during The Force Awakens movie theater showing I went to with all the little girls that were so excited to see themselves represented with Rey as a Star Wars heroine. I had a blast getting to know Rey and feeling like Star Wars was back.\n\nHowever, writers Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndt, and J.J. Abrams himself basically ripped off A New Hope in trying to introduce Star Wars as a series for new viewers. I just feel hollow knowing Disney wasted their chance to center The Force Awakens' story around Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo training new Jedi and rebel fighters. Carrie Fisher is dead now, sadly. So we'll never get a better farewell or epilogue for her like Leia becoming a Jedi as trained by Luke, instead of a boring armchair general for this supposed rebellion. Why is Han Solo still a smuggler instead of a universally beloved hero like Luke should have been rather than a disappeared Jedi Master in hiding. People would know that Luke, Leia, and Han saved everyone before, surely?  Instead, this story does feel like an imitation of A New Hope from another Death Star, Darth Vader, and Empire figures. I really think The Force Awakens has endearing characters, exciting action, thoughtful character moments, intense lightsaber duels, and funny jokes. \n\nI just wish Rey was confirmed in The Force Awakens to be Luke's daughter or even Obi-Wan Kenobi because things get derailed so hard after The Force Awakens. Rey's parents did not need to be a mystery. Many things make no sense like how could The Empire return as The First Order with what funding? They have so many supporters, Storm Troopers, even a planet sized Death Star out of nowhere after the universe's balance was restored. It feels like they unwittingly undo Return of the Jedi's conclusion. Why are the good guys rebels instead of The First Order being smaller like just Snoke, Kylo Ren, The Knights of Ren, and a smaller army that are resisting the new government? Having the heroes be rebels for the sake of being rebels like in A New Hope is absurd after they already won and changed the galaxy. I really enjoyed The Force Awakens, but it ends up copying A New Hope pointlessly, instead of being brave and trying something new for Rey and her companions.\n\nHarrison Ford is just a grumpy old man who doesn't want to be there. His Han Solo gets some nice emotional moments, but Ford looks dead from the neck up already at times. Mark Hamill is absent until the end in an absurdly dumb choice given he could have raised or trained Rey instead of using a legend of cinema like Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker to get people into movie theater seats. He's all I wanted to see and I ended up liking Rey a lot instead. Carrie Fisher is nice to see as Princess Leia, but she's just a dull General Leia here with nothing to do or say other than a quick reflective scene seeing Han Solo again. Fisher is just not as fierce or charming as Leia in The Force Awakens, but I'm glad she was there. Adam Driver is great as an evil scoundrel Sith wannabe named Kylo Ren. His scene with Han Solo is memorable, but I most liked when he was actually scary intimidating Rey in the torture sequences.\n\nDaisy Ridley is lovely, endearing, and charming as Rey. I found her staff and lightsaber fights enthralling and her sweet sense of humor very playful. Ridley sounds so much like Keira Knightley in The Force Awakens. I guess Abrams wanted a new Padme, but as a Jedi. She did not need to be a great pilot or blaster shot. Rey could have been a natural lightsaber duellist and moral heroine with a pleasant personality. Unfortunately, after The Force Awakens, Daisy Ridley is wasted on a lackluster story for Rey. She is delightful here in every scene.\n\nJohn Boyega is gripping, then annoying as a deserting Stormtrooper now going by Finn. He could have been a cool Jedi with that blue lightsaber or a fascinating portrayal of a Stormtrooper scarred by war. Instead he's a fakeout romantic interest and raving comedy relief like Poe. Oscar Isaac is charming and likable as Poe, but he gets very little to do or say. He's basically a comedy relief.\n\nLupita Nyong'o is wasted as Maz with hideous CGI instead of what could have been a cute wise puppet similar to Yoda. Nyong'o is a brilliant actress, so Disney really could not just put some make-up on Lupita? Andy Serkis sounds creepy as Supreme Leader Snoke, but does nothing and looks so bad with terribly dated CGI. Domhnall Gleeson is intimidating as General Hux with his terrifying space Nazi speech in front of The First Order's Stormtroopers. Too bad he's wasted overall with nothing to do but look smarmy. Anthony Daniels gets a couple of cute lines as C-3PO. Max von Sydow gets only a brief cameo when he should have played Snoke in a neat alien outfit instead of a random rebel informant.\n\nPeter Mayhew gets a few nice moments as Chewbacca, but he's ultimately wasted. Gwendoline Christie does nothing as Captain Phasma. She exists to sell chrome Stormtrooper action figures and costumes. Simon Pegg plays the ugly merchant that gives Rey food rations in exchange for old antiques of value. He should have been a full puppet instead of ugly CGI for no reason. Ken Leung and Iko Uwais have funny cameos as space pirates. Michael Giacchino is Rogue One's composer and he cameos here as a Stormtrooper near Finn. Billie Lourd cameos as a rebel on the same base as her mother Carrie Fisher. Daniel Craig's Storm Trooper cameo is hilarious when Rey uses her Jedi Mind Trick. Bill Hader is a funny voice actor for Rey's adorable rolling droid BB-8.\n\nEditors Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey speed us through a new Star Wars adventure with a fast pace and an older feel. The Force Awakens is a long 136 minutes as the new Death Star finale fight with the rebels goes on way too long. Rick Carter and Darren Gilford's practical sets are cool with a gritty realism present in their ruined junkyard buildings and make-shift homes. All the numerous art directors illustrated where Star Wars could go visually from vast deserts to deep space and beyond. Lee Sandales' set decoration gives Rey's hollowed out AT-AT home all manner of knick-knacks that she's picked up along the way.\n\nThe Force Awakens has either astoundingly gorgeous visual effects like the ruins of the AT-AT or the forests Rey faces Kylo in the end or horrible CGI. Snoke and Maz look awfully cheap, ugly, and fake. I like how the starships look in flight, but they do get clustered together in the midst of battles into a blur you can barely follow. The lightsabers and blasters look incredible, but The First Order's new Death Star destroying planets looked cheap and you don't even care because we've gotten no time with these other planets. \n\nComposer John Williams writes a lovely score for Rey that sounds curious and romantic in tone. He never lost his musical touch and The Force Awakens sounds riveting with fearsome First Order thudding themes to that brilliant gentle Rey theme. The sound designers went wild with the loud throbbing blaster bolt stopped in midair by Kylo to his surging lightsaber noises. The lightsabers whirring by each others' heads are stellar. They get too nonchalant with The Wilhelm Screams everywhere though. Make-up artists Amanda Knight, Bill Corso, and Amy Byrne give Rey a lovely natural look for Daisy Ridley.\n\nIn all, The Force Awakens remains genuinely fun, if far too familiar a narrative compared to A New Hope.",

The acting is generally good, the original cast is fun to see again (although they don't do anything that interesting). Having our hero defeat the big bad in the first film, is a huge mistake. Kylo Ren loses much of his mystique and intimidating presence because of this. Rey's inexplicable talents & abilities without any training or character building is a poor setup for a trilogy where we are meant to be invested in the hero's struggle. It's hard to feel any sense of danger or stakes when the main character was able to destroy the main villain without reason or explanation.

This film is very fun and is essentially a rehash of the original star wars. Abrams takes the fundamental aspects of New Hope and repackages them for a new generation. Is not always a good thing since the film can sometimes feel like a reboot instead of a sequel. In here Daisy Ridley plays a girl named Rey who's been orphaned in a desert planet and joins the Resistance in their fight against the First Order, the successors to the Empire. Ridley does great as Rey giving her humanity and charm and we want to find out more about her. John Boyega as Finn has tremendous chemistry with Oscar Isaacs Poe but is really Adam Drivers as villain Kylo Ren who's the best here. His character is a young adult who's still feels like a teenager filled with rage and hatred. He is evil but we end up liking him not just for his beauty and driver is a phenomal actor exuding presence on the screen. The return of Harrison Ford as Han Solo is great and in many ways he carries the film with his snarkiness and charisma. In the end is a fun installment in the franchise although not very inventive or original.",

There were more than a couple moments of sheer glee for Star Wars fans in this, including the Millennium Falcon reveal (the entire theater cheered; I literally had tears in my eyes). I wasn't sure there could be a droid more lovable than R2D2, but BB-8 just might be. The pacing is often as frantic as the original, and dialogue as sparse, but it works. All of the new heroes are well cast and likable (Jon Boyega is very reminiscent of Luke in A New Hope.., young, inexperienced and in over his head, Daisy Ridley is likable in her ordinariness and toughness, Isaac is a solid big brother / Han Solo type) and Adam Driver really does make the film as a conflicted and intriguing villain (all of the nuance and subtlety that was missing from the prequels).",

            "content": "Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.\n\nDespite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.\n\n'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.\n\nWhile it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).\n\nThe story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.\n\nCould the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.\n\nVisually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.\n\nActing also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.\n\nIn conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Most of the characters were done quite well, I think the relationship between Poe and Finn was great, Rey and Finn also pretty good. Han and Rey was a little short and not the best. BB8 was a fun little character too.\n\nMain short fallings in this movie were the villain Kylo Ren and the main Heroine Rey.\n\nKylo started the movie as an awesome looking enigmatic character similar to how Vader did in the original but then they revealed his identity. Then he just became an emotional wreck that got beaten by a not-even Jedi.\n\nRey seemed like Luke at first, a lot more enthusiastic about saving the universe which was a fresh change but then she just seemed too good at everything. She mastered every task first try and failed at nothing. She even beat a trained Jedi in single combat without a scratch. I understand that the force can help a lot but in the movie it didn't convey that well enough.\n\nPerhaps this movie would have been better as a stand-alone without any sequels because on its own the good parts outweighed the bad. No way near the best Starwars movie, prequels included but certainly no the worst, other sequels included.\n\nIf I were to recommend watching the Starwars franchise I would suggest all the prior movies and just this one for the sequel trilogy.

It's a fine movie but as a Star Wars fan, I cannot give this movie a 4 star rating.",

            "content": "I'm gonna be honest here. Star Wars: Episode VII was the only reason why I started watching Star Wars in the first place. Since it was so popular ($2 billion, seriously? I thought Star Wars wasn't a thing anymore!), I decided to take a look at the franchise and seeing how the original and prequel trilogies were, I was expecting this movie to also be somewhere across those lines. Turns out it is nothing like them. First of all, let's get the praises done with. The CGI is awesome. With that said, let's move on to the bad stuff.\n\nThe story begins with a Stormtrooper named Finn deciding not to kill innocent people. First of all, what's with these new age space movies and concern for innocent people's lives? It happened in Star Trek (also directed by JJ Abrams, I think I'm seeing a pattern here), it happened in The Expanse and now it's happening here also. Star Wars is meant to be about fighting and killing. Concern for innocent people is exactly the opposite of what we come to watch a Star Wars movie for. And to add insult to the injury, that concern doesn't even stay for very long. Immediately Finn proceeds to kill every single Stormtrooper and escape from there.\n\nAfter that there's Commander Po, and something something Finn wears his jacket. After some time the scene transitions to female Luke. Now I don't have any problem with a female Jedi, and I don't think anyone does for that matter. Ahsoka Tano was a good character. But when your character's entire personality is being female and having a plot armour because of it, then it goes a little too far. Especially considering a plot armour for being female comes when the character is actually very gorgeous because men normally have a thing for seeing hot girls fight, but Rey here has a very sister-like look. There's no way we would ever want her to win. Keep getting beaten, yes, but not win.\n\nSo anyway she teams up with BB-8, Po's droid and then they team up with Finn to find Po which they just happen to do so with some plot convenience. After that they join the resistance to fight the Empire led by Kylo Ren. He's literally the only likeable character in this entire movie (other than BB-8 probably because of the way he gave a thumbs-up with a lighter, it was very funny and cute). It's kinda sad that they ruined him in the next movie. Speaking of the next movie, they also ruined the part where Luke and Rey meet each other. I was expecting it to be a very big moment. Of course I won't be cutting any points from this movie for it, but it's not like the sequel wasn't already planned. They had already planned to play with the audience's emotions like this.\n\nI can understand very well why there are so many people who hate the sequels. This movie looks like a complete rip-off of the original only making it worse in every aspect. Even I hate the fact that its poster does not look like a painting but rather a collage like every other Disney movie nowadays. I simply can't stand watching it again. Only the cool visuals were able to save it from being a train wreck that the next two movies turned out to be.",

My brother and I have watched this movie a few times at home when we are bored and need something to do so I understand the plot and ideas for this movie. The moving needs work on the originality. The plot is very much like the original trilogy, Rey the main character is an unlikely hero living on a barren planet, very similar to Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy.  Kylo Ren the antagonist has a resemblance to Darth Vader mostly in his suit and how he acts, these two characters are just like Luke and Vader, they have similar backstories, ideals, and goals; They lack any new depth. As the movie progresses Rey is approached by two fleeing characters, a rebel prisoner and a subordinate stormtrooper and together they make an unlikely team, much like Luke, Han Solo, and Leia Organa. Three different people working together to take out an empire. The next problem is the plot, the force awakens has a very similar plot to the original trilogy, a small ragtag band of rebels trying to take out the empire that wants to control the galaxy. Kylo Ren wants Rey to join him and rule the galaxy together. The First Order has a star killer base that is just a death star that is 10x bigger and covered in snow, but there is a weakness in its core and Rey, Finn, and Poe want to exploit it and save the day. Which they do and then they become heroes of the resistance. Also during this movie, Rey is searching for Luke Skywalker so he can train her in the ways of the force. This has a very similar feel when Luke is going to Dagoba to find Yoda so he can train as a Jedi after Obi-Wan Kenobi died on the first death star. If I could rate this movie I would give it a 3.5 because the movie was not terrible, the action was good, the characters are relatable. But on the other hand, the plot is unoriginal the characters are old characters tweaked a bit to look different. But there are lots of good parts of the movie, it is not all bad. There is a lot more to the movie that does make it unique.",

We get to know another new character named Rey, she didn't felt special in the first scenes, but the first moment I liked her was when she meets BB8 for the first time, a really sweet and fun moment. Going on to two other new characters Poe & Finn, Finn seems like a really good guy from the first moment he lifts his helmet, but I was not the biggest fan of the escape, because I think it was way too easy for two guys to just flee and it was also very unspectacular. When Rey & Finn meet for the first time I thought the conversation was very bad-written and felt cringy, but this time I liked their escape. A lovely moment when we saw Han and Chewie back. During the middle of the movie, the story was a bit flat and sometimes boring, almost typical Star Wars, part of it because the storytelling just randomly getting slower. The \"first-order\" speech was incredibly well acted and well done in general. It felt weird to see both Finn and Rey dealing with the lightsaber that easily, remembering how much Luke for example struggled back in the day when he first had a lightsaber, was not a fan of it. Nostalgia kicked real hard when we saw Han and Leia together one more time. Rey getting to know her powers and mind battling Kylo Ren was badass and helped me liking and respecting her character more. Kylo killing Han immediately shows how huge his character can become in this universe, a huge moment. But then the writing begins to annoy me. Why doesn't Kylo just make sure Finn is dead? Why is Rey equally and in the end a better fighter with the lightsaber than the trained Kylo? Such a lazy, dumb plot in my opinion. Although the fights in themselves were great. Even though R2D2 is not a real thing in this movie, he somehow is once again the MVP, how ironic. In the end, I absolutely loved the wide camera shot showing Rey and Luke standing across from each other. Solid movie, with some lazy writing mistakes and logical mistakes.",

Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are excellent additions, both give top performances - I will say I didn't sense major chemistry between the two, but I assume that'll come soon enough.

Either way, it's cool seeing them back in the franchise.\n\nEverything else about the film satisfied me, I'm not saying it's perfect - esp. the plot - but I found it perfectly fun to watch.

And I love the new characters. Rey is a likable and charismatic protagonist. She's a scavanger on a desert planet, waiting for her parents to return. Kylo Ren is the \"new Darth Vader\" and I find him interesting. He worships Darth Vader and he's young, angry and brash. The way he stops a blaster shot is cool as hell. His red lightsaber is also unique. Finn is another interesting character. What's special about him is that he's initially a \"bad\" guy. He's a stormtrooper, but he defects and joins the good guys. And there are certain moments when his knowledge about the New Order comes in handy, so I thought that was very cool. The story itself is great. As I said earlier, it's similar to the story of A New Hope and I don't mind that. The big twist is that Kylo Ren kills his own father, Han Solo.\n\nI'm a Star Wars fan and I enjoyed The Force Awakens. It's what I expected.

This movie i think sets up some plot points to be explored in the future movies but, I don't think there's a plan in motion yet. If you're a Star Wars fan who hated the prequels maybe this could be the start of a truly good series that makes you re-fall in love with it. If you're a prequel fan it mag be the same.

A better writing team would have been able to tell a much more original story. \n2) Another consequence of resetting the galaxy is that it set up our favourite characters from the original trilogy to be miserable failures, which is depressing. Given that many fans watch Star Wars for escapism and fun, turning fan favourites into failures was a terrible creative decision.\n3) Unfired Chekhov's guns. This film set up so many mysteries that were never fully answered by the sequel trilogy. How did the galaxy react to the First Order's destruction of the Hosnian system? Why did Luke leave a treasure map so that he could be found? Why did Rey experience visions when she held Anakin's lightsaber? How was the lightsaber found? Where did the first order get the manpower and resources to build it's fleet and Starkiller base? Why did Finn suddenly \"awaken\" from being a Stormtrooper? Was Finn force sensitive? How did Rey beat Kylo Ren when she had no Jedi training? How much of the galaxy did the First Order control, and why was the Resistance to the First Order so small?

            "content": "Rebooting the Star Wars franchise was a very difficult task. The Star Wars franchise has a long history with many movies, film theories, controversies, and a very loyal fanbase (which I am an active member of); Star Wars has been around since the 1970s so this is not at all shocking. Because of this long and complicated history, as well as a mega fan base to impress, Abrams had his work cut out for him when he took on The Force Awakens; he did not disappoint.\n\nOne of the reasons The Force Awakens is so successful is its use of special effects. Abrams and the production team went back to Star Wars' original roots of hand built sets, special effects makeup, models, and animatronics. It is these fabricated elements that made the original Star Wars trilogy feel so real and tangible. The special effects used in the original trilogy made the impossible world of Star Wars feel grounded in reality. We feel we know the characters of this world and that they exist in real places. R2-D2 and C-3PO for example, are full of life because they were crafted from hand and brought to life by the actions of real people. The ships in Star Wars were hand-built models and props that the actors could physically interact with. Matte paintings and moveable models created believable and fantastical environments. This use of fabrication is the main reason the special effects of the original Star Wars trilogy holds up to this day. \n\nWith today's advancements in CGI it would have been easy to rely on CGI for the creation of this movie; the computer graphics would have looked a lot better than the prequels too. But the creators of The Force Awakens took the time to hand build sets and fabricate characters through animatronics and costume, which made all the difference. The scene where our main characters venture into Maz's Cantina is a great example of this. This scene is filled with a mix of both fabricated and CGI characters; very similar to Mos Eisley Cantina from A New Hope. This is why The Force Awakens is so successful. The movie sends us back to the nostalgic days of Star Wars, and we are able to connect once again to the characters and places of Star Wars through its materiality. Of course, there is a lot of CGI involved in making the film as well, but it is artfully intermingled with special effects makeup, fabricated creatures, and sets; a wonderful blend of old and new. \n\nThe Force Awakens would not have been able to hold its own in the Star Wars franchise without the original movie scores of John Williams. The special effects of the original trilogy made Star Wars believable visually, but the music of John Williams made us believe the stories emotionally. John Williams brought the world of Star Wars fully to life. We know the characters of star wars through their musical motifs as much as we do their costumes and mannerisms. These musical motifs are what helps us identify these characters and further connect with them. When I think of Luke Skywalker I can't help but think of \"Binary Sunset,\" or The Imperial March when Vader comes to mind. Williams made a whole new soundtrack for The Force Awakens and these powerful scores bring the characters and world of this movie to life. Rey's Theme in The Force Awakens is extremely well done, and lets us know much that we need to know about her character; she's lost, but strong and hopeful. \n\nOverall, it is JJ's reverence for, and acknowledgment of the original Star Wars films that made The Force Awakens a successful movie. Long-time Star Wars fans can enjoy it for nostalgia and story building, and newcomers can become enamored by the wonderous world of Star Wars. The Force Awakens is a great jumping off point for this new era of Star Wars films.",

Rey is almost immediately very good with the force so she's probably been using it her whole life. Luke has disappeared but has left a map behind to find him. The galaxy doesn't even remember the Jedi or the things that happened in the original trilogy!\nIt could be better but it could also be a lot worse.

What's so bad about them that they're blowing up planets? It's never explained. Rey is cool and a good sword fighter and has a good hair style. Overall a good movie but I would have liked more explanations for the stuff that was going on. Also I thought the whole time that Kylo Ren was secretly Rey's dad, which made some of the movie pretty weird. Then later you find out her parents were just nobodies.

I enjoyed the crap out of watching this movie. The editing was also fantastic. The only things that bothered me with this movie were some semi-cringey lines and other lines that should have been re-shot.

In my view, it was such a missed opportunity to take the story in new directions with the New Republic in power. The struggle throughout the original trilogy was to defeat the Empire and restore the Republic. But here in this movie, it's just rebels vs. Empire all over again, which makes it like the victory at the end of Return of the Jedi is completely irrelevant. People blame The Last Jedi for ruining the sequel trilogy, but I blame this movie. With this movie, JJ Abrams set up the trilogy to erase the 6-film arc and just be a retread of the original trilogy. He's a good director but a terrible storyteller. Disney should have just adapted the Thrawn book trilogy with JJ Abrams or Rian Johnson  as director.  Also, Rey is a Mary Sue, but that's not the biggest issue with the movie (at least Daisy Ridley gives a good performance).",

And that there isn't much else to say except – it is a GOOD film.\nYou will occasionally hear people whinge on about how this film sucks, and so I think it's my duty and right, as an all-inclusive Star Wars fanatic (except Rebels …… go away Rebels) to tell them to shoosh.\nActually. You know what? Let them whinge. Let them get sh***ed off over Disney's redoing of the original trilogy. See if I care.\nI mean, hey, let's get this straight — there's nothing WORTH complaining about other than the fact that it's a slight copy cat of the OT. And that's exactly what I'm here to talk about.\nThere is NOOOO denying that a couple of scenes from TFA replicate that of aforementioned trilogy. In fact, I've made a LIST of them (elsewhere).\nBut can I say that stepping out from under the shadow of George Lucas' baby (or should I say, giant), to produce something to please \"everyone\" using $300 billion, WITHOUT hesitating is no easy feat.\nAnd by hesitating I mean incorporating a truckload of nostalgic elements, giving the nod to scenes, themes and lines we all know and love and just generally doing fan service (something TRoS took too much advantage of).\nDo I think it's uncreative for J.J. to resort to the old stuff? Well it's a creative DECISION, so technically NO … but yes.\nAnd if seeing a lightsaber being extracted from the snow doesn't piss you off too much, I say you either: shurrup and embrace it OR go into exile on Anch-To.\n\n😤\n\nVerdict: Good.

            "content": "When I first saw this movie, I loved it. But I feel as if the rest of the sequel trilogy has made TFA worse. The plot threads either were cast aside or answered in an unsatisfactory manner. I remember seeing this movie in theaters, and I loved all the new characters like Finn and Rey and Kylo Ren. I was so exited to watch them develop. But unfortunately, they barely did over the next two movies and that makes this feel worse. I really liked Rey and Finn’s friendship in this movie and it was tossed aside in TLJ and not as prominent in TROS. My biggest problem with this movie was the lack of originality. Everybody says it’s a copy of ANH — they are all correct. I won’t list all the similarities, but the original Star Wars did it better. When I watched this movie and there was another Death Star (Starkiller Base) I thought to myself “Come on! Another? After the first two Death Stars blew up?” However, I could overlook this and enjoy the movie for what it was. When Finn and Rey fought Kylo Ren in the snow, the first time I saw it I was excited. I thought it was so cool how when Finn was defeated Rey came in and fought Kylo. I thought it was so cool. Now, though, I am irritated. Kylo sliced Finn with his lightsaber in the back and Finn only got a scratch. Rey got Kylo in the face and he only got a scratch. That’s not how lightsabers work! They’re deadly weapons that cut people in half, and the fact that Rey/Finn didn’t hurt themselves with a lightsaber when they had no training is ridiculous. Finn probably should’ve at least been paralyzed from Kylo slicing him but he wasn’t. I have other questions. How was the First Order able to afford to build everything? How did Maz get the lightsaber? Why did the lightsaber give Rey visions? Why did Leia hug Rey instead of Chewie, who she actually knows? Why did Rey beat Kylo with no training? Just because she’s a Palpatine doesn’t give her a pass; just because you’re related to someone who was good with lightsabers doesn’t mean you’ll be. There is also a lot of coincidences in this movie like a force sensitive girl finding the droid with important information and running into a former stormtrooper who happens to have Poe’s jacket, and they happen to escape on the Millennium Falcon, and that happens to be found by none other than Han Solo. I think the problem with sequels, just in general, is that they ruin the happy endings that the series originally had. Anakin killed Palpatine and fulfilled his destiny, and Luke redeemed his father. The rebels won... but now it feels like everything they did was POINTLESS. Whenever I look at something that is Star Wars, I think about how all their hard work was pointless. Almost all of the OT characters die, like Han Solo did in this movie. So why did they make this?... oh, money. I don’t think this movie was bad. It was quite enjoyable. But I couldn’t give it five stars because of the reasons I stated above. The thing is, we want to wonder about what happened to our favorite characters after ROTJ, not see them all die... like Han Solo died in this one :(",

If you were expecting the writers to develop a new radical plot for our new band of heroes to conquer, then you'll be sorely disappointed. Overall, great cinematography, score, and acting, but lacks in creativity and plausibility.",

Instead of the Empire you have The First Order. Instead of the Rebellion it's the Resistance. A skinny mini-me Darth Vader who looks like a hipster and guess what a bigger Death Star to destroy!!!

            "content": "Having seen the rest of the mess of a trilogy, I decided to revisit this film, which I enjoyed, although found flawed when it first came out. I conclude that this movie has not aged well even in less than 5 years, and bares the roots of what hurt the overall trilogy. Much has been made of the unoriginality, but it goes deeper than that. First off, this movie is very short. At just 2 hours and 15 minutes long it is the shortest of the last five SW films, and is much closer in length to a film like Spider Man Homecoming than most SW films, let alone films like Infinity War or Endgame. It is unusual to do this when you are planning to in just 3 films try to reintroduce OT character, introduce new characters, create a new overarching threat for the trilogy and supposedly provide closure for the whole episodic SW saga, a feat more analogous to event movies like IW/Endgame than like a random MCU installment. But I think this could've been overcome with the right direction. But instead, JJ seemed to lean into this, with a frenetic pace that didn't allow supposed emotional moments like Finn's admission to Rey to hit and led to weird moments like Leia comforting Rey when Han died though she barely knew Rey and Rey hardly knew Han. A few more scenes of bonding between these characters would've helped this, but instead, events seemed to just go along because they wanted Finn and Rey to be certain characters in future movies (Other examples are Rey volunteering to go on a mission to find Luke in a distant place when she was supposedly committed to waiting for her parents on Jakuu, something TLJ tried to rectify but ROS screwed back up, as well as Finn giving one liners when he has just escaped from his tragic and complex background). Compare this to the moments of slowness and character development such as the bond between Luke and Obi Wan in ANH. Another issue is the forced fan service, with moments like Han finding the Falcon feeling a lot less awesome and more like plot convenience (again to fit the speedy pace) outside of the environment of a packed theater in late 2015. Finally, the biggest issue I'd say is the central conflict of the movie. I said I'd stay away from criticizing the movie's originality and I tried to be ok with the similarities through much of the movie. But on both viewings, one copy bothered me and that was the Starkiller Base. Not only was this unoriginal but it didn't fit within the narrative of the film itself. The Death Star works in ANH because it is introduced from the start, in the opening crawl. TFA however presents itself at the beginning to be about this Resistance, backed by the Republic, being in a race with the First Order to find out about Luke's whereabouts. Then, what is presented as a bigger, badder Death Star is presented without warning, over halfway into (again an already short) movie, killing one of those organizations, the Republic without it having been relevant to the plot at all. The plot that was presented about Luke is resolved randomly at the very end, with no explanation given (R2D2 is just suddenly awake with what they need to find him). Changing the main conflict of the film halfway through is just bad writing, and seems to be done just because of laziness/fan service. It doesn't even work as a surprise, because it's a reused idea in a film where we have already seen reused ideas play out in the same way. This is all too bad, because it detracts from what is a well acted and visually stunning film. In conclusion, I would say TFA fails not just because it is a remake of ANH, but also because it is a poor one.",

You start with this world, and then you build a story that flows organically from the events in that world.\n\nThe prequels fundamentally showed a different status quo, instead of the Jedi being these hermits, we were in a different part of their history, here they were interwoven with politics, they were basically public servants. Instead of a empire ruled by a galactic dictator you had this horrible inefficient republic that had basically grown too bloated with politics and technicalities to function. These changes are clearly shown, we see life as it is throughout these movies, which helps us place and understand the characters in the world.\n\nBut the force awakens didn't do this. The galaxy in TFA is fundamentally the same as the one in the OT, which is absolutely disastrous since that tells us that the actions of our heroes of the OT didn't matter, it all becomes meaningless. If Luke has also become a random hermit, then all our fantasies about lukes life fall to pieces, his life was wasted. If the last order is around building death stars then none of it really mattered. \n\nSure, it's somewhat stated that there is a new republic or something, but it gets blown up immediately, we don't see this new world and how it slowly falls apart, we are still just a bunch of rebels in space....none of it mattered. \n\nCompare this to the mandalorian, which is all about showing the galaxy living and reacting to the fall of the empire, it's 100% driven by worldbuilding and stage setting.\n\nTFA took the most famous heroes, broke up the most famous couple, never showed the three on screen together (WTF!), and then killed one of the three to prevent anyone from fixing this mess. This is such a fundamentally poor decision that it boggles my mind, present this in film class and you'd get kicked from the university. Who in their right mind would take the most famous trio in movie history, one that people have been waiting to see together again for FORTY YEARS, and then NOT have them share a scene?...\n\nIt's been 40 years, Disney should have spend the necessary time to set up the world, show what Luke has done, create a new Jedi order that has learned from the past and stays away from politics, we should see Han and Leia be a family, we should see the fruits of their labors and cry as it all falls apart over the course of a three movies, and cheer at the slow passing of the torch to a new set of heroes. Instead, TFA skipped all that and went straight to the new heroes that no one cared about. And because we didn't take the time to acclimatize to the old heroes again there are no tears when they sacrifice themselves, and since the movies didn't take the time for us to get to know the new heroes we can't cheer for them when they become the heroes.\n\nTFA killed star wars, it just took three movies to bleed out.",

            "content": "You know, star wars seems like such an easy franchise to win with. I've only seen the first two newest movies and they were aimless. It was fully obvious that they were making this up as they went along. They should have had a solid writer and paid him or her their weight in gold for a complete trilogy. It would have been great cinema. My problem with the the force awakens: Rae's character was underdeveloped and did not make the audience relate to her. Finn's character was underdeveloped and did not make the audience feel for him. Ren's character should have showed an ascension to power to lead the empire instead of already being in a power position. Rae's character could not have been as naturally skilled as she was with a light saber and instead should have been gifted in force power, surprising Ren somehow and escaping star killer base. Mas kanata, why? The other question about mas kanata, why why why? My problem with the second installment, the last jedi: everything. Mainly, I had an issue with the fact that Luke skywalker was not a G. Being a jedi for all of the years, luke should have been cutting war machines to pieces and force throwing stormtroopers through walls with ease. But what do we see as Luke skywalkers top skill? A force projection that cost him his life. It reminded me of the time Daffy duck wanted to show the best magic trick and blew himself up turning into a ghost to a thunderous round of applause, but instead of applause, exponentially more people let out a collective grown and wanted their money back. Even Mark Hamill admitted he read the script trying to see how Luke matured and wondered, \"who is this guy?\" In regards to Luke's character arc. Then there were other problems: The space chase? The battle on the salt plains? While george Lucas seemed to have some type of logic with the war settings in the first three films, this trilogy seemed to simply regard settings as cool looking places to film battles. After watching the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, I knew I would not be paying for movie tickets for the third. I'll catch the latest installment on redbox.",

I thought this was a successful \"reboot\" of the SW franchise in that it felt more like the original trilogy than any of those crappy prequels.  (Man, those prequels suck!!!)  In my opinion, a familiar plot and a bunch of familiar--albeit much older--faces is exactly what was needed to rekindle the spark and get real SW fans excited again.  Believe it or not, after seeing this movie, I had brief hopes that the SW franchise was in good hands, and that Disney would be churning out great SW films for many years to come.  Alas, it was not meant to be as every SW film since \"The Force Awakens\" has been inferior, reaching absolute rock bottom with \"The Last Jedi\" which was a DELIBERATE slap in the face to SW fans everywhere.  (Rian Johnson is a complete idiot.)  It looks like \"The Force Awakens\" will live on forever as my fourth favorite SW movie after the original trilogy...",

I thought Episode VII was a good blend of nostalgia-blasts and character development for the many new faces added to the franchise. We got more insight into the First Order, or the Neo-Empire, with Finn's defection, and how the Resistance (the Neo-Rebels) has managed to stay cohesive, fully expecting the dark-side to rise once again. Of course, I wanted more light-saber battles, but I admittedly have an insatiable thirst for light-saber battles, so no points lost there. My biggest gripe this viewing was Rey's constant questioning if they Jedi, and Luke Skywalker, were ever real. It didn't make sense considering Kylo Ren trained to be a Jedi with Skywalker, a man who pretty much everyone assumes is alive, but hidden. I understand despotic regimes rewrite the past (I've read \"1984\"), but the Republic was very much in power during most of Rey's life, not the First Order, and the Star Wars Universe extends for galaxies, therefore making it unrealistic such a well-known figure would merely be wiped from history within one/two generations. Nevertheless, The Force Awakens is a fantastic start to the final trilogy of a beloved franchise.",
