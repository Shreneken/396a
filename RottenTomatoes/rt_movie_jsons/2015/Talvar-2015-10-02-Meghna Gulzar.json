There's a special biases towards the Talvar couple. But this is just a minor complaint in an otherwise moving, subtle, rich and grounded film that always does everything it can to not be exploitative. It has all the elements a truly thrilling film would need. There is heft and vulnerability here. Irrfan Khan and Neeraj Kabi as the CBI officer and Rajesh Talwar- respectively- are my favorite performances from the film. But there's absolutely no denying that even Konkona Sen Sharma is very striking as the poised character inspired by the Mama Talwar Nupur. \nDo watch 'Talvar'. It's a solid film and beyond that, a profoundly seamless example of a horror story of the modern times. If not anything else, watch it for it's unflinchingly emotional gaze and a realistic portrayal of media.",

Since I knew nothing about what happened in real life, I didn't know what to expect. The mystery element of the movie is handled well and all of the possible theories for the crime committed in the movie are explained. I also really liked Irrfan Khan's performance and thought his character was the best part of the movie. Even in the slower patches of the movie, every second he was on screen was great. I can't blame the movie for being based on an unsolved case, but because of that, I felt it lacked closure and it was a tad bit frustrating. However, in the movie's defense, I think that is how they want you to feel because it is showing a situation where true justice was missing. It's not the most pleasant movie out there, but it is a fascinating and intelligent movie that will certainly raise many questions.",

Maybe due to enough knowledge about the case (not that of  the police staff involved or their family) from which the movie is inspired. While it's a fictionalized version of real crime, it doesn't manipulate the significant facts of the case as far as the evidence and proof are concerned. Well, more than less. Seems like Tabu's character was created to show the emotional side of Irrfan's character and maybe some light moments. But it doesn't help the cause and it'd have been better off without it. While the performances are commendable, the portrayal of the police personnel is quite typical (not to be mistaken for unreal).\n\nOne time watch if you don't know about the Noida double murder case details already. A seemingly open and shut case (more so if you aren't interested to go into the details of the case & pass judgments based on unscrupulous assumptions) that's a hard one to crack. Much, if not full credit goes to the police force that mishandled the case by not following the essential procedures in its initial stage.

TALVAR achieves something rare. It is a medium trying to tell us through tinted glass the truth about the Aarushi murder case, which is not a whodunnit or a hazy murder case but a sorry incident or chapter in Indian criminal history, where the media, judiciary, CBI and police have botched a simple murder case and TALVAR does exactly that....expose the trappings and machinations of the state to destroy a family's life beyond repair.\nIrfan Khan is incredible as Ashwin Kumar, who actually is the first CBI officer Arun Kumar who solved the case. Meghna is perfect in her brevity to treat this subject matter with respect and sensitivity with no ounce of sensationalism pouring through it.\nEach and every moment in the movie is fact-based and completely authentic right till the last meeting between the two CBI teams, where Arun Kumar exposes the stupidity of the 2nd CBI team and their theories of wife-swapping, honor killing, golf club murder weapon mumbo jumbo.The black humour pervading the movie is just delectably delicious. \nIf you are Indian, this is a mandatory watch for two reasons:-\n1) Somehow protest in some form or another - to fast-track the appeal of the Talwars to get it heard in High Court so that they are set free for a crime they didn't commit.\n2) Pray to God that you do not fall into jeopardy ever with respect to the State machinery, because it will devour and swallow you whole.\nTo me - this weekend is a toast to TALVAR and no other movie. Hard-hitting, gritty and thought provoking. This is not a movie but a text book to understand what is horribly going wrong with our democracy, which is just a system which perverts truth and bends and breaks and smashes it to smithereens.\nWatch TALVAR - it's uncomfortable, its horrid, it's unflinching but thats the face of truth in India. Movies rarely move people but TALVAR is one such honest humble attempt to discern and distill the truth for a layman which should not be missed at any cost.\nFor many years it will survive as a piece of evidence and testimony which truly showed what happened that fateful night on Aarushi, while her parents were asleep in her adjoining bedroom.And for that we have to salute this piece of art or medium not just as a movie but a body of work, which transcends beyond just providing us entertainment but a catalyst to push and provoke the truth and bring it out in the open.\nThis is not a movie but much more!!!",

            "content": "4.5/5* or 9/10\n\nThe \"Arushi murder case\" has become a legendary story in India now, everyone you meet has there own theory, on who is the murder and why they did it. But as things stand today Arushi's parents rot in a jail cell for her murder. Like many others I have also used Wiki too look up the case details way before Talvar was made, so I went into the film thinking I know everything about the Arushi Murder.Well all I can say is that,\"you know nothing John Snow\" well jokes aside what I meant is that this film just blew my mind, with its new facts, its detailing, and almost complete unbiased approach. Rarely do you see hindi films that are made like Talvar, a investigation drama, that doesn't leave out any detail what so ever. Therefore by the end of the film we know everything about the case, and can make our own judgement. And I must say even though we knew what the films ending was,Talvar still has so many suspenseful and thrilling moments. However alot of things you see in the film leave you totally disgusted, especially the way cops handled the case but more on that later.\n\nStory wise the film is about the Arushi Murder case but the girls name is changed to Shruti in the film. The film deals with the double murder of 14 year old Arushi and her 50 year old servant Kempal, who was the first accused of the murder of Shruti until his body was found by the family a couple of days after Shruti's body was found. The film shows a detailed investigation of the murder case and how the local police first accused the parents of murder, but after there botched up rushed case is brought to the forefront the CDI (aka CBI) is brought in.CDI investigator Ashwini Kumar takes over the case and starts to unravel his own truth of how he thinks, two servants Rajpal and Kanniya murdered Shruti. His investigation makes up the crux of the plot.\n\nRarely do you see so many superb performances all in one film but Talvar is a great expectation. Irfan Khan is excellent.Neeraj Kabi and Konkana Sen Sharma are superb.Sohum Shah is great. Gajraj Rao and Sumit Gulati are hilarious. The films ensemble cast is just amazing, everyone acted brilliantly even the smallest actor.\n\nA film like Talvar gets me thinking that how can India have such, out right dumb, and stupid cops. For example in the Arushi case as shown in the film cops ruined the whole investigation, the didn't collect any forensic evidence, they let people trample all over the murder scene, and they rushed through the case and blamed the parents for honour killing(like come on seriously). Seriously I have only scratched the surface when it comes to the case atrocities, and the media deserves alot of blame too for the trial by media, and there sensualizing of every small detail. The CDI was also not be left behind with some dumb investigation of there own, and whats with the cops, and CID trying to look out for each others reputations etc in young girls murder trail. Have some heart no and give a fair judgement.\n\nBut all these misjudgements in real life made from the amazing stuff in the reel life in Talvar. I must add that the film has some amazing dark comedy too, i found myself lauging aloud many times. But works for the film foremost is the way the Director Meghna Gulzar gets into every detail of the case, and the way the investigation proceeding go on it feels like the audience is a part of the case. And by the end of the film you are not only forced to think, but you cringe thinking of the outcome of the parents. I must add though the film is a little biased towards the parents in the case, and thats the only negative.\n\nOverall rarely have I enjoyed myself as much as I have while I watching Talvar, its a film that challenged me while I watching it, and thats something I cherish in a great film.Therefore Talvar is a truly thought provoking film. And its easily one of the best hindi films of the year. Its just sad that the film might get a niche audience in India, because this film is a must watch,its some damn brilliant work that deserves global recognition.   \n\n4.5/5* or 9/10",

            "content": "What do you expect from a film directed by Meghna Gulzar (Filhaal), written by Vishal Bhardwaj (Maqbool, Kaminey, Haider) & starring power house talents such as Irrfan Khan & Konkona Sen Sharma among others, based on a double murder case which shook the whole country from its core. Well of course - Excellence! The real story - In 2008, Aarushi Talwar, 14, the daughter of middle class parents, was found dead in her Mumbai home with her throat slashed. Suspicion quickly fell upon the family's servant, a Nepali migrant named Hemraj, but when he was found dead the next day in a nearly identical slaying, all hell broke loose. This was only the beginning of an event that captivated the nation with more twists and turns than even the nuttiest that Bollywood could come up with. The 2008 murder of Aarushi Talwar and Hemraj Banjade and the subsequent investigations, of which the film is the fictionalized account, are complex, with multiple official points of view, compromised evidence, and of course breathless media accounts with unnamed sources, rumors and innuendo. The Noida double murder, as the case is familiarly known in India, has been the object of conjecture and speculation since day one, here Meghna Gulzar's film is the second attempt (Kay Kay Menon starrer Rahasya being the 1st) to tackle the material on the big screen, and trust me it's an explosive piece of work. The views on this case are polarized and often hardened, so how to make a movie about it? Vishal Bhardwaj and Meghna Gulzar took the time to scrupulously research the case, and present a Rashomon-like telling of the story with multiple viewpoints, allowing the viewer to conclude which case is most compelling. The best part about the film is it doesn't waste time in establishing a happy family before to show the loss. It gets straight to the point and starts from the morning Shruti's body is found. The script is water-tight so much so that we get engrossed in it right from the first frame. The intensity that is built quite early in the story stays intact after interval too. The ending is not at all abrupt. It goes with a number of intriguing questions that keep floating in mind even after leaving the theater. The story gets absorbed in your mind and heart and unknowingly or even if unwillingly it travels with you, stays with you and keeps haunting you and probing you with many questions. What if? Why that? How could it be? are the few questions that keep floating in your mind. It has been well written by Vishal Bhardwaj and the similar credit for screenplay too goes to Vishal. Of course, it is a film which shows the Talwar family's side of the case, throwing light on how they were implicated in the case but never ever does it falsely make you root for them. It also opens our eyes on the fact that things like Narco tests are conducted on the accused even though they are not admissible in court. So even if you manage to get a confession out of them, they are almost redundant. The film attempts to extensively showcase all sides of the double murders and does it exceedingly well. Issues like sensationalism in the media, long panel discussions on TV and incompetency of the police force are brought up in the film. Personally, I loved the chunks that showed how desensitized the police probably is because murder and crime scenes are this regular to them. It's also great testament to Gulzar's skills as a filmmaker that she manages to make the audience laugh ever so often, in the middle of a super intense sequence. Shruti, name changed for the film from Aarushi, was presumed to be an innocent, a victim of a crime of violence and passion from her repressed household servant. However, as soon as the police arrive to begin an investigation, reality and fiction begin to meld in discomforting ways. The story follows Ashwin Kumar (Irrfan Khan), a CDI (Central Department of Investigation) officer who has been handed the homicide case of teenage girl Shruti (Ayesha Parveen) & her help Hemraj, due to highly incompetent work, media pressure and the mockery the police made of itself. Based on the statements provided by Kanhaiya (Sumit Gulati), the police have already arrested Shruti's father Dr Ramesh Tondon (Neeraj Kabi) & accused her mother Nutan Tandon (Konkana Sen Sharma) of being an accomplice in the misdeed. Ashwin step-by-step gathers all evidence, while verifying each evidence scientifically in order to find the real culprits. The film is a remarkable achievement that works on a number of levels, both as a contemporary Indian movie in contrast with the mainstream market and as an experimental effort designed to question long-held assumptions of superiority and safety. Far from a traditional police procedural thriller, the film turns most of those conventions on their heads, along with the traditional Bollywood reverence for the police. In addition to that, there is also the splintered story line, multiple points of view, and stellar performances to consider. Some of the most remarkable directing takes place as Ashvin attempts to collate all of the different stories into a coherent series of events that makes sense and doesn't fall prey to the lies and liars attacking him from all sides. This gives us multiple gut-wrenching reenactments of the brutal crime through the testimony, both legitimate and coerced, of numerous participants and witnesses. It's not easy to watch, but it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the character and what he must suffer in order to reach his end goal. Vishal Bhardwaj has excellently written the screenplay of this movie. Full marks to him for converting this long, confusing and multi-angle case in just 132 minutes run time. This being a true story, the challenge is on the writer to deliver a screenplay that will keep the audience engaged and Vishal does it really well. Meghna Gulzar's direction could not have been any better. She excellently succeeds in re-showing the already known details of the murder investigation which ruled the news channels for multiple months. The incompetence of police and CDI, the mockery of investigation made by the media, the TRP hungry media and the emotions of parents are all excellently shown on screen by director Meghna. The flip-side is that the pace of the movie is slightly slow in the second half and has unwanted fillers that could have been completely avoided. (e.g multiple shots of loneliness of Irrfan, his story with Tabu, the frozen shots of the blind fold justice lady). Talking about the stellar cast in the movie, I have to say 'mind blowing'. Irrfan Khan does it again. It's so much fun to watch him on screen. He is sharp, intelligent, rude, sarcastic, angry and frustrated. He proves to be a very good choice for the role. Konkana Sen Sharma & Neeraj Kabi as parents are very good. While Konkana has few dialogues, Neeraj mostly emotes through his expressions, any attempt to add unnecessary dialogues would have ruined his character in the movie. Gajraj Rao has also acted well as the incompetent police officer. Other actors like Atul Kumar, Sumit Gulati and Prakash Belwadi also make their presence felt. Tabu is like able in a limited role. On the whole, 'Talwar' or Guilty (released in festivals under this name) is a gripping, infuriating, and at times a humorous film that reflects how politics, media and judiciary can change directions of the justice. It is a must watch movie, quite serious, intense and intriguing with no excessive and non-digestible masala or item numbers to please. Even if you have a whole lot to do this weekend, make a point to watch this film.",

Interesting story based on a true case, it gives two plausible scenarios with two plausible guilty parties and lets the viewer come to their own conclusion even though the justice system came to theirs. Taut, full of twists and turns, police incompetence and media frenzy it could have been set in any large American city as well as India.",
