            "content": "The Martian is a gripping and visually stunning science fiction film that takes audiences on an exhilarating journey of human resilience and exploration. Directed by the masterful Ridley Scott and based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, The Martian is a true cinematic masterpiece that captivates from start to finish.\n\nAt its core, The Martian is a story of survival and ingenuity against all odds. Matt Damon delivers a riveting performance as Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded on Mars after a daring mission gone wrong. Damon's portrayal of Watney is both inspiring and relatable, capturing the character's unwavering determination and resourcefulness in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. His portrayal of a man fighting for his life and using his scientific knowledge to survive in a hostile environment is truly compelling and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe film's visual effects are breathtaking, bringing the red planet to life with stunning detail and authenticity. From the vast, desolate landscapes of Mars to the high-tech interiors of the spacecraft and the NASA mission control, every frame is meticulously crafted to transport audiences into the world of space exploration. The attention to detail in the production design and visual effects is simply awe-inspiring, creating a sense of awe and wonder that stays with the audience long after the credits roll.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its scientifically accurate depiction of the challenges and possibilities of human exploration of Mars. The Martian is a celebration of human ingenuity and the power of science, showcasing how human intellect and determination can conquer seemingly impossible obstacles. The film deftly weaves in realistic science and engineering concepts, making the story feel grounded and plausible, while still being accessible to audiences of all backgrounds. It's a testament to the film's commitment to scientific accuracy and attention to detail that it has been lauded by NASA and the scientific community for its realistic portrayal of Mars exploration.\n\nIn addition to its gripping survival story and breathtaking visuals, The Martian also boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Kate Mara, and Jeff Daniels, among others. Each actor delivers a standout performance, adding depth and complexity to the story and making the characters feel fully realized and emotionally resonant. The chemistry between the characters, both on Mars and back on Earth, is palpable, adding an additional layer of tension and emotion to the film.\n\nThe Martian also shines in its pacing and screenplay. Drew Goddard's adaptation of Andy Weir's novel is masterful, expertly balancing moments of tension, humor, and heart. The film's screenplay is filled with witty and memorable dialogue that adds depth to the characters and keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. The pacing is perfectly calibrated, keeping the story moving at a brisk pace without sacrificing emotional beats or character development.\n\nFinally, the film's score by renowned composer Harry Gregson-Williams is a standout element, adding depth and emotion to the story. The sweeping and evocative music complements the film's visuals and elevates the emotional impact of key moments, drawing audiences even deeper into the story.\n\nThe Martian is a must-see film that transcends the science fiction genre. It is a cinematic tour de force that combines a riveting survival story, stunning visuals, scientifically accurate depictions of Mars exploration, and outstanding performances from a talented cast. Ridley Scott's masterful direction, Matt Damon's captivating performance, and the film's commitment to scientific accuracy make it a standout in the realm of science fiction cinema. The Martian is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the boundless possibilities of human exploration, and a true masterpiece that will leave audiences in awe.",

            "content": "Premiering at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, Ridley Scotts's 'The Martian' tells the incredible story of one man's survival after being left on Mars. Spanning over 141 minutes, 'The Martian' brings Andy Weir's 2011 novel to the big screen in a well-paced, well-written affair that features a star-studded cast with Matt Damon at its helm.\n\nPresumed dead by his team after a vicious storm during a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself stranded on the red planet, 385 million kilometres away from home. Relying on his resourcefulness, Mark must find a way to keep himself alive and find a way to signal to Earth that he didn't die while NASA and his crew try to reach him.\n\nMatt Damon gives a great performance in the lead role. He does a terrific job keeping viewers interested throughout the film, especially considering he's the only person in the majority of the scenes. The supporting cast, including Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, and a whole host of Hollywood's finest, all give solid performances across the film. Not only does Damon do a splendid job keeping viewers entertained, but Drew Goddard's screenplay makes sure viewers don't get bored when Watney starts mentioning things like hexadecimals and many other scientific details.\n\nFor the most part, the science behind 'The Martian' is surprisingly accurate. Some are cosmetic, but the most important one, the storm that causes the film's events to take place, is something that can't physically happen. Scott's use of various wide and overhead shots does a great job emphasising Mark's isolation and loneliness. The visual effects on display throughout the film are impressive. The VFX department does an incredible job making sure the CGI used looks realistic and doesn't blatantly stand out to viewers.\n\nDespite being a futuristic sci-fi film, 'The Martian' incorporates themes that link to ideas of human nature and humanity's future. Man's natural desire to persevere and survive plays a key role in the film - If Mark didn't have this overwhelming hunger to survive he probably wouldn't have made it home; this directly links to themes of hope and possibility. One of the first times Mark addresses the audience, he directly says 'I'm Not Gonna Die Here'. The film asks the question of what future space travel will look like, and if we might actually have humans on mars sooner rather than later.\n\nThe biggest theme, however, is isolation/separation and what effects prolonged isolation has on someone. The only thing that appears to keep Mark sane through the film seems to be his access to a video log, telling both the log and viewers, what he's thinking and planning. The psychological effect of this shows up when Mark is finally rescued by his team and instantly tears up at the thought of being with other people again. Even the production design carries across this theme; the crew's kit and equipment remind Mark that he's all alone, with nothing and no one.\n\nOn the whole, 'The Martian' does a brilliant job making the viewers feel like they're with Mark. The production design, camera movements and performances all help the viewer feel as though they're in the scene with Mark. 'The Martian' is a superb film that showcases a sensational performance from its lead and features striking cinematography. Ridley Scott provides audiences with a movie that fans of off-planet adventures will enjoy for years to come.",

Really?\n\nRewatching I'm less inclined to think it's over-praised and that it's still a load of fun. It's quite an achievement to make a science-heavy survival film fun and entertaining, but Ridley Scott and co pull that off in spades; it's the inverse of the reason I've thus far avoided seeing Castaway, which from this distance I've always assumed to be a bit dull.\n\nThe opening scenes are impressive but lack tension, mainly due to us all knowing Matt Damon has to survive - the other side of how Alien scored so big on first release by having the relatively unknown Weaver as the final girl. That it's science-heavy but accessible is probably as much down to the original book and the screen adapter as anything else; I haven't read the book, but recently read the author's latest, Project Hail Mary, which is similarly fun, exciting, and science-heavy. It's obviously dependent on Matt Damon, who's excellent here, along with a talent-laden supporting cast and Ridley Scott on top directorial form; I think a British director making a film about a NASA rescue (which doesn't go all according to NASA'S plan, of course) means it avoids much US nationalism (as well the original text once again), which would have been turn off for me. \n\nI see Project Hail Mary is in the works. That'll be even tougher to adapt ... but another large dose of fun if it's pulled off.",

With only a meagre amount of supplies, the stranded visitor must utilise his wits and spirit to find a way to survive on the hostile planet. Meanwhile, back on Earth, members of NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home, while his crew mates hatch their own plan for a daring rescue mission.\n\nThe storytelling techniques work well enough to keep the film engaging. Its a film about human error, the will to survive, and the responsibility that we have as human beings, not just to the work that we dedicate our lives to, but to one another as people. Despite being marketed under the mainstream bait of a \"space movie\". \n\nThe acting and plot are great featuring the best work and the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, and an outstanding supporting cast.\n\nThe Martian is an extraordinary tale of Watney's extreme optimism, courage, determination and most importantly, ingenuity.

The characters, primarily Matt Damon's Mark Watney, are charming and fun to watch, which honestly makes the whole movie work.\n\nThe beginning is strong. Everything on Mars is hectic, until it isn't and Mark Watney is stranded on Mars. The narrative takes time with Watney, the near silence from Watney and tense synth-y score really pulling the audience into Watney's head, almost uncomfortably close. Very intimate. It sets up\u2026 not stakes, exactly, but the seriousness of the movie. Later, Watney will joke around accompanied by cheesy 70's music, but in the beginning, the movie grounds itself, letting the more serious moments later also finding their place alongside the sillier ones.\n\nMatt Damon really nails Mark Watney, making him likable with depth in a way that makes me forgive how little character development takes place. With all the talent, gravitas, and charm the other actors bring, the acting is one of the strongest parts of the movie. You can't help but root for Watney to get saved, for his crew to come rescue him, for everything to go right back on Earth. The narrative does them all favors too, because even though you're sure he'll be saved and everything will be alright, all that goes wrong keeps making you wonder, \"What if?\" Even if that's not a question in your mind, it's immensely entertaining to see Watney get from Point A to Point B. The script is clever in this respect, and while I don't know if the science was correct, the movie impresses upon its audience complicated science without making it feel too easy or too difficult to understand. \n\nThe lighthearted moments are definitely one of the biggest draws of the movie. Just as this movie is rooted in serious stakes and dangerous situations, it has little jokes or bright music to uplift it. The movie treads a careful balance without the humor seeming forced or the tenseness dragging everything down. It succeeds, for sure. The suspense feels more real when broken up by those little fun moments, and the little fun moments make the movie all the more watchable. \n\nOverall, this is an absolute blast of a movie, and I would recommend it if you're into fun sci-fi!",

It was a good film , but because of the unrealistic side and the lack of something that I don't know what it is, I won't say it's perfect.",

            "content": "Ridley Scott this time has adapted Andy Weir's best-selling novel of the same name. Which detailed a stranded astronaut's story to survive on Mars with the resources he has and botany skills to boot. Scripted by Drew Goddard of The Cabin in the Woods fame and starring Matt Damon in the central role of Mark Watney. All of this has come together to form one of Ridley Scott's best films for some time. Certainly at this point in time, his best film since American Gangster.\n\nThe story goes that a space crew is stationed on Mars, there to explore the Acidalia Planitia plain as part of their expedition. A storm rages which prompts them to leave, but not before Mark Watney played by Matt Damon is struck by a piece of a satellite antenna and is presumed dead by the crew. NASA gets wind of this and has a memorial service in his name, believing him to be dead. Sure enough, Watney survives but is in the risk of losing air.\n\nHaving managed to make it to to the base, he comes to the realisation that he is alone, with little food and contact with no-one. Therefore using a space log to update his activities, he plans to use his special botany skills and ingenuity to survive. To make contact in the hope that he can somehow escape and reunite with his crew and Earth itself. The film works on several levels. The cast themselves are part of an ensemble and all shine together in this film. From Matt Damon as our lead, a worn-down but cocky and confident individual, who you all root for to make it back home in the long run. To Jessica Chastain as the ship's commander Melissa Lewis, the authoritative and leading figure to her crew and all-out disco music fan. To Chiwetel Ejiofor as NASA's director of space missions who carries the burden on earth to bring Watney back safely. To Jeff Daniels director of NASA who is cautious and decisive to a fault, just to name a few.\n\n The film manages to be surprisingly funny even during the more sombre and dark moments. By no means is this film a comedy (as the Golden Globes believed it was\u2026) nor is it out of place or sporadic. Which is a credit to Drew Goddard's script who possesses a successful track record of subtly blending drama and comedy together to significant effect. I think it is also a credit to Ridley Scott, who doesn't downplay or fight against the right tone for the film, but more flows with it. Sometimes a script and Scott's vision in the past would conflict disastrously \u2013 but here it's lighting in a bottle. The steps Watney takes to survive, whether growing potatoes in a confined space of dirt and faeces by using leftover rocket fuel to produce hydrogen or dismantling equipment and ship parts to make movement viable by the direction of NASA scientists; is fascinating to watch.\n\nNot just because the audience know what's at stake, but the level of humourous insight renders any steps into dreariness; making it an excellent but reflective thrill ride of a film. Just watching the movie blending all those successful elements together marks it as a triumphant rendition of the novel itself and offers surprises along the way. This is undoubtedly a film that isn't there to make a grand, ultimate statement. Nor is it trying to be a deep, experience film like in the vein of 2001: a Space Odyssey or Interstellar but is just only an entertaining, enjoyable survival story. That has its moments of reflection and more than enough time for the audience to spend time with Watney on his journey to survive and also be in the company of a great cast to boot. To the power of the botanist and film director, this is definitely one of his best outings and reaffirms Ridley Scott as one of cinema's greatest storytellers.",

The Martian also skillfully depicts the crew's struggles with guilt, and accurately shows their feasible  mission to save him.\n\nDespite the fact that The Martian is a science fiction thriller, the movie accurately depicts the struggles to survive on a barren planet, as well as the technology that martian astronauts would likely have. This degree of realism when depicting Mark Watney's world helps effectively create a sense of tension as Mark struggles to grow food, a sense of the total desolation when viewing the martian planet, and a sense of vastness to accurately show truely how stranded Mark is.\n\nOverall, the Martian is an engaging and realistic science fiction thriller that not only will entertain, but will also engage your curiosity and allow you to fully immerse yourself into the futuristic earth of 2035.",

            "content": "(SPOILER ALERT!!)\n\nSummary: \nThe movie follows Astronaut Mark Watney's journey of surviving from a catastrophic event of being stranded on Mars. Everything started from an emergency mission abort due to a deadly Martian dust storm. During the abortion, Watney gets hit by a runaway debris antenna and his signal is lost. The other crewmates left him on Mars, thinking that the debris had killed him.\n Miraculously, Watney survived. However, he is left alone with no communication and only some resources. Watney, being the botany specialist of the crew, utilizes his skills to grow potatoes on Mars to survive until the next Mars mission. Meanwhile, NASA discovers that Watney is still alive. Through hard work, NASA and Watney restore communication with each other using the decommissioned Pathfinder probe. NASA also comes up with a plan to send resources to Watney. Just as things are turning to the bright side, however, Watney's farm and habitat module explode. Watney will starve. Therefore, NASA is on a tight schedule to send food to Watney and skips some safety tests. As a result, the only payload rocket that NASA can get it to Mars in time crashes. Fortunately, the Chinese space agency offers their only rocket available to save Watney. NASA goes through internal conflicts on how to use their last chance. They decide to go for the plan with a higher chance of succeeding but risks Watney and his five crewmembers' lives. The crew, without hesitation, goes back to Mars to save Watney. They go through the remaining obstacles. Watney gets saved.\n\nAnalysis: \nThe first thing we see is Mars. A manned space program is taking place. Mars is a hostile environment. By showing that us humans made it to Mars, it implies the possibilities of mankind. The movie tries to express the struggle of mankind in front of nature. Then it escalates to deliver a message that the possibilities of mankind are way larger than we think.\nThe process of surviving on Mars involves many aspects of mankind. It involves knowledge. With Watney's knowledge of Chemistry, he was able to create water out of rocket fuel. With his knowledge of history, he was able to recall the decommissioned Pathfinder probe to use it to restore communication with Earth. With his botany skills, he saved himself from starving. \nSurviving on Mars involves discipline as well. Watney could not have returned alive without working hard. We can see his constant struggle to resist the hostile environment of Mars. To quote Mark Watney himself from the original novel the movie is based on, he said, \"Mars keeps trying to kill me.\" He is aware that Mars was very hostile and keeps himself striving to stay alive.\nThe most important thing is that it involves hope. If Watney had drowned in despair, he would have died even before any hostility of the Martian environment could reach him. If there was no hope, Watney's crewmates would have hesitated to go back to Mars to save him. It was hope that motivated Watney to travel a long distance to his window of escape.\n\nCritique/Recommendation: \nTowards the climax, Watney makes a hole in his spacesuit to maneuver himself to the crew. While this is a compelling scene, it does not make much sense. It does serve as a good plot device. However, some fans would have figured that the laws of physics will frown on this scene. A hole in the suit means catastrophe. While it is well sugarcoated in the movie, it is impossible to control the force of the explosive depressurization with your bare arm. Also, the oxygen in your body would be drained rapidly, and your blood will literally boil and freeze at the same time due to a drastic difference in terms of pressure. I admit that the movie was able to give a strong climax by sacrificing this accuracy, but I think that scientific accuracy is also a major factor to consider when making a hard-sci-fi movie like this.\nInformative stuff aside, I would like to compliment the film directors on how the urgency was depicted in the intro scene. In the start of the movie, a fatal Martian dust storm forces the crew to abort their mission. All crewmates evacuate to perform an emergency launch. However, Watney is hit by debris on his way to the evacuation vehicle. Every factor of this scene gives a boost to maximize the anxiousness of whether who will survive and who will die. The low visibility, the tone of the actors, and even the sound effect of a deadly Martian dust storm. Especially when the evacuation vehicle was about to tip and crash, it gave me the chills.\nWhile the movie tells us about a man's desperate struggle to survive, it sprinkles some humor to prevent exhaustion. For example, when Watney literally digs up a nuclear battery of plutonium to solve his heating problem, he goes like, \"Ha, I don't care. Look, the point is that I am not cold anymore.\" The background music, \"Hot Stuff\" by Donna Summer also gives a laugh, since plutonium, a radioactive isotope that unleashes heat, is literally the \"hot stuff\".\nMy personal opinion is that the movie is unique because there has not been a decent Mars movie for quite a long time. I like the movie especially because it resembles the Apollo 13 incident, where all humanity becomes one in praying for the safe return of a soul endangered in space. I would also personally recommend reading the original novel as well because it doubles the joy. considering all these factors, I think that this is a well-made movie and therefore my final rating is 4.0 stars.",

Props to the original writer and adapters to faithfully keeping most of it.\n\nCinematography was great, made boring desert Mars look stunning, praises for the direction by Ridley Scott has nothing to add more for his rich career.\n\nI thought it was only ganna be Matt Damon but boy was I wrong. Movie nerd inside me brust open when I saw that humangase of a cast.\n\nJessica Chestain,Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan(Bucky) and Micheal Pena(Luizzz) in the main crew. The relationship set up between the crew was well executed without that much scenes, build up, at the start.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor is fantastic, his protrayal of helpful and caring person was phenomenally done. Jeff Daniels as NASA Director stole some scenes for me at the start with his rude caricature. Wong and Donald Glover had short but very effective scene time. Sean Bean not dying has no scientific explanation.\n\nAll the NASA scenes, Mars scenes, JPL, China & Hermes working together felt great. Everybody uniting to save a human life was realistic.(real life situation of Thailand kids).\n\nThe movie had great sprinkles of comedy. Protagonist humourous approach to every trouble and optimistic characterisation served the themes of 'not giving up' pretty well. Looking for best in the worst of things. Hence he came back alive, cuz he science the sh!t of it.\n\nNow the sciennccce,\n'The greatest botanist in this planet', 'Botany isn't science.' Using radioactive decay to solve cooling problem, using own poop as fertilizers was fantastic, making H2O from N2H2 and blowing himself up for miscalculation got the science right. Even astronomical science, rocket science had some realism in them. Blowing up Hermes and poking space suit for thrust as Iron Man, superb. Mars is the name of Roman God of War, and his Greek version is called 'Ares', hence the name Ares3 4 for Mars mission. And Hermes is the Greek god of travel (also Mercury but travel seems more right).\n\nScientists are not always crazy old dudes in white coats, they work together and solve problems. One of the few movies that got both science and scientists right.",

I watched an astronaut review of this movie and he only pointed out one flaw in the actual science of the movie.

It was actually very refreshing to watch a movie where everyone is with each other and doesn't hate each other's guts. What I mean by that is it was nice to see that somebody didn't try to sabotage the mission for their own self-interest. Everyone was on board with the mission and they all had the same goal.

            "content": "The Martian movie is a dream come true, a faithful elucidation of the central technical dramas that made the Andy Weir novel it's based on the surprise \u2018space geek hit' of the decade. The tale is something of a Robinson Crusoe in space: Astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on the surface of Mars when his crew mates are forced to evacuate their habitat and blast off for Earth. Watney must improvise ways to eke out his limited resources, as the next mission to the red planet isn't scheduled to land for another four years. Like the book, the movie's rhythm is a steady cycle of crisis, recovery, humor, determination, and new crisis. On screen, directed by Ridley Scott, these cycles are delivered with satisfying characterization and eye-grabbing visuals of Martian landscapes and mouth-gaping zero-G gymnastics in space.\n\nAs a backdrop to the human drama (and comedy), the movie's hardware is based on real engineering, not magical miracle machines. The Hermes mother ship, for example, is a modified version of the sound design strategy of a \u2018cycling spacecraft' that repeatedly makes the Earth-Mars-Earth loop with crew and small landing craft. (Buzz Aldrin and I wrote up the concept for Scientific American a decade ago.)\n\n\nAs the left-for-dead Watney, played by Matt Damon, faces doom in a dozen guises, he defiantly boosts his courage through styling himself as everything from the \"best botanist on Mars\" (as he ingeniously grows potatoes in carefully-created garden soil) to a \"space pirate\" (for his goal of commandeering a rescue rocket emplaced automatically elsewhere on the planet). He expresses his thoughts to his laptop log and later in messages to people on earth campaigning to rescue him. When humans finally reach other planets, we will need real \"Watneys\"\u2014those smart enough to repurpose on-hand assets in an emergency, and lucky enough not to be killed by their own inevitable oversights.\n\n\n\nSpace geeks will enjoy identifying and debating technical flaws in the film. The Martian follows its source material remarkably closely, but unlike say, certain installments in the Harry Potter movie franchise, it will still make perfect sense to those who haven't read the book. Aside from the monster sandstorm that sets up the crisis (Andy Weir, the author of The Martian, is very upfront about choosing to gloss over the realities of Martian atmospheric pressure in favor of a dramatic opening), there are few noticeable factual flubs in the plot. Unlike 2013's Gravity and its magical space maneuvers, or 2014's Interstellar with its mystical time continuum tricks, this movie is a remarkably authentic exposition of what space travelers need to be able to do under crisis conditions.\n\nRun time constraints forced the movie's producers to condense and combine characters, with no real detriment to the story\u2014although viewers might be surprised to see the same set of key NASA experts showing up at every launch or space center on the planet as the action shifts between continents. Similar story-telling imperatives probably compelled the most striking departure (spoiler alert!) from the book\u2014changing who actually goes to rescue Watney in the end\u2014but again, without any significant detour from the plot.\n\nThere's no cheating on even highly-technical spaceflight topics, as shown in the treatment of the so-called \"Rich Purnell maneuver,\" wherein the Hermes slingshots past Earth back to Mars for a desperate pickup attempt. NASA's navigation geek Purnell\u2014played with effective nervous energy by Donald Glover\u2014 demonstrates the \"orbitology\" of his maneuver, with two NASA officials as the planets, and a stapler and pens as spacecraft. The result is coherent, comprehensive, and surprisingly comic. The basic strategy of the Rich Purnell maneuver is not fictional\u2014a crippled Japanese Mars probe named Nozomi actually used a similar Earth-flyby scheme to set up a second chance for its own faltering unmanned Mars mission a dozen years ago.\n\nThere's one cringeworthy trope in The Martian that has apparently become an unavoidable cultural myth: the scenes where teams in Mission Control erupt into leaping cheers a few seconds after a rocket blasts off. This imaginary practice would not only be utterly unprofessional but also an indicator of near-criminal negligence. In the screening that I attended following an event at NASA's Johnson Space Center, these scenes were negatively noticed by many NASA folks in the audience. But I only can suppose it was sympathetically meant to humanize the rocket scientists, and it was the only exception to the admiration shown for all the other portrayals. (It's also possible this trope has been influenced by footage of the controllers of deep space unmanned missions in recent years, where data about events can take hours to cross the solar system, leaving controllers mostly in the position of spectators during key mission milestones.)\n\nAfter faithfully reproducing technically-sound crises and responses for two hours, the movie did briefly run off the track into fantasy mode at the very end, by by violating the physics of action-reaction in portraying an over-dramatized dramatic rescue attempt that really didn't need any such cheating. But if that was the price to pay for producing this otherwise magnificent space adventure story, the math checked out. Mother Nature is relentlessly unforgiving in space, but a movie audience can show a lot more mercy to one major technical transgression. I do.",

Matt Damon is just a cool cat through out film fixing everything with such ease that never really gives us reason to want or need to cheer him on as he clearly doesn't need our support.

This is neither an action-oriented motion picture nor a special effects extravaganza.

It had an early October release and I don't know if there is anything else I will venture to the theater for until mid to late December.  With it being a minimal risk due to the people involved(director - Ridley Scott, and starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, and others) it was a safe bet to not be a bad movie.\n\n\nI went into it with no expectations, maybe because I knew it would be good.  I felt it was a solid trip to the movies with very few holes in my viewing experience, if any at all.  I liken the movie to a cross between Gravity/Castaway/Apollo 13/Mission to Mars and/or Red Planet, three of which were nominated or winners of awards... the previous Mars movies, not as good.  \n\nFor me, the movie starts as a 7 \u00bd of 10 but fails to get much higher due in large part to it being what you think it would be and not extremely big on surprises or twists and turns.

            "content": "This \u2018comedy' charmed and excited the audiences of 2015 enough that the Academy gave it a Best Picture nomination. It's a fine film but hardly deserving of all the over the top praise it receives and certainly not one of the finest films of 2015, although it was an admittedly weak year. The visual effects are impressive and the direction and performances are serviceable if not brilliant. This film was a return to form for director Ridley Scott after the failure of The Counselor (2013) and Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) and he does a decent job at blending science fiction and comedy but it pales in comparison to his best. Go in expecting an average film made by people capable of producing something much greater.\n\nAstronaut Mark Watney, Matt Damon, is stranded on Mars after he is lost by his team during a dust storm and they are able to evacuate without him. He sets up a sustainable lifestyle for himself on Mars in the HAB while he attempts to contact earth as the other members of his team, led by Melissa Lewis, Jessica Chastain, are not told of his survival despite their superiors being aware. When they do eventually find out due to a strange subplot about the Chinese they return to rescue him and lead successful lives when they return to earth.\n\nThe movie looks beautiful as most Scott films do and the wide shots of Mars are marvelous as you really get a sense of how large the canvas that Scott is working on is. That wasn't enough to make me like the film however and because the movie is fairly thin on character development and portrayal of personal struggle in the characters I did find it hard to enjoy the film in a way that was not shallow. Even 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) which features minimal dialogue and is mostly just shots of the most unbelievable visuals you have ever set your eyes upon makes you care about Dave, or humanity, in his plight to survive. Of course I don't expect this film to equal one of the greatest films of all time but I needed it to make me feel something instead of just mild pleasure and occasional amusement.\n\nThe two leads, Damon and Chastain, can both be fantastic and have appeared in several great films but they do have a tendency to be rather stolid when not given much to work with. They appear that way here as their characters seem almost robotic in how hyper competent they are while lacking in personality completely and although occasional lines about disco add some flavor to the characters we never really feel for them. You can pick out several notable actors amongst the film's supporting cast as Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig and Mackenzie Davis get very little do and this can at times feel frustrating as I would hope that you could find less talented people to fill roles that require so little.\n\nA lot has been made of Goddard's screenplay and how ingeniously it blends popular science and humor. I think it deserved it's Best Screenplay nomination as 2015 wasn't the best year, for mainstream cinema, but it didn't pack the punch of a film like Galaxy Quest (1999). Again, I liked it but I was never surprised by anything that occurred, no real tension was built up and nothing about it made me really laugh, cry or have any emotional response. I needed to feel one of those things in order for this film to be anything above average in my mind and it proved itself again and again to be good but not great.\n\nWould I recommend this film? No. It's not good enough for me to tell someone it's worth watching because there are better films that do everything that this film does but better. Ridley Scott made one of the greatest films of all time in Blade Runner (1982) and a feminist classic in Thelma & Louise (1991), Matt Damon gives a brilliant performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Jessica Chastain lights up the screen in A Most Violent Year (2014), these are all films I would recommend before even mentioning The Martian.",

            "content": "There can't be a greater story device then that of basic survival. One character battles against the elements as their life hangs by the slender thread solely dependent on their own ingenuity and wit. That's the crux of Ridley Scott's adaptation of The Martian, a bold and exhilarating red-blooded adventure about a man stranded on the Martian surface 143,000,000 miles from home who must use every resource he has to keep himself alive until somebody comes to pick him up. It's bold, it's fun, it's smart, it's ingenious, and it contains the only montage I've ever seen of a man scrapping a space capsule while ABBA's \"Waterloo\" plays on the soundtrack.\n\nBased on the book by Andy Weir, The Martian tells a story that is simplistic but not simple-minded: The crew of Ares III, a manned mission to Mars, find themselves overwhelmed by a nasty rock storm that forces the crew to evacuate the planet. In the chaos of the blinding wind one crew member is lost and presumed dead. It's now or never, so the crew has to make a hasty escape and reasonably assumes that their crew member has fallen. Of course, he hasn't. As the crew head for home, our hero Mark Whatley (Matt Damon) wakes up the next day on the planet's surface with his oxygen depleted, and a piece of the antenna sticking out of his abdomen.\n\nShades of Cast Away, Mark discovers that he is the only man on Mars and not only must figure out a way to survive but must also figure out a rational reason to keep talking (Tom Hanks had a volleyball, Damon has easier device of talking to his video log). He moves into the crew's abandoned man-made habitat where he calculates how much food, water and air he will have to sustain himself for the next four years until the next scheduled Mars mission, arrives on the planet's surface.\n\nThis is where the movie gets interesting. Mark discovers that he has enough food and water for a few weeks, and ascertains that he must figure a way to grow more. But how is he going to plant a garden on a dry planet with no air. This solution is inspired. Plus - good news kids - He's a botanist!\n\nMuch of the movie is taken up with Mark's adventure in pure survival not only from the hostile environment, but also from the maddening fact that the only music left behind is Disco (That's why the ABBA song). Step by step, piece by piece we're with him as he carves out a tiny civilization for himself on a planet that is dead-set against it. The script pays close attention to thoughtful reasonable questions like what would happen if the faceplate on Mark's spacesuit got cracked? How do you manufacture water in an airtight environment? How can he make contact with Earth when his communication devices were destroyed by the storm? (for that he creates a crude form of ASCII code that is simply inspired) Each new problem becomes a brain exercise for Mark that keeps his mind sharp. Never for a second is any of this dull or uninteresting. The script by Drew Goddard keeps things moving and always ups that stakes. The irony, of course, is that while Mark is forced to close himself up inside the tiny habitat, outside are the wide open spaces of the Martian landscape. The cinematography here is breathtaking, showing us the vastness of the Martian landscapes which look so beautiful and yet so lonely at the same time.\n\nOf course, that's not the whole story. There are two other parts to this movie. One takes place on the ground as the crew at NASA gets a cryptic message from Mark that he is alive and well. Then - shades of Apollo 13 - they must put their collective heads together to figure out how to retrieve their man from 140,000,000 miles away over the next four years. Again, none of this is ever dull or uninteresting. We get the pure joy of watching smart people coming up with smart solutions.\n\nThe other part takes place aboard the returning ship - the one that left Mark behind. We are privy to the crew - led by Jessica Chastain - as they must figure out how they are going to be able to turn the ship around and go back and get him. Of course, that means another four years onboard the ship, plus how are they going to retrieve him when they get there? Everything, in all three parts of this story is based on surgical timing. If one thing goes wrong, the crew could be lost, Mark could be dead and the whole thing could become an international fiasco back home.\n\nAll of this, of course, leads up to a third act that - while predictable - has you on the edge of your seat. It's rare in these days when most movies go on automatic pilot in the third act that we are just as exhilarated by the third act as we were by the first or the second. What is so thrilling here is that director Ridley Scott and his screenwriter Drew Goddard avoid phony manipulation. They don't manufacture extraneous drama or throw in unnecessary subplots that weigh the story down. There is no villain here, no naysayer. Mark's situation is all the villain that you need. Plus, unlike last year's Intersteller, the movie doesn't drown itself in emotional syrup. Yeah, it's tragic that Mark is stuck in this place, but for the most part, this is an upbeat movie. It is also nice that the motivation of the people at NASA and the crew aboard Ares III isn't solely based on politics. They're doing this because it's the right thing to do.\n\nWhat an exhilarating movie this is. What fun it is to watch smart people trying to figure out a nearly impossible task. It's rare that a movie of this size - and it is a big movie - can keep us so totally involved in what is going on at every single second. Like Gravity and Apollo 13, this is a movie about a dangerous situation that has us riveted at every single moment.  We know the ending but we're not sure how the movie is going to get there. This is one of the best movies of the year.",

It would just make it a bit scarier, the only thing about Earth being just woke green text on that screen in his rover.",

            "content": "How could a futuristic, highly-technical story of isolation on the Red Planet connect with an earthbound reader? Well, at times we all endure isolation, solitary confinement, and feelings of being lost. The question is how to work within the given circumstances and not give-up hope? It's a universal story of over-coming, perseverance, teamwork, and bravery. In the first 20% of the book and the film, one learns that Mark Watney is determined, relentless, and content in any and every situation. Then really bad sh*t starts happening! His communication is in the form of a (daily log) diary, and the effect is eavesdropping on the anxious, personal ramblings of a lost astronaut on Mars. The feelings of being lost, misunderstood, and hopeless affect all of us at some point, so it is easy to relate to Mark Watney. His intelligence, humor, courage, tenacity, and wit are essential to survival; but most of all, he won't quit, despite facing almost impossible odds of long-term existence or rescue. What originally started as free posts by a nerdy blogger, and then small increments posted on Amazon for $0.99/per chapter, turned into this bestseller, which really picks up its pace when NASA discovers his movements on Mars (even though they thought he was dead) and begins to plan a rescue mission. All forms of botany, hygiene, communication, repair, and maintenance go out the window in a desperate attempt to save one man's life, at all costs. The problem-solving alone keeps the pages turning as fast as the oxygen is depleted from his EVA suit. It's kind of like Unbroken, Castaway, and Apollo 13 (movies) combined to make this story one of the most gritty, compelling, suspenseful, and realistic novels I've read in a long time. Speaking of movies, the epic film directed by Ridley Scott in 2015 stays lock-step with the book's rhythm, and for a movie largely based in technical details given in soliloquy, it does a masterful telling of the story with only minor changes. Kudos to Drew Goddard for the Screenplay. Matt Damon is a perfect Mark Watney! And for any lonely soul whose felt \"cut-off\" in severe isolation, in whatever human condition, whether his fault or as part of an attack of bad luck; this character, Mark Watney, botanist astronaut, space pirate, Capt. Longbeard, will soon become your long lost hero. He is a life-force for the ages, and even though the logistics of his rescue are a bit technical, the flow is powerful and engaging. I would read the book and see the movie! Two-thumbs up; go for blast-off!",

And yes, Matt Damon (Mark) is great as the lead and has to carry a massive chunk of the film on his own, which he does spectacularly. But, there are so many good actors here. Jessica Chastain (Melissa), Jeff Daniels (Theodore), Sean Bean (Mitch), Kristen Wiig (Annie), Kate Mara (Beth), Sebastian Stan (Chris), and Donald Glover (Rich), just to name a select few. Yes, this is one of the best casts I can recall seeing in any movie. Ridley Scott was a fantastic choice for a director. He just seems to get these space films, doesn't he? The script is intelligent and does a tremendous job balancing the serious notes with a surprising amount of comedy. This is way funnier than you'd expect. The special effects are very well done and make good use of the film's budget. Obviously, the emotional connection to Mark is a key to the movie, but it's just so interesting to watch him do whatever he can to make life on another planet work. That is enough to keep you enthralled until the closing credits. The big scene where Mark reunites with his crew in an effort to try and return to Earth is thrilling and filed with tense beats.\n\nWeaknesses: It's understandable why this is nearly two and a half hours, but it's one of those movies that feels like it. You certainly feel that things are going long at points. It's probably a weird thing to nitpick, but the sound was off in this. I found myself struggling to hear several characters in various scenes, despite the volume being fine in other parts. Also, for some of Mark's scientific exploits to work, believability needs to be stretched. Some things just so happen to be in places that benefit him and it feels like somewhat of a stretch. \n\nOverall: Despite a few minor flaws, this movie ultimately works in many ways. Matt Damon is a terrific lead in a very demanding role. The rest of the cast delivers in their smaller roles in spades. It does a good job balancing the meat of the story on Mars with the intrigue of how this gets handled down on Earth. A great film.",

            "content": "It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why: \n\nPlausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts! \n\nWriting. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners (\"My balls are frozen!\") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, \"Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you.\" (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, \"Yes!\" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation. \n\nPacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake! \n\nAGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here.In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again).\n\nAs the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off.\n\nTechnically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years.You know how I said that blockbusters are one-note, generic and have no personality whatsoever?\n\nLuckily, legendary director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard said \"Forget this formula!\" and decided to adapt a nerdy sci-fi novel to the big screen. And what do I think of it?\n\nI LOVE IT! Wanna know why? Well, let's focus on the story first.\n\nWhile on a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and a crew of astronauts decided to abandon mission when a storm happens. However, Watney gets hit by a satellite. Because of the storm and the lack of time, they immediately decide to leave Mars, believing that Watney is dead. But surprise surprise, he's actually alive and well. You see, he actually knocked out cold and part of the satellite damaged his bio-monitor (which actually explains why the crew couldn't find him, aside from the storm). Left alone on Mars, he decides that he's not gonna die and solves problems in order to survive. \n\nHowever on Earth, a bunch of images cause NASA to realise, \"Uh-oh, we messed up!\" and do everything in their power to help him. The result is a 2 hr 20 min adventure full of suspense, problem-solving and laughs that will even make a robot interested.\n\nNow why do I adore this movie? Well, there are lots, but I'll just put out my main reasons.\n\n1. Mark Watney. Like characters such as Andy DuFresne, Barry Egan and Michael Sullivan, Watney is one of my favourite characters of all time. In fact, the whole film will basically be nothing without him. The reason why I like him so much is because that he's a character who actually DOES something other than look pretty. He grows potatoes in poop and Martian soil, He uses duck tape to fix both his helmet and a broken door, and travels in a rover for days to search what he is looking for. He solves problems. He has a sense of humour. He feels like he's having FUN in space. He doesn't mope around mourning about the fact that he is trapped in Mars. Hell, the only thing that is sort of torturing him is God awful disco music. He's everything a great character should be. In an era where a main character does nothing but look good and does nothing else, Watney is the like the rebuttal of all bland main characters today. He is such a great character, I could talk for days about why I love him so much.\n\n2. The supporting cast. Again, They actually do something aside from looking good. You got actors like Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. They all could have been underused in a regular blockbuster. But the screenplay has so much energy, it gives the cast something to do. They sit down, talk, debate about their plans, calculate on how Watney's gonna survive, tell sarcastic jokes, etc. You get the feeling these are people that are just doing their job instead of being bad guys. That's MUCH more interesting than just the same aul tripe we get in regular blockbusters. That is something I want. A film that focuses more on character and story than just blowing stuff up. I would stop there, but there's a lot more good in this movie\n\n3. The screenplay and direction. It has personality. Again, that's something I want in a movie! The screenplay is part-comedy, part-drama, part sci-fi, part sci-fact, all nerdy to a degree. Drew Goddard wrote the sh*t out of this. Although it's adapted from a novel, Goddard has written something sharp, focused (even if it lasted for 2 hours and 21 minutes) and cooked perfectly to a degree and Ridley Scott only made it even better. Not only does he have a knack for visuals (which are good as always), but Scott also gives out the best performances from his actors. It feels like the actors truly give a damn about the script. This is one of those movies where even the subplots are the best parts.\n\n4. The score. My god, the score is amazing! It doesn't attempt to sound Zimmer- like. Instead it sounds heroic, beautiful, powerful and memorable to a degree. Harry Gregson-Williams created a score that sounds like a Boards of Canada album got eaten up by a Jonny Greenwood composition and surprisingly it works.\n\nOverall, the Martian is a great movie. It has everything I ever wanted in a movie released in today's Nolan-ridden era. It's definitely an anti-Nolan movie. It's fun. It has consistency. The characters aren't mopey. It's very nerdy. It wastes NO time and goes straight to the point even at 2 hours and 21 minutes. Hands down, it's not only one of the best of 2015, but also one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. It's Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner and a comeback that is definitely worth the wait. \n\nThe best part? The whole film is even funnier than the revenge after 400 years bit from Exodus: Gods and Kings.\n\nSimply put, if you're tired of all the dark, gritty and absolutely bland blockbusters, SEE THE MARTIAN ALREADY! It's out now! I saw it two times already! What are you waiting for? Go already! Skip school to see this! Skip work to see this! Don't even bother downloading it! Get your a** to mars already! This one that you must see in the cinema and trust me, it's a rewarding experience. ;)",

Mark awakes alone on Mars and has to use his skills as a botanist to survive until he can be rescued and brought home to earth. \nMatt Damon is truly excellent as Mark Watney, even though he spends the majority of the film alone he manages to carry this movie with a great deal of humour, drama and taps into some very emotional moments. Jessica Chastain is also good as Commander Lewis and her and the other actors playing the rest of her crew have great chemistry together. Back at NASA headquarters, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Benedict Wong, Sean Bean and a number of other excellent actors play off each other well and keep the plot moving forward.\nConsidering a huge amount of the film is about scientific/mathematical calculations and growing potatoes , this is an incredibly entertaining film. There is a nice balance between drama and comedy and the scientific parts of the film are quite interesting, managing to simply explain what they are doing whilst not grinding the pace of the film to a halt. The film overall is a little on the long side and some of the obstacles or conversations at NASA could have been cut but the film still manages to maintain a level of tension and jeopardy about Watney's rescue.\nThe Martian is also beautifully shot with a great soundtrack. The use of pop music, explained by the use of the commander's CDS is also a nice touch an plays up some of the more comedic moments. The scenes inside the Hermes are also very well shot and look very convincing as the crew floats through moving parts of the ship as well as the scenes in space.\nTo summarise, this is an interesting, thrilling and surprisingly funny film in which people come together to save one man and as is often the case, that man in Matt Damon. Which is certainly not a bad thing.",

Four and a half billion years, nobody here. And now...me.\" - Mark Watney, \"The Martian\"\n\nImagine you're the first person to be alone on an entire planet. You're in a NASA exploration habitat that was built to last for 31 days. Your food supply is limited. If the oxygenator breaks, you'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks, you'll die of thirst. If the habitat is breached, you'll implode. What do you do? How do you survive? Is it possible to make it back home? For astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon), dying is not an option.\n\nYou'd think a story about one man's fight for survival on a planet several million years away from Earth would be bleak, but this return to form for director Ridley Scott is anything but. \"The Martian\" is one of the funniest movies I have seen all year, largely due to Drew Goddard's adapted screenplay and Damon's perfect execution of the sarcastic spaceman Mark Watney.\n\nEach time something goes wrong, Watney delivers a line that showcases his optimism and comedic nature. One of my favorite lines comes a little over halfway into the movie, when Watney is forced to ration his food into smaller portions. As he eats a piece of meat the size of a Lego block and half of a red potato, he stares at the camera blankly and says: \"It's been seven days since I ran out of ketchup.\"\n\nWhile humorous moments like this are sprinkled throughout the film, Damon also captures the underlying despair and loneliness felt by Watney, and his desire to get back home.\n\nThe scene that hooked me comes right after Watney is marooned on the red planet. As a massive dust storm rages outside of the habitat, a defeated Watney looks through some of the belongings his crew left behind. Staring off into the darkness, he confidently mutters, \"I'm not gonna die here.\"\n\nDamon's performance is complimented by those of a large supporting cast consisting of Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean, who play members of Watney's crew and the NASA men and women trying to get him home.\n\nWhen Watney says, \"Mars will come to fear my botany powers,\" you believe him. His scientific wit is as entertaining as his humor, and you're for rooting for Watney each step of the way. You cheer with each success, and empathize with each failure.\n\nRidley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski bring the desolate wasteland of Mars to life. Scott and Wolski create beauty from the barren world, and with each shot, the vast desert further contributes to the sense of isolation you feel while sitting in the theater.\n\n\"The Martian\" stands among Ridley Scott's best work, and Matt Damon provides one of his greatest performances. The scientific wonder the film evokes transcends both of their contributions however, and I am excited to see where we as humans progress in the coming years.\n\nWith several Mars-based projects currently being pursued by NASA as well as advancing technological developments, the future looks bright. Hopefully in our lifetime we will have the chance to witness history. Mars colonists will be able to say with a smile, \"In your face Neil Armstrong.\"",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I feel like Jan Brady:  Martian, Martian, MARTIAN!   \n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Only one Martian, Greg. Not a bunch. And he s My Favorite Martian. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to Matt Watney (Matt Damon) who is on an away mission to Mars with his 7 fellow astronauts. They are all gathering dirt and samples when a storm starts a-brewin . So they rush back to the ship as the storm starts getting rough. So rough, in fact that a satellite dish goes flying and hits our boy. The rest of the team make it to the rocket and they reluctantly take off without him, thinking he s dead.\n\nSCOTT: Turns out that Watney survived the mishap and is now stranded on the red planet. He calculates that he has about a year s worth of food supplies but must somehow survive three years until the next manned mission to Mars arrives. Being a botanist, Watney uses his skills to begin planting crops inside his habitat shelter. Meanwhile NASA scientists discover from photographs of the planet that Watney is alive, and they begin communicating with him. Soon they hatch a daring effort to rescue Watney before he starves to death.\n\nGREG: Scott, The Martian is another in a series of smart, scientifically accurate, science fiction movies (following 2013 s Gravity and last year s Interstellar). The Martian puts you right in the action. You immediately care about Watney s situation and you root for him to succeed. When everything goes south on him we all feel his anguish. If you notice that I m talking a lot about feelings in this review, it s for good reason. The science isn t only what s showcased here, it s the emotions of Watney on Mars, and his compatriots on the spaceship above, and his peers at Mission Control back on Earth. I was struck by how the screenwriter (Drew Goddard ) and director (Ridley Scott) kept three different storylines running at once. That makes for a fantastic story.\n\nSCOTT: The Martian is an extraordinary hero story, perhaps the best I ve seen on the big screen in several years. The movie itself is almost as strong as the hero s journey; it explodes off the screen, seizing our attention and lifting our hearts for the entire 2 hours and 21 minutes. We have the complete package here: a riveting screenplay, a terrific cast, astounding CGI effects, and a gritty hero worthy of our greatest admiration. The only element of the hero s journey that is missing is a  mentor  figure. My thinking is that there are  implied  mentors   all the teachers and trainers who taught him skills in science and survival. The end of the movie, showing him become that teacher to others, drives home that point. We saw that kind of implied mentor in A Walk in the Woods, where Robert Redford s character reveals the influence of Henry David Thoreau.\n\nGREG: Scott, what you re describing could be  The Mentor s Journey.  We ve seen this in other stories. The last role for the hero is to become a mentor; to share his lessons learned with new and upcoming heroes. In The Hunger Games Haymitch is just such a mentor. He was once a tribute for the Hunger Games and he survived by killing off all the other tributes. As such, he became a hero figure. Now, in his twilight days, he passes on what he has learned to newer tributes. His final destination as a hero is to become a mentor. I felt there were a lot of heroes in this story. Of course there s Watney on Mars. But there are other lesser heroes. There is the director of NASA Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) who has three underlings who act as henchmen (Henderson, Ng, and Moontrose). While he manages the operation, it s the other three who do the dirty work. We also see a turncoat in Henderson. He defies Sanders and informs the crew. This may be a new secondary character - the Unreliable Henchman. Up on spaceship Ares, there is a crew of followers lead by Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). They are also following the Mastermind/Henchman pattern. I d also like to draw your attention to two characters who represent a new kind of secondary character for us - the Ingenious Youngster. In one case we have a young woman, Mindy Park, who spots Watney on the satellite photos. In the next, is the young orbital mechanics scientist Purnell (Donald Glover) who figures out how to get Watney home. Both of these underlings are far down in the hero hierarchy, but without them, the story ends sadly.\n\nSCOTT: You re right, Greg, in pointing out the importance of the young kid character who unexpectedly saves the day by solving a problem that his (or her) elders cannot. In Star Trek: The Next Generation, it was Wesley Crusher who bailed out the Enterprise on more than one occasion. Here it is Purnell, a neophyte astrophysicist whose computations allow for the possibility for the crew to perform a slingshot maneuver around the sun to expedite a return trip to Mars to save Watney. This whiz-kid character stands in direct contrast to the archetypal Wise Old Man or Woman character who usually serves as the mentor. How interesting that heroes can get help from all different types of sources, some expected and others unexpected. I suspect that villains can receive assistance from a similar range of characters, although The Martian is not the right movie to test this hypothesis. There is no human villain in the story; the villain is nature itself, specifically, the inhospitable natural conditions endemic to Mars.\n\nGREG: Which brings up an interesting question in this story - who is the villain for the secondary characters? It would seem it is time. NASA is running out of time before their window of opportunity closes. The astronauts aboard spaceship Ares are also fighting against the time it takes to turn around and go back after Watney. Also, the director of NASA plays a bit of the villain too, as he weighs the expense of losing one man on Mars, versus an entire crew in a rescue attempt. In his mind, better to lose one man than a whole ship and its crew. Perhaps budgets and finance are a villain for him? The Martian is a great story told exceedingly well. The three plotlines dovetail nicely to give us what some have called Apollo 13 on steroids. The science in this movie has won praises from all corners. The special effects made me believe I was on Mars. But more than that, the tension in this movie is unrelenting. I couldn t look away for a second for fear I d miss something important. I give The Martian 5 out of 5 Reels. There are heroes a-plenty in this movie. Watney, of course, is the main character and is the hero of his plotline. But the other two plotlines have heroic characters at all levels of the story. Even in China we meet two scientists who risk their reputations and status to help rescue Watney. As for Watney, he is the ultimate hero. He s physically capable and the most competent man on the planet. He uses all his knowledge and experience to survive in the harshest of environments. He gets a full 5 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, the enormous cast of secondary characters is just overwhelming. We see two sets of Mastermind/Henchman hierarchies. Everyone from the top down is working at their peak to get Watney home. The cast is diverse in every way. We even found a new supporting character in the young geniuses. I give the supporting cast 5 out of 5 cast points.  Movie:  Cast: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Greg, nothing displeases me more than agreeing with you, but I have to concur with you across the board. The Martian is a near-flawless movie that deserves both critical acclaim and box office success. I hope this film gets recognized with numerous nominations at Oscar time. It s both a no-brainer and a pleasure to award the full 5 Reels out of 5 to The Martian. The hero story is textbook. Watney travels the full hero s journey, and in every phase of the journey we witness a richness and depth that is rarely seen in the movies. Watney shows all eight characteristics in the Great Eight traits of heroes: He is smart, strong, inspiring, reliable, resilient, caring, selfless, and charismatic. He becomes transformed from ordinary astronaut to an exceptionally innovative, pioneering colonist who rises to the challenge of surviving where no human has any right to survive. Clearly, Watney earns the full 5 Heroes out of 5 here. And as you mention, Greg, the secondary characters possess a similar richness and depth, and they do exactly what secondary characters should do in any great movie. They complement the hero, assist him, wrong him at times (albeit unintentionally), and enjoy their own mini-journeys of discovery, despair, and triumph. This impressive cadre of supporting characters no doubt earn a rating of 5 out of 5.  Movie:  Cast: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I don t think films get much better than this. I d like to nominate The Martian for the coveted Reel Heroes Hall of  Fame. What do you say?\n\nSCOTT: The Hall of Fame is rarified air, Gregger. But I have to agree with you. This movie is a remarkable gem, and so I second your nomination. It s Hall of Fame material for sure.",

For a science fiction film, it's a little shy on the science and heavy on the fiction. There is a cheesy factor to this film that reminded me of \"Independence Day\"... and that's never a good thing. Regardless, it's good entertainment and mostly keeps you interested, largely thanks to Matt Damon's charismatic performance as the titular character. The movie definitely drags in parts and needed some trimming, it needed to be about 20 minutes shorter. Still, this is Ridley Scott's best film since American Gangster, and it is enjoyable, but it's my least favorite of the Best Picture nominees.",

            "content": "The Martian\n        \tNow I've only seen 7 out of 22 of Ridley Scott's movies. And for the most part I've been Indifferent towards Ridley Scott's movies. And sometimes he'll come out with something that I really like, but truth be told I've only liked 2 of his movies and I like I said I haven't seen all his movies. One movie I need to revisit of his would be \"Blade Runner\" since I saw the Director's Cut of that and \"The Martian\" may be a movie that I need to see the director's cut of. But if there isn't one then this is one movie that I don't think I need to revisit.\nOne thing I was thoroughly surprised by was the fact that this movie was written by Drew Goddard the creator and main writer for the new \"Daredevil\" series on Netflix. And he actually wrote this movie really well even though it was a little contrived. The plot of \"The Martian\" is one where it's a very intense story of survival. Matt Damon is alone on Mars. He has no friends, very little food and he needs to find a way to stay alive until help arrives to BRING HIM HOME!\n\"The Martian\" is like a combination of the movie \"Gravity\" and \"Cast Away.\" And while \"Cast Away\" and \"Gravity\" were both interesting movies for different reasons I can't really say that a combination of those movies worked for \"The Martian.\" I'd like to talk more about Gravity, but I'd rather save that for another time.\nOne thing I didn't particularly like about The Martian was that it didn't really have a lot of tension between characters other than when Matt Damon was typing out his crass complaints live to the entire world. I thought the movie would have been more engaging than it could have been with some conflict between the characters. And even though I was engaged the entire time I think that it was mostly due to the fact that the survival elements were enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. \nThe idea of someone being stranded alone on a planet waiting for help to come is a good idea for a story right? Damn straight it is. But the thing that I thought \"The Martian\" relied WAY too heavily on was all the stuff that went wrong for Mark Watney and there wasn't enough conflict between the characters. And when there was conflict between the characters it was resolved almost instantly. And as for the things that went wrong for Mark what I mean by that is this: With Mark's garden blowing up and his food running short I noticed that those were the MAIN THINGS that fueled this movie and kept it afloat. And usually those scenes came after scenes where you thought things were going okay and then something bad happened.\nKeeping warm for Mark wasn't a big problem because the temperature on Mars is livable and he found his warm Uranium thingy, but for the most part I just felt bad for him since he was going to starve on Mars and they SHOWED IT. They showed that he was starving and that he didn't have a lot to eat. Especially near the end when he was skin and bones. But as soon as the movie was over I was in no rush to see it again. I thought that Matt Damon did a great job as usual. And this redeemed Mr Damon after his shitty role as Dr. Mann in \"Interstellar\".\n\"The Martian\" had almost no tension between any of the characters. And when it did happen the tension was there for less than a minute and that in and of itself was frustrating because people don't just end arguments so quickly. Not over little things and not even when someone's life is on the line. I'm sure that if something like \"The Martian\" were happening in real life right in this moment the world would probably be debating whether or not we should save him and whether we should spend millions of dollars in tax-payers money to save one man. And plus the part in this movie where China agrees to help out the United States in bringing him back is quite baffling to me.\nI don't think it was entirely a bad thing to have made the story mostly one of survival I also think that if they were going to make it one of survival that it needed to be even more intense than it was. And I'm not talking like gunfire, explosions or monsters or anything like that. But I think that Ridley Scott should have made it even harder on Mark Whatney. I don't know how that could have happened, but that was the screenwriter's job and Drew Goddard didn't do as well as I would have hoped in that sense. But Drew Goddard is a fantastic writer and I'm very much looking forward to whatever he has in the works that's coming out next.\n\"The Martian\" was not bad, but honestly it just wasn't exciting enough and I don't think it was as good as it could have been. I don't want to see \"The Martian\" again. I have no desire to. If I was invited to some event where \"The Martian\" was going to be shown and I didn't have to pay then I'd probably go if there was nothing better to do at home.\n\"The Martian\" gets: 3.0 out of 5.0",

The cheesy disco soundtrack helps fuel this slightly lighthearted feeling throughout and is also bolstered by the cameo of Kristen Wiig, mostly known for her dry and darkly comic roles and proves once again that she can lighten up the bleakest of films. The Martian is not a comedy, but nor is it a thriller. It's a genuinely brilliant story, however. Matt Damon's brilliant performance grounds the film throughout and is constant, committed and extremely well executed. Damon doesn't seem to take the role too seriously and this is a good thing, however is performance is undeniably believable. Jessica Chastain is also a perfect compliment to Damon's presence, providing a cosmic yin yang chemistry. Ridley uses his dreamily effervescent and textured perspective to deliver a film that is great, if a tad overlong in places. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "In real life, space travel is a very dangerous undertaking, but more often than not everything goes as planned. In movies, however, when characters venture into outer space, disaster is inevitable. I can't think of any movies set in space where something does not go wrong. The Martian is no different in that respect, but in many other ways it is quite exceptional. \n\nIn the first moments of the film, the crew of Ares 3 must make an emergency evacuation from Mars as a dangerous storm heads toward their mission site. In the midst of the storm, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by flying debris and thrown far from the escape vehicle. Presuming Watney to be dead, the rest of the crew launches and begins their trip back to Earth; Watney awakes to find himself injured and alone on Mars. He makes his way back to the mission's living habitat and immediately starts figuring out how he is going to survive on a lifeless planet with very limited supplies until the next Ares mission arrives or a rescue mission can be sent, either of which would not be possible for at least three or four years.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThough Damon is all alone for the scenes on Mars, The Martian is not entirely a one man show like the survival films Cast Away or All is Lost. Once Watney is able to reestablish communications with NASA and let them know he is alive, we see the scientists and administrators at NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) rally to find solutions to keep Watney alive and get him home. The team on Earth is made up of a great ensemble of familiar and lesser known actors including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Mackenzie Davis, and Benedict Wong. We also check in with the other five members of the Ares 3 crew: Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Michael Pe\u00f1a, and Jessica Chastain. Jeff Daniels, as the head of NASA, and Jessica Chastain, as Ares 3's commander, are both stand-outs playing competent, pragmatic, and decisive leaders. Between his performances in The Martian and in Steve Jobs as Apple president John Sculley (for which he should've received a Supporting Actor nomination), Daniels had a pretty good 2015. Chastain, no stranger to playing strong, badass characters, might be a bit young to be a mission commander, but she is completely believable as a good leader with natural authority. I know that if I were going to Mars, I'd feel secure with her as my mission commander.\n\nWhat sets The Martian apart from other science fiction movies is its heavy emphasis on science. It is based on a novel by Andy Weir which began as a blog in which Weir would present a problem facing an astronaut stranded on Mars, then research and post a solution. If one of his readers noticed something was incorrect or just seemed amiss, he would go back and fix the inaccuracy. The film adaptation's scientific accuracy has received the approval of NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, and for science enthusiasts (a.k.a. geeks) like myself, this is very exciting. However, whether or not everything in the film is 100% accurate is not as important as how problem solving and the scientific method are portrayed. Each life-threatening problem that Watney faces on Mars is entirely likely and the solutions are plausible. There's no moment where a character just tries something dangerous and hopes for the best-all the dangerous behavior in The Martian is backed up by meticulous calculations. I've never heard so many lines in a movie about how the math \"checks out.\" \n\nPerhaps most important of all, and most accurate to real scientific problem solving, is how Watney's rescue is a team effort. Science is about solving a problem in the best and most efficient way possible, and the characters in The Martian know that means putting several minds to work and accepting help. Watney solves the problems of living on Mars with the help of the people at NASA and JPL and uses the things left behind by his fellow crew members to help him survive (like the wood from a crucifix to start a fire). In an act of international cooperation between scientists-not governments-the head of the Chinese Space Agency volunteers their rocket booster to help send Watney a delivery of food and supplies. And it is a young, eccentric scientist working in Astrodynamics for another NASA mission (Donald Glover) who comes up with the daring plan to get Watney home. \n\n\nMatt Damon has no one to act against in his scenes on Mars, but he still gives an engaging, lively performance that fills out all of his scenes and keeps the movie's pace flowing steadily. Through his video logs he indirectly addresses the audience which is an obvious, but effective, way to engage viewers and let us know what Watney is doing and why. His scenes on Mars are compelling and funny, too-demonstrating that having a positive attitude is important to persevering through any life-or-death situation. The Martian caught a lot of flak from critics for being submitted to the Golden Globe Awards as a comedy, but it is a pretty funny movie. Watney makes jokes and wisecracks throughout the film, which Damon is great at delivering. Perhaps in addition to raising interest in science, The Martian will also make people realize that science fiction does not always have to be dark and dour.\n\nThe Martian presents science fiction in a way we rarely see done successfully: as a non-esoteric, engaging blend of real science and entertainment. I loved the pro-science message of The Martian and I hope it does get people more interested in science and the universe. I enjoyed The Martian when I saw it in theaters, but when I watched it again recently...I loved it. I wish this movie were a stronger contender for Best Picture and I think I'll always be surprised that Ridley Scott did not receive a nomination for Best Director. Every shot of The Martian brims with serious, honest effort and execution and at the helm is Ridley Scott. Damon managed to snag an Oscar nomination for Best Actor which he is unfortunately unlikely to win, but which he completely deserves. \n\nIn Interstellar, my favorite movie of 2014, Damon played an astronaut whom others believed to represent \"the best of us;\" however, when put to the test, he demonstrated the worst sides of human nature. The characters in The Martian, are truly the best of us because they are able to put aside selfish impulses and rise to the occasion when a fellow human is in need. It is an ideal vision of NASA, but an immensely satisfying one. Everyone snaps into action, puts their brains to work, and sets aside self-interests-even if it means accepting help from other countries--and works together. If there ever is a manned mission to Mars, I imagine that it will bear many similarities to the expedition presented in The Martian; and hopefully, unlike the fictional mission, the real mission will be disaster-free. However, if you were stuck on Mars, you'd want people like the characters in The Martian working to keep you alive and get you home.",

            "content": "An astronaut's greatest fear: being left alone in space. There's nobody to keep you company -- nobody to keep you alive. Nothing to rely on but human instinct and, of course, potatoes. We humans rarely find ourselves in ideal situations. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is forced into a particularly problematic situation in Ridley Scott's 2015 movie, The Martian. He's stranded on Mars, impaled by an antenna, and presumed dead by all of earth. Not to mention an insufficient food supply and no way to phone home. But Mark's a botanist, and these are problems that a botanist is trained to solve. This movie must be seen by anyone who, like myself, loves great adventures that exhibit the wonders of science and the tenacity of human ingenuity.\n    The plot is relatively straightforward. The 6 person crew of the Ares 3 mission are busy performing experiments and engaging in some lively banter when they are alerted (a little too late) to an oncoming martian dust storm of death. They decide that they need to abandon the mission and blast away from Mars lest their rocket get destroyed by the storm. But in the dark chaos of the storm, some debris hits Mark Watney and throws him back out of sight, The crew leaves him there, presumably dead. But he isn't. He wakes up the next morning with shrapnel in his stomach and begins his epic journey of survival. Using his super-genius mind, he manages to solve any problem thrown his way (and there were plenty). In the meantime, NASA, after announcing Watney's death, find out that he is still alive and do everything within their power to get him back. Everybody in the movie, from NASA to the crew to Watney, as Watney says, \"science the shit out of it.\"\n    Watney's first and arguably most important breakthrough was growing potatoes using a combination of astronaut poop, martian soil, and self-manufactured water. As the first human to grow anything on Mars, Mark technically colonized Mars. He proceeds to find an ingenious method to communicate with Houston which gives him encouragement to begin formulating a plan to get himself home. An incredible team effort from JPL, NASA, and the Ares 3 crew make Watney's return possible.\n    So many times in movies, science is used as a shackle, an antagonist-- something that prevents heroic characters from doing their heroic things. It was refreshing to watch a mainstream sci-fi film that featured science and portrayed it in a positive light. Science is what allowed Watney to survive and thrive. Science was the hero. The key to this unique portrayal of science was that the science wasn't boring. It was pragmatic and fascinating to watch. And there was a healthy amount of humor to prevent Watney, NASA, JPL, and the crew from seeming like their stereotypes. The characters were approachable and made me want to team up with them to solve the problems that they were facing. The movie did a good job staying away from making the incredibly smart characters seem like elitists. The attitude of the movie encourages science and critical thinking which are skills becoming increasingly valuable in society today. In the Martian, Matt Damon was a great actor but science was the star.\n\n-- Johann Kailey-Steiner",

An unexpectedly strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), forcing them to hastily leave the planet. During the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and lost in the storm; the last telemetry from his suit indicates no signs of life. With Watney believed dead, and the storm worsening by the second, mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) orders the remaining crew to take off and return to their orbiting vessel Hermes without him. Watney awakens after the storm to a low oxygen warning, in pain, and makes his way to the \"Hab\" (hypocoristic for \"habitat\"), the crew's base of operations. He removes a piece of antenna from his suit's biomonitor-which caused the erroneous life-sign readings-which has lodged in his torso, forcing him to perform self-surgery. He begins a video diary and realizes that his only chance of rescue is the arrival of the Ares IV crew at the Schiaparelli crater, 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) away, in four years. Calculating that he has enough food to last only 300 sols (roughly 309 days), Watney, a botanist, improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with human waste, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes saved for a Thanksgiving meal. He begins to modify the only functional rover to make long journeys across Mars to reach the rescue spot. Eventually he finds a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring \"the Martian\" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return...\n\nThe Martian received positive reviews, with critics commending the visual effects, musical score, scientific accuracy, writing, dialogue and the film's likeability, largely due to Matt Damon's performance. Variety reported, \"Critics are calling the film a funny, thrilling ride, and a return to form for [Ridley] Scott after The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings fell flat.\" According to Robert Zubrin, commenting in The Guardian, \"[the film] is the first genuine Mars movie. It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of exploring Mars, as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially either shoot 'em ups or horror films. It does not engage in fantasy: no monsters, no magic, no Nazis. However, there are a number of technical mistakes.\" Writing for the New York Post, Lou Lumenick considered the film to be Scott's and Damon's best and thought that it is a \"straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of Interstellar.\"  Manohla Dargis, of The New York Times, stated that the film, \"involves a dual journey into outer and inner space, a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway, space is the place where he's physically marooned, but also where his mind is set free\", from a film director, whose \"great, persistent theme is what it means to be human\". Negative reviews focused on the lack of character depth or atmosphere. Jaime N. Christley, writing in Slant Magazine, commented, \"It goes in for the idea of texture, tics, and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity. ... It hardly seems interested in its characters or in any depiction of their work, settling instead for types of characters and kinds of scenes, correctly placed among the pendulum swings of Watney's dramatic journey.\" In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors \"are treated as accessories\", and that the director is \"workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian - that's the point. But if we can't feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?\" In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: \"Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott's two masterpieces - Alien and Blade Runner - it's not even on the same continent.\"\n\n\"The Martian\" is a visually and effect wise nice sci-fi adventure about survival and exploration of deep space. It has a standard castaway plot, but what could\u00b4ve have been more dramatic and emotional ends up as a predictable and pretentious flag waving space story with a Matt Damon on autopilot and a too thin characterisation in general. Everything feels so convenient, politically correct and from A-Z in how everything develops to Watney\u00b4s advantage despite some bumps in the road. Ridley Scott used to own this genre, but has become so formulaic and boring in his direction and chosen projects these days. There\u00b4s no sparks at all from the magic Scott used to present in films like \"Alien\" and \"Blade Runner\". The issue here is as well Damon who has a certain range as an actor, but never comes beyond a specific point that would take him further as an actor. \"The Martian\" is just a disappointment on many levels in my opinion and Scott fails to handle a range of serious psychological issues and scientific aspects about space which would\u00b4ve given us a better film most likely. Or it just simply has a shitty novel as the foundation...",

The Martian starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Jeff Daniels; brings a thrilling adventure almost as if you were there every step of Matt Damon's journey on Mars. Mark Watney (Damon) is an astronaut voyaging on Mars with his colleagues when suddenly the voyage takes a turn for the worst and leaves Mark left behind on Mars all alone believed to be dead. However to much surprise Mark is in fact alive, now he must survive  in solitude while trying desperately to return back to Earth. Mark becomes a \"martian\" surviving by farming on mars, and takes Mars by the rains while he awaits for his trip back to Earth, it's a long crazy thrilling ride as Mark does the impossible. The movie captures Damon's renowned acting ability while providing some comedic relief, with an excellent cast to provide the movie with everything it doesn't already have really completing the movie. However because of the small size of the cast at some points in the movie you might feel almost alone since the majority of the movie focuses on one man all one. While very interesting there's almost no variety in the setting with very little change, not to mention that almost every scene not on mars is very similar adding to the blandness of the movie. Overall I give the movie 4.5 out of 5 stars everything complements each other very well the movie is very interesting I promise you the movie is well worth it.",

But there are too many errors in the movie too like during the time it gets too dramatic in the end and shows the stuff that could really not happen or is not possible but in the end it's just a movie.

Abandoned on Mars, our hero is a botanist, and so resourceful, he does more than survive the improbable time it takes to rescue him. It is well paced and shot with flair, but no bombast, easily one of Scott's best films.\n\nIt carries a decidedly modern, PC message. The white male hero is saved by women, blacks, orientals, Mexicans, etc - an anti-Trump undertone throughout. Two bizarre casting choices by Brit Scott of two of his fellows, Sean Bean and the impossibly named one from 10 Years a Slave. Neither adds a thing to this movie.\n\nSo forget Star Wars and Star Trek, this is the kind of sic-fi we've been missing, where effects serve the story and not the other way around. Near great.",

            "content": "When a fierce storm on Mars cuts off astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) from his colleagues, they fear the worst. Their commander, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR), has to make a critical decision. Blast off, leaving Watney behind, or stay and risk the lives of all the crew. She chooses to leave, not knowing that Watney is still alive. For Watney, his options are clear. Another mission to the Red Planet isn't expected for four years and he has enough food to last for 50 days. He needs to \"science the shit\" out of everything to stay alive until help can come.\n\nTHE MARTIAN is director Ridley Scott's (EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS) latest masterpiece... and it is a masterpiece. Sometime, hopefully in the near future, a few brave/lucky/crazy men and women will travel 140 million miles to Mars. For the rest of us, this film is the closest we're going to get. But for 134 minutes, we're right there with Watney and the team from NASA, through every success and failure (and there are plenty of both) as they push themselves to find creative solutions that will keep Watney alive and bring him home.\n\nThankfully, this is not a story about American patriotism or even American ingenuity. It's a story of perseverance, having a can-do attitude, cooperation and, most of all, how science can be sexy. There, I said it. Sexy science. (Who knew? To tell you the truth, I did. Just like Watney, I also majored in Botany in undergrad.) I have no doubt that NASA and other space agencies around the world will receive a flood of applications to their astronaut training programs in the coming months, but if it just means that more kids will want to study science in school, I'll be satisfied.\n\nBy now, the backstory of this story is legendary. Author Andy Weir, a computer programmer and himself the son of a particle physicist father and an electrical engineer mother, first put the book on his website in 2011 where he serialised it for free one chapter at a time. At the request of his fans, he then self-published it through Amazon, pricing it at just 99 cents, which is the minimum price allowed. The Kindle edition quickly sold 35,000 copies, garnering the attention of a number of publishers who had previously rejected his manuscript. In 2013, he sold the print rights to Crown Publishing Group for just US$100,000. (I hope he got a lot more than that for the movie rights.)\n\nThe book was adapted into a screenplay for the film by Drew Goddard, who started his career as a staff writer on the TV series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and its spinoff, ANGEL. He later penned the screenplay for the 2008 film, CLOVERFIELD, and shared co-writing duties on the 2013 film, WORLD WAR Z, which starred Brad Pitt.\n\nThis is Matt Damon's best work in years. He plays Watney as a guy who is both nerdy and cool at the same time. We cheer for him because he's Mr. Spock with a sense of humour and humanity. Many critics have made comparisons between Watney and Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks' character in the film, CAST AWAY). More than that though, are the similarities between Watney's GoPro camera (itself a star of the film) and Noland's volleyball, Wilson. In THE MARTIAN, we travel along with Watney on his journey as he documents both his work and his mood to the video camera. It's a much better narration device than having dead silence or watching the guy mutter to himself as he goes about his activities.\n\nThe film's supporting cast of Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig and others all bring \"the right stuff\" to the film as well, making it a real delight to watch (much like the cast of APOLLO 13 did with that film). Entertainment Weekly, in its review of the book in 2014, was less than impressed with Weir's treatment of these secondary characters. Not having read the book, I don't know if EW was just being harsh or if the characters were more fleshed out for the movie.\n\nAlthough I thought it was an excellent film, I did have a couple of nits that needed picking. For me, the planet wasn't forbidding enough. The sky wasn't red (or butterscotch) enough, the temperature wasn't cold enough (temps there apparently average minus 63 degrees C), and the gravity wasn't weak enough (62 percent that of Earth, apparently). I was expecting Mark to bounce around a bit as he was walking, which didn't happen at all. I also had a problem with the Chinese space agency coming to NASA's rescue. I understand that this wasn't changed from the original but, to me, it seemed like a nice way to get Chinese government approval of the film and more box office revenue. (Perhaps Andy Weir was thinking down the road when he wrote the novel.)\n\nDefinitely go see this film - it's an Oscar contender. If you decide to see it in 3D (as I did), make sure you sit in the middle of the cinema for the best view and the best light.",

Still it works as a faux replay of a story that we know will end well - it is just the process of getting to that happy ending that we need to watch.  Scott, aided immensely by Matt Damon (playing his usual average Joe), keeps the plot moving for more than two hours with intermittent crises and successes.  The rest of the cast play as a collective, trying to rescue him.  You can feel the problem-solving happening.  All the pieces fit together.

He manages to \"science the shit\" out of his situation and survive on left-behind rations and locally grown vegetables. He scavenges communications gear and contacts Earth. NASA has to decide what to do with the marooned astronaut, taking into account technical resources, orbital mechanics, and public relations.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the science is pretty good in this, although I've read the violent sandstorm that starts this modern-day Robinson Crusoe tale is physically impossible in the thin Martian atmosphere Watney's ingenuity and technical skills are impressive, but perhaps not completely unrealistic for a cross-trained botanist. The visuals are stunning, and the production values are excellent. The film doesn't break any new narrative ground, but it's very well made.",

            "content": "During a space exploration to Mars, a powerful storm forces the crew of astronauts to evacuate early. In their rush to leave, they lose track one of their crew members; they believe him to be dead. Against the odds, he lives, but he now finds himself alone stranded on the red planet. He knows it will take at least four years for a rescue mission to reach him, and that he has limited air and food supply. It inspires and thrills with a realistic feel, but at its core, it is extremely personal. Matt Damon is excellent. For much of the movie, he is alone talking to into the camera, speaking to himself while working, or using only physical expressions to covey his thoughts and feelings. The character does not wallow in self-pity. He knows he must channel his energy into surviving; that gives the movie a more optimistic perspective. The movie celebrates his triumphs, shows his sarcasm and humor that keep him going. There are still moments of sadness, fear, and defeat, but the main character is admiringly resilient. Damon conveys this range very well, and director Ridley Scott captures it all perfectly. The stark but beautiful rendering of the Martian landscape is powerful. It expresses the still loneliness and insignificance that the main character is feeling. While Matt Damon is superb, there is a strong supporting cast too. Characters on earth argue and debate how to handle the situation. This advances the plot and creates an interesting the subplot where the entire NASA organization works together to rescue their man. The events on earth also give important tonal breaks from the stillness of the Mars setting and make the move more exciting. There is part of you that knows things will work out, but this movie is more about how the lone astronaut survives and how some of the smartest people on earth plan the rescue mission. How they accomplish the impossible is completely fascinating in itself. Everything works exquisitely here with the story, characters, acting, direction, use of music, and visuals. Despite the grounded premise, this will go down as a classic science fiction movie.",

With no one for company and no entertainment except the music and TV shows that the crew left behind on their laptops, Watney keeps video logs to discuss his plans, his efforts, his failures, and his opinion of disco music. These video logs work as an excellent narrative and comedic device, providing both explanation for Watney's ideas and action, as well as giving some buoyancy to the peril of Watney's situation.\n\nFull review: http://reelrambling.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-martian.html",

Even though I was already familiar with the plot and aware of the ending, I don't believe I exhaled fully until the very last scene of the movie!  Watney was definitely hope and resilience personified, wasn't he?  It was uplifting to witness the perspective of Matt Damon's character manifested in the way he tackled his situation and circumstances; he made a choice to embrace one of my most favorite quotes that resonated so profoundly when I first heard it uttered by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne in _Shawshank Redemption_, \"Get busy living or get busy dying.\" \n \nThere is wonderfully exhilarating twist in the movie that reminded me of one of my favorite Bible verses that I kept formulating in my mind during scenes of the NASA collective working feverishly to bring Watney home safely and crowds congregating in front of jumbo screens, praying for a successful outcome was Matthew 18:20, \"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them\"... \n \nI thought it was awesome to see Jessica Chastain in another sci-fi movie as I instantly recognized her as Murphy from _Interstellar_; not until after the movie did I remember that Matt Damon was also in the same movie playing the more manic character, which was completely different from the more stable and pragmatic character he portrayed in this current movie! \n\nOf note, I was so impressed with the director for casting Donald Glover in the pivotal role of Rich Purnell, portrayed in a positive light when we are all too often bombarded with negative images of young African-American males in the media...                                          \n\nSurprisingly, the film score was not as ethereally majestic as I had expected it would be as I imagined it would be as captivating as that of _Gravity_ and _Interstellar_; however, I still plan to purchase the movie when it becomes available on DVD and immerse myself in the minutiae as I usually do during encore viewings of movies I am compelled to watch again...",

While it is kind of a mixture of many different genres - from drama to comedy and action-adventure - 'Martian' is really all about its main star, Matt Damon.\n\nAt the outset of the film, we see how an unexpected incident on a planet that is millions of miles away can lead to a series of events that unites the entire globe. The majority of the film centers around the actions Damon's character (Mark Watney) takes to stay alive as the only living organism on Mars. While Earth scrambles to rescue him - not an easy feat, considering the distance - we get to see how Watney solves various problems and overcomes challenges ranging from growing crops on Mars to human error. There are plenty of things that happen over the course of the film that hold viewers' attention, and there is plenty of entertainment value delivered.\n\nWhile 'Martian' is basically \"The Matt Damon Show,\" the rest of the all-star cast delivers for the most part, as well. From Jessica Chastain as the commander of the NASA spacecraft Hermes to fellow NASA team members portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean, there are plenty of good performances to go around (although it's odd seeing Kristen Wiig in a somewhat serious role). Still, none of them can compete with the screen time given to Damon. And while there are some scenes that make viewers say \"Really?\", all is pretty much forgiven considering it's Hollywood, after all. Perhaps 'Martian's biggest weakness is its bloated runtime, which could easily have been pared down.\n\nSure, 'The Martian' is a bit overrated. But the film is one of Ridley Scott's better efforts of late, and should be held in high regard when it comes to movies that take place beyond our planet.",

            "content": "In the not too distant future, in a planet far, far away...\n\nThe Martian\n\nMark Watney (Matt Damon) is stuck on Mars! After Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) ordered Martinez (Michael Pena), Johansson (Kate Mara in her most fantastic 2015 sci-fi role), Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Vogel (Aksel Hennie) to leave him after his suit was perforated in a storm, Watney wakes up, and just makes it to the habitat, where he repairs the suit, and makes his first video log. Rather than give up like the less prepared and less skilled would, Watney defies the statement of NASA director Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and sciences the $h1+ out of Mars in a realistic manner. I do not feel like we should define this as science fiction, because it is fiction by the loosest definition: a story that has not happened in our world. It is a scientifically accurate fictional story. The length may seem overwhelming at first (almost two and a half hours), but they make the pacing work out, as well as have it make sense, both scientifically and storywise. We alternate between Watney, NASA, and more towards the end, the crew of Ares III. Mars is bright in the picture, because wherever they filmed this, you feel like it could really be Mars, and the establishing shots of the planets look amazing. I could believe they launched a camera into space to take those shots (Based on their budget, not too likely), and their use of CGI is minimal, which helped make it feel more like a movie based on a true story than a movie based on a fictional book. However, it is so plausible in terms of science and the humanity; they bring up the larger parts, but this is ultimately a story of survival and human compassion. All of this goes well with Harry Gregson-Williams' compelling soundtrack that hits all the right beats except the hilarious ones. That's right, for comic relief, we get Watney's lighter moments post-abandonment set to 70s music assumably from Lewis' collection she got to bring with her. His reaction to her taste (if you can call it that according to Watney) and the use of said songs at the right moments make for laughter to keep us from falling asleep and/or providing lighter moments. There's a bit more swearing though, especially for a PG-13 movie, but I'm not complaining, because the scenario called for it, and the character development was spot-on: we get to really care for Mark Watney, because we get to experience his sense of humor and see how the crew feels about abandoning him, and see how people really do have an inherent need to save each other, even if it's just one person, from lost hikers to abandoned astronauts on distant planets. The Martian is perfect: it has Guardians of the Galaxy's sense of humor with the true-life-story genre and the language of a sailor!",

Sure it's realistic (except that silly ending, c'mon?!) & amazing to look at but I got seriously uninterested halfway through. I can't believe Matt Damon was nominated an Oscar for this.

Martian brings in a bit of a twist by allowing home base, Houston, to become part of the show or solution. This is one aspect of the movie I enjoyed. It was also obvious that the science and physics advisers were well represented. \n\nThat being said, it did get a bit much with one impossible, impractical, no-way-it's-ever-gonna-work event after another just happens to, well, work. So the recovery team effort, science, and acting all worked well, but the movie was really just an action film in a far away place. Where it excelled in intelligence and the impossible action thrill, it lacked in depth of meaning, for space exploration has always been akin to man's greater meaning, and with Martian its lack creates quite a contrast with its finer points.",

Both of these concepts could carry their own movies, and this becomes apparent while watching the movie. Both sides are equally as interesting as the other. What also amazes me is that with two radically different settings, they both feel like they're a part of the same movie. It also helps that this movie is very well acted and scripted, making this an overall great time at the movies.",

Comparisons with Castaway are inevitable. Perhaps I would love to see a crossover version of Mark Watney in Castaway. He could turn that island into Tokyo in 500 sols.",

This is a great family action movie. At first i found matt damons character annoyingly positive and thought there was way too much space jargon. Also the movie leaves out a lot of details of day to day and just focuses more on the rescue instead, which itself at times seems too perfect and unbelievable. As it goes on tho, it def get better and the stakes get raised. The tension toward the end is palpable. Movie shows that a postive attitude, ingenuity, and determination will get u anywhere and out of anything.",
