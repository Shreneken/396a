The screenplay isn't a thing for me despite the fact that I'm not interested in bank stuff, so I was a bit confused all throughout, but I absolutely loved the idea that some important vocabulary was explained in a more usual way, for example in the kitchen, brilliant idea. It is certainly fast-paced, but not as much as I couldn't understand a thing. Loved the performances, especially Christian Bale was this chill, antisocial dude, who knew that he is right. I liked the way the story was told, where we had 3 different groups of people who wanted to scam the system because they knew the system is already scuffed. Although one thing resonated with me like anything in this movie, where in the end credits, there's a sentence, which says that the Bale's character invests in one single thing: water.

Not only does this movie entertain you throughout its entire runtime, it also informs you extremely well about what really happened in 2008. Pulling this off is incredible.\nWhen it comes to movies, there are always certain formulas that often lead to success, like a good superhero movie or a romantic comedy between the famous actress and the regular guy. But The Big Short doesn't use any of that. It tries something new in so many aspects. Its unique style of filmmaking is refreshing and I sure hope to see more of it in the future.\nWhen going into detail about this movie, the first thing that has to be talked about is the way it explains the economy in its story. People study for years to be able to understand what is going on in economics. But what if I tell you, that it takes Margot Robbie in a bubble-bath one minute to explain mortgage bonds to you. The film's story is very ambitious. The audience has to understand what's going on to be able to enjoy the movie. And this challenge was mastered with flying colours.\nEarlier I talked about how The Big Short doesn't use any of Hollywood's success formulas. I wasn't exactly honest. Cast big names - make much money. Yes, there are many famous actors in this movie. But that is good, because it relies so heavily on the incredible acting. If you don't buy one performance, one character, the whole story falls apart for you. But it doesn't. Literally everybody in this movie is amazing.\nIn conclusion, The Big Short is different from other movies. It's a comedy, a drama and a documentary at the same time. And it's f*cking awesome.",

Utilizing boldly creative editing techniques and a madcap approach to incorporating manic snippets of pop culture into the fabric of the film, we are given an outrageous, funny, and yet simultaneously terrifying portrait of consumer excess gone wrong. Through the masterstroke of employing the heightened witty brilliance of key players such as Christian Bale and Steve Carell, a film which might otherwise be watched and then set aside is rendered fresh and timeless; we can come back to it time and again for its risky and yet rewarding fusion of comedy and real life economic tragedy. Note to the viewer: instead of attempting to fully piece together the elusive ins and outs of finance, simply allow your head to swim; the brilliance of the material is not found in its technical substance, but in the innovative way in which it is distilled and delivered.",

            "content": "It's 2005 in America, and while a vast majority of the nation's bankers, investors and homeowners are reaping the benefits of a booming housing market, a select few recognize the telltale signs of a tenuous bubble and invest accordingly. First they're laughed out of a dozen different boardrooms - mortgages, they're reminded, are the safest long-term investments in the land and have never, ever failed - but, after wiping the tears from their eyes, a number of large banks are perfectly happy to accept their cash in a series of long shot bets against the \"sure thing.\" This displeases the money behind the money, profit-hungry capitalists who see these as reckless investments, and the pressure of their growing discontent results in a number of tight races to the finish line. Will the backers pull out before the market inevitably collapses? Can the fat cats continue to win in the wake of such great losses?\n\nWell, you probably already know the answer to that one. And, if you've been paying attention for the last fifteen years, you know how on-the-money these naysayers were about subprime mortgages and adjustable rate loans. Therein lies the rub; we know how it all shakes out, but we don't know which runners will still be in the race and on their feet when their collective prescience is proven valid. We also don't really know who to root for. The inclination is to back the guys on the fringe of the establishment, those smart and bold enough to call the banks on their mistakes and jab them right where it hurts. But, as one character so deftly explains on the floor of a Las Vegas casino, if those guys win, that means millions of Americans will lose their retirements and their homes. As someone who was personally affected by the collapse, that really hit home. At least one side of this story had the decency to step back, if only for a moment, and realize the broader implications of their numbers game, and to address the desperate futility of it all. Inevitably, everybody loses except the house, because the house, we've learned, is too big to fail.\n\nI wasn't surprised to learn, after the fact, that the source volume was written by the same man behind Moneyball. The comparison sprung naturally to mind: both do a wonderful job of digging into the nitty-gritty, of explaining the rules of the shadow games, without losing the audience to impatience or disinterest. Very smart, very raw and very effectively witty when the tension gets too thick and everyone needs to reset with a deep breath and an exhale.",

            "content": "The critically acclaimed comedy-drama directed by Adam McKay, The Big Short is centered around the basics of the ideology of realism, from the nature of man being selfish and rational acting to survival of said man not being guaranteed. Following multiple perspectives in and around Wall Street leading up to the housing crisis of 2008, few individuals caught onto the idea of an economic bubble and were able to benefit from the failure of United States economy. However, benefiting, these individuals chose to fight for their own self-interest rather than the interest of the many. The Big Short also demonstrates many ideologies pertaining to the economy, such as: structuralism, mercantilism, and liberal market economies. All with their own specific characteristics, these principles, making up the economy of the United States, created a competitive nature that favored the self-interested, leading to its own demise.  \nThe main goal of realist actors, in the case of The Big Short being individuals and eventually the government of the United States, is to protect their own self-interest while also expanding it rapidly. As seen with the two bragging mortgage brokers that Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his colleagues' interview before discovering the beginnings of the housing bubble of 2008; Self-interest was the only goal of, at least, these two mortgage brokers as they explain that the more mortgages they write, the more money they earn. Without doing their due diligence with the mortgages being written people were getting homes coupled with mortgages that they had no way of paying off. However, the mortgage brokers at the time, specifically these two in Florida, were only interested in competition with one another in terms of amassing profit. Baum's initial confusion of their interview \"I don't get it why are they confessing?\" in response to the brokers boastfulness towards their shady business practices and lifestyle was clarified by his colleague, Porter Collins (Hamish Linklater): \"They're not confessing they're bragging.\" These young mortgage brokers are so caught up in how much money their making that when they are \"bragging\" they don't realize they're breaking the law. Mark Baum and his team, being rational thinkers, view this \"bragging\" as if they are confessing to their ill-fated business practices that have the sole goal of benefiting their own self-interest. Thomas Hobbes' famously stated, \"Government is necessary not because man is bad but because man is by nature more individualistic than social.\" Hobbes' take on the necessity of a common governing rule applies to these mortgage brokers as they are very individualistic and concerned with their own success rather than giving any relevance to morals. \nFurthering the efforts of the mortgage brokers were the ratings agencies that assessed the risk of the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that was purchased from the big bank who purchased the initial mortgage from the local bank who was the lender of the mortgage. Promising the homeowner would earn their initial investment back with additional interest is how the bigger banks convinced the individual to buy into a CDO, which the bank made commission on. Collateralized debt obligations are only a collection of different mortgages, so when a few mortgages fail to be paid upon, the CDO fails. Earning a profit and commission on their assessment of the CDO, the ratings agency would inflate their evaluation in hopes that the big bank would not go to another ratings agency and retrieve their desired rating. Yet again fueled by self-interest, the ratings agencies were lying to the big banks who in turn were lying to the homeowner, eventually invalidated the survival of the individual. This constant competitive nature is highlighted by realist ideology through Thomas Hobbe's The Leviathan: \"Competition of riches, honor, command, or other power inclineth to contention, enmity, and war, because the way of one competitor to the attaining of his desire is to kill, subdue, supplant, or repel the other\" (Hobbes 11). Given a pessimistic take on the nature of man, Hobbes' belief that man will naturally fight for his own self-interest first is illustrated throughout The Big Short. \nOn the opposing side of the CDO's and rating agencies were the people that shorted, or bet against, the housing market of the United States. This is only important in the case of a realist and structuralist perspective because as the majority of the nation suffered through the crisis, a few wise traders and bankers were able to benefit. Instead of making the housing bubble public, with what little validity they had, these traders were more focused using the future collapse as a method of profit, as they bet against the economy of the United States. However, the underlying socioeconomic class division ultimately led to the economy's crash as the rich and upper class attempted to maximize profits by exploiting the lower class's wealth. This exploitation can be accredited to the upper class of Wall Street either being ignorant of the law and just focused on money or consciously breaking the law knowing that they'd receive a governmental bailout in the form of the taxpayer. The Wall Street bailout funded by the taxpayer is a clear form of structuralism as the state acted on behalf of the upper class that exploited the social class of producers. This bailout of these banks can also be attributed to a mercantilist economic policy; similar to structuralism, The Big Short portrays the economy of the United States at the time as rewarding for those who attempted to accumulate wealth because, according to mercantilism, this wealth ensures national security. The liberal market economy is also portrayed in The Big Short as the film is centered around the corporate governance of the market with the earnings and share prices being public. The inter-firm relations of market competition as well as both contracting and subcontracting with mortgages being purchased by big banks on Wall Street then eventually morphed into CDO's. \nIn conclusion, Adam McKay's The Big Short employs many international relations related policies as the movie follows the downfall of the economy in 2008. These policies were not the foundation of the United States economy but were merely absorbed over time as rational thinking and self-interested individuals arose. Still following a liberal market economy, The United States has moved away from the competitive and exploiting economic ideologies of structuralism and mercantilism. The United States now supports a more neoliberalist system which favors market freedom and privatization of the economy.",

Christian Bale, Pitt, Gosling, and Carell might not give awards bait performances, but they prop up a solid ensemble that does not truthfully have many standouts. Ryan Gosling's humour in both narration and exceptional performance, perhaps, but I just like Gosling. McKay's narrative style might be abrasive for some. I thought a few jokes and fourth wall moments felt \"corny\", for lack of a better word. The randomness of having the likes of Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez explaining mortgage banking terms really took things to a strange level without fully descending into a madhouse. \n\nI do not have a great deal negative to say about The Big Short.

In retrospective, it is a valuable history lesson on how unregulated the securities market was before the 2008 subprime crisis, that everyone should learn about so that, hopefully, history will not repeat itself. \nClassified as a comedy on Prime due to the light-hearted tone of the dialogue and the innumerable, fast-paced anecdotes about people of all walks of life who were in one way or another personally involved with mortgage-backed funds (the safest type of mortgage backed securities, with highest ratings and low risk of default), collateralised debt obligations (the \"crap\" mortgage-backed securities with deceiving ratings and highest default risk) and swaps (a derivative financial instrument which, in this particular case, was purchased by people who already owned interests on the \"crap\" mortgage backed securities/CDOs to give them the option to sell those in exchange for other financial instruments (the nature of the financial instruments acquired through the exercise of the SWAP option was not specified in the movie) at a moment of their choice; while holding the SWAPS, the short position holders had to pay premiums if the underlying securities (the crap ones \u2013 or CDOs) were going up and only started receiving premiums once they started to plummet, and then they were eventually disposed of by actioning the swaps thus making millions in the \"coup\").\nThe anecdotes range from the stripper who already owns 5 mortgage-financed houses, to the law-abiding tenant paying his rent to a defaulting landlord and eventually getting evicted along with his wife and children, to the ex-bartender made financial advisor who was paid incentives to give away as many mortgage loans as possible without scrutinising important details about the borrowers, such as, for example, whether they had a job!!!\nThis movie covers all the main culprits of the so called \"crisis of the subprime\". Easy, free-for-all mortgages without proper borrower scrutiny, which eventually led to default payments (subprime mortgages, which originated the high risk CDOs), financial advisors without proper training, financial advisors with personal interests in the sale of CDOs (watch out for the infamous restaurant scene where Baum meets the CDO manager), the composition of CDOs where the same securities were sold over and over again to different investors, in different packages along the line with the same underlying mortgages in a ratio of 20-1, the fraudulent ratings of CDOs which were consistently rated AA or more, with the Rating Agencies turning a blind eye on their composition due to personal interests, i.e. fees received from the financial institutions whose products they were rating, the panic that news on default mortgage payments generated on investors who had been buying mortgage-backed securities, either funds or \"bonds\", who, by retrieving their investments generated the collapse of the financial institutions selling them (after all, if you lend 50,000,000 $ to mortgage borrowers, all your bank is going to get back is that amount plus interest, so how can you pay 1,000,000,000 $ plus premiums back to investors buying mortgage-backed securities?).\nIt probably seems by now that this is a bleak movie, a confidence-shaker to the system, and there is no way around it: it is. In the end the banks are saved by the Governments through tax payers money and it is everyday people who end up being blamed for the Downfall of economies everywhere (rise of right-wing movements, anti-immigration politics, etc) \nBut it is also good to remind ourselves of how much more transparent, regulated and solid the financial markets have become since the Economic cataclysm of 2008: sometimes, as in this case, History teaches us painful lessons that change the World for the better.\nNow personally, being a woman and thus a feminist, I think the movie could be improved with a little bit less (ok, none at all) explicit female nudity. I don't think that to illustrate the fact that a character is a stripper you actually need to see her \"on the job\" no more than you need to watch a gastroenterologist performing a live colonoscopy to understand he is a doctor, right? This voyeurism aspect of the movie is detrimental to its perceived value to all audiences, and good instructing movies dealing with issues with global impact, which we already don't have many of, should be dealt with in the most \"umbrella\"-like way as possible, reaching to all, respecting all, alienating none.",
