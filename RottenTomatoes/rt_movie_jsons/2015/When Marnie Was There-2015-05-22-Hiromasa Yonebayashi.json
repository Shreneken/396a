It moves to compare both children and their experiences as orphans as well as show the main character's struggle to accept the love of her foster parents. The connection Anna has with Marnie as beautifully written and shows the lengths she will go to take care of her. The fact that Marnie is an apparition from a long time ago binds the film a bit because it must have the eventual reveal of who she was in the past. The story of the reveal is a bit overstretched and doesn't wrap things up as nicely as you would expect.",

            "content": "'When Marnie Was There' may not be one of Studio Ghibli's best films ('Princess Mononoke', 'Spirited Away', 'My Neighbour Totoro', 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Grave of the Fireflies).\n\nBut even when Ghibli are not at their best they still produce films that are better than most studios at their worst, while 'Tales from Earthsea' is from personal opinion their weakest effort it does have enough to make it watchable still. 'When Marnie Was There' drags a little at times particularly in the first half an hour or so, which is somewhat aimless, and some of the supporting characters could have been much better fleshed out.\n\nThese flaws aside, 'When Marnie Was There' is still a real charmer, and ranks possibly around higher middle of Studio Ghibli's filmography. Its best assets have to be the animation and the music. The animation is simply wondrous, the colours are both atmospheric and ethereal, all the characters are appealingly drawn in distinctive Studio Ghibli fashion and the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed and gorgeously idyllic, was also really impressed by how Anna's facial expressions conveyed so much. The music is incredibly beautifully orchestrated and sears with emotion , nostalgia and atmosphere, often appropriately gentle and sometimes melancholic. \"Fire on the Outside\" is genuinely moving as well, not mawkish or over-sentimental at all.\n\nScripting warms the heart and moves the soul, the lack of humour not being an issue at all, and actually considering the story it would have felt very misplaced if it was included. The story, centring around Marnie and Anna's friendship, is haunting, heart-warming and often incredibly poignant with the right amount of mystery, the central friendship being charmingly and sometimes heart-wrenchingly portrayed. The message is a strong one, and gives the film an uplifting quality, if one is wondering how the message is written here it does succeed in not preaching too much.\n\nMarnie and Anna are likable, well-written characters , while the voice actors fill their roles sensitively.\n\nAll in all, not one of Studio Ghibli's finest but still a charmer. The DVD bought from Amazon was pricey, but at the end of the day it didn't feel like a waste of money. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

It definitely is very slow-paced and there are moments in the story where I could definitely feel how slowly it was moving.

However, as it gets into the mid-section of the movie and Marnie sub-enters, it starts to lack structure; things start to get confusing and are not properly explained. Too many things are left unfinished which gives \"When Marnie Was There\" a sense of bitter unsatisfaction. Nonetheless, this movie does a wonderful job at conveying strong emotions, tackling less things could have probably turned it into a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Dreamy serenity and emotional epiphanies with intrigue at every turn.\n\nHiromasa Yonebayashi's coming of age mystery anime When Marnie Was There (2014) is a moving picture worthy of Studio Ghibli's name. Ghibli's legendary hand drawn animation looks gorgeous, especially for all the splashes of water and glowing moonlight. The slick modern style mixed with Ghibli's heartfelt colors and lively motion look resplendent. When Marnie Was There is certainly one of their best looking features. Hiromasa Yonebayashi directs When Marnie Was There with sincere sympathy for his young heroine just trying to find herself and a friend. I thought he did a wonderful job following up Ghibli's then retired animation director god Hayao Miyazaki. When Marnie Was There is deeply touching character arcs, endearing charm, and thoughtful representation of the shy.\n\nJoan G. Robinson's original novel When Marnie Was There is a brilliant mystery book with a fantastic twist ending and a series of cleverly hidden clues, so it's no surprise that Ghibli bring the book to life with an earnest appreciation of mystery and intrigue that holds you in suspense.  Hiromasa Yonebayashi, Masashi Ando, and Keiko Niwa's writing for When Marnie Was There perfectly blends realistic dialogue and behavior of preteen girls with thoughtful reflections on friendship. When Marnie Was There asks us to be brave and make friends, enjoy parties, appreciate the rain, and live life to the fullest with no fear. All the simple pleasures of life are on full display in When Marnie Was There and Yonebayashi's innovative direction keeps you captivated by Robinson's narrative and Ghibli's cute animation.\n\nRie Matsuhara's gentle editing only cuts from scene to scene with a relaxed pace for a brisk 104 that never wears on you. Everything keeps moving along plot wise, but you get to enjoy the fun friendship between Anna and Marnie immediately, alongside Anna's journey into confidence. Atsushi Okui's cinematography is beautiful with wide shots of forests, swamps, moonlight, and mansions. He gives equal grace to water reflections and rowboats with his intimate close-up shots. I love how he frames the girls' faces throughout When Marnie Was There.\n\nYohei Taneda's production design has this realistic groundedness for the average homes and gorgeous lavish furnishings for Marnie's mansion. Yohei Taneda also did the art direction with a nice focus on the window light and moonlight appearing to make Marnie shine. Takeshi Imamura, Masashi Ando, and Akihiko Yamashita's visual effects are cool for characters fading in and out of light sources, the camera frame hazing for a dream sequence, and cute sudden splashes of water.\n\nTakatsugu Muramatsu's score for When Marnie Was There is affectionate and alive with a symphonic splendor that fits Studio Ghibli's animated bliss. Muramatsu uses the emotionally harrowing moments as music cues for heartfelt strings and tranquil piano melodies all throughout When Marnie Was There's endearing score.\n\nI adore the English Dub's voice cast for When Marnie Was There. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic as the lead Anna. She's genuine, awkward, endearing, frightened, shy, and confident all in one profoundly relatable role. Steinfeld's soft voice captures Anna's wallflower personality as well as her important desire for friendship with her voice full of longing. I love Kiernan Shipka's chipper and likable voice for Marnie. She breathes life into Marnie with her sublime voice acting and immediately loving voice. Shipka is a talented voice actress for sure. She makes the difference in making you believe that this girl is friendly and fun.\n\nGeena Davis is quite nice to hear as Anna's worried adopted mother. John C. Reilly is fun and kindly as Anna's nice carpenter uncle who takes her in for the Summer. Ellen Burstyn cameos as Marnie's mean nanny. You can hear Vanessa Williams' voice full of fondness as Hisako. Kathy Bates and Catherine O'Hara also have cameos. Lastly, Grey DeLisle is great as Anna's sweet Aunt who is nice to her for the Summer.\n\nIn the end, I think When Marnie Was There boasts riveting storytelling from director Hiromasa Yonebayashi. It's simply a lovely film that engaged me in the innocence of childhood and the scary fears of growing up.",

            "content": "I'm not really sure why this never gets high marks as the other Ghibli films. This movie is so masterfully done in bringing the character and the audience on a journey. At the core of the movie is a character, Anna, that doesn't believe she is loved. In her mind, she has ever reason to believe this is true - she was abandoned when her parents died, and has just found out that her adoptive mother gets subsidies to care for her. The movie then brings you on a journey with her to show her that she really is loved.\n\nHow? Spoilers: Her grandmother, Marnie, loved her and the entire movie is putting her into the love story between her grandmother and grandfather. I know some people see this as incestuous but it's not...It's just Freudian. I view it as her grandmother's love coming through to her.\n\nOn top of that, Anna is clearly gay. I remember watching this film the first time thinking it was subtext. On a rewatch, I was wrong. It's not subtext. It's supertext. It's so very clear that Anna is gay. Between her love interest relationship with Marnie and the fact that she feels so ostracized to the story taking place during Japanese Valentine's Day (Tanabata), which is based on two lovers separated by a river.\n\nAnyway, this film is a masterpiece. A masterwork in how to tell a story simply, beautifully, and profoundly.",

I found myself tuning out very quickly. I was looking for a reason to get into it but it never grabbed me.\n\nCharacters: 8\nYou immediately sympathize with Anna. She's an introvert with seemingly no place in the world. To make matters worse, she's prone to panic attacks. From the very beginning, she's a character you wish you could reach out to and protect. Learning her history and the source of her pain is the best part of the film. There were a few other characters that were memorable as well, but none so much as Anna.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nAnother strong suit of the film. Animations were crisp with strong attention to detail. One scene inside of an abandoned silo particularly stands out. The blend of darkness and destructive winds really place you in the moment and breathe life into a film that was otherwise dull.\n\nConflict: 4\n\nGenre: 8\nThe film isn't a favorite by any means and won't hold up against some of my other animated classics that I love. HOWEVER, I appreciate the animation style of the film and I also respected that it attempted to try something different. Even though it was a total miss, I give it the proper credit for daring to be different and take a chance. \n\nMemorability: 6\n\nPace: 1\nThe word \"snail\" comes to mind here. A huge mistake was made here in merely focusing on the day-to-day of Anna. There wasn't a lot of conflict that dictated the pace. I was waiting for something to happen, ANYTHING. Before I knew it, I was begging for it to be over. As the story progresses there is no real momentum building that can give you a reason to keep your attention solely on the film.\n\nPlot: 0\nUnique or not, I had a hard time buying it in its entirety. Had this been a real situation, Anna probably would have been put in a nut house 10 minutes into the film. She was given an awful lot of freedom for someone known to not be adjusted to the world. That didn't make sense to me, neither did the fact that Anna couldn't somehow piece the whole situation together a little bit faster. Maybe the whole idea was that she couldn't piece things together because she didn't want to? I don't know. What I do know is that sometimes even the best intentions can yield some bad results. Perfect example.\n\nResolution: 10\nBest part of the film and, no, I'm not being sarcastic. You essentially find out the mystery behind everything going on and I have to say it's a really nice payoff. Extremely touching, it makes the film 100 times better than what it could have been. I won't give anything away but it resolves around finding your place in life and appreciating who you are. While I loved it, it infuriated me at the same time. WHY COULDN'T THE REST OF THE FILM BE LIKE THIS???\n\nOverall: 57\nI have seen a number of films that get off to a great start and fizzle out at the end. When Marnie Was There does the opposite and the feeling it leaves you with ends up being far worse. Had the rest of the film hit home like the ending, this would have been a wonderful classic.",

            "content": "Following one year after the retirement of legendary anime film director Hayao Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli's rising director Hiromasa Yonebayashi (\"The Secret World of Arrietty\"), is still going strong with the last film the studio would make before going on hiatus, \"When Marnie Was There\". Fans of Ghibli and those not familiar with Japanese animation can enjoy this movie alike.\nAdapted from Joan G. Robinson's 1967 novel, it tells the tale of Anna Sasaki, an orphaned, 12-year-old girl who feels estranged from her kind foster mother and keeps her at arm's length. After a particularly bad asthma attack, Anna is sent to live with warm-hearted relatives for the summer as a form of therapy. \nAnna's character may come across at first as unlikeable to some, but as someone who can see my past adolescent self in her character, she's quite accurately written for a depressed, withdrawn, socially anxious pre-teen with low self esteem. Anna says hunched over after a spat with a local girl, \"I look like just what I am...ugly, stupid, moody, unpleasant. That's why I hate myself.\" These are almost the exact words many young people may have uttered to themselves.\nBut Anna doesn't spend the whole movie feeling sad, she starts to change when she meets Marnie, an outgoing girl living in a seemingly abandoned mansion across the marsh. The two instantly bond, but all is not as it appears. Encounters with the mysterious Marnie are dreamlike and transient, and as the story unravels, their relationship is further revealed to be something deeper than Anna could have anticipated. \nThe setting, which was originally England, has been shifted to rural sea-side Japan, and is drawn typical of many Ghibli movies. A warmth pervades the small town and detail is paid to every aspect of the painted backgrounds and designs of the countryside homes. The animation is as always exceptional, with grass looking wonderfully lush and water appearing as soft as silk. Marnie's golden hair and dangling earrings bouncing as she runs down the stairs, or the many birds shown in the marsh lands are just some of the many details that make watching Ghibli's animation a treat for the eyes. \nIt's something that many dubbed films struggle with, the English voice cast is unfortunately mediocre. Hailee Steinfeld as Anna sounds appropriate for the reserved young girl, but Kiernan Shipka as Marnie sounds too similar to Anna. There were times it wasn't immediately discernible who was speaking when the two were on screen together. Both characters suffer from stiff, controlled voice acting, although it works better for Anna due to the nature of her character. Other cast members perform their roles well however, and no one was terrible.\nAs other Ghibli films that take place in less fantastical worlds tend to be, this is not a movie packed with action, but a patient one that focuses on emotional exploration. However that isn't to say this film isn't filled with imagination.Yonebayashi spins a tender, well-executed story of adolescent despondency, self-discovery, friendship, family, and love with a hint of melancholy.",

It's a little weird, as the film and the dialogue are Japanese, but several of the characters have  Western European featues . maybe there's a message here abut connection that is also pan-racial.\nIt starts with socially awkward Anna expressing the thought -\n\"In this world, \"there's an invisible magic circle. There's inside, and outside. And I'm outside.\"\nThe film tells the story of Anna's troubled journey through self -hating and loneliness to loving  connection and friendship, and it does so in a mature and unsentimental way that had a lot of the audience (of adults) in tears at the end-  a lot of us know how it feels to be \"on the outside\" and the film deals carefully and honestly with the subject  - Anna makes the situation worse for herself many times through the ideas she fosters about herself, but the ideas stem from real and troubled incidents in the past that she had no influence over-  Anna is open to change, but needs help from people's lovingkindness and acceptance as she is - rather than reaction and condemnation - she finds this when she is sent to stay with relatives in the country  and also  through connection with the  natural world, the past, and simpler pleasures such as boating, sketching, and playing.\nThere's a message here that is probably timeless - the film takes us back to a previous age, but it's as relevant today as ever\n\nA charming and mature film, beautifully executed",

The film is refreshingly beautiful and soft to the eye. \n\nBased on Joan G. Robinson's modern essential classic novel of the same name. The story is moved from Norfolk, England to the Countryside of Japan without losing the core of the storyline. About a young girl Anna, who's socially an outsider, being an orphan and is sent to the country to rediscover herself. \n\nThere, she makes new friends and one in particular is Marnie, the girl who lives in the supposedly derelict Marsh House. There's an instant bond but a haunting feeling behind it all. It's all a mystery and even though you think you might have guessed it, all is not what it seems. \n\nAs expected, the animation is glorious with parallax scrolling and beautiful sceneries. However there's no wondrous weird characters that normally populate Studio Ghibli films. But there's still the loveable characters in human form such as  the Oiwa's and Sayaka.  \n\nTakatsugu Muramatsu composes the score but is sadly not quite the enchanting Joe Hisaishi some of us might expect but nevertheless it suits the film and sets the scenes nicely. \n\nThere has been speculation that this might be the Studio's final film after the famed Hayao Miyazaki departure, retiring. There is a planned prolonged break while the studio decides what to do but there is nothing final about it closing down. \n\nThis is a fine example of the animated features the studio can produce, an enchanting mystery that's emotional and heart-warming. A great film for all to watch, especially the kids but some might find it long, a little slow and doesn't have the usual magic Ghibli films have.  \n\nRunning Time: 7\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 9\nStory: 8\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 7\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 5\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n66% 7/10\n\nTwitter: SpoilerAlertRV",

It's more magical-realism than outright magic like a lot of their works, but it's nice to have a simpler film.  The main character Anna is really an interesting lead.  She's a loner, she's depressed, and she's a bit of a jerk.  She's really not your typical leading lady, but I think a lot of people will be able to relate to her.  From her opening monologue which ends in \"I hate myself\", I was invested in her character.  Her friendship with the mysterious Marnie is very charming and the heart of the whole film.  If I had one complaint it's that their friendship can feel a little awkwardly romantic at times, but I think that might just be a cultural thing in how we express our emotions.\nThe film is also just plain gorgeous.  It's from the director who did The Secret World of Arietty, and while I love that film it was clear it was from a first time director.  Here he's mastered his craft, and shown how subtle and gorgeous he can make things.  You could take any frame of this movie and hang it in your living room as a portrait, it just looks that good.\nWhen Marnie Was There is a gorgeous and emotional journey.  As secrets are unraveled, the film leads to a climax that left me speechless.  It's an almost heartbreaking film that still has a sense of wonder and hope.  Simply put, it's just a great film.

Whether or not director Hiromasa Yonebayashi knew this was to be the studio's swan song does not matter; the film feels definitive and lasting, a goodbye-of-sorts to something dear. For this reason, \"Marnie\" is something extra special. Yonebayashi should be proud, and he may be the most talented rising anime director whose last name isn't Hosoda.\n\nCalm and tranquil, \"Marnie\" plays out like a stroll through the park. It is never in a big hurry to get anywhere. Its splendid moody visual imagery incorporates natural elements; my favorite sequence is the rising tide preventing our protagonist Anna from escaping the old house Marnie lives(d?). It is very reminiscent of the rising river appearing in \"Spirited Away.\" \n\nThe main protagonist, tomboyish Anna, is a troubled child plagued by not only asthma attacks, but depressed, knowing her foster parents were accepting money from the government to keep her. For this reason she feels like a useless commodity for most of the film. Until she meets Marnie, that is. This character interplay is very reminiscent to Sean from \"Arrietty,\" who also moved to the countryside to recuperate (and found a peculiar friend in the process.) \n\nMarnie being a living memory was not so much a shocker because I was already familiar with Joan G. Robinson's children's novel. However, what initially confused me was Marnie's sudden (and unrelenting) emotional attachment to Anna. While the third act explains everything, the first half of the film gave strong vibes that Anna and Marnie were lesbians. This isn't a bad thing, as such a twist would have been bold would have vaulted this film to the top of the Ghibli roster. But alas, filmmakers decided to play the safer route, which was still charming and unexpected in its own way. \n\nThe music score thunders with emotions, and this is the best soundtrack to a Ghibli film since Yonebayashi's previous \"Arrietty.\" The only real issue I had with the film is the character design, which is often bland, apart from the title character of Marnie, the first and only blonde protagonist in a Ghibli film. The film is not perfect, but it worked in all the ways a Studio Ghibli film is supposed to work. It certain did not let me down, unlike a couple recent efforts like \"From Up On Poppy Hill\" and \"The Wind Rises.\" While the two aforementioned films were sold as \"big\" films that felt small in minuscule, \"When Marnie Was There\" was sold as a \"small\" film but it roared with emotion and felt \"huge.\" The only other time I felt this way was when I first watched \"Whisper of the Heart,\" one of the studio's most awesome efforts. \nFarewell Studio Ghibli. At this point in time, it is hard to say for certain if they will ever return to feature films, but just in case they do not, \"When Marnie Was There\" is a fine period at the end of their sentence, the end of a majestic era...",

More impressively, the story the film tells is just as filled with colorful themes and plot points that you just wouldn't get from a Disney or Dreamworks animated film.  When Marnie Was There doesn't pull any punches, but more importantly, the punches they throw at the audience mean something and will have an emotionally resonating impact for all viewers, not just kids.  \n\nThe film tells the story of Anna, a young girl who spends the summer with her relatives close to open water, and finds a mysterious and seemingly abandoned mansion across the water.  After drawing numerous sketches of the mansion, she finds her way across using a row boat.  What follows after that is a legitimately mysterious plot that keeps the audience guessing at every turn.  Is Anna seeing things?  Is this all a dream?  Which characters are hiding what?  And so on.  For most of the film, that technique works very well.  But there are a few times when the secrets and potential reveals get a bit tiresome.\n\nWhen Marnie Was There is a story about plenty of things like regret, loss, and neglection.  But at the heart of the film is a story about friendship, and an unlikely one at that.  Obviously, there's plenty of things about the plot that you can't reveal without spoiling anything, but Anna and Marnie's bond throughout is truly something special.  It's a bond that is probably more satisfying when you watch it a second time and can appreciate it without having to keep your eyes pealed for the next secret to be let out.\n\nThe film is complemented by a beautiful score and a heart wrenching end credits song that is sure to get even the most stubborn of people to get teary eyed.  But it's also a different kind of sadness than say a Pixar or Disney film can give you (exceptions of course).  When Marnie Was There has a dream like quality to the entire story, but the devastating moments hit you like a ton of bricks.  Even in its most unrealistic instances, you feel the same sorrow and happiness that the characters do.\n\n+Score\n\n+Story has just the right amount of dark moments\n\n+Probably more depth than other animated flicks\n\n+Bond between Marnie and Anna\n\n-Mysteries perhaps get a bit tiresome\n\n8.7/10",

The look of the film is nice, and I enjoyed the mystery of it all, but something about the structure just doesn't engage me. One of the things that I find most difficult to deal with is the slow pacing of these films. They glory in the minutiae of repetitive and uninteresting things to an excessive degree. Also the culture doesn't translate all that well, so I find it hard to see why certain things are handled in such unusual ways. I must admit that the characters are interesting, though. I cared about Anna, and I was captivated enough to watch until they revealed what was going on with Marnie. The film is entirely built on this intrigue where we are left to decide if Marnie is a real person, a figment of Anna's imagination, a ghost, or something else. Because of this framework for the story you are almost forced to hang in there and see what is actually going on (whether they offer a satisfying answer, I'll let you decide.) One big struggle I had with this movie was character transitions seem to occur without reason. Certain characters undergo a complete transformation by the end of the film, and I don't understand what prompted this change. Again, it must be something about the story-telling in these Japanese films, or quirks of the Japanese culture that I don't comprehend. For those who are fans of Miyazaki films, based on my limited exposure, I bet you would also connect with When Marnie Was There. For people like me, who aren't enchanted by Anime, I think you can give it a pass.",

When Marnie Was There will certainly go down as a \"smaller\" Ghibli film, like Yonebayashi's previous film for the studio, The Secret World of Arietty, but no shame in being smaller than Miyazaki or Takahata. I actually think I might prefer this one slightly to both of their final films, and I hope Yonebayashi continues to direct after this. The story involves young Anna, a sickly, depressed girl from Sopporo who moves in with family friends in the country one summer. While exploring the area, she comes upon a beautiful, seemingly abandoned mansion. One night she finds it's not abandoned, but a young, blonde girl named Marnie lives there with her rich parents. They become quick friends, but each new meeting seems more dreamlike than the last. Anna begins question whether Marnie really exists. Like most Ghibli films, one of the highlights is the score, here by Takatsugu Muramatsu. The English language song that plays over the closing credits, \"Fine on the Outside\" by Priscilla Ahn, is tremendously moving. Truly wonderful.",

When they announced their last movie in the film festival, I knew I had to watch it and lucky enough, I was able to get tickets on time.\n\n\nBecause this was a movie that is part of the festival, the first release in the UK and it is shown on a Saturday, a day when families usually go out, I assumed that they would show the English version. I didn't know that because it is part of a film festival that supports worldwide cinema, they would show it in the origin. \n\nI got there a few minutes late but still, it was incredible. I love watching movies as part of a festival because at the end, everyone clapped. Even though we had to read the subtitles, everyone had a reaction at the same time. The movie was strange but at the end of the day, it was my strange. It's about a girl who just wants to feel loved by a family or friend and finds out that she had that all along, whilst discovering some history. \n\nThe animation style was spectacular as usual. I'm really going to miss it. I even found myself crying at some parts because it was emotional as a whole. There were surprisingly some scary scenes so I think you would have to be careful if you would like to bring young ones to see it. \n\nIn the end, I was glad that I got to watch it before January and it is a great end to a fantastic studio that will live on forever.",

What's great about this movie is the illustration and the internal family story of the house where Marnie lives. Anna was lost at first and when she moves in with her aunt and found the mysterious house and got curious. The yellow house is where the magic happens where she finds out more. It's a great movie and I don't think this movie will not be understandable for little kids but overall it's an interesting animation. I do recommend this movie for all Studio Ghibli fans.

There, she befriends Marnie, a mysterious and charming girl her age, who has secrets of her own. From there, we learn along with Anna who Marnie is. The narrative is what really makes this movie outstanding. Slow and methodical, it is told from the perspective of Anna. Coupled with her condition, this makes for an emotional and personal point of view that I found absolutely hypnotic although somewhat unrelatable. While the film does falls short of the magic and wonder of the other regularly mentioned Studio Ghibli pieces, it also makes no attempts to be such. It is also utterly heart rending to realize, at the end, that this is almost certainly the final Studio Ghibli film. This is also evident throughout as there are several nods to other studio masterpieces. Finally, this is a movie to watch with a loved one, but perhaps not the children. While it doesn't contain any mature or questionable moments, it does assume a slow pace and is ultimately focused on the complex relationship between Anna and Marnie. There is also some symbolism that may be lost on those less familiar with Japanese mythology. This movie is everything you would expect from Studio Ghibli. If that sentance has any meaning to you, then go and watch it.",

With the exception of Wind Rises, the movies\nwere overrated with simplistic Tale of Princess Kaguya (at the beginning,\nof course). I was pretty skeptical about this one. While it started off\nwith a great beginning, it got boring and annoying when Sayaka showed\nup. She is a forgettable character who was kind of mean, yet so nice,\nshe's clichÃ©d.\n\nAnna bothered me for some reason, it was because of her boyish clothes\nbut it was also something else, I don't know. Maybe she's just a\nstereotypical pre-teen. Marnie was the standout character of all the\ncharacters, she was perky, friendly, and mysterious.\n\nAnna befriends Sayaka which drops the ball because a lot of movies have\ncharacters befriending the clichÃ©d nice girl. The art and animation\nwere still amazing as usual, but I am very disappointed in Studio\nGhibli for ending up like Pixar. The movie of course got cloying as it\nwent on whether it's between Anna or Sayaka or Anna and Marnie. It also\nended in a sentimental way. Maybe if they brought Hayou Miyazaki back\nto directing, he would save the studio and bring it back its glory.\n\nAlso, I thought Sayaka's voice acting was a pretty bad job. The themes\njust didn't click with me, it was boring and sometimes not empathetic.\nStudio Ghibli tried too hard by throwing in creepy parts and an\nemotional ending to be like their other movies. The creepy parts did\nnot blend well and ruined the pacing of the film.",

Going back to the roots of its best films - a young, female protagonist encountering another world and coming of age (and adapting a Western novel again, for good measure) - Ghibli makes it's most blubber-inducing film yet. It's brave in a way kids films rarely are, daring to depict darker and sadder aspects of childhood. Anna is deeply relatable as she deals with childhood depression, alienation, and loneliness. When she falls under the charismatic spell of a girl in similar straits, it's hard to tear your eyes from their mysterious, yet cathartic encounters. \n\nMany people have complained to me when a story or book is set somewhere else in its adaptation. And while it's true re-setting a story in order to make it more 'relatable' can erase key parts of its cultural aesthetic, I believe that the opposite can be true. Marnie is one such film, reworking the book's original English setting into a Japanese one, giving the story and characters wholly new dimensions and connections. Marnie and Anna's alienation is made even sharper by their foreign appearance in a country with so few immigrants. The undertones of xenophobia are not overt, but present enough to make Marnie's and Anna's struggles even more timely and compelling. It's a great change that serves the story well. \n\nOn the other hand, some points of the story seem to conflict with the second half. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that there was some tension between Marnie and Anna that was somewhat confusing, and hard to ignore. I liked this tension, but considering the resolution, it does seem a bit odd. If you see the film, I'm sure you'll get what I'm talking about. \n\nAll in all, this is already one of my favourite Ghibli films, and the fact that it's the last I'll see for awhile made it even more blubber-riffic. \n\nTake a bow on a film well done, Ghibli. (But we all know your retirement can't last. )",

She is having trouble interacting with other kids (or adults) because she's very shy.\n\tSo when her asthma acts up, she is sent to visit relatives in the country in hopes that the quiet life and fresh air will alleviate her asthma.\n\tOnce there, she does a bit of drawing (actually she does a lot of drawing).  But she finds a very odd house nearby, and soon she meets up with a girl her age named Marnie.  They become instant friends and they start sharing secrets about what life is with their families.  \n\tIt seems that Marnie and Anna are different because Marnie is part of a wealthy family, and Anna isn't.  But after spending several hours together, they seem to have a lot in common.\n\tBut Marnie is very odd - she appears and vanishes in an instant, and everyone else isn't sure about who Marnie is.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tI like these two as girls who just want to be friends - and I really like Anna as the girl who has to break free from her shyness.\n\tBut there are parts of Marnie that just ... doesn't interest me.  Her family, her house, her parties - just seem to be nothing more than filler.  SCORE: 7\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe rest of the cast doesn't add much to the mix - they're just a bunch of friendly neighbors/family members.  I know that Marnie and Anna are supposed to be the driving force of the movie, but there's really not much support here.  SCORE: 4\n\nPlot\n\tI had some fun watching Marnie and Anna become friends and do some playful activities around Marnie's house and on the river.  But the main conflict wasn't properly developed.  Instead of an amazing climatic scene, I get way too much exposition near the end of the film.  Some of the questions should've been answered sooner instead of forcing one character to answer all plot questions all at once.  SCORE: 3\n\nOriginality\n\tFilms about friendship between girls aren't all that original, but these two have a spark that puts a nice twist.  But just like some other films for girls - this one spends a bit too much time with the girls having fun instead of pushing a plot.  SCORE: 5\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's nothing really violent going on here (except for a woman getting locked in a room and girls huddling in a building to stay out of a nasty storm.)  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film does a great job on how girls can forge friendships, but the movie hides the problems the girls have to deal with for a bit too long.  Sometime you have to speak up to someone if something's wrong.  SCORE: 6\n\nFinal Score ( out of 60): 33\t\t\t\t% Score: 55%\nThis film has a pair of great girls, but the story just drags on too long - and the conflict not fully developed (thus a need for a long, boring speech near the end of the film.)",

I was fine until the last ten minutes of the film when I wished I brought tissues.  It's almost unfair to nitpick this one thing, though.  This movies tries a little too hard to be mysterious.  Most questions are answered at the end but you had to go with parts of the film that felt disjointed and trust that the souffle would rise, so to speak.  I'm still unsure how Anna's blackouts played into this because they seemed to happen whenever Marnie arrived or left.  That's minor, though.

This is simply a beautiful film from a wonderful Studio and my heart will be broken if it remains their last.",

            "content": "From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.\n\nThe movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.\n\nNot a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.\n\nThe opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.\n\nFeels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.\n\nI love you more than any girl I've ever known.\n\nStudio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.\n\nThis film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.\n\n9/10",

They spend time together and become fast friends. Anna shares her deepest secrets with Marnie and she finally begins to release the pain she's held on to.  \n\n    This film is more about the journey than the destination. It's nice to eventually figure out the mystery, but it's the animation and pacing are so wonderfully orchestrated, you can't help but stay for the ride.

Anna and Marnie strike up a friendship and their interactions allow the previously withdrawn Anna to open up.

You're certain that something more will come of this. But nothing does. Later there is a scary interlude that resembles a Gothic tale involving an old abandoned silo that terrifies Marnie. More suggestions of something grander than what is actually presented. The denouement ultimately ignores all of these plot threads and settles into a resolution that doesn't effectively address the issues with which this poor kid is struggling. She was really messed up and the reveal is totally disconnected from what this girl had been feeling. Sill, the picture is too visually hypnotic to ignore. The soundtrack, both the music and the sounds of the environment, create a lavish atmosphere that is spellbinding. I liked When Marnie Was There. I just didn't love it.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

Created by the new generation of Ghibli apprentices and based on a children's book few have heard of, it's no doubt that the critics would be more lukewarm about it than some of the Ghibli movies with more pedigree or gimmicks (sorry Kaguya). \n\nPut quite simply, Marnie is about a universal human experience: lonliness. Young Anna is an orphan who feels alone in the world, a gap between her foster parents, her friends at school, even her surroundings. She's a great artist for her age, and as she moves out to the country for health reasons, she falls in love with a lonesome, colorful house on the far side of the marsh. The story unfolds from there as Anna sees it, in spurts and stops, as Anna befriends a dream-like girl in the house, their friendship allowing Anna to come to terms with her own feelings of lonliness and disconnection. \n\nChances are you will not be able to guess the true source of Anna's disconnected feelings or the nature of Marnie. The movie does make you want to know the answer to these questions, but its only through the movie's vibrant secondary characters can we truly come to know them. Children and adults alike can understand and appreciate the themes of the movie (also unlike some of the recent Ghibli faire), because everyone can understand lonliness and isolation. \n\nIf it's playing a theater near you, see it, if it's not, then buy the video when it comes out.

The cinematography is well done with some very touching moments. I will say that the film has some pacing issues. The middle of the film especially after meeting Marnie has a lot of scenes that don't progress the story too much.

This is a nostalgic throwback to what Ghibli.does best imho, to cast common childhood/bucolic memories against a backdrop of busy modernization, and to reexamine how much has been lost in our blind rush towarda progress. Many of the details are understated but poignant, from the sharpening of pencils to the putting on of hairclips, and awkwardness of new friendships. An african proverb goes: it takes a village to raise a child; this movie posits that it may take a few generations of the village to do so. :-D A must watch, with a slight caveat, don't get too spooked out in the middle, it gets better ;-)",

Its only saving grace was that it was pretty, like a Ghibli film would be. If you must see it because of the Ghibli label, wait for the Blu-Ray. Otherwise, prepare to be bored out of your mind in the theatre.",
