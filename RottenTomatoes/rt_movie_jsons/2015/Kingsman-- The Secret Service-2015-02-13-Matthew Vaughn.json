The direction from Matthew Vaughn creates a visually entertaining movie, especially during the action sequences, which probably were a blast to shoot. The idea of keeping all important action in the center of the screen was something I picked up on immediately, and I appreciated that it was kept throughout the entire film, even when the action sometimes looked messy. The acting was enjoyable to watch, especially from actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Taron Egerton, and Colin Firth. The film recognizes the genre it is in, and vows not to be like others in it, even going so far as to make comments about how many spy movies have become so gray and serious and lost a lot of their pizzazz, which this film isn't. This is a great introduction movie to a franchise, and I hope to get a deeper look into the characters featured in the next film. Overall, this movie was a wondrous ride, and I give it an 8/10.",

On a good day, it is Jack Bauer. See why they did that? 24 was a great show, but let\u2019s be real. No way all that stuff in each season could\u2019ve happened in one day. Kingsmen is just like that. It\u2019s outrageous and over-the-top, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s trying to do. You don\u2019t get a princess to say they can do it in the a-hole unless you are very self-aware of your ridiculousness. For me it was maximum entertainment from start to finish with a very satisfying storyline and finish. For what it was trying to do, it is a perfect film.

The two leads Colin Firth and Taron Edgerton have great chemistry with each other . Colin plays Harry Hart , a Kingsman who hires the son of his dead partner Gary played by Taron. They both create a bond that works in this movie, Harry the sassy British spy with humor and Gary is a rebellious teenager who then slowly embraces his turn as a Kingsman. Finally, Samuel L Jackson as the villain of this story is hilarious as Jackson plays Valentine a delusional man who wants to wipe out the human race. The movie is fun although unrealestic at times since is meant as a humorous and fun look at the spy genre.",

He is on the way to a delinquent life however the agent Harry Hart recognizes his potential and recruits him in order to he become a Kingsman (a secret agent). Meanwhile, villainous Richmond Valentine launches a diabolical plan to solve the problem of climate change with the end of humanity\nThis plot seems to be gripping and intense. \n\nThe story of the main character was predictable. The background of the protagonist is d\u00e9ja vu. It was the same background as the other protagonists of other movies. \nThe acting is wonderful! The actors play very well. They can to keep a straight head even if the scene is hilarious. Samuel L. Jackson who plays the villain, makes the character even more eccentric and crazy. They are very talented for example during a tense meeting between the villain and Harry, Valentines offers him a Big Mac to eat. Despite this scene they managed to keep their seriousness.\nThe special Effect are very realist and spectacular. We can see that it is not cheap.\nThe fights are absolutely breathtaking. The utilization of tracking shot, low angle shot and close up shot make the action in movie stunning.\n\nIn conclusion Kingsman the secret service is outstanding because it is fast paced and on the edge of the seat. It is a groundbreaking movie. It's blend different genre which have nothing to do with the other comedy and action.\nI am a huge fan of this film. I laugh a lot moreover the actors are very talented. I recommend without hesitation Kingsman the secret service.",

The best aspect was definitely the action. The camera was shaky, but this actually helped making the action more intense. It's not the typical bad shaky camera where you had no idea what's going on. The church sequence showed just how amazing this unique camera work was. I could see things clearly, including the brutal kills, and yet felt disoriented and having an adrenaline-rush. I was excited when this scene came up, and it was still amazing as I remembered.\n\nThe acting was solid throughout. I honestly wanted more suit scenes because these Brits look so damn classy in the suits. There were many cool lines that I wanted to quote. It just made the movie all the more entertaining. Oh and the head-popping sequences was so cool.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson played the bad guy who's almost like a cartoon version of Thanos.

Were it differs is the age rating, it tackles a lot more darker themes, and of course has harsher language than James Bond, which brings this film to its main strength, the action.

They didn't go cheap on casting and they got their money's worth. Samuel L. Jackson put in a tremendous performance as a villain, drawing from one or two of his past character portrayals.  The script is fast moving and well written.  The foreshadowing is subtle and strikes the right balance between clueing in the audience while keeping them guessing.  Expensive, well done production.  This movie deservedly generated huge profits.  Some criticisms include (1) over the top violence, (2) unnecessarily and unneeded vulgar language, (3) the last 15 minutes of the movie in general and (4) the sophomoric nature of the movie.  All points for valid criticisms, but you have to remember who the target audience is.",

Then he starts murdering everyone in the church. I think the scariest part to me is that 1. hollywood actually thinks this is what churches are like and 2. they are sort of preparing their followers to begin the genocide which they are obviously craving. I watched it on a plane and it made me cry. They are no longer afraid to say that they want to kill Christians.",

            "content": "During a mission in the Middle East in 1997, probationary secret agent Lee Unwin sacrifices himself to protect his superior, Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Hart, blaming himself, returns to London to give Lee's widow, Michelle, and her young son Gary \"Eggsy\" (Taron Egerton) a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number. Seventeen years later, Eggsy is a stereotypical chav, having dropped out of training for the Royal Marines despite his intelligence and talents for both gymnastics and parkour. Under arrest for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the number. Hart arranges his release and explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a private intelligence service founded by British elite who lost their heirs in World War I and put their money towards protecting the world; the organization is named for the tailor shop that clothed them. Hart, code name \"Galahad\", explains there is a position available, as agent \"Lancelot\" (Jack Davenport) was killed by the assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) while trying to rescue university professor James Arnold from kidnappers. Eggsy becomes Hart's candidate. Other candidates are eliminated through dangerous training tests run by Kingsman's technical support operative \"Merlin\" (Mark Strong), until only Eggsy and Roxy, a candidate Eggsy befriended, are left. Eggsy refuses to complete the final test\u2014shooting a Pug puppy he raised during the training process, and Roxy is named the new \"Lancelot\". Merlin discovers that Professor Arnold is working as though nothing has happened. Hart attempts to interrogate him, but a microchip in Professor Arnold's neck explodes, killing him. The detonation signal is traced to a facility owned by Gazelle's employer Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), an Internet billionaire and philanthropist who has offered everyone in the world SIM cards that grant free cellular and Internet connectivity. Hart, impersonating a billionaire philanthropist, meets Valentine face-to-face. Hart learns of Valentine's connection to an obscure hate group's church in Kentucky, and travels there, wearing glasses containing a video transceiver. As Eggsy watches, Valentine activates the SIM cards in the church, triggering a signal that causes the parishioners to become murderously violent. Hart's spy training leaves him as the only survivor. Outside the church Valentine explains what happened before shooting Hart in the face...\n\nRotten Tomatoes called the film \"Stylish, subversive, and above all fun\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said of the film, \"This slam-bang action movie about British secret agents is deliriously shaken, not stirred ... Even when it stops making sense, Kingsman is unstoppable fun\". Jordan Hoffman, writing for The Guardian, said of the film, \"The spirit of 007 is all over this movie, but Vaughn's script ... has a licence to poke fun. ... no one involved in the production can believe they're getting away with making such a batshit Bond.\" Comparing the film to those of Christopher Nolan, Hoffman said, \"Despite the presence of grandfatherly Michael Caine, Kingsman's tone is about as far from the Christopher Nolan-style superhero film as you can get. Verisimilitude is frequently traded in for a rich laugh\". Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, called the film \"a smirking spy spoof, weirdly charmless and dated in unintentional ways\", commenting that \"it is a film forever demanding to be congratulated on how \"stylish\" it is.\" Some reviewers were critical of the film's depiction of violence, which was considered to be too graphic for a comedy. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker stated, \"Few recent movies have fetched quite as far as 'Kingsman', and countless viewers will relish the brazen zest of its invention.\" However, Lane was critical of the film's use of stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times enjoyed the film, but criticised Vaughn's use of violence as a cinematic tool, calling it \"narrative overkill\". The filmmakers also faced some criticism for an anal sex gag at the end of the film.\n\nMatthew Vaughn\u00b4s \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" based on Dave Gibbons's and Mark Millar's comic book series of the same name carries a classic storyline with an outcast being recruited by an organisation to become a secret agent. Nothing new there, but Matthew Vaughn is good at creating stylized and visual eyecandy which is what we get here. Ok casting besides the minus of Samuel L. Jackson as the main bad guy. It\u00b4s just tiresome to see him in whatever these days as he plays every character the same way. I like the Kingsman, the private intelligence service as the foundation, but the rest is pretty violent, sexist and stupid at times. But, with some entertainment value in between.",

            "content": "This is one of my favoret movies but it dose have some flaws. the first thing is the 2nd husband Eggsie's mom married, I know you are not suppost to like him but what bother's me most is why she married him. I don't think that anyone in their right mind would ever marry a guy like that unless they are forced to or they need to provied for their famaily, but maybe it was something like Cinderella's stepmother. He was a nice guy, then they got married, then he revilled that he wasn't the nice guy that she thought he was. The second thing was is how Harry met Eggsie the second time. What I think should have happened is that maybe Harry wanted a pint of beer and saw Eggise and started easedroping, saw him stealing the car and maybe should have followed him, then found out who he was, and then broke him out of jail. Instead of Eggsie calling a number on a neckless when he was going to go to jail, then Harry magicaly finds out who he is, then magicaly got to the police station. Also the other thing is that where did all the people get all the cloths in the interview they never came with any bags so how did everyone get all those cloths and in the right size? Also his mom said that she had been so worried about him, so he probably didn't go home to get new cloths, also they were out in the country so they probably didn't buy new cloths. But I guess that is more of a hole than a plot twist. Also what Valentine did with giving out all those free sim cards that dosen't make too much sence because sim cards cost a lot of money to make and I know that he is a millonare but you have to agree that even that if you were not in the Kingsmen that it is a little suspicious. Lastly I didn't like how Eggsie had sex with the princess, but he had never met her and all he said is that he only wanted a kiss that he always wanted to kiss a princess, but I think that it was a little unnecessary. But I do think that if you want to watch a British action movie with some comaty I totaly recamend it.",

But wow, the CGI is distractingly bad for most of the movie. There's really only one good action scene (the church scene) and even that is plagued by weird effects. At least the soundtrack is pretty good.\n\nThe lack of diversity in this movie is also startling. It doesn't even come close to passing the Bechdel test and the only two non-white characters are the villains (shocker). It sounds like this movie has something to say about classism, but at the end of the day even the \"disadvantaged\" characters in the movie are still white and pretty well-off.\n\nAll of that being said, the pacing was good enough to hold my interest and the acting is pretty engaging overall.

The choreography for the fights was decent, and the church scene was enjoyable. The visual effects could have been better but were ok. The machine that requires the villain's hand to stay touching the display for the thing to work has to be one of the dumbest design flaws ever made but makes for great plot armour.

I actually had to look up for getting to know, what this crap is supposed to be.

I have a huge TV crush in \"the Princess\" and whilst Firth does his usual stellar job once again - the rest of the cast are just as entertaining, if not more!! Being half Brit/half Yank, I'm partial to most British films - but was glad to see it got an 86% great score on R/T's and I hate critics as they all talk outta their arses thinking they're gods gift to film reviewing when filmgoers like me HATE Hollywood, hate their elitist \"we know better than you\" arrogant attitudes be it politics or abortion etc and the whole fame/fandom (kiss my ass) - I don't have time for you little peasants wanting a selfie... run along \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb So when the odd film does land and register with me, I'm man enough to own up to my many shortcomings and admit if I was wrong about a film or actor. (But will always stand by my core values and beliefs) - But I've never said anything bad about this film or cast of actors as I didn't even know there was a series released. Just hoping the other 2 are as good as the first. (Which we all know is rare with sequels) ...",

Jackson, this unlike many villains, if he has personality, not you In no time to spare on the screen, his motives are justifiable, simply if you see it from another point of view his plan was not so malicious, this was to eliminate part of humanity to start again and save us from extinction, what really bad in this was that he chose those who were going to be saved and let's say that's not very fair, but hey, the point is that he's a very good villain, and without a doubt the violence is just great, I mean is creative, I say When we have seen in a movie a scene like that of the church?\nThe film is well executed in the sense that it explains something, but without wasting time, and something that I really like is Egsy is not the typical annoying character who wants to be good if because, or who wants to defeat the villain with all his strength to Although these are not even found, the film also has personal moments for the protagonists, for example we see how the relationship between father and son between Harry and Egsy is strengthened through the progress of the film, something that was very brave on the part of the movie is to have killed Harry at the moment, I say at the moment because we already know that in the two he is alive and blah, blah, blah, the point is that for us he was dead in that movie, it was something that I grab you without you see it coming, because it is not very common that in today's movies they kill one of the protagonists of the way in which this movie did it, which is another success for the film since this serves as inspiration to Egsy and to return to become a Kingsman and want to defeat Valentine, but as good as this movie is, it is not perfect, I say through which the movie progresses the characters have technological objects that are suitable for the plot, or that no matter how much training they put Eggsy in their preparation to become a Kingsman, we never really saw them teach him how to fight, I say that the movie has mistakes but this does not mean that it is all the good it has.\nIn conclusion Kingsman is a creative, funny movie, with good characters, an unusual villain, great action scenes, with one or another mistake, that is why this movie earns its good merely 8/10.",

Eggsy (Taron Egerton) really excels in this movie and is truly an underdog worth cheering for. I loved the soundtrack and the use of color throughout the film.",

Jam packed with James Bond-esque spy scenes and a sprinkle of silly comedy scenes inter merging with one another making an amazing film.\n\nThe characters are flushed out and feel so very human, interacting with each other without if every feeling forced or stretched out. Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, a key role in the story and character development of Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton. Another one of key characters, Richmond Valentine the villain of the movie, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is super stereotypical, but at the same time feels like if a real world human played a super villain where they would never give the spies a chance to breath and simply shoot them.\n\nThe plot was absolutely amazing and the action scenes feel so natural, as well as making it feel like their hits actually are doing something, they even get hurt a bit at times. Little attentions to detail such as blood or wounds staying but fading away over time make this movie feel real.\n\nDefinitely worth watching if you haven't already, great movie with great characters, my personal favourite movie of all time.",

Jackson plays a cartoonish villain with a lisp straight out of an old hat, done to death melodrama, that needs to exit...stage right, as soon as possible.  All this is crammed together like another sodomy joke that Vaughn would have happily stuffed up your hind-quarter had he been creative enough to think of it.
