    "summary": "When college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that Christian's true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of pain and pleasure.",

Yes, of course there's sex in them and that was the main draw for many people, but I believe that made many overlook the underlying story of both Christian and Anastasia. From the time Anna stumbled into Christian's office, they were on a collision course. Christian leaving his sadistic life and Anna leaving her life of virginity, both being drawn to each other where, in book three/movie three, they meet in a life of intimacy and companionship. Every relationship has ups and downs, and theirs had it's fair share as well, but that's what dramas are about, conflict and resolution.\nThat is what happened during the course of these books. Anna grew from a naive girl to an educated and assertive woman, and Christian from a sadist to a father. All-in-all, a great love story!",

Dakota Johnson se roba la película mientras los demás actores dan una actuación muy seca, Anastasia se ve vulnerable y de cierta manera atrapada en esta relación, sus sentimientos se sientes genuinos y es la única que podría parecer un personaje real, a Dakota Johnson le queda chica la película. \n\nEl como se plantea la relación tóxica funciona y no, por un lado mientras más se desarrolla la misma relación si llega a dar ese tinte trágico de una relación en la que una persona ya no es feliz, pero a la vez en su falta de propositividad la película es ambigua en muchas decisiones de los personajes. Su poco desarrollo es el que termina arrastrando a las escenas interesantes. Con una dualidad muy marcada entre ellos, que va más allá de las clases sociales, para mi lo que refleja esta película está en esa misma lucha interna de ambos participes de una relación en buscar sacar lo mejor tanto de ellos como de su pareja, y aceptar \n que hay cosas que no se pueden cambiar, y saber cuando es mejor soltar que aferrarse.\n\n50 Sombras de Grey es una película muy sencilla, que más allá de su gran fotografía y vestuarios hermosos, no hay nada más, la película tanto en su mensaje como en su escritura es superficial, con un conflicto muy sencillo que no acaba por darle sentido a la historia. A esta película le faltó poco para ser buena, solo se necesitaba darle más matices a los personajes, la trama no necesitaba ser compleja para funcionar, solo necesita tener los suficientes elementos para empatizar tanto con los personajes como con la historia, y no esperar que con escenas subidas de tono es suficiente para agradar con el espectador. Entiendo porque esta película fue un éxito, pero con una introspección más a detalle y con un conflicto más solido esta película hubiera sido mucho más que una simple película de romance.",

When Anastasia (Dakota Johnson), a recent college graduate, crosses paths with wealthy businessman Christian (Jamie Dornan), sparks fly.  Before she knows it, the sexually inexperienced Anastasia finds herself in an all-consuming relationship, generally bound and blindfolded, with the controlling Christian.  The main problems with the movie would seem to be the incredibly dull dialogue, little of which feels natural and none of which is the least bit interesting, and the drabness of the characters.  While Johnson at least seems engaged in her character and gives it the old college try, Dornan attacks his role with the enthusiasm and energy of a garden slug, moping about in what appears to be a constant state of boredom.  Other than Johnson writhing around in a blissful state, there's not much to see here.",

Aun si Dakota Johnson y Jamie Dornan se esfuerzan, no consiguen jugar bien ninguna química que sea dramática o seductora en pantalla, y el hecho de que interpreten personajes unidimensionales y sin desarrollo en una película sobre sadomasoquismo, creo que solo logra hacer que \"Fifty Shades Of Grey\" (2015) sea todavía peor de digerir.

In fact, it operates on passable grade levels as it's helped a lot by Dakota Johnson's terrific performance, excellent cinematography and playful, at times even self-aware dialogue. But that dialogue also contains a lot of cringey lines that are simply laughable. The movie is also far from truly sensual and certainly not truly provocative given that its target demographic have always been middle-aged women. Christian's character lacked depth, the faux psychology of the third act was very annoying and this particular story needed more edge in terms of sex on screen and nudity. Consequently, this flick is undeniably problematic in multiple areas, but it is a consistently entertaining guilty pleasure watch nonetheless.",

The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.\n\nThere are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.\n\nOn the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.\n\nRegarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.\n\n'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.\n\nAll in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

Then after telling her they wouldn't work together, he tries to control her when she's on a night out with her friends. I get people are into BDSM and whatnot, thats fine. But he was very fucking possessive and controlling outside of the bedroom. Nah thanks.\nThen Anastasia. She actually continues trying to be with this guy after his creepy as shit behaviour. Then, as a romantic, she protests how he refuses to go on proper dates, do romance-y shit, and have her touch him. But she STILL continues in this relationship. And yet she repeatedly has these same reservations, as if she's trying to change him. It's clear he's not budging, so I don't know why she sticks around when she's not in the type of relationship she wants. Because then she cries and runs off when she sees the 'real' side of him. Like GIRL, you just asked him to give you his worst, what did you expect? You know he's got issues and is into this whipping shit that clearly ties back to his childhood trauma. Really don't know what she thought she was doing there.\n\nIn that whipping scene, at the end where Anastasia runs off crying, I couldn't even tell if Christian was feeling remorse, or was just turned on. I couldn't even tell if he actually had feelings for her or if she was just a toy he could use to project his past traumas on.\n\nAnyway, this movie was just stupid.

However, I decided to sit through the trilogy with as open of a mind as possible and will now be reviewing them. This first part is a bad movie in that it is boring almost all the way through and the dialogue is horrendous. On top of that, the two leads have no chemistry or compatibility so everything just feels off. The movie has one scene that I can say is somewhat well-made but that's not to say it was enjoyable. I also thought the soundtrack was fair and the ending of the movie should have been the end of the series because Dakota Johnson's character actually makes the right call. I can't believe people think this movie is romantic in any sense. The character of Christian Grey is controlling and manipulative and gets away a lot simply because he is good-looking and wealthy. Overall, I would say unless you're morbidly curious like I was, this movie is entirely skippable.

Weeknds song earned it was alright but it's not my favorite out of his library. Since its based off of twilight fan fiction I'd say that film was better. Even after we colided is better than this trashy mess. I wouldn't say this is bad, persay, but its not a good movie, as its too sick, and overly sexual. But it does have a few good things going for it in terms of filmmaking, musical score, songs and acting, and I will say (sigh) it can succeed in being trashy (even though I don't like how trashy it can get) 5/10, maybe even a 6.

Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man!\n\nAlso, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!!\n\nThe movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wants to eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise and waxing habits are under his control. She is basically just a possession.\n\nThe movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies with giggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I would feel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day!

Do you also remember the equally terrible movie adaptation on Valentine's Day weekend in 2015? The story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and her sadomasochistic relationship with young businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) has been the most entertainingly awful piece of literature and a subject of parody in the first half of the 2010 decade. What made the novel so infamous were the exaggerated sex scenes and the laughable internal monologue. The movie however, trims those elements down in favor of a conventional romantic drama instead of raising the bar with James's text. Don't get me wrong, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't without saucy moments, but there are so few drips to squeeze and they get bogged down by scenes of Mr. Grey gawking Anastasia with materialism, stalking her at dinner parties, or sending creepy text messages. Christian has an entire collection of whips, butt plugs, and other BDSM sex toys, yet he never takes advantage of them in the movie. With the funny narration being replaced by generic pop songs, the film also loses its charisma and never explores Annie's lustful desires. I'm not asking for this movie to be ultra-pornographic, but I expected more steamy activity than just hard spanking and rubbing ice on the nipples. Despite Sam Taylor-Johnson's effort to better the book's prose, the result of Fifty Shades of Grey is extremely mild and not the least bit titillating. (1 ½ Exploding Inner Goddesses out of 5)",

Let's sum up Anastasia(our main character) who is biting her lip throughout this entire ordeal. Sexy indeed. Her personality is a bore, it was 2015 when this came out. It's safe to safe damsels in distress don't exist anymore. Perhaps that's why they have made more powerful female-based movies since then. Christian, an awkward and insecure personality. Oof, the forbidden fruit? Not my type of tea. The only attractive trait he has is generosity. By that I mean his ability to shower lavish gifts. Seattle seems to be the only accurate source, but in the book it's clear the author has no information. Other than that, this movie tries to use sex as a weapon and I'm not certain that it's true. It does manage to make you feel embarassed however. Embarassed because of course, you wasted your time watching and assesing how long it lasts. There's no storyline behind it, just an influenced and well advertised book from a former \"tv executive\"(you would think there would be more).  Cringey, awkward, and laughable is what this confusing mix of a timeline is composed into. They should've just scrapped the entire thing and went a different dirdction.

Dakota Johnson is a strong, capable female lead - resulting in the opposite of the above. The result is an imbalance where one relates to the position of the woman when the two are in conflict which undermines the better balanced but rampant and contradictory characters in the book. The other thing that got lost on the way was the raw pulpy sexuality in the book since there is only so far that one can go, even in an R-rated movie. \n\nDepth aside the movie has some superficial entertainment value, but falls horribly short of the better acting and storyline of Geere and Roberts in Pretty Woman which masters some of the same issues in this movie.",

In any case, while the first 15-20 minutes stuck to the book, that's what made me almost turn off the ridiculous thing. Seriously stupid dialogue with absolutely no character generation at all. Just straight into it. However, I'd like to at least point out the positives. One, I'm so glad they used an actual writer for the screenplay. Kelly Marcel changed up quite a bit, especially toward the end, that made the movie pseudo tolerable. While Jamie Dornan had the arrogance down, I expected a taller, blonder, more Nordic look to Christian. And, while Dakota played the timid girl-turned-submissive quite well, I honestly expected someone more attractive. Yet, given the crappy content, they both made it work as best it could.

I'm a straight And i'm the Target audience For this film. Doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out i'm Not really interested in looking at naked women. And yet there was full frontal naked woman all the way through this film. I do like to look at naked men. I get the feeling that hollywood thinks i shouldnt like to look at naked men.  Even when dornan was having sex, he was wearing jeans and johnson completely visibly naked. I find it creepy.\n\nMy first review on this site and probably my last.

I haven't written any reviews in 22 months, but I just felt that I HAD to give my $.02 on this one. And just to be clear: I didn't choose to see this movie. It was picked for me by someone else (you know who you are).\n\nLet me be real clear up front: this production, content-wise, is totally and utter crap. That's what you get when you take a cringeworthy, over-inflated abysmal story that somehow became a hype and try to make some more Hollywood money off of it.\n\nThe production is slick like you'd expect from a 201x movie. No money was saved anywhere. Problem is: the characters are so one-dimensional that even those who are supposed to be 'lead' characters are so limited that there's nothing to work with for the actors. There's all kinds of talk and hints of complicated pasts that never show in what these people actually do or in the 'why' behind it.\n\nOkay. Maybe people didn't read the book or go see this film for the depth of characters or the interesting and attractive plot (ahem), but they wanted some real kinky bondage action played out in front of them. They will be sorely disappointed here (and even more so in the sequel). If you think you're going to get anything of value here, think again. Mr. Grey is a (spoiler alert!!!) self-proclaimed 'sadist' and admitted mysogynist instead of the 'dominant' he pretends to be. Anyone with a little knowledge or experience with bondage and/or bdsm will be appalled at what is shown here and how that lifestyle or preference is portrayed. Not only does the whole Christian Grey character give the impression that anyone with bdsm-related inclinations has those feelings because of childhood abuse, what is worse is that the activities he engages in that are labeled bdsm are as close to 'vanilla' as the bdsm-spectrum gets. Really, production team, is sexual intercourse where one of the two people involved is wearing handcuffs for the first minute of it, deemed typical of bdsm in 2017? Maybe I am jaded, but these supposedly 'racy' scenes seem more like a teenage girl's trepid kinky fantasy than anything remotely close to the reality of a 'dominant' man's mind.\n\nAnyway, in between these scenes that never really deliver what anyone (read the other reviews on this site) wanted out of them, is a sappy chick flick that is even more generic, flat and predictable than pancakes for breakfast. It's cringeworthy at times and boring for the remainder of the time. No wonder it gets such a low audience score everywhere. Makes you wonder why some people actually give this a positive review. \n\nVerdict: avoid like the plague and smallpox.",

You see what the filmmakers and actors are trying to do, but it's so horribly written, performed and directed that it results in boring, tedious and often hilarious parody of an erotic thriller. The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 14-year old girl writing her first screenplay in her journal. The two leads are so miscast and deadpan/flatline in their roles, I was giggling uncontrollably when it was supposed to tense, serious and sexy. This film has no tension, almost no likeable characters and is filmed in such a sterile, emotionless way that it doesn't even qualify it as a sexy, campy guilty pleasure. Really shows how much of a genius Paul Verhoeven is, making trashy erotic thrillers that actually work. What an embarrassment for all involved. Wow.

            "content": "I'm not the kind of person who likes to say bad things about a film just for the sake of it. Even if a film has a not so good reputation I'll always give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a go, keeping my mind open to possibly liking it. I did this with \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", the big screen adaptation of E.L. James' hugely successful novel. Putting aside any preconceived notions I had, I went in with a blank slate and just let the movie speak for itself, and it did speak for itself... and it was not good. The film stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as the leads, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, and follows their romance, for lack of a better, as he introduces her to his rather abnormal lifestyle.\n\nI'll start off with a positive, possibly the only one in this entire thing. Is the film well shot? Yes it is. It's nothing extravagant but it is fairly competently well filmed and the way some scenes are lit are actually not bad. The board room meeting between Ana and Christian comes to mind as a good example of some decent attempts at nice lighting. Having said that, the directing in every single scene is beyond basic. It is amateurish and so forced and needy. Instead of letting the \"relationship\" organically form, director Sam Taylor-Johnson lingers on shots that are meant to induce feelings of passion and excitement, but instead come off as completely hokey and at times just plain idiotic. And the script really doesn't make things any better, it is absolutely horrendous! Not a single line feels original or inspired. The entire story feels like some immature fantasy. Which is exactly what this is... look it up, this whole thing started as \"Twilight\" fan fiction! And it really shows.\n\nDakota Johnson is a decent enough actress but here she is bland, boring and incredibly dull. In fact her character is very similar to the bland, boring and dull Bella Swan played by Kristen Stewart in \"Twilight\". Another actress who is fairly decent in her own right but was robbed of all emotions and acting abilities in those films. As for Jamie Dornan, he is meant to be playing an emotionless person, but his performance here lacks any sort of resemblance of how a human being behaves and he is not helped with his robotic and totally unnatural dialogue. There is zero chemistry between the leads. And even amongst the rest of the cast, there's absolutely no connection between anyone. Everything feels so fake and unnatural. The only relationship that seems just slightly credible is the one between Ana and her mum, which takes up a total of maybe two minutes screen time... after that it's back to the crappy, boring story which we have to endure for the other 120 minutes.\n\nOne of the main problems with \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is that it's so damn boring. There is not one interesting thing to enjoy in this joke of a film. There are a few moments of unintended comedy with certain lines of dialogue, but as a whole the bloody thing isn't even so bad it's good... it's just bad. Really bad. The film even seems to be afraid to embrace its main premise. For all it's hardcore talk, the actual scenes that depict any sort of sexual activity are so incredibly tame. Yes there is nudity, but so does 70% of other sex scenes already out there. So what is there about the scenes in this film that sets it apart? Because there has to be something, for this is the whole catch of the film after all. The answer... absolutely nothing! The film can't even identify with its own ridiculousness, making the whole thing very hypocritical. And the entire effort feels so staged and rehearsed. Every movement and gesture just feels so unnatural and predetermined. There is absolutely no spontaneity in any of the scenes.\n\nHowever, by far my biggest problem with the film is the love story, if you can even call it that. This is the most unhealthy relationship I've ever witnessed on screen. It baffles me why a girl like Anastasia would be even remotely interested in a creep like Christian Grey. There are so many red flags early on, she should have just run... run and not looked back. Just the fact that he's ordering her around after having simply bumped into her a few times should have set off some alarm bells. Also, there are honestly some sick and twisted themes and story points that come up in this film that are simply glossed over or even worse, the film at times tries to validate this behaviour, such as child abuse! Christian Grey specifically says that he is friends with the woman who sexually abused him when he was a teenager. I mean, what the hell!?\n\nThe film is really an insult to anyone who takes filmmaking seriously. The fact that this series has now made a billion dollars when there are so many amazing films that don't even get to see the light of day is so wrong. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is not just a bad film, it's horrible on so many levels. It's Fifty Shades of pure horrendous writing, crappy acting and uninspired filmmaking. To put it simply... the film bloody sucks!",

This one is not one of those cases.  \"Fifty Shades\" proved to be a very boring movie that suffered from a dragging plot, terrible dialogue and two lead actors who have no chemistry and weren't that memorable at all in their roles.  The film also suffers from a story that didn't feel like it was going anywhere or building up to anything, contained too long of a running length, and an ending that comes out of nowhere and isn't a very satisfying conclusion.  I will add that the sex scenes (the heart of this property) were actually well-constructed but that can't save this otherwise unengaging and uninteresting film.\n\nHello!  My name is Rev.

Any of these elements can make a film underwhelming, but still leave you with a decent syory if there is stuff happening and you're being kept engaged. The ultimate sin of cinema, is being boring, and 50 shades of grey might be the biggest offender of that rule.\n\nI went into this film having not read any of the books, and even after watching this movie; it seems like you still need to read the book to understand slot about these characters. We have Anna, the indecisive awkward and very plain looking virgin who is smitten with Billionaire Christian Grey. Grey seems more like Gordon Gecko as a Bond villian( he seems like he would have drinks with Patrick Bateman's and Goldfinger) and quickly becomes obsessed with Anna and controlling every aspect of her life; in what seems like very creepy stalkery  almost gaslighting behavior. The main plot point of the whole movie is this stupid contract he's trying to get Anna to sign, saying she'll be his submissive and do whatever he says (Nevermind she's already been doing everything he says).\n\nThe rest of the movie plays out as: [lame pg-13 \"kinky\" sex scene (lame), he says he's not into relationships, she gets ready to leave him, he storms after her and says he needs her, she reminds him she hasn't signed the contract and then she does what he wants anyways]. This sequence of events happens about three or four times in a row with little dialogue between. It's all very boring and tedious.\n\nAside from this movie being two hours long and as boring as C-SPAN; the absolute worst part was that there was no conclusion. The ending was banking on this movie being successful enough for a sequel. Unfortunately they were right......... I recommend this movie as a cure to insomnia, but in no way shape or form was it entertaining. F**k this movie.\n\n0.5/5",

EL James is a talentless hack. The popularity of this book is just sad on many levels. Ladies, there is much better erotica out there. In fact, I'm quite sure I could write my own better erotica. In any case, while the first 15-20 minutes stuck to the book, that's what made me almost turn off the ridiculous thing. Seriously stupid dialogue with absolutely no character generation at all. Just straight into it. However, I'd like to at least point out the positives. One, I'm so glad they used an actual writer for the screenplay. Kelly Marcel changed up quite a bit, especially toward the end, that made the movie pseudo tolerable. While Jamie Dornan had the arrogance down, I expected a taller, blonder, more Nordic look to Christian. And, while Dakota played the timid girl-turned-submissive quite well, I honestly expected someone more attractive. Yet, given the crappy content, they both made it work as best it could. I admit, I liked the ending much better than the book as it leaves anyone enjoying the film, yearning for the follow-up, which was really the intent all along.",

GREY WILL SEE YOU NOW\nHello Kiddies your pal the Cupid Critic here and you know what I hate? Try mixing Twilight with porn, it equals crap, now make that crap into a movie and you get something much worse, this movie.\nThis film is based off the popular novel by E.L James which was started as a twilight fanfiction, turned into a novel, became a best seller somehow and now its one of the worst movies of this year. But guess what, it's made money so were going to have to sit through the next two sequels that will probably be made. The film is about Anastasia Steele, who does an interview for her friend Kate who is sick but after Ana comes back from the interview she feels better miraculously for some reason. Ana has to interview CHristian Grey who is a young and very successful billionaire. She has the hots for him for some reason and is being asked to sign up to be his submissive to explore her sexual side.\nThe film has the goal of appealing to it's demographic, I am not among that demographic but as film that is meant to have meaning, or be enjoyable, or fun even it most certainly does not succeed. All the characters feel like one dimensional real-world twilight characters. You got the female lead who is in love with the tough guy who is dangerous for her, you've got the completely different friend/roommate, and good friend who is in love her which sets up the love triangle.\nYou probably want to know what I thought about the BDSM sex scenes, their there and I was not aroused. They are just filler and a plot device to tell this story, your girl might take you to see this but will make you delete your porn history. The acting in the film is alright from Dakota Johnson, I feel she could be doing better if the dialogue wan't so horrible. The direction is actually kind of good too. But as a whole this movie is fifty shades of crap, I'm giving it one silver ball out of five.( if you've read the book you'll get the silver ball reference.)",

I mean, it's about a young 21-year-old woman who fell in love with a 27-year-old entrepreneur, who wasn't looking for love and had her sign a contract on becoming a submissive and all that jazz. Not really romantic if you ask me.  \n\nIt wasn't really that much of a plot if it has too much erotic scenes of them boinking and such. It's full on porn. But, I'll be honest, I watched it again and I just can't help, but watch it over and over. I own four books of the series and I usually like to read books more than watching the movies.\n\nOverall, it's a good, average movie.

Leads Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan give it their all (the former managing to be borderline adequate), but they just can't find a way to create a sense of chemistry between these two dull characters completely lacking development. The fanfiction origin of this story becomes apparent as the film progresses, as characters spout off horribly written lines that often lead to cringing. Even the BDSM elements that the story relies so heavily on are too tame to be effective, and become quite tedious once the film hits a dead end and has nowhere else to progress the plot to. Perhaps with a stronger source material, with characters that actually have character arcs and chemistry, this could work as a decent drama, but unfortunately that just isn't the case with Fifty Shades of Grey.",

What is all the hype about? Well, put your muzzle on and let me tell you, you dirty pervert. \nAnastasia Steele is a young, intelligent college student with an awkward nature that will melt your heart. When her roommate falls ill on the cusp of a rare interview with the powerful Christian Grey, Anastasia reluctantly takes her place. What transpires on that day changes her life forever.\nChristian Grey, played by Jamie Dornan, is not surprisingly a deep and perplexing character. He is in good shape, and yet you see him eating simple carbs and drinking wine throughout the movie. The film does not insult your intelligence in this regard, however. Instead, it lets you infer that he is Captain America. How else can he run a multi-billion dollar corporation, maintain a physique to Olympian perfection and, most importantly, court the elusive Anna?\nAt least one-third of the film's eroticism comes from Danny Elfman's score. The dulcet tones recall shades of Pee Wee's big adventure, which is another erotic masterpiece. \nIn all, I believe that Fifty Shades of Grey will go down as the greatest family film in history. Just wait for the kids to bed, and then call your cousins, your aunt and uncle, your mother, her cousin, and maybe even your grandpa.

The opening shots of Seattle are quite lovely, and the music is nice and moody. All things considered the movie looks and sounds great.  But then the characters start talking and it all goes to hell.  Christian Grey is one of the most profoundly boring characters I've ever seen in a movie.  He talks like a robot with nothing interesting to say, and every woman who gets any screen-time can't stop talking about how hot he is as if that gives him character.  He has a moderately interesting backstory involving some childhood trauma, but then the movie tries to use this as an explanation for his controlling nature and fascination with S&M, which is offensive to both survivors of abusive relationships and people in the S&M lifestyle (all of whom, by the way, have disowned this story as BS).  His decisions make no sense, when in one scene he'll tell Anastasia to stay away from him and that he's not right for her, and in the very next one he'll give her some extravagant gift.  Either he's a manipulative dick, or he's just a poorly written character, and I'm not sure which is worse.\nAnastasia Steele isn't much better.  I really have trouble saying much about her even, she's your stereotypical clumsy shy girl, but to such a degree my forehead became sore from all the facepalming it caused.  And that's all I can say about her, she's boring.  Her chemistry with Christian is simply non-existent.  The erotic scenes they share have no hint of eroticism.  Things are happening that I recognize as supposedly sexy things, but they simply aren't sexy.  Truth be told I was more bored by the sex scenes than I was by the character scenes, at least those could provide a few unintentional laughs.\nFifty Shades of Grey is like a porno with too much story and all the sex taken out as written by someone who's never had sex in their life and only has the loosest idea what eroticism is.  The story originated as a Twilight fanfiction which doesn't surprise me in the least, but what does surprise me is that it was written by a middle aged woman when it feels more like it was written by a 12 year-old just learning what sex is.  It's a bad movie, and an embaressment to S&M, sex, and relationships in general.  I will admit that it is very well shot, the colors are nice and when the characters don't talk there are some very lovely moments.

I can't say the same for the movie. Summary: it was eh. Slow, drab, with not very much of anything going on. The \"kinky\" sex scenes? What got this series famous in the first place? Not very kinky or sexy. Dakota Johnson played the part as well as she could have, I suppose. And since James portrayed Christian Grey as a god walking among men in the book, I think anyone would have disappointed. I'll give Dornan some credit for not being as creepy as the Christian in the book. So, if you're looking for sexy, go elsewhere! If you're looking for a good laugh, you can go elsewhere too because, as much as possible, Sam Taylor-Johnson removed all the weird in an attempt to make a decent movie.

It was well known that these two didn't get along on set, but wow. There is literally, and I mean literally in the textbook definition sense of the word, zero chemistry between them. Their lines of \"passion\" come of as extremely awkward, which is perfect, because the whole film is just awkward. The sex scenes? Laughable. The characters? One dimensional, laughable caricatures. The writing? Laughably juvenile. As for this being a story of female \"empowerment\"? Yeah, not really. This is about abuse, because no female who feels \"empowered\" would ever sign a contract handing over her basic human rights while agreeing to be a sex slave. Really empowering stuff right there.

            "content": "I spent most of this films run time wanting to kill myself, now if that sounds like your ideal emotion while watching the biggest and possibly most offensive film of 2015, then please go right ahead... And do both. 50 Shades of Shit for those of you who have been smart enough to hide under a rock, is the film adaptation of the book by the same name, which hilariously became a trend a few years back. Now I haven't read the book, I dont intend on either, but if this film is any indication of even a fraction of the books potential, I truly believe there may be something wrong with the demographic which went ape shit for it. The story follows a young English student, who while filling in for her sick friend (she isnt really sick, she clearly just has a case of the cant be fucked) falls head over heels, literally, for some twat with money. Now after a few encounters, that would make any normal female run to the hills, the twat and the girl then proceed to become invested in each other, and while doing so she discovers that he likes to be a bit of a dominatrix and he wants her to be her submissive, fill in the blanks for the rest, you know them, honestly there is no twists or turns, just fill in the blanks. So where do I begin with this boiling hot turd? Well lets start with the concept, so Fifty Shades concept is that a man who has spent his adult life being into BDSM, falls in love with a girl who is a virgin, the rest of the material is about how they both try to change each other for their own personal benefit. On concept alone, if this is what we are condoning as respectable behavior, what have we become, and I'm not shunning the BDSM. This is essentially packaged as a love story, okay i'll go with that, Fifty Shades decides that love is something that can just be obtained by being hot and having lots of money and indeed that it is acceptable for Men to be only attractive if they have a 6 pack, a lot of cash in their back burner and decide to whisk you away from your friends in a helicopter, if you cant tell by the sarcasm and disdain in my writing, then I dont agree with this one bit. So moving on to script, is it good, not in the slightest! Literally Fifty Shades has the clunkiest dialogue you will hear, in hopefully quite some time, there is nothing quirky or smart about it, it doesnt ooze sexuality and even the referencing of sex, sounds like it has been written by a 12 year old, primarily unaware of what goes on in the bed room. This is not helped by the fact that not only do Mr Twat and Girl have zero chemistry, but give 2 of the most stone walled performances I have seen by professional actors. Jamie Dornan is an acceptable choice, he is good looking, fits the age range and of course if you had seen the BBC's excellent television show The Fall, you would understand solely why he was picked, then again apparently not as he either cannot be arsed or The Fall was just a fluke. Girl is played by Dakota Johnson, and yet again, she seems like the kind of person who the director is trying to cast but yet again its just painful to watch her try and do anything. I'll give them credit, they both try and act the atrocious script out and god only knows how difficult that must be, but seriously they are hopefully looking back at their careers and questioning this completely stupid choice. This film is ball brakingly boring, honestly its 2 hours and 10 minutes of just nonsense, which it then has the audacity to sequel bate at the end, I dont know anyone who will be interested in any follow up to this, but if you exist, go and throw yourself off a bridge. The film just drags and drags and drags, mainly between a will they, wont they, will they wont they, will... Oh who fucking cares! I dont feel sympathy for either party, but if I had to choose it would probably be Mr Twat, he openly and continually reminds Girl about what he is, what he wants and continually brakes and bends his own rules to cater for her, yet she continually moans and groans about it, not in a good way, and tries to change who he is. First of all didnt you hear him repeatedly tell you what he wanted and if you never agreed why on earth have you gotten this far into it. He hasnt bullied her, okay maybe stalked her, but thats nothing a quick phone call to the authorities cant sort out. It honestly doesnt make any sense why this continual situation needs to go on for over 2 hours of film time and by the looks of the ending even longer, oh whoops I just spoiled it, oh dear! Did you know that Danny Elfman produced the score for this? No? Thats okay because I actually never heard a single song by him, unless of course he was the one that remixed the god awful Beyonce track and I'm highly doubting that. I honestly could go on for days but I will not give this garbage any more of my time. Its overly long, boring, lacking any charisma, it isnt sexy, it isnt provocative, it has zero emotional weight. This film will no doubt find itself as a firm staple in a Quantanamo-esque style prison camp in years to come, so if you were thinking about being a terrorist, just think, I may be subjected to this shit on a loop for days on end. The thought alone is making my hand reach for a noose. Stay away!",

I want to say that I did not read the book, but in terms of adaptation and censorship, I guess they had to cut too many sex scenes (some extremely stupid) so that this film would at least a rated \"R\" (or C in Mexico) but in the end, remember that I sat at the computer and I said to myself: \"will see this film without the need to look for cons or intending to criticize\" but this not hard or 10 minutes the film is a total mistake, first of all, doesn't fit me in the head the idea that this movie is romance and love (which isn't it) because I only see a gloomy, dark, stupid, full of sadomasochism or masochism atmosphere. When women come to a sick man mental attraction? do not understand it, would be because it is a millionaire? do you have luxury cars? I have no idea. Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of Anastasia, a shy Virgin student who will interview Christian flock for a work of her roommate, the interaction of Jamie Dornan with Dakota Johnson is flat, do not feel real, Anastasia always has the same face: \"orgasm\" \"sadness\" \"orgasm\" \"anger\" \"orgasm\".\nThe relationship of these two is silly, boring and uninteresting, both characters do not provide anything about charisma, become tedious and annoying, for example:\n Christian Grey: \"give away you a car, a computer, books and everything what your want to do you will be my submissive?\" \n Anastasia: No, don't want to see you again (spend 2 minutes) I love you.\n For the love of God, this movie is trash! With regards to sex scenes, they promise more than they are, so do not go with the idea that sex scenes really extremely explicit and controversial. \n Sam Taylor-Johnson does what it can in this film, it is not her fault that the film would not work, in fact looks to put all its effort to be at least passable, fault history has it (and of course the writer James S.L) a story boring, nothing interesting, mediocre and with little originality (would forget to mention that this is \"Twilight\" with sex?) All forgivable here is the Soundtrack (by Danny Elfman) does will not be a masterpiece, but it is the only decent thing has this film (this is you can call movie? this term does not fit here...)\n\nReview en Español:\nNo es novedad que un libro tan viral, con tantas ventas, al final del día realicen una película sobre esta. Quiero decir que no leí el libro (ni lo leeré) pero en cuestión de adaptación y censura, supongo que tuvieron que cortar demasiadas escenas de sexo (algunas sumamente estúpidas) para que esta película lograra por lo menos una clasificación \"R\" (o C en México) pero en fin, recuerdo que me senté frente a la computadora y me dije: \"veré esta película sin la necesidad de buscarle contras o con la intención de criticarla\" pero esto no duro ni 10 minutos, la película es un error total, en primer lugar, no me cabe en la cabeza la idea de que esta película es romance y amor (el cual no lo es) pues yo solo veo una atmósfera tétrica, oscura, estúpida, repleta de Sadomasoquismo o masoquismo. ¿Desde cuando las mujeres ven a un hombre enfermo mental atractivo? no lo entiendo, ¿sera porque es millonario? ¿tiene autos de lujo? no tengo idea. Fifty Shades of Grey cuenta la historia de Anastasia, una estudiante virgen tímida que va a entrevistar a Christian Grey para un trabajo de su compañera de cuarto, la interacción de Jamie Dornan con Dakota Johnson es plana, no se sienten reales, Anastasia siempre tiene la misma cara: \"orgasmo\" \"tristeza\" \"orgasmo\" \"enojo\" \"orgasmo\".\nLa relación de estos dos es tonta, aburrida y poco interesante, ambos personajes no aportan nada de carisma, se vuelven tediosos y odiosos, por poner un ejemplo:\nChristian Grey: \"te regale un auto, una computadora, libros y todo lo que tu desees ¿seras mi sumisa? \nAnastasia: No, no quiero volver a verte (pasan 2 minutos) Te amo.\nPor el amor de Dios, esta película es basura! Con lo que respecta a las escenas de sexo, prometen mas de lo que son, así que no vayas con la idea de que veras escenas sexuales sumamente explicitas y polémicas. \nSam Taylor-Johnson hace lo que puede en esta película, no es culpa de ella que la película no funcionara, de hecho se ve que puso todo su esfuerzo para que al menos fuera pasable, la culpa la tiene la historia (y por supuesto la escritora E.L James) una historia aburrida, nada interesante, mediocre y con poca originalidad (¿olvide mencionar que esto es \"Crepúsculo\" con sexo?) Lo único perdonable de aquí es el Soundtrack (por parte de Danny Elfman) no es que sea una obra maestra, pero es lo único decente que tiene esta película (¿esto se le puede llamar película? este termino no entra aquí...)",

In all honesty I have read the book and I can safely say the movie is far more toned down and hence more compelling to watch than it was to read, yet I felt like the sex scenes were never quite sexy just really awkward. And hence my confusion with this movie because when its not showing a sex scene the movie was actually quite comedic and Dakota Johnson kills it adding far more layers to the one-dimensional Ana of the book. Jamie Dornan on the other hand can be quite wooden (pun not intended, okay maybe it was HA) and doesn't necessarily catch the tortured soul of Christian Grey. I mean lets be honest here the books are complete shit so there's not much working for the movie from the beginning and secondary characters are given about a minute's screen time each and hence totally underutilised. It's beautifully shot and well-lit and props to the actors for being comfortable to strip down next to nothing but the movie lacks substance and doesn't explore the psychology of BDSM culture. In summation I think Dakota Johnson was the highlight of this film and I hope she finds better work as she has the acting chops. This review feels awkward sorry. 2/5",

EL James is a talentless hack.  The popularity of this book is just sad on many levels.  Ladies, there is much better erotica out there.  In fact, I'm quite sure I could write my own better erotica.  In any case, while the first 15-20 minutes stuck to the book, that's what made me almost turn off the ridiculous thing.  Seriously stupid dialogue with absolutely no character generation at all.  Just straight into it.  However, I'd like to at least point out the positives.  One, I'm so glad they used an actual writer for the screenplay.  Kelly Marcel changed up quite a bit, especially toward the end, that made the movie pseudo tolerable.  While Jamie Dornan had the arrogance down, I expected a taller, blonder, more Nordic look to Christian.  And, while Dakota played the timid girl-turned-submissive quite well, I honestly expected someone more attractive.  Yet, given the crappy content, they both made it work as best it could.  I admit, I liked the ending much better than the book as it leaves anyone enjoying the film, yearning for the follow-up, which was really the intent all along.",

            "content": "It's inevitable to mention that \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is one of the best films of 2015. It was not as painful as everyone thought. \n\nUndoubtedly \"Jurassic World\" , \"Star Wars\" , \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" and \"Furious 7\" marked path at the box office and critical overall but this year \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" boosted by its Valentine's Day release, have been record-breaking. \n\nGlobally, this film has attracted attention for the exciting and strange love story between English Literature student Anastasia Steele and billionaire businessman Christian Grey. \n\nThe erotic trilogy of books left speechless the whole world and the film was not far behind, Its quality to capture every detail of the book in real life was more attractive to attract the attention of fans and non-fans. \n\nDakota Johnson, daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, she was pleased to execute the Anastasia Steele character, She has done it a perfect way , showing virginity , innocence and sweetness of a woman who had never been in love, she was about to graduate, had the pressure of final exams, had to Jose hounding her and was about to go to a world full of dangers, alone. \n\nJamie Dornan, after playing a serial murderer in BBC Two -The Fall, comes as a replacement of the first elected Charlie Hunnam . The question is : Would have done much better Charlie as Christian ? I doubt it.Jamie made ??an arduous and difficult work , fully achieve the character and that was evident. \n\nSignificantly, relationship Anastasia - Christian was moderate and closely linked to aspects of the bestseller but the relationship Dakota - Jamie has fuelled speculation that the two stars can barely stand each other's company. So Taylor - Johnson responded openly: \n\" The film's biggest single asset is Dakota Johnson: gone is the book's blithering simpleton \" \n\nInterestingly , despite controversy between Sam and James , low public confidence in this project , the low apparent affinity between the main characters and the difficulty of bringing to the screen a book that revolutionized the world ,\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" achievement to be one of the best films of 2015 , so Fifty Shades Darker ( 2017 ) will not have an easy road because Sam will not direct the sequel, James Foley who will be in the director's chair. \n\nThe film's single biggest asset is Johnson, who has worked hard with Marcel and Taylor-Johnson to perform a three-woman salvage job on the character of Anastasia. Gone is the book's blithering simpleton, with her arsenal of \"holy hell\"s and \"double crap\"s and \"oh my\"s. Her inner goddess is, thank goodness, nowhere to be found or heard. She is at no point a quivering, moist mess, and doesn't make the ruinous error of thinking the word \"f___\" is an epithet. \n\nGrey, for obvious reasons, is much more likely to Anastasia for intimacy and mystery with which it has on the books. \n\nPersonally , this film from start to finish was excellent , showing an introduction of a fairy tale , a totally aggressive and an end that surprised us . E. L .James' books are enigmatically catchers for the public but the film is undoubtedly the best of the best. \n\nThe sex scenes are intense thermometer , which threatens to get red hot but not reach the top,and with more participation Dakota that what Jamie. You could say that the submissive from all angles captured is about to undress while the master is not sufficiently dominant achieving momentarily deflect the camera toward her. Even when Grey, with his riding crops and cat-o'-nine-tails and Red Room of Pain, would claim otherwise, these sequences stay well within the bounds of vanilla mainstream taste. \n\nAnastasia is no walkover here and sometimes gives as good as she gets, if not better. The funniest scene - debatably the sexiest, too - has the duo sitting at either end of a glass boardroom table, while Ana whips through the contract for their experimental relationship scratching out everything she won't consent to. The script isn't afraid to call a spade a spade here: \"Find anal fisting. Strike it out.\" \n\nIt's amazing boom that had the soundtrack of the movie taking on its lists Ellie Goulding , The Weeknd , Sia, among others. Music is a quiet and elegant journey that distorts good way every erotic moment of the film, making them much more tolerable to hear groans and hits constantly . \n\nThe punishment of the inner goddess is very worrying and surprising , and the pain she feels , makes us mourn everyone . \"One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six\". \n\nThe end of the movie is the best, leaving an open end and shaking us all with a simple \" No\". (This ending is much better than the book) \n\nThere are no more words to praise the project, \"Sex, love, drama , romance , controversy , music , fame , pen and other things around to \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"",

            "content": "It's hard to think of another film in recent times which has caused more headaches for film fans than Fifty Shades of Grey. Long before its release, cruelly and cynically timed for Valentine's Day, the internet was flooded with more casting rumours, whingeing fans and craven speculation about how raunchy it would be than you would get at a decade's worth of ComicCons. In a frighteningly short space of time, E. L. James' trilogy has become all-pervasive in our culture: it's been embraced, over-indulged, parodied and run into the ground in everything from greetings cards to books about sheds.\n\nAs film fans, we always strive to wade through the Augean stables of ill-deserved reputation. While many in the media are content to wallow in meaningless hype, we aspire to rise above it and approach any given offering with a refreshing dose of perspective. We may not always be the rivers that can wash away all the filth from said stables, but you'd be surprised what a few little streams can achieve. In the case of Fifty Shades of Grey, the biggest surprise is not how far it goes; on the contrary, the film's biggest problem is that, both narratively and sexually, it's pretty tame.\n\nBefore we dive into the sexual politics of the film, it is worth addressing the reputation of the film within a wider context. An awful lot has been written about the book and the film purporting to encourage or condone abuse towards women, something which can never and should never be excused for the sake of entertainment. The concerns of campaigners like Natalie Collins, who say that the film \"romanticised and celebrated\" domestic violence, should be taken seriously; we should not try to devalue or demean real victims of abuse just because their life experience doesn't gel with our attitude towards a piece of media. Equally, however, it is possible to have a positive experience of the film while being mindful of these concerns, as well as noting those voices, like star Dakota Johnson, who believe that there is an emphasis within the story on consent and empowerment.\n\nPeople I have encountered who have read the book (including my fiancee) have led me to believe that Anastasia enjoys more agency in the source material than is immediately evident on screen. They hold that there are more sequences of her saying no to Christian without it resulting in punishment, with more emphasis being on the boundaries put in place by mutual consent. This suggests that Fifty Shades of Grey primarily fails because it is a poor adaptation rather than anything else; certainly the final scene between our two protagonists is bizarrely cut short. But considering the unintentional hilarity that results from much of the dialogue and its delivery, I have a hard time believing that the book is a masterpiece by comparison.\n\nAs with many films which tread the fine line between erotic drama and straight-up pornography, Fifty Shades of Grey wants to market itself on the raunchiness of its sex scenes - and like most of these kinds of films, it comes up short. Whatever is described in the book, the fact that these kinds of scenes generated such a furore is more a damning indictment of how prudish our society remains than anything else. The sex scenes in Basic Instinct or even Goldeneye are steamier than anything here, and in most cases they are better written too. there is nothing that James attempts here that wasn't handled a hundred times better years earlier by the likes of D. H. Lawrence and Anais Nin.\n\nNo matter what the trailers would have you believe, there isn't a great deal in Fifty Shades of Grey which merited it being seen as a top-end 18 certificate. Notwithstanding the false advertising on the part of the studio, it is good that the film is at least trying to focus on drama and character development, rather than just knitting together a series of sex scenes with pointless dialogue. But all the scenes where flesh is present are shot all too tastefully, with little full frontal nudity or associated swearing. Far be it from me to demand more flesh on screen in a culture already sexualised to the hilt, but if a film claiming to be this risqué can be passed uncut, then it's clearly not worthy of its reputation.\n\nAnother big Hollywood problem which lumbers the film is its lack of understanding regarding how S&M relationships work. Hollywood has consistently misunderstood the dynamic of S&M, believing that the sadist's job is to beat the living shit out of the masochist, while the masochist just takes the pain and does what they are told regardless of whether they benefit. The reality is that the submissive partner is always in control, whether through safe words or pre-arranged routines, and the pleasure is more mutual and evenly spread. To this extent, the film does rob Anastasia of some agency; we get the contract scene, but too few other examples of her exerting the influence which she technically possesses.\n\nBecause of both its relatively tame sex scenes and its lack of S&M knowledge, the film fails to be a meaningful or compelling examination of sex and its role in relationships. In my review of The Look of Love, I said \"it is possible to make a film which will arouse an audience in more ways than one, provided that said arousal is supported by a discussion of the issues that surround it.\" But instead of using its reputation or characters as a means to discuss sexual issues, the film just sits there, giving us more of the same for an hour and a half without a clear sense of direction to its action. This is to The Look of Love what The Da Vinci Code was to The Ninth Gate: well-meaning incompetence, rather than active contempt.\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that this film, unlike Basic Instinct or other erotic films of note, was scripted and directed by women. Sam Taylor-Johnson's debut feature Nowhere Boy had a lot of interesting features, and screenwriter Kelly Marcel did a great job on Saving Mr. Banks. But while it's interesting from an industrial standpoint, the film doesn't consciously reflect the talent behind it; it still feels like a film made by a committee who were both afraid of hurting the fans and coy about the subject matter.\n\nDespite Marcel's good work elsewhere, the script for Fifty Shades of Grey is downright risible. Some lines are laugh-out-loud poor, such as Ana asking \"What are buttplugs?\" during the negotiation. But most of the time the dialogue is laughable because of how inept and dull it makes the story. Both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are clearly trying to make something out of a script which gives them precious little in terms of character construction and little development outside of the bedroom. But even then they seem awkward and lacking chemistry, with all of Johnson's lines being delivered in a irritatingly breathy whisper and Dornan being inconsistent in his temper and charisma.\n\nOne aspect of Fifty Shades of Grey which hasn't been so widely discussed is its relationship to vampire fiction. The fact that James' work started out as Twilight fan fiction has been picked up by many wanting to make a cheap joke about its quality, or lack thereof. But the connections run much deeper than this, with both the book and the film having unintentional undertones which tie them very strongly to Dracula.\n\nBoth Bram Stoker's magnum opus and Taylor-Johnson's film have exactly the same character dynamic: a rich aristocrat or other wealthy figure who preys upon poor, vulnerable and virginal women in awe of him, cementing a bond which costs both parties. Fifty Shades of Grey seems unaware of this comparison, but because it fails to properly depict a balance of power between the characters, these similarities do come to the fore. The references to Thomas Hardy are also very telling; Tess of the d'Urbervilles uses a similar dynamic of the rich, cynical, urban man having his wicked way with the simple, rural woman in both a literal and metaphorical rape of the countryside. Suffice to say, Taylor-Johnson doesn't attempt any detailed analysis of this, and the film lacks the political depth that Paul Morrissey achieved on Andy Warhol's Dracula.\n\nWith all of this taking into account, you have to give Taylor-Johnson credit for what she has managed to salvage. The film still looks very sleek, with a cold metallic quality nicely contrasted by all the exterior shots full of foliage. The soundtrack is pretty good too, though Annie Lennox's rendition of 'I Put A Spell On You' is far more spellbindingly memorable than Ellie Goulding's contribution. Most importantly, Taylor-Johnson strives to keep the characters central to the action; even if the performances are not the most convincing, we always get the impression that this is a film about people and not entirely about sex.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey is a surprisingly tame and somewhat disappointing adaptation which neither delivers when it needs to nor turns out to be so-bad-it's-good. Taylor-Johnson strives to keep the characters central and tease out development and intrigue where she can, but she's fighting a losing battle against poor dialogue, flat performances and a peculiar coyness about the subject matter. Whatever happens with the sequels, this remains a sub-par effort which doesn't linger long after viewing.",

It's a disgrace and should be ashamed for daring to even call itself a romance, while it's clearly not. Not only is it one of the worst films (and books) out there, but it's also a horrible influence towards women of all ages and all over the world, telling them that it is ok to be tortured, whipped, beaten up and being sex experimented with, but all for the sake of being with the one they are so stupidly crazyly in love with. Also, after seeing how stupid women proved themselves to be and how horrible and abusive men are SHOWN to be, I just want nothing to do with love or romance. Seriously, it just made me feel that I am way too smart to be in love.\n\nI would probably give it more credit if it had a good story with sex scenes that are shown in a more erotic way, but with such idiotic characters and such stupid story and disgraceful message it gives, I'll have to say that Twilight might end up actually being a better love story. Yes, I said it, Twilight makes a better love story than this. Because, aside from being also really stupid and also being a disgrace of a love story, Twilight at least had some sparks of romance. At least in first two Twilight movies, the guy cares about his girl and he tried to protect and save her (most notably in the first Twilight movie). That shows that the guy somewhat cared and calling it romance and love is somewhat justified.\nHere? The guy is an ignorant and abusive bastard who doesn't give a single crud about the girl at all. Because if he did, he wouldn't do the sexual experiments on her at all. He would treat her like a woman he loves, which he doesn't. Also, the girl is clearly stupid enough to agree to be abused for the sake of being with him and some point, you'd expect her to stand for her rights to say she doesn't enjoy it all or even call the police after that or even after finding out he did the same thing to a bunch of other women before her. But, she doesn't do anything about it, sometimes making it worse for her.\nAnd don't get me wrong, Twilight is an awful series, both film and book. The characters are morons and they had some stupid s*** such as making the vampires glow in the light, a whole bunch of other f***. However, in terms of which one of these two is closer to what love and romance is.... I'm sorry, but f***ing Twilight got closer! That had at least SOME elements of romance. THIS is a shame and disgrace to even be CALLED romance. F***. That. S***!\nAnd just to make it all worse, they had this released on Valentine's day. A real slap.... No, a real PUNCH in the face towards true romance and love. \nAlso, women are hypocritical when saying this movie (and book) are s***. Why? Because they say it's horrible, while in actuallity, once it came out, they all ran into the theaters just so they can desperately see it.\n\nSo overall, this is another one of those things in life that are not suppose to exist, yet it does, and Normal people (believe me when I say \"Normal\") have lost faith in humanity because of it. And finding out it was sold well in both mediums, it just make me want to do the same thing Tom and Jerry once did, which is to sit down on train tracks and wait for the train to run me over. Because this is one of the proofs that it would appear that nowadays it is a trend to make a film adaptation of ever piece of crap that has been written, whether people like it or not. Also, just because the guy is \"handsome\" (yeah, I put it in quotes because I do not find him good looking at all) doesn't mean the movie is good. Looks don't make the movie. It is the talent, good acting, good directing and especially good writing that make a movie that can be enjoyable.\nThis is one of those that has non of those things. And considering that there's more of that s*** to come in about two years, it's enough for me to pray that women being disappointed after watching this crap got some human sense knocked into their heads which would help Normal people to get this to disappear as soon as possible and be gone in a pit of obscurity with other bad movies, like Jurrassic Park: The Lost World, Garbage Pail Kids, The Legend of the Titanic and most movies that came in 2013.",

I'm beginning to think that this movie is a first step in pioneering a trend that was paved in literature by Henry Miller and James Joyce, and now has become de riguer in most recent publications, of including at least one XXX porn description. Peter Benchley's novel Jaws even has just the one graphic sex scene, and that scene could be used as script for a  porn movie much easier than Speilberg's adaptation of the book's violent parts.\nI don't know if this is a good trend, for more quantities of more graphic sex to be included in popular entertainment. but like violence it seems to be the path now followed.",

Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are so stale- I haven't seen Johnson in much, but I have seen Dornan in \"The Fall\" and I know he is capable of delivering. I fault the creative team that adapted the book to the film: after all I heard, I was surprised how dull the interactions between the two were and how tame the sex scenes were. This movie shouldn't have been R- if they wanted to hit that target audience full force, they should have gone for NC-17. The one saving grace here is the soundtrack- The Weeknd, Ellie Goulding, and Sia all contributed stellar new songs, in addition to classics by Frank Sinatra and the Rolling Stones. It is, honestly, probably my favorite soundtrack of the year. Too bad it's supporting one of the worst movies of the year.",

Something happened in his psychological development that went askew and he is pulling this poor innocent girl into this neurosis.

            "content": "The erotic romance novel that took the world by storm has now been transformed for the big screenâ?¦ or in other words, people that arenâ??t bothered to read the novel can feast their eyes on moving pictures. Yes, this transition generated even more hype than the novel for fans are now able to actually vividly witness the erotic fantasies that tickled their fancy in the first place. E.L. Jamesâ?? novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, topped best-seller lists around the world, has been translated into 52 languages and has defeated the negative feedback of critics and reached global popularity thanks to the people, and this is essentially down to its controversial topic of BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism). But, the real question is could the film adaptation replicate the same controversial sexual depictions on a visually, less discreet level? Unfortunately, Fifty Shades of Grey is the biggest disappointment of the year, and considering it is only February, that is saying a lot. There seems to be a shortage of the eroticism that made the novel popular, perhaps Taylor-Johnson wanted to retain some female dignity despite the awful treatment of women, but all in all this adaptation flops on every single level.\n \nFifty Shades of Grey revolves around Anastasia Steele, a 21-year old undergraduate at Washington State University near Vancouver, Washington. Due to her roommateâ??s inability to interview a wealthy 27-year old entrepreneur, Anastasia agrees to help her out, but as soon as Christian lays his eyes on her, her life changes completely. Christian seeks her out intently, arousing the curious Anastasia in the process. But, as they grow closer, Christian reveals that he cannot ever be in love, as he prefers controlled bondage. Anastasia is more curious than disturbed, but how long can she really live this fantasy and not experience the true darkness of Christianâ??s cravings.\n \nChristianâ??s interest in a subculture relationship where he can be the dominant and Ana the submissive, allows the film to explore the territories of controlled bondage. However, the lack of bondage is alarming for a film that sold itself on the disbelief of its perverse love story. Ana and Christian actually make love at first, straight after revealing that he only â??fucks,â?? and at this point you wonder if youâ??re watching the right film! After this rather unexpected moment, there are only a handful of bondage scenes to choose from, and then again they are so unrevealing and brief, that just because sexual tools are being used doesnâ??t mean it will heighten the sexual intensity. By what Fifty Shades tells us, bondage is simply tying a person up with whatever you can find and punishing them like a child. It is pretty sad viewing because there is no meaning behind the story; sexual fiends like Grey should not be allowed a place in cinema. If Fifty Shades were sexually gratuitous then it possibly would have been fine because its fame is indebted to that, but because Taylor-Johnson attempts to find the love in something so unloving makes Fifty Shades of Grey such a confused film that doesnâ??t know how to express itself. There is hardly anything for us to call the film a sexual thriller as even the music is used at wrong moments, especially the sexual ones. The song â??Earned Itâ?? by The Weeknd is perhaps the only song that deserves its place within the movie for its sexual overtones are immense, but it is used for a car journey! Fifty Shades of Grey is so unsexual that you can describe Basic Instinct as a whole lot worse, but Last Tango in Paris puts this film to shame.\n \nDakota Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele, the literature student whose sexual life takes a whirlwind evolution. First of all, Johnson deserves kudos for even wanting to be shown to the world as a sex slave, and secondly, she is the best thing about the film. She captures the vulnerable innocence of Ana at the beginning, but as she is enlightened to this whole new world, she develops a tough side under that susceptibility of hers that makes the story far more interesting than it should really be. Jamie Dornanâ??s erotically extreme Christian Grey is perhaps the most depraved character to appear on screen in the past few years. Dornan may have the physical appeal to fill the role, but he seems too robotic to play the desirable pervert as he fails to offer any sort of dimension to his personality. Everyone else donâ??t matter because no one really knows what their relationship is about. But, the shocking cameo from Rita Ora requires a mention for she now has two films to her name with Fast and Furious 6 already as cringe-worthy as you can get. She wasnâ??t even a singer until a few years ago, how dare she think she can be an actress too!\n \nFifty Shades of Grey suffers terribly from the awfulness of its script. Characters are introduced but we donâ??t really care about them or anything they do. The relationship between Ana and Christian is irritating because it needs more moments of conversation. They hardly speak and this forces us to deduce their relationship based on the acting, and the acting isnâ??t that good so weâ??re hopeless passengers that are unable to identify with the story. Scenes are also overlong and fruitless in grabbing our attention. All we want is to see and be shocked by the eroticism that has gripped the world, but Fifty Shades of Grey promises to deliver only 20% of your wildest expectations. You begin to question what is the point of this film as Christian just wants someone beneath him so he can smack her and do all sorts, whilst she falls in love with his ways, but at the end he smacks her one smack too far and then that is it, at the close of an elevatorâ??s door it endsâ?¦ the film is a complete waste of time nobody should bother seeing unless you want to be dissatisfied.\n \nJust because Fifty Shades of Grey tells an intensely sexual tale doesnâ??t mean the tale is worth telling. It goes to show that our society desires a sexual edge to everything! Fifty Shades of Grey the novel may have been seriously steamy to generate a global hoo-hah, but the film has destroyed any sort of popularity the book had, as it was too unsexual to not disappoint. Grossing over $527 million just a few weeks since its release demonstrates how its popularity has attracted peopleâ??s curiosity, yet it also discloses the tonnes of people the film has let down. This is down to the fact that the director and author clashed a lot on how the film should be executed. Taylor-Johnson has proven that she was not up to the task as she poorly utilises the source material, causing her to end up with something that lacks any sort of sexual bite to have an impact. Fifty Shades of Grey is the most hyped up film of the decade, and boy did it let everyone down!\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nUtterly underwhelming to say the least, Fifty Shades of Grey is a droning sexual affair that has failed to live up to its overhyped build-up.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        2/10",

Fifty Shades of Grey is the male equivalent of all of the movies that regular dudes get a highly beautiful or interesting woman interested in them as a matter of routine. I guess the movie gets points for not being the norm, but that's about all I can positively say about it besides being competently directed and being a merely meh movie.

So I rented it with my own money and watched it, only to realize that not only did I regret paying my own money for this movie, but I also regret watching this terrible film. Lets get to the good stuff already, Dakota Johnson is really good and brings out some of the humor from the dumb lines that she says. The soundtrack by Danny Elfman is really good which I was actually looking forward to that in a good way, and it didn't disappointed me.  The shots for the movies are good, including the sex scenes, and that's all the good stuff I can think of. Jamie Dornan is terrible and just bland in this film. I was looking forward to seeing singers like Rita Ora act in this, but she was very underused which was pointless that she was even in this. I was very disappointed of how the script went, but I don't blame Kelly Marcel for it because I heard some sources that she was very disappointed of what the final result of the film was, and there were a lot of disagreements between her and the author herself. The writing is very dull with not much laughable lines in there. The chemistry between Anastasia and Christian is terrible, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. The plot is awful, as there isn't a plot at all. I was curious to see what the sex scenes are like as the book is famous for those and the terrible writing, but the sex scenes are very safe, and just very standard. The characters are forgettable, although one of the things I hate, is that the movie portrays women very negative in that in order to get the man she want to be with, she has to surrender and weaken herself to the man, do what he says, and if she keeps it up, that's when she gets him. The ending was so brief and so terrible that I was just glad that the movie is over. It's been a while for me to be sick of a movie as while Fifty Shades of Grey is not the worst film I've seen, it's definitely one of the worst romance films I have seen, it's actually a bit worse than Twilight which astounds me to a degree, and when there's going to be sequels coming up, I'm gonna be groaning as I'm probably going to watch them too.",

After perusing a couple of pages and slamming the book shut (it really is just cheap erotica), I had hoped that the makers of the film version of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" would attempt to improve on the source material. I was hoping it wasn't as bad as people said it was (those people are also not fans of the series). My suspicions were confirmed. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is every bit as awful, frustrating, angering, and unromantic as I thought it would be. \n\nDirector Sam-Taylor Johnson (whose teen John Lennon meditation \"Nowhere Boy\" I enjoyed very much) is able to inject some style into certain scenes with some help from the production design and the director of photography. And on the plus side, the soundtrack is nifty. \n\nHowever, the movie does not work if you don't have the right people playing these characters, and though Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are talented, attractive individuals (they definitely look good naked and physically can get through a sex scene passably), they are totally wrong for these parts. There is no chemistry to go along with the heat, however little heat there is. Their discomfort with the material is evident from the beginning. Johnson unintentionally plays up Anastasia's awkwardness and sadly, a lot of the supposedly romantic scenes become funny in a bad way. Jamie Dornan, on the other hand, is not awkward. He unfortunately enhances Christian Grey's creep factor with all of the menace of a psychopathic yuppie out of \"American Psycho\" and only paints an even worse picture of the character than I already had. \n\nBut that's not the actors' fault. The blame really lies on the source material and Kelly Marcel's insufferable script, which comes loaded with cringe-inducing dialogue. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is not romantic in any way. It is not a hot, steamy love story for the modern age. What the filmmakers and the writers refuse to admit is that the interaction between Mr. Grey and Anastasia Steele is ultimately abusive and manipulative. Nobody is in love here. It's one giant S&M fantasy that author E.L. James and screenwriter Marcel should have done more research on.",

Christian Grey seems like less of a psychopath in this than the book, but he is still, in my opinion, an abuser. I also still don't buy the relationship between him and Anastasia. I just don't believe a women would go from being a virgin to being in a BDSM relationship just like that. One welcome change is that you do not hear Ana's thoughts.

I guess those parts played a big role and it's not like other movies where the two people just engaged in sex because they're attracted to each other and all that stuff, blah blah blah. This movie was exploring deep, not the sex, but the relationship between Grey and Ana. They're at a different wavelength but while more in the same zone. This movie can be interpreted in so many ways but I really think it's showing how two people have more than one trouble, not each other but for themselves as well. Grey's characteristics tells me that he doesn't want what Ana wants and something or someone is preventing him to do so. This kind of story isn't the first thing down the line, there are similar stories out there that shares similarities in a situation that Grey and Ana are having  and some of those stories didn't end well. Suffice to say, this movie was actually interesting and it has some cheesy and weird moments. It really focus Grey and Ana a lot and of course, the characters were treated just like any other supporting/miscellaneous characters in a typical formula of creating a story but that's okay. I'm totally okay with that. I didn't realize that this movie was a planned trilogy when I found the book has two more.

The relationship between the two lead roles was this movies greatest asset, the inquisitiveness and innocence of one, against the dominance and bluntness of another. Watching her sweet mind pick holes in this mans seemingly impenetrable need for control was intriguing, resulting in him slowly questioning his desires in the bedroom. Could she shape him into the man she wants, or would he get his way as always - that was the question which I was tuning in to find out. The graphic nudity was not as arousing as the book may have portrayed, perhaps leaving some disappointed. It was also very repetitive. The first encounter involved some sensual stripping of one another, but so did the second, and third, and fourth scenes. There was the odd moment of wham bam Thank you mam Inbetween, but it was certainly the verbal interaction that took the forefront over the physical side. The conclusive scenes of ultimate punishment were somewhat anticlimactic after she received a couple of strikes with the belt but I like to think that that was just the lead up into the second film, rather than the poor ending of the first. Yes I'm glad I've seen it, if purely for the fact that I can now join in every conversation women are having in the workplace or outside it. Most appear to have similar opinions to i by way of this being a minor let down, but in fairness, there's not much more this showing could have done without turning it into tasteless pornography. It was well acted, well built up, and the dialogue between the leads gave this a great deal of credibility. There was clearly barriers to how far this film could actually go and it has possibly suffered from the over erotic literary content that has got women's expectations and juices flowing too freely.",

If Dakota Johnson's character doesn't like what Mr. Grey does to her then why didn't she just leave him in the beginning instead of waiting. Dakota Johnson has the potential to be a great actress but she needs to be in the right movies. The writing for this movie is laughable and very cheesy. There were some parts that I laughed because the lines that were delivered were so bad that I had to laugh at. A lot of people were defending this film by saying most of the stuff in the film were in the book.....then why was it in the book in the first place. Fifty Shades Of Grey is so far one of the worst films of 2015 so far and probably one of the worst films I've ever seen.",

When the books came out, everyone was talking about them at school and work like they are salacious. And as I've said, I love trash, so I picked up the first book, and I use the term \"book\" loosely. It was horribly written. I think even those who like it know that. I stopped early on because the book offended me, and not with steamy content, but with its message to young girls (regardless of the fact that mostly middle aged women were the target audience). The main character was sexually inexperienced, yet performed like a pro on her first outing. I think this fantasy is damaging in that it leaves young people with the impression that sexual prowess is something you're born with rather than something that develops over time and with experience. However, those facts aside, I wondered if the movie would fix some of the errors. I couldn't say if it did or didn't, all I can say is I don't know why on earth anyone finds this story enthralling. I found it dull, and maybe that's because I don't find the premise of a billionaire whisking me off to meet his family while I consider a legally binding contract to be his sex slave appealing personally, but there are plenty of films that do not reflect my life dream or fantasy relationship that I still, nonetheless, enjoy watching. To those in the audience of my local theater, including my friends that went with me, I apologize for my snoring, I know it must have been awful because I woke myself up a few times.\n\nHave a different Take?

Honestly Dakota Johnson was one aspect that was alright. Unlike Jamie I do look forward to seeing her in other roles in the future that do not involve this series. Given the fact that this story is very similar to Twilight I imagine that it attracts the same audience, I have heard many times since this released that it is nothing like Twilight. Ignorance is bliss I guess. Anyway other than Dakota the one other aspect of the movie that was decent is the cinematography, though it is not a marvel like Birdman, it makes drudging through the painfully long, never ending, boring movie a slight bit more enjoyable. For fun when I watch movies I often times like to grade them in my mind, when Jamie Dornan belts out that one magnificently terrible line when questioned why he is the way he is, I could not control my laughter and thought how does he know the title of the movie? Is this just a common phrase he uses? If it weren't already at an F it would have dropped a full grade mark. In the end if you're a teenage girl who enjoyed Twilight or other films of this nature you'll enjoy it and it's not my place to criticize you for liking what you like but if you,  in my opinion, enjoy quality movies skip this one.",

After all the dominating talk about what he's going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys, he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he can't live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie. The storyline is extremely simple! Basically, woman meets man! Man & Woman fall for each other! Man has a weird sex appetite! They Get It On! Simple! I thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love. I can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a man's point of view, it's boring and pointless. The acting wasn't bad because I was intrigued about the individuals background but I can't help feeling cheated. Maybe it's better on paper than it is on the big screen! Anyway, it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so there's obviously an audience for this type of movie but I really didn't get why there is so much hype surrounding it. Terrible!\n\nRound-Up:\nFor a movie that is based around two characters falling in love, I really can't see were the $40million budget went. Jamie Doman has only really starred in TV series, except for his role in Marie Antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster. Dakota Johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies, like 21 Jump Street, Need For Speed, The Social Network and Black Mass starring Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch so she's obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen. Personally, I haven't heard of her before so I thought that she was a newcomer. Anyway, the director, Samantha Taylor-Johnson, has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are Districted, Nowhere Boy. Maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad. Its been reported that she won't be returning to make Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed so there's a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish.\n\nBudget: $40million\nWorldwide Gross: $570million (WOW!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird, sexual appetite. 2/10",

The actors were not really attractive once they open their mouths. Whatever this is, it is NOT BDSM and not even close to being romantic. Stunningly dull.

            "content": "With hopes of finding a movie so terrible that it was entertaining, the internationally recognized Fifty Shades of Grey sounded like an ideal fit for the criteria.\n\nI say that because almost everybody on the internet in the western world would know about the source novel that is Fifty Shades of Grey, and it is known for being originally a fan piece based on the ridiculouly terrible Twilight series and for being one of the most commercially succesful erotic novels of all time. The writing style has been often lambasted by critics as have the thin characters, and so it sounds like this is one of the few times where a text would honestly work better as a film than in its original novel format. This seems to be the general consensus with critics, and in all honesty the film was not as bad as I was expecting, Nevertheless, the story itself is just so poor that it drives everything down.\nAs the Fifty Shades of Grey novel itself is notable for a mix of poor writing and high pressure sexuality, there is little to expect from its film adaptation. And since the film is not a pornographic adaptation but rather an extensively promoted commercial film, this severly limits the level of sexuality that can be depicted. The nudity is tasteful, but it hardly hits any effective level of eroticism explained in the novel. I pretty much expected that, but I was more frustrated by how little nudity there was in the film. Since Fifty Shades of Grey has to pretend that its story matters, it has to be more balanced with the sex scenes in the film being moderated. But there are no genitals. Yeah, none. There is a sporadic amount of butts and boobs, but nothing else. I just knew that there would not be one penis on screen in the film, and that was right. It may have come close in one scene, but for an entire film about sex, there is no dongs. I expected this much because of Hollywood's inability to handle depiction of penises on screen, but the lack of vagina is also pathetic. The fact is that Fifty Shades of Grey is extremely tame with its nudity, and frankly that makes it hard to masturbate to. I will admit that the sex scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey were captured in an erotic sense with smooth moving cinematography, gently timed editing and a soundtrack composed of atmospheric covers of less-than stellar songs from recent years. This illuminates that the film has a sense of style which is consistent throughout the film as the colour scheme is consistent with the narrative and the cinematography captures everything nicely which does not apply strictly to the sex scenes in the film but to the entire experience throughout. However, the styly cannot compensate for the story.\nBecause the sexuality in Fifty Shades of Grey is so tame, the dull nature of the narrative is made all the more clear beneath the style of the film. The story itself has characters who are not interesting and a relationship which is just confusing as it goes between being about obsession, sexual desires and even possession without any consistency. What goes on between Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele and Christian Grey is uncreative and dull writing, and no amount of style or acting can save the fact that the film is about a relationship which starts nowhere and goes in circles which leaves it ending in the same position. The actors may have chemistry, but there is nothing to learn from the film. Viewers will most likely walk away from Fifty Shades of Grey with no understanding of the relationship shared between the couple at the heart of the story. E. L. James really is not a person who knows how to make characters, and I can't imagine what it would be like to read through this dull and directionless story when watching it is boring enough. I will admit that the style of the film caught be off guard occasionallyt which served as a sporadic distraction, but when I actually thought about the kind of film that I was watching I realized that it was the same pathetic romantic drama made by everybody else ever only with a creepy male character and a slight sense of style. The story in Fifty Shades of Grey is not one that needs to be told, and that is all there is to it.\nI will admit that the cast of Fifty Shades of Grey performed better than I expected.\nDakota Johnson delivers a fine leading performance as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey. I've never read the source novel before, but I am aware that the character has often being criticised for being ridiculously idiotic and saying \"Oh My\" more than George Takei. Dakota Johnson approaches the role well enough so that it is not idiotic but in such a way that the character is somewhat naive, albeit passionate. She takes the material very seriously and manages to play the character with strong sex appeal and a powerful grip over the drama in the more hard hitting scenes of the film. Dakota Johnson's leading performance transcends the incompetent writing in Fifty Shades of Grey and paves the way for a potentially strong career.\nJamie Dornan is also effective as Christian Grey. Also stuck in the part of a one-dimensional character, Jamie Dornan captures a mysterious edge for the character Christian Grey and puts on a hard-edged facade to bury things inside. But there is a genuine sense that he is hiding something and not only playing the role as a shallow character, particularly in the way that he interacts with Dakoata Johnson. The relationship they share is poorly depicted, but Jamie Dornan's ability to capture both a sense of passion for her and for the idea of possessing her is intense. Jamie Dornan makes a good effort in Fifty Shades of Grey by capturing a darkly sense of charm and sophistication with a touch of madness which becomes more apparent as the film \"progresses\".\n\nSo Fifty Shades of Grey benefits from the performances of Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as well as Sam Taylor-Johnson's ability to capture a sense of style, but with the narrative being so incoherent, stupid and repetitive, it drags everything else down in this overlong and tame excuse for a film.",

The only thing that saved the sloppy script were the two leads (but as i've already said we've seen this before) and though I liked the tone, pace, and some of the vulnerability it showed, 50 Shades of Grey did not explore a lot of territory that we haven't already seen before and the ending leaves you empty and wanting more, but what i can say is i was mostly entertained till the end.",

            "content": "A billionaire with an exclusive penthouse condo, private helicopter, private jet, over a half dozen expensive, luxury cars, CEO of his own company.  Very plausible.  A 27 year-old billionaire with all of this already in place, even though he was adopted at age four by a wealthy family. Not so plausible.   (Compare:  \"In 1987 Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue, just days before his 32nd birthday.\")  Between the ages 15 through 21, Christopher Grey spent six years as a submissive to a married woman who was his dominant.  Then, consider that he had 15 submissives in the one particular \"play room\" we see in the movie.  The book says that the standard Submissive-Dominant contrasts were for three months and that he had four long term relationships in his life.  If you do the math, fifteen submissives, each lasting three months is 3.75 years (45 months).  Some of the submissives lasted more than three months.  We aren't told when he started his company or when his net worth hit one billion, but this information suggests that he had roughly six years, give or take, to accomplish this level of wealth.  I'm assuming that perhaps he went to college and either dropped out (like Bill Gates did) or he graduated at age 21.  How many Bill Gates are there in the United States?  Even if he did not attend college, it's not too plausible that Grey could be a billionaire.  Maybe the point was to make him unquestionably powerful, influential, extraordinary, and sexy to Anna.  \nAnna's character is more conceivable.   She was a virgin at age 21 or 22, no prior boyfriends, graduating with honors (thesis notes) in English literature, with no definite plans upon graduation except for moving to Seattle with her friend and roommate.   (Just so happens that Mr. Grey resides in Seattle.)  She fell hard for Grey due to her vulnerability and because she was not attracted to any of her peers.  Enter the Knight in Shining Armor and she cannot resist him no matter what.   \nThere were so many telltale signs that she shouldn't get involved with a man who tells her point blank that he does not do romance; he only fucks---hard.  He warned her three times.  She is lucky that Grey did not destroy her when he reconciled the condition of her virginity.  In this respect, Grey is confusing as to what he is being that he could \"make love\" on this one occasion.  It could be that he decided that a woman with zero experience was an opportunity he shouldn't pass up.       \nAside from the fairytale of a 27 year-old billionaire, the problem with the movie is that it confuses the issue as to what Christian Grey really is.  If the information provided by Wikipedia is accurate, he seems to fall under one of the four classes of \"sexual masochists\", rather than one of the four classes of \"sexual sadists\".  Yet, Anna says to him \"You're a sadist!\" and he does not really respond or deny her labeling.  Is he in fact a sadist because of the type of punishment he administers such as whipping women with a belt and having them count each time they are struck?  Not until I saw that only people who must engage non-consensually could be a killer, rapist or a dominant that inflicts serious injury, was I convinced that Grey was not one of these people.   (And, there is doubt that \"only\" is accurate?)  I would have preferred that Anna's research on BDSM covered this ground because the movie producers and directors have a responsibility when dealing with sensitive topics with main stream audiences.   Secondly, wouldn't Anna's character who leads a very constrained life have this very concern that her life might be in actual danger?    \nWhen Grey and Anna had a \"business meeting\" in a conference room, at his office, to negotiate the terms of the SD contract, it seemed that some viewers could easily confuse some of the practices that can be deemed non-BDSM with BDSM only behavior.   \nHow was Grey able to control his actions and how was he able to respect the limits set by his submissives?  He was sexually abused at age 15 having been seduced by an older woman to become her submissive, after all.  (Isn't that statutory rape?)  And, this is on top of abuse in the first four years of his life by his biological mother, a drug addict and prostitute.  Remember, he tells Anna that if he told her why he must punish women so severely, she would not have anything to do with him.  Part of the reason he had some self-control might be because he needed to win the trust of his female submissives, which he needed in order to maintain the consensual relationships.  The answer might also have to do with the doctor (probably a psychologist) that he confided in and the paid sex he utilized in his training to become a dominant, according to the book.   The movie should have touched on these aspects of Mr. Grey's behavior as the issue was left wide open.  Having formal written contracts does not imply an ability to have self-control and the capacity to respect for another's limits or preferences.  Without self-control the contract terms can be easily breached.      \nThe good thing about the movie was that the sex scenes, although I've read that they are covered in 20 minutes (roughly 18% of the movie), were kept minimal in number and filmed or edited to give the audience a brief view of the actual sexual activity so that our minds can fill in the rest.   The romance story was the emphasis, rather than, a full exhibition of soft porn.   \nI'm not sure what the movie intended to say about BDSM.  Even if there was no intentional message, it does send out some harmful or distorted messages.",

Comparable events that were stupid in Twilight become even more idiotic once the supernatural element is taken away. Most of the plot revolves around the signing of a contract for their sexual adventures to go forth but then it is later disregarded having no meaning. One of the main plot points has zero meaning. Story is only one of the many problems this movie has, with the prime thing being the script. If you are alive, then you would gag at how terrible everything anyone says is, just utter drivel. Actually to be fair it could have been spun as a comedy and then the script would be spot on. Onto the acting, which was not just bad - it was awful. Jamie Dornan could be a nice guy in real life, but as an actor in this film he was the worst; just the delivery of every line is unbelievable and as bland as sugar-free cheesecake. The constant lip biting which was focused on made it not sexy at all. Also a little thing, but why does she have a flip phone? Just why?\n\nMoving on to what you really want to hear about, how well does the film portray the erotic moments of the book. As you may be aware, the infamous tampon scene was cut. What was left in was a few sex scenes similar to any other movie and then after 90 minutes of a 2 hour film they enter the playroom. Once inside, not much of what is shown would be even slightly steamy. Not helping the fact, is the utter lack of chemistry between the two leads. \n\nNot only does Fifty Shades Of Grey lack any deep exploration into the discovery of BDSM and its psychology, it fails as a simple movie that has a couple falling in love and having sex. The music adds more emotion then any character or plot point in the film. It fails as everything but perhaps a comedy. Half a point because it made me laugh.",

They meet and immediately Christian is drawn to Anastasia. Soon enough he starts popping up at Anastasia's work, grabs coffee and they both have a pretty sure thing attraction to each other. There's more to it though with Christian eventually revealing to Anastasia that he's into S&M. He wants Anastasia to sign a contract agreeing to all these things between them which he can and can't do. Anastasia seems to want it at first, but is really looking for more of a romantic relationship something that Christian has told her he doesn't do. The film continues on exploring their relationship and how controlling Christian ultimately becomes. I will say right off the bat Johnson and Dornan have a great on screen chemistry. They work off each other well (especially during the more intimate scenes) and they seem believable. Unfortunately, the films writing is atrocious. Dialogue seems off and wooden at times and unbelievable. The films pacing is also really bad. It's only a 2 hour film, but it almost feels like three. There's a lot of the movie that could have been cut down and edited for pacing purposes (especially the last half) where I felt scenes were just repeats of what had happened already.

But ultimately Fifty Shades fails because the effort is tepid and unwilling to fully embrace its trashy origins. \n\nFifty Shades of Gray and its sequels are mega-selling novels with worldwide success. Written by 50ish Brit E.L. James - the author made up this pseudonym to avoid judgment from her friends; a wise choice - Fifty Shades was conceived after she fell in love with the Twilight novels. James even desired to have Robert Pattinson play the role of Christian Gray! WTF.\n\n Most readers with discerning taste will tell you that those Fifty Shades books make the Twilight series read like Shakespeare. That is not a ringing endorsement of the material. So is the movie better? Certainly, but it still doesn't rise to the titillating levels of classic trash like Wild Things, 9  1/2 Weeks, and Showgirls. It's a little too self-conscious probably because a soft R-rating had to be required by any studio seeing dollar signs. I still expected more from a female director especially one who in her 40's bedded hot actor Aaron Taylor (Kick-Ass; Avengers 2) and had two kids with her boytoy. So Jamie Dornan (the enigmatic serial killer on Netflix's The Fall - everyone should be watching this) is a cool, emotionally vacuous Christian with just a hint of danger when he should exude a lot. And Dakota Johnson, daughter of Hollywood royalty Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, is adequate as Anastasia Steele. But she's so whiny. He states clearly want he wants, even writes it in a contract! And she still bitches. It makes their torrid bedroom play - including flogging, bondage, and guilt - seem like a typical contentious relationship. He wants it his way and pays for it, but she still wants more. The things money can't buy - like love, respect, humanity. \n\nTwo more of these are coming to theaters in the near future.

They're both not terrible looking, but they are not drop-dead gorgeous to the point that guys should be fighting for them; if either one of them were playing hard-to-get, I promise you: any guy would just move on.  This series is wildly popular, and I really haven't been able to determine why.  I have not read the books, but my wife confirmed that they are amateurishly written, overusing the word \"clamor\" more times than she could count.  What's frustrating about this material has very little to do with the depravity of it all, it is grating because the characters are so inconsistent.  As smart as Anastasia is supposed to be, she freaks out when Christian does his usual activities...  that is literally what she signed up for, and I do mean that a contract is drafted.  At the same time, Christian repeatedly says \"I don't do romance\", and then proceeds to take Anastasia on helicopter rides, plane rides, and out for family dinners.  Apart from having a dark streak in the bedroom, the guy does nothing BUT romance.  Both of them do nothing but send mixed signals, which would be frustrating in any relationship, never mind in a movie.  This is also really creepy, and again, it has very little to do with the kinky flair this story has to it.  Christian is essentially a sexually scarred Bruce Wayne throughout this, and he appears out of nowhere at Anastasia's place of work to surprise her with a date.  He also apparently has tracking hooked up to her BAL, because the moment Anastasia has one drink too many, he again, appears out of nowhere.  He has so many sociopathic tendencies that it would cause red flags to go up for anybody, but Anastasia remains oblivious throughout.  You can watch this as an unintentional comedy and have a movie to laugh at and make fun of all of the melodrama, much like The Boy Next Door, but that's really the best I can say about it.  This story will lead women to believe that you can change your man to be the guy of your dreams, which is not a message females today really need to be hearing.  Bottom line: both of these characters need to get over themselves, and I promise you will feel the same way if you choose to watch this.",

            "content": "The best thing about this film is that its quite clear Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has talent. Its clear she knows what she's doing, implores excellent cinematography and the music by Danny Elfman is riveting, as always. Whats sad, therefore, is how depressingly dull and bland this film feels. The reason why this may be is that the director had the mammoth task of adapting the utterly diabolical novel into a feature film, which wasn't helped by the author's constant need to intervene. What's worse, the director will not be continuing to the film's sequel, rather the author will become MORE involved as a screenwriter!!! \n\nThe problem here is that the author's words are as eloquent and sophisticated as a child's dribble, something that doesn't transition well on screen. From the beginning, it's clear Taylor-Johnson tries to fight this, apparently cutting much of the author's ridiculous dialogue and numbingly repulsive torture sex and attempting to focus more on character development. Whilst I applaud this, truly, there are a couple of problems that arise as a result. The first, is that the film becomes exceedingly dull. Given 80% of the author's book is just, well, porn and with her limiting capabilities as a writer, most of the character development is either barely apparent or barely passable. This means that, for Johnson, she struggles to truly create a sensual film. The next is that, myself excluded, many will see this film for the same reason they read the books: it's an erotica story. But this film is not erotic, failing to live up to it's most 'useful' purpose.\n\nThen we get to the central romance. Now, admittedly, both actors somewhat struggle with the screenplay given some of the grammatical inaccuracies get transitioned to film, making the foreplay much less interesting. Yes, this film does this. However, what truly sinks this film is the chemistry between the lead actors. Dakota Johnson is actually a very fine actress, and she really endevours to work with the terrible script and muddled story. Even in the first scene, her meeting with Mr. Grey, she excels in the script's comical (a nice touch by the director) elements and shines in the vulnerable moments. Unfortunately, Johnson is not matched well on screen. Jamie Dornan is wooden, uninteresting and frankly dull as a troubled Mr. Grey. He fails to become a truly engaging character and ruins the possibility of the film being even a guilty romance. \n\nWorse still, the film has a terribly unsatisfied, rushed conclusion that leaves many threads unresolved. This means that YOU have to wait another year just to see if they get together again, which they will as it's so damn predictable. But, I must firmly digress, nothing is achieved by having unresolved endings to a film where it doesn't add further intrigue to the ongoing story. Fifty Shades does not do this. It leaves you feeling cold and cheated. I would be more inclined to have viewed this film if I knew the author had no involvement and the romance was not as shitty.\n\nThis film achieved the impossible by making erotica boring. Like the Transformers franchise, its baffling how something so creative or steamy can become so bland and uninspired. With help from the lead actor's wooden behaviour, shoddy dialogue, ridiculous and unrewarding sex scenes, an unsatisfying conclusion and the fact that it's adapted from E L James' miserable novel bury this film beyond hope of redemption. Whats more ironic is how the film's title, Fifty Shades of Grey, epitomises how you'll feel after the credits roll.",

I felt like the actors were holding back on their performances, but the material of the book may have had something to do with this. What will Hollywood allow on screen? I didn't sense the passion between the two actors that I felt the characters had in the book. I wanted to feel this surrender on both sides that led to their bond. The movie does follow the book's timeline accurately. The story beings when Anastasia Steele covers for her roommate & best friend to do an interview of Christian Grey, who is a billionaire & Publishing giant. Anastasia & Christian immediately are attracted to each other during the interview. Christian decides to pursue her. As Christian shows up at her job unannounced & slowly reveals her is not quite the typical businessman. Anastasia becomes drawn to his dark sexuality. When Christian reveals his specific sexual tastes, Anastasia is intrigued & against her own red flags decides to take on this journey of exploration with Christian. When he shows her a contract he has her sign, and a room where she would be staying, the formalness of the arrangement sinks in. I think the movie should have less focus on the S&M relationship as it not considered a psychological illness, it is a choice between two consenting adults. What is interesting is the psychological journey of both characters. How they got to this place in their lives, and their need for completion.",

They heard about the play room and judged the book by the cover. Literally. Since it's been awhile since I read the books I felt the movie left some important details out that the viewers who had never read the book needed to be aware of. It's clear how possessive and narcissistic Grey is and that he's got a troubled past he won't share with Ana but they could've elaborated the pain he felt more when she touches him for example the way it was in the book. It's shown how much he loves her but the movie didn't get to show the viewers how he feels he can't live without her and she can't live without him. That's what it's ultimately about and it just isn't delivering that message clearly enough to me because I asked if the person who I watched it with if they got that from the movie and they said no. they haven't read the books so that tells me it needs to be done better.",

Fifty Shades of Grey cuenta la historia de Anastasia, una estudiante virgen tímida que va a entrevistar a Christian Grey para un trabajo de su compañera de cuarto, la interacción de Jamie Dornan con Dakota Johnson es plana, no se sienten reales, Anastasia siempre tiene la misma cara: \"orgasmo\" \"tristeza\" \"orgasmo\" \"enojo\" \"orgasmo\".\nLa relación de estos dos es tonta, aburrida y poco interesante, ambos personajes no aportan nada de carisma, se vuelven tediosos y odiosos, por poner un ejemplo:\nChristian Grey: \"te regale un auto, una computadora, libros y todo lo que tu desees ¿seras mi sumisa? \nAnastasia: No, no quiero volver a verte (pasan 2 minutos) Te amo.\nPor el amor de Dios, esta pelicula es basura! Con lo que respecta a las escenas de sexo, prometen mas de lo que son, así que no vayas con la idea de que veras escenas sexuales sumamente explicitas y polémicas. \nSam Taylor-Johnson hace lo que puede en esta pelicula, no es culpa de ella que la pelicula no funcionara, de hecho se ve que puso todo su esfuerzo para que al menos fuera pasable, la culpa la tiene la historia (y por supuesto la escritora E.L James) una historia aburrida, nada interesante, mediocre y con poca originalidad (¿olvide mencionar que esto es \"Crepúsculo\" con sexo?) Lo unico perdonable de aquí es el Soundtrack (por parte de Danny Elfman) no es que sea una obra maestra, pero es lo unico decente que tiene esta pelicula (¿esto se le puede llamar pelicula? este termino no entra aquí...)",

            "content": "I must admit that I really wanted to see this movie after reading the book.  I was intrigued to see how the story would manifest itself on screen.  The book trilogy, of course, has had its critics.  However, you can't deny that it generated a worldwide frenzy and that it all started with the first book (which was also my favorite of the three):  \"50 Shades of Grey.\"  To me, the first book had that intensity and magnetism that was required to get us to even pay attention.  Yes, things were dramatic and outlandish, but that's also what captivated us.  In turn, I was eager to see that play out on the big screen.  While I feel the movie succeeded  in some parts, I also feel it fell short in others. \n\nOne strength of the movie were the compelling and accurate sets.  For example, Mr. Grey's office, his home, his closet, his playroom were all very well-done.   Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan) played broody and mysterious well.  Just like in the book, you were left wondering, curious, and unsatisfied with the lack of answers and openness from him.  Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) played awkward well, but didn't seem to have the quiet confidence and strength of Anastasia I found from the book.  There were a few scenes where this was more true (such as in the boardroom meeting and at the very end), but because it was a bit lacking earlier it seemed a bit out of character when her quiet assuredness did show up.\n\nHowever, given the sexual intensity of book, perhaps one of the bigger surprises and disappointments was that I did not feel the couple had the electric chemistry on screen that was required.  Some moments certainly worked; but other times it just seemed to fall a little flat.  Sometimes, I felt the movie moved a little too quickly on the subtle moments/gestures that could have increased the film's sexiness.  The film makers did this a couple times with Christian's drumming fingers or Ana's biting lip.  But sometimes I felt the sensuality quotient was compromised by a speeding by of certain details or even of dialogue.  I guess these moments could have been optimized to serve as foreplay, if you will, for the viewer.  \n\nIf you read and enjoyed the book, it's likely you will enjoy the movie.  But  I will admit I was hoping for more.  Let's hope what has been learned from this movie can help guide and improve the creation of the next two movies in the series.",

I think the reviews were poor because of societies perceptions (of love and sex) and expectations of what this film represents for us as individuals and for society.  For example, if someone is expecting a kinky porno, then they have obviously come to the wrong place!   \n\nThis movie has more to do with a deeply disturbed man with narcissistic tendencies, as he hides his pain through power and control.  In Christian's attempt and need to have power of Ana, he begins to lose himself along the way.  Like layers of an onion, he did not even realize he had, he starts to fear he is losing power over himself.  All the while, Ana is longing for the one thing that unites us all...love.  She starts to control him as a result of their mutual feelings, which is something he did not expect. The power of love cannot be controlled or contained in a simple contract or maintained with such strict rules.  This film represents a human's most basic need: LOVE.  It also shows us the long-term impact child abuse can have; shaping our personalities throughout a lifetime.   \n\nAdditionally, this film is controversial in many regards (Sadomasochism views are different from person to person, power/control roles, etc.) Also, many do not understand S&M culture.  It exists.  Power play is real.  While for most, this kind of sexual experience is new and possibly difficult to understand and grasp since this lifestyle is so controversial in real life.  \n\nSome men and women may be offended by this film, taking this movie to represent abuse in relationships (which it DOES).  Although, difficult to view for many because of this, I believe cinema is an art form. I do not condone violence to anyone EVER.  I look at this film just as it is....a film.  It is just another way for us to broaden our horizons in understanding: ourselves, our perceptions and the way we view life.  So let's take a step back, and remember that as well.",

I have to be honest: she did. The film is tastefully shot, with atmospheric imagery (I'm not talking about the sex scenes, even though it applies to those as well, but I meant the scenery and surroundings in general) and a mostly appropriate and contributing soundtrack. My hope for this was sparked, funnily enough, by the first couple of minutes I saw of the film when it was accidentally started in the cinema where we came to see Kingsmen. More important than the filmography: I didn't want to punch Ana in the face the whole time, because in the film, she wasn't so naive, dependent and clueless as in the book(s). The movie version is far less absurd, more real and more equal. Compared to the reading (I still cannot believe such bad writing can exist and sell), watching was comfortable.",

            "content": "Another Valentine's Day come and gone. (Also, St. Patty's went by in a blur.) I know I said I would post a review of this movie by Valentine's 2015 but things just got in the way. Maybe I just didn't want to be that guy who watches bad movies and bitches about it on the internets. But the experience draws in readers. Just so you know, I did watch Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day. And I probably should have consumed a glass of wine or beer beforehand, like fellow critic Christy Lemire had done (fyi: her review is the best).\n\nTo watch Fifty Shades of Grey is almost like a dare. Dare to watch a bad movie; or, dare to watch a movie about bondage and sadomasochism. The funny thing is that such sexual acts are looked down upon, and now we have a mainstream movie about the very act the majority condemn. What's even more funny is that I dare to defend this movie from all the naysayers, the ones who dismiss this movie because it opens the doors to the velvet underground.\n\nThis movie was incredibly tame and yet people were up in arms about the whole ordeal like they've never heard of such depravity. It's amazing that sex is still a touchy topic to this day, and I was equally as amazed when I pointed this out back in 2006 when I reviewed The Notorious Bettie Page. (see also my 2013 review of The To-Do List.) The bigger the budget, the higher the controversy. I guess everyone keeps overlooking the contract beween Mr. Grey and Ana and the two have to work out a mutual agreement before fucking. In short, it's all consensual. (But there is that one part that seems to rub people the wrong way, which I argue is almost the right response to illicit but some folk take it further by being offended).\n\nBut Fifty Shades of Grey isn't a landmark motion picture. It wants to be, as evident by its glossy presentation. Characters dressed sharp, walk in sterile environments, and have clean sex even if it's supposed to be unusual. Heck, even the trailer hyped this up to be way more than it should. I was sold even though I scoffed--it was also because of that horrible redux of Beyonce's otherwise brilliant \"Crazy in Love.\" Nay, Fifty Shades of Grey is a punchline. It started off as a punchline (a Twilight fanfiction!) so there really is no reason to take it seriously. Dare to watch a bad movie? This is your ticket.\n\nHowever, I am intrigued that a mainstream movie dares to make certain sexual acts mainstream. More often than not, the act itself is resorted to a punchline or underlying psychological disorder, or viewed in a seedy grindhouse where Travis Bickle and Betsy are on a first date getting schooled in sexual education. Just think, to watch Fifty Shades of Grey back in 1975 would've ended a relationship. Maybe your date would've thought you were crazy. You might've even gone to jail for watching such filth.\n\nThough BDSM is also viewed as unnatural by our leading lady Ana or Anastasia (Dakota Johnson). She's essentially the good girl trying to tame the bad boy. It's like that one song that goes, \"Why do good girls like bad boys?\" She plays into Mr. Grey's sexual obsessions almost right away. She says he was intimidating but was drawn to him like she made it her personal mission to find out exactly what made him tick or why he is so enamored by her.\n\nAna is rather a blank character which I noted from the first five minutes. She's such a square, and I suspect many audiences are, particularly the ones who recoil to see Mr. Grey playfully spank Ana because she playfully bit her own lip (which is against one of his rules). Mr. Grey wasn't any better except looking good for the camera. He remains guarded which somewhat explains the character's shortcomings. A rather interesting scene is when he actually opens up to Ana, but he was only able to while she was asleep. The movie hints at his dark past but this entry doesn't explain it so we'll have to find out in the upcoming sequels.\n\nFor about two hours, they do more than just fuck. Mr. Grey indulges Ana in the fine escapades of the high life, so there are more ways these two oddly-paired consenting adults connect. It's painfully drawn out. It's sweet even if it's cheesy. I think the word that should be stressed is fantasy. Most fantasies don't take a whole lot of creativity, especially when it comes to sex. Show a little skin, play up the meek and dangerous personalities materialized by typically two attractive people. Maybe Fifty Shades of Grey is more of a modern fairy tale, but with fucking. You go \"ooo\" and \"ahh\" and \"aww,\" and then maybe gasp a few times. \n\nI'm sure it was all intentional to make this dark, sexual world more appealing to the curious. It's weird, sure, but somewhat fascinating knowing that people keep leather, whips, and chains (oh my!) and other assortments to act out their fantasies. And finally, here's a movie that sheds light on a topic that was placed in the \"special interests\" sections at a video store or shown on late-night Cinemax. There was another movie about sex: Lars von Trier's two-part epic Nymphomaniac. It showed here in Albuquerque but only at the Guild and only at night. Fifty Shades of Grey played at chain theaters that had no qualm showing it during the day. Yet the sex is merely a conduit for the romance set to bloom. That was the other reason why this movie is fitted for mainstream.\n\nLong story short: Fifty Shades of Grey was okay. Do what film critic Christy Lemire did. Have some wine, watch the movie with some friends, and giggle all the way through (seriously, read her review). It's really all you can do. Giggle like it's the first time looking through a nudie magazine. Because it is and it does feel like the first mainstream movie about sex since American Pie. Only less funny but more unintentionally funny. Win-win, I guess.\n\n...but I dunno. One month later, no one's really talking about Fifty Shades of Grey. I made my \"review\" to make it seem like it's a landmark cultural event. But it's not. It's a punchline. Now everyone knows how the joke goes. Perhaps it overstayed its welcome. Like Bart Simpson's \"I didn't do it\" catchphrase. We need something new.\n\nWoozle wuzzle?",

Surrounded by all the hype coming from the books success, the movie fails to be anything more than a nicely calculated cash machine. Pretending to be bondage, kinky romance Fifty Shades of Grey is nothing but an impotent wanna-be-BDSM melodrama that utterly annoys.\nAnastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a college graduate meets the young and ultra successful businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) during an interview she does for her best friend. An immediate spark flies between them and from that moment E.L. James' romantic melodrama starts. The beginning is intriguing and not bad at all, until nothing actually happens throughout the movie. Overlong dialogues and lame depiction of restrained passion, Sam Taylor-Jonshon's delivery is far from being even partially engaging. What totally ruins the movie is that the biggest asset of E.L. James' story, the BDSM and kinky elements are totally softened and replace by a boring soft-core scenes and completely artificial dialogues. \nIt would definitely take some nerves to get through the final credits. With little to enjoy or to appreciate, Fifty Shades of Grey is a poor delivery that could have been a major improvement of its source material if it had been naughtier and kinkier.",

Ignoring the issues that exist with the story and the misrepresentation of S&M practices, this is a film that refuses to accept what it is. All the sex scenes, which are devoid of anything resembling titillation, focus almost exclusively on the body of Dakota Johnson. Even with a female team behind the camera, the heterosexual male gaze cannot be quashed. When in comes of Jamie Dornan the film is down right prudish. We get to see almost nothing of his physique, with the camera quickly shying away from even a brief glimpse of his bare ass. No such reservations exist where Johnson is concerned. We get to see her naked in all her glory, being restrained and whipped, even if both are too tamed to shock or titillate. Fifty Shades of Grey shows a fundamental misunderstanding of heterosexual female desire, which is made more problematic with a target audience of straight women and on behind the camera. Maybe it's because everyone knows this is the epitome of trash and they are just collecting a paycheck. Dornan in particular looks like he's sucking on a lemon the whole film and is only there because the producers have some solid blackmail material on him. Dakota Johnson is the only one who manages to escape the energy sucking mess. She takes the mess in stride, realizing Fifty Shades for what it is, a chance to make a lot of money and get herself noticed. She delivers lines that make George Lucas look like a great writer of romance like she's in on the joke. She knows she's making trash and she's going to have fun with it. Johnson's efforts can't make Fifty Shades good. There is no power on Earth that can manage that feat, but she does make it bearable, even when she is reduced to writhing around restrained and naked.",

            "content": "NOTE: I NEVER READ THE BOOK AND THIS FILM DOES NOT ENCOURAGE  ME TO! Well, where to begin...Let's start with  this is nothing more than propaganda to demonize the BDSM community. You expect me to believe an English Literature major with a 4.0 had to google submissive? Caring for her new beau with broken foot kept her mom from flying, and \"Ana\" doesn't call her out on this? Then she meets this enigmatic billionaire, by the most cliched deus ex machina, who stalks his way into her heart, and then drives her away with his BDSM fetish. This wasn't written by some one with a clear understanding of the fetish world. If they did they'd have already seen Secretary and not filmed this garbage. I want to take a second to speak of the boggling use of color in this film. The color screaming the mood theme and emotion so loudly that i thought I was missing something. In Hero the use of color helps tell the story, but here it's hitting me over the head with things I already know because I pay attention to the story. On par with that is Christian Grey's wardrobe, between his mom, the fifteen other women, Ana herself, and all the boys at the gym and country club Grey would have a more diverse wardrobe. Not only that but he forces this drab sense of fashion on all his employees. His offices remind me of the world of Equilibrium, in which both feelings and artistic expression are outlawed and citizens take daily injections of drugs to suppress their emotions. The whole my last name is grey so that's my motif went out with 1980's Saturday morning cartoons. Had his last name been Cowslip or Steppenwolf...? \nThe sex; how can you poorly edit a sex scene? By tying someone up two different ways at two different moments and chopping the footage up into a montage so now it seems like they're constantly doing some tying and untying. Now we'll skip the part where they omit the montage of them exploring each others deviant desires the way real couples do and go right to where Grey throws a tantrum about Ana goin' to Georgia then flies out to see her only to have to rush back because of work. \n*PTI but, I want to take a second to question what Grey does. It said he was a telecommunications billionaire but never says what exactly he does to make such wealth. Does he own ISPs? Build communications networks? Or did me just buy in to pre established industries? But that's not the point of this movie right?\nWhy is Grey purposefully vague about who he's having dinner with? What in their relationship would make her not trust him? Was he pissed she went to Georgia and did it to get back at her? He's an enigmatic billionaire with holdings all over the globe I'm sure he'd understand some one having to leave suddenly on a plane at that! \nAnd then we get to the end. So she's gonna break up with him because she's fallen in love with him, but not his BDSM fetish which they'd been exploring the entire time right?\n*PTI but exactly how much time passed in this movie? She wasn't graduated, then we watch her graduate, then she goes to Georgia, then their back in Seattle (or is it Portland?) and then they break up. how long were they dating and why is Ana not famous for dating a billionaire? That's not the point of this movie, I know...\nSo why did it take Ana all this time to figure out this wasn't the kind of thing she wanted? Why didn't her \"Oh this is what he mean't by 'you don't wanna love me'\" light come on and she just leave?\nWhich brings me to my conclusion, the moral of the story is true love is suppose to conquer all. Written by someone who doesn't understand how fetishes work. They are not, repeat NOT defensive mechanisms used to ward off intimacy. Christian Grey is an emotional toddler who would react the same way if his mommy remarried as he did when Ana went to Georgia. She's a virgin (like it's suppose to be revolutionary) named after the folktale about a princess who has to go into hiding only to later reclaim her throne & a hardened alloy. He's named after a pious religion and the color of neutrality. It's so cliche it was fore shadowed by the lighting. He's suppose to change for her, her innocence and love WILL change him... hawyuck, hawyuck, hawyuck.\nIt should be noted I only watched this film to write this review...",

No wonder the dialogues sucks. I'm a big fan of Twilight, but this is movie is crap.\n\nThen you have this BDSM, which makes me ask, why would the author come up with this crap with Edward and Bella? It's not something I would read.\n\nWhat I don't like is how people think the book is great and is romantic and hot. I never read 50 Shades of Grey, but after seeing the movie, how can anyone think this is a love story? Yeah Ana falls in love with the guy and yeah the guy had his romantic moments, but like he said, he doesn't do romance and was just being nice to Ana so he can f*** her. That's not a love story ladies and I'm a girl saying that. Twilight is a love story.\n\nI also think it's funny how no one can see that Christian is messed up on the head since they are so focus on his charms and how he f****. Really? He basically got sexual abused at age of 15 years old and through 6 years by his mom's friend doing BDSM to the point that now he does this to any girls who sign his damn contract. That's not hot, that's sick. Clearly the man needs help.\n\nHorrible movie as I expected.

I had read the first couple pages of the book and found the writing to be insufferable, but I also fully expected the screenplay to iron out the kinks (heh) like with the \"Twilight\" movies, which had better material to work with in comparison. Anastasia is still a little unnecessarily inept and vapid at first and Dakota Johnson oversells her mousiness, but she proves herself a subtle comedienne in the hardware store and drunken voicemail scenes.\n\nJamie Dornan is sufficiently sexy and tortured and predatory, but the script is careful to make sure Ana's free will is at the forefront of every decision, though some may argue it's the illusion of freedom because she's so inexperienced and he's so persistent. Even so, that doesn't make her decisions any less her own, nor his lust any less an earnest desire for connection in the only depraved way he knows how. It's a problematic relationship dynamic, to be sure, and there's really only one Harlequin fantasy way to end it, but so far, the representation seems unmannered and unfettered (heh).",

I do not understand what the fuss is all about at all with regards to the books and now the movie. I have not read the books but I am assuming they are similar to the story in the film.. if so, it just does not make sense at all. This guy is a freak, why would anyone who has 1% of human brains would let him even touch you? Anal fisting? A room full of weird toys? Can not sleep with someone at night though? and you are ok with that? I suppose there are some sexual freaks out there, fart porn anyone? but this movie just annoyed me. It had potential, i thought it was going somewhere and that there would be a massive reveal to why he is such a sick fuck but there wasn't anything worth waiting for at the end.

            "content": "http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com/244389.html\n\nCurious? That's got to be the most apt publicity tagline for a me for a movie ever. It's not that I was curious about the content, per say. I was curious as to what the fuss was all about. Why are so many people so rabidly into this story? I had to know. No way on Earth would this ever be my kind of movie, but a phenomenon this big is hard for me to ignore. Plus, I had a coupon!\n\nI don't need to explain the very thin plot to you, do I? No? Okay, moving on. I'll admit, there was a lot that fascinated and intrigued me about this film. It raised many questions about relationship roles as well as trust and expectations. A lot of it had me really thinking, in a way that stuck with me most of the rest of the day. Let me set things straight, I was pondering things, not fantasizing. Philosphically different. What part of their relationship was okay vs what should have been a red flag to send Anastasia running out the door. What would I be willing to put up with vs what's going too far?\n\nBecause for such a highly coveted romance, they really don't have a lot of substance there. Like any other movie relationship, the two inexplicably fall desperately in love immediately. They can't even bear to go a couple hours from each other. Gag. And for someone who claimed to be so devoted to his girl, Mr Grey really does put a lot of unfair and arguably abusive and manipulative pressure on her. Those are the sorts of things I was thinking about.\n\nAs far as the kink, it's my understanding that it's not a very accurate representation of the culture. I've been told that it should be based on trust, and that the open honesty and communication necessary to make it work make for a very solid relationship. That was not here whatsoever. Would I ever wanna read the book? Umm, no. Besides the fact that it's amateurishly written, I feel if I really wanted to know about such things, there'd be much better sources. Still though, I'd rather re-read LOTR.\n\nI'm coming off pretty negative, there was some fun to it. Yes, Jamie Dornan was incredibly hot. And while Dakota Johnson is a little green as an actress, she did have a likability. It's my understanding that the screenplay smartened things up a bit, although much came off as very dumb. Without having read it, though, I could always tell when a line of dialogue must have been taken verbatum from the source. It was usually the really silly sounding lines that were meant to be sexy, often delivered in a fairly deadpan manner. Inappropriate giggles broke out in the audience. It was a fun fantasy to escape to, as long as you didn't pay too much attention to the details.\n\nWould I see it again? Not any time soon. A couple days after I was at the movies with a friend. Our intended flick was cancelled due to a leaky roof in the auditorium. Her first suggestion \"Would you see Fifty Shades?\" \"Again?! No\" I resounded quite forcefully. We saw Imitation Game instead. Much better choice.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey - \\m/ \\m/ \\m/\n\nhttp://www.expletivedleted.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted\nhttp://www.facebook.com/expletivedleted",

            "content": "I might have been previously too harsh on the Fifty Shades film when I reviewed it before. It's still definitely not anything exciting to watch... but compared to the book, it actually is better.\n\nWhen making a film based on a terrible book series, you already don't have much to work with-- especially when the book's author constantly hounds, harasses, and pesters the director into giving her as much creative control as she can possibly have. If it weren't for E. L. James being a harpy on set, this film actually might have had even more intelligence associated with it. As it stands, it's already better than the novel (of course, a piece of shit cake is better than the novel), but think of how much better it would be if the terrible author of the book wasn't affiliated with its production?\n\nThere were, I admit, creative changes made in the script that never happen in the book that would have made the story poignant-- a word James doesn't understand, and never can understand.\n\nI hated the Fifty Shades novel with every fiber of my being. It's romanticized abuse and the protagonist is highly unlikable. In the film, however, she has a personality that her blank slate counterpart in the book doesn't. She has a bit more fire, and a bit more strength. Not too much, but more. It's like the producers of the film KNEW that the book was terrible, and wanted to turn it into something beautiful. That's never easy to do, and I have to admit that I feel sympathy for them when having to deal with the book's author hounding them the entire time, picking apart every little thing and demanding things \"be added\" or \"be removed\" or changed.\n\nI'm less fascinated with the film itself than I am with what the film COULD HAVE BEEN without E. L. James' influence. She needs to realize that there just are more creative people than her, and to allow some breathing room. Her books are boring-- PAINFULLY boring. But the movies have a chance to turn that possibility of saucy narc-and-supply relationship into something engaging, enthralling, and fun.\n\nI know that James will remain glued to people on the next film as well. I can only pray that they don't allow her to dog them around in the same manner Christian proudly does in her awful books.",

Despite giving credit to the soundtrack and the way the movie was shot (yes, the movie was visually beautiful), I feel I just witnessed almost two hours of nothing. This movie was pretty much a story that focused on a very bland and somewhat disfunctional relationship. And no, I don't think this gives BDSM a good image: it makes it just come off as abuse. Which to me is a little hypocritical, seen as the sales for kinky sex toys rose because of this franchise.\n\nThe main characters? I don't know who is worse: the sadist which everyone sees as \"romantic\" for reasons I will never understand, or \"Bella 2.0\" (I know she has a name, but seen as this was based off a Twilight fanfiction I beleive it suits her) who submits herself to things she's not into and then whines and complains that she wants \"romance\" (you dumbass, he said from the start he's not the romatic kind of guy, so why are you even with him in the first place?!).\n\nThere were two fliyng scenes who added nothin to the story, they spent too much time talking about the stupid contract, and the sex scenes... Even those were boring: they're porn \"for people who don't like to watch porn\", plain and simple. And just when I was beginning to grow tired of watching two hours of nothing... it ended! To sum up the movie: they meet, the hook up, thery're disfnctional and they break up. There, I just saved you two hours of your life. \n\nNot my kind of movie, no story to keep my attention, and little to no chemestry between the leads. I'm glad I didn't actually go to the theaters to go see this, and I have a feeling I won't be bothered with the sequels.",

Si usted es un morboso más, lamento decirle que 50 shades of Grey no es Garganta Profunda, esta película no está descubriendo absolutamente nada, la sexualidad está manejada con mucha sutileza, es mas erotismo que otra cosa, y la verdad es que el revuelo que se ha levantado en torno a su estreno es el clásico gancho que al final termina por ser el pan nuestro de cada día con Hollywood. La película está muy bien filmada, bastante pulcra, la música es estupenda, y ya; en general está bien hecha. En cuanto al tema adaptación la verdad es que no puedo dar una opinión porque no he leído el libro, pero de lo que estoy bien seguro es que si quieren llevar a la pantalla el segundo y tercer libro tienen que perderle el miedo a la obra en si misma. ¿La recomiendo?

That being said, Fifty shades of grey had NOTHING to contribute to my cinematic love. The cast is terrible; Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have no on screen chemistry. They don't keep us interested in the film because they can't act. At one point Charlie Hunnam was attached to play the main role of Christian Gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion I really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck. The writing is crap and Christian Gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper. Anastasia Steele seems like she is slow and dumb. One thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if Christian Gray was just an average guy, not a billionaire, the tone of the movie would be completely different. The music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs.  \n\nAnd let's not forget the sex scenes, there is nothing special about any of it. So what, you see her boobs not a big deal, but the sex parts (which is what the books are built upon) are nothing to be excited about. I should have just watched a real porno! There would have been a better story and much better acting. It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon. Cheers and remember I watch the crappy movies so you don't have too. \n\n0.5 out of 10       \n\n\nedited by Samantha Locke",

Even that is a bit weak with no character development, etc. Translated to a movie, I thought it effective for a while. There was a buildup to the early sex scenes, and with minimal weird stuff in those early scenes, they were actually pretty hot. Later, when Christian really begins to lay down the law, I began liking the movie and his character less. And because she stuck with it, Anna. \n\nMy complaints: Christian's story is nonexistent to lame, and the fact that he's a bit odd in the bedroom doesn't help. The backstory and character is on the writers, not the actor, so he did well enough. But the whole point of the movie seems to be this buildup to the masochistic sex. When it's barely there, the scenes are effectively hot. I just think the story unravels late when he becomes so unlikable it's not worth continuing.

The book would have been a lot better and believable if it had been a romantic love story, only sexier. It can actually be romantic and erotic at the same time, it doesn't have to be the one or the other. Because when the story is created the way that it is I don't really believe in the characters. Why would Anastasia Steele, a 22-year-old inexperienced literature student fall in love with a guy like Christian Grey?\nWith that said I enjoyed the movie better than the book. For some reason the storyline felt a slightly bit more plausible on screen. Although I still stand by my opinion that the character of Christian Grey isn't very credible. \nI was actually a bit afraid that they were going to romanticize this movie a bit too much, I was happily surprised of how much they actually managed to show.

I enjoyed this movie because of it's unconventional story! There are not a lot of movies out there strictly for adults these days. The PG 13 rating has been given to a big portion of the industry to bring in the \"tween\" audiences and their money. I was not convinced that Jamie Dornan was right for playing the part of Grey but it turned out that he did a good job.

First off, this movie is based of a poorly written book that is also based off of the twilight series which weren't the best books ever written either. Understanding that, its safe to say that this movie IS better than novel. IMO, the portrayal of christian gray was done above average. We could see the character development from the beginning to and, his increasing love and interest for Ana. As well, depicting him as a billionaire was soot on, from a lavish advertisement of apple and Audi products and the inclusion of penthouses and \"rich boy\" attitude, I thought Jamie had done an excellent job. Now with Dakota, many critic her for playing a weak girl, I say not. Reason is because she's much stronger than who she really is, if you truly understand the story and mentality if Ana, you can feel what she's going through. Dakota played the perfect innocent, delicious young woman which every rich man would lust for. Those lips and eyes, her body, the way she walks, talks and connects with Christian was pretty spot on, dont think any other actress would have done differently. All in all, this movie is for people who are curious about BDSM and the whole idea of erotic film. Walk in with an open mind and you will be pleased.",

He lavishes his wealth on her hoping she'll sign a contract to become his \"submissive\". She yearns for a more typical movie-and-a-dinner-type relationship but tests her 'hard' and 'soft' limits anyway.\nAs the emotions get more intense and we begin to learn the motivations underpinning Grey's need for dominance, the film gets bogged down in repetitive, earnest romantic drama.\nDornan as Grey is no hero, and Johnson was so understated it was like she wasn't even there at all. she gives Anastasia both a strength and sense of humour.",

            "content": "So, the film version of E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey sucks hard. Are you shocked? I actually was. Shocked that Fifty Shades of Grey on film is a such a dull, bloodless affair that's about as erotic as prego porn. Sure, the book sucked too, but the book had real heat to it. You knew you weren't reading literary excellence. James too had the common sense to suggest that there are actually real motives behind dominants and submissives.\n\nWhat we do have onscreen, from slumming director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy). from a super sanitized script from Kelly Marcel, is the story of poor virginal English major Anastasia Steel (Dakota Johnson). She finds the perfect man in 27-year-old tech billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Christian's only flaw--he gets off on blindfolding Ana, tying her up in his Red Room of Pain and cuffing and flogging her. Got that?\n\nThe movie presents a solution to the question of 'What's a girl to do?' and apparently the answer is do everything she can to domesticate the guy so he'll charm her parents and they'll live happily ever after. So who's being dominant now? Rather than dinner and a movie, Christian offers a contract that spells out everything, from  how he wants to hold Ana in bondage with sex toys like butt plugs and genital clamps, but, this being a consensual love story, Ana refuses anal and fisting. It's a hell of a negotiation. Christian makes things sweeter by dressing Ana in high fashion, getting her a computer (hello product placement), and supplying her a sports car, taking her to the Pacific Northwest in his chopper where they go hang-gliding and buying her first editions of Thomas Hardy novels. The rough stuff? Hardly there.\n\nSince the film is essentially trying to be an adult version of Twilight, that can still appeal to the young ones, the rough sex is few and far between. Director Taylor-Johnson shoots all the crotch touching and nipple nuzzling like a strict school marm making sure not to let the kids have too much fun. The wicked soundtrack, from the likes of Beyonce, Sia and Ellie Goulding, make the sex scenes look more like old music videos. There's no grit, just gloss. The movie shies away from real dirty details like bodily fluids and bruises save for a quick peek at Christian's junk as he spanks Ana.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey is porn for tweens, and a piss poor substitute for the book's darker, bloodier instincts. The tampon scene is missing. Too bad, it could have given the movie something it desperately needs: real sparks and heat. Johnson (The Social Network, 21 Jump Street), daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson (no relation to the director either), plays all of this swill for real. She's the film's one bright spot in a film that removes the joy of sex worse than the movie Shame (at least that was intentional). Johnson thankfully too gives Ana much-needed intelligence the book never hinted at. Dornan, sadly, is practically zombified. The Irish model-turned-actor (he's amazing as a serial killer on the BBC series The Fall) seems to be too frightened or embarrassed or both to really give anything to the role. This Christian has no shades. He's merely a human doll with nary a hint of the darkside and what drives him. The better to not scare away the girls.\n\nCritics who gave the film favorable reviews seemed grateful it wasn't as dirty and shocking as they thought it'd be. I'm way disappointed. Fifty Shades of Grey is horribly sanitized. It's most punishing feature is the crushing boredom it inspires.",

Therefore, the female character makes sense, but the male character is all over the place; his actions and motivations don't make any sense except as a foil for her. The title suggests that the writer might even be somewhat aware of what she's doing -- a character with \"50 shades\" should be one with so many variations that he is inscrutable. Unfortunately, rather than being multifaceted and mysterious, Mr. Grey comes off as a muddle of conflicting cliches. \nIf the story could be taken seriously at all, perhaps it is as a study of the contemporary woman's fantasy of the ideal man. According to this movie, he is rich, good looking, young, driven, persistent, superficially dangerous but soft on the inside, uber-successful but not too bright, and totally malleable to a woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up for herself.\nThere really should be a scene at the end where she wakes up and realizes that she has fallen off a ladder at the hardware store and bumped her head.",

From the great performance from lead Dakota Johnson to the great directing by Sam Taylor Johnson and even the amazing soundtrack, the film was firing on all cylinders...until it came across the screenplay. The majority of the dialogue in this movie is so laughably bad, it makes the film border on a guilty pleasure or semi comedy. Granted with the material the filmmakers had to go on they did their best. Actor Jamie Dornan didn't seem to comfortable with his lines which made his performance seem fairly wooden and dull, that also contributed to the fact that the leads share a minimal amount of chemistry. All in all the film missed the opportunity to make a serious drama and instead landed on a sillier version of \"9 1/2 Weeks\". If you go into this film with minimal expectations and don't take it seriously, you might be pleased. C",

So many gadgets and toys he must have an army of Chinese factory workers manufacturing them in his basement.

Instead we learn that his major vice is just whipping her six times with his belt.

These two have little to no chemsitry on screen, with Johnson feeling like a young child against Dornans creepy and completely serious performance.  A little humor could have done the characters some good, since the complete lack of any fun between them made their romance as boring as it comes.  This is a film that was made strictly because of the success of the book, which most would agree is porn for soccer moms.  It was not a well recieved book so I never imagined the film would be any better, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt nonetheless.  But this erotic Twilight ripoff simply doesn't do anything interesting for nearly two hours and gives us a joyless and strange romance with actors with absolutely no chemistry.  To call this film an expensive porno would be accurate, as the story here is about as intersting as a porno.

            "content": "Fifty Shades of I can't believe I watched this twice. I read the trilogy - not because I'm into the romance genre (I'm a love of the classics, and yes I've actually read \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\") but because a ridiculous number of my married and single lady friends read them and well, curiosity got the better of me. We all know how terribly E.L. James writes and the subject matter leaves a lot to be desired plus we've pretty much heard enough criticism about the unrealistic nature of the Christian-Anastasia BDSM relationship. We don't need to rehash the domestic violence discussions. \n\nLet's talk about some of the merits of the movie:\n\nSo, we have one young woman about to graduate from college who finds herself reluctantly interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor under thirty. He's smitten almost immediately and she's intrigued but intimidated. The deadly hot billionaire decides to engage in what could easily be defined as moderately stalkerish behavior meant to entice the young woman into a dominant/submissive relationship. Guy engages in some fairly elaborate stunts to get girl's attention including showering her with gifts even though he claims adamantly that he's not the \"hearts and flowers kind of guy.\" No, instead he sends first editions of Thomas Hardy novels, a new Apple laptop, and an Audi coupe. We should all be so lucky. And though this guy wants to be in control, dominating every part of the girl's life, it becomes very clear by the end that this isn't the case at all. She finally decides she can't take the Red Room, his need to punish her or his inability to give her \"more,\" so she bolts and leaves him completely bewildered.\n\nLet's talk Anastasia and Christian from a young adult perspective. It's hard to give yourself completely to someone else when you're not entirely sure who you are and have little life experience to rely upon. Christian has not exactly had the most traditional of upbringings. In the first novel/movie, we know he was adopted by the very wealthy and successful Greys, that his biological mother was probably on Child Protective Services frequent flier, and that he lost his virginity to one of his mother's friends at the age of fifteen. He's lived a full life at the age of 27 and is hesitant to let anyone really know him or touch him. Anastasia is completely different. She meets Christian and he believes (somewhat mistakenly) that she would be the perfect submissive based on his first impression. Ana is anything but submissive. \n\nIt's a welcome change in the screen adaptation. Typically screen adaptations pale in comparison to their literary counterparts (with a few notable exceptions). This is the first time I've read a book and been more pleased with the movie. Kelly Marcel omits a lot of Ana's tiresome inner monologue and indecisiveness in favor of a slightly more assertive and concerned female character. Unlike the book, Ana asks a lot of Christian and finds a way to pull him out of his comfort zone and into hers. For a person who professes to exude control in all matters, Christian loses himself fairly quickly in his pursuit of Ana. What we end up seeing is a power struggle between two truly dominant people looking for the right opportunity to submit to someone. Christian speaks often of trust and comfort in submission. He ultimately has to trust her as much as she has to trust him in order for their relationship to continue. \n\nThe biggest point of controversy is Christian's treatment of Anastasia. He is constantly aware of her location, inserts himself into her life in overbearing and creepy ways, and tries to direct her life. Fortunately for everyone, Anastasia is relatively astute and keeps a sense of humor and propriety about the situation often poking fun at Christian for his behavior. There are points where being sexually adventurous borders on overtly sadistic actions that make us uncomfortable particularly towards the end. Ana questions this too even going as far as to ask \"Why do you want to punish me?\" She asks in a way that most of us vanilla types are asking, too. What is it that drives people to BDSM? Where Christian is concerned, we don't get the answers until later in the trilogy. But we're also wondering why exactly he is so obsessed with Ana. Is it love? When she admits her feelings for him, Christian acts completely astonished that anyone could be in love with him given his sexual perversions and generally screwed up mental state. Honestly, being in love in your early twenties is a lot like that - two complete head cases coming together to make some sort of sense in the world. Honestly, who are we really to judge? There's something to be said for romanticizing these kinds of relationships that border on abuse, but you really could cite how frequently they exist in films and literature - Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a fantastic example. Besides the erotic \"mommy porn\" reputation the novel and film have garnered, maybe people actually relate in some way to the material. It's not just escapism but something else. \n\nOther points: There was a startling lack of development of the other central characters from the novel. In a trilogy, you have a little more time to waste I suppose. The chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson is initially shaky but works itself out a bit by the end. Sam Taylor-Johnson actually did a really fantastic job of directing a film that arguably had a lot of high expectations from the outset. it's unfortunate she won't be around for the sequels. The sex scenes were, in my opinion, relatively tasteful and not exploitative. I saw more of Dakota Johnson than I needed to although Jamie Dornan did look fantastic in those infamous distressed jeans. Oy. \n\nBottom line: I saw it with girlfriends in the theater the first time and watched in on Blu-ray alone the second time. I was entertained. And sometimes, that's what's really important.",

I am writing this review knowing I will lose a lot of movie or man credit but here it is, I jumped on the original band wagon for the first twilight film (the first one- still have and may not ever watch the last ones), it was bad but I rather enjoyed it and fell for Kristen Stewart, I stated that so any middle aged mothers or tweens may know if this film was good there is no bias hate because it was written by a woman or is aimed at a disliked target market with that said, it was not a great or even good film, it was fairly interesting and surprisingly not bad as I thought both in the film and sexual content. It was a little bad. Not terrible but not alright either.\nAnesthesia Steele played very well by Dakota Johnson (Anesthesia is the name of one of the wicked step-sister's in Cinderella), interviews a young tycoon business dude Christian Grey; James bond + Mark Zuckerberg. They start to fall into sappy-dappy love with whips and chains. But Grey has a little tug and pull problem when it comes to sex, he is into BDSM, like way into that shit like he knows every aspect of it's invention, the whole film is the two's love affair, that struggles to stay alive with the only way to consulate into love making is in a strictly dominating role.\n\nThe Secretary I am afraid takes away any glory this could of had if any, from the high criticized book and writer (E L James), calling it badly written sexfiendish filth. I can't write to save my life so I'm not gonna kick dirt at the book I have only heard from a audio book that thankfully I did not finish after watching this because it would of been a complete waste of time. This may keep you involved with fairly good performance's from both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan in a really bad story.\n\n\nHonestly the credited star rating I give this film goes to those two dedicated roles and the cinematographers pin point theme he brought to the screen.\nA film that seemed to be plagiarized by E L James that has a better tolled tale and ended story, I would rather watch instead in a heart beat is The Secretary with the talented Maggie Gyllenhaal and I got to say with the pervert in me it has better exotic sexual scenes then this film holds your the better part of you attention with. A little bad film that surprisingly did not bore me- but it does have a lot of nudity, that may be why. Stellar performances that define any good parts of the film, if any, I definitely see a sequel with that preemptive ending that probably will just be an even more of a cash grab for the filmmakers then actually telling a better story with the book rights.",

They made it LESS about the sex and MORE about the \"romantic\" love story of Grey and Steele. Also, they gave Steele's character some humor which for me was such an important element. \n\nIn terms of technicalities, the film wasn't \"over-the-edge\" it's okay. Nothing special. \n\nIn terms of soundtrack, the film has superb songs! It' actually sets up the mood quite well. I cried a bit when Ellie Goulding's \"Love Me Like You Do\" started playing. Weird right?\n\nIn terms of acting, Dakota did an okay job. She started a bit off (her character was supposed to be awkward-cute, but she made her seem awkward in a bad way). Jamie's portrayal of Grey on the other hand was less than okay. He pulled of the sexy and \"let's fuck\" part but the INTIMIDATING part not quite well. The way he talked also distracted me i don't know why.\n\nAll in all, I think the film's still worth watching and is not as bad as to what people/haters are saying.

Sam Taylor-Wood's direction is, for the most part, network TV drama standard, but it's really what's needed for a tale like this.  She does kind of choke towards the end, not yet up to the task of using the codes of cinema to show progression in the third important scene set in the same room with the same characters, but she's also smart enough to bring some intentional laughs to the early scenes that undercut the general unlikelihood of the set-up.  Jamie Dornan blunders his way through role that he's somewhat miscast is, whereas Dakota Johnson defies expectations and carries herself reasonably well.  The script starts totting up the logical inconsistencies in scene one and doesn't let up (a college newspaper scores an interview with a billionaire industrialist and lets the assigned journalist chuck a sickie and send her flatmate? How small is their journalism programme?) but it's not so much offensive as lazy.  And assumes the audience is lazy.  And is probably right.\n\nFor all the furore and hand-wringing over the film's supposed misogyny, there's really not a lot to support it.  This is the story of a naïve young woman who flirts with the possibility of an unfulfilling and one-sided relationship (spoiler) before growing to a point where she not only walks out but gains the upper hand.  If this were a thriller instead of a romantic drama and she cut his balls off instead of walking out, it'd be hailed as a trashy feminist triumph.  Yes, the film exaggerates Anastasia's stupidity in the early scenes, not because it is misogynist but because it is a Hollywood film and it's drawn in broad strokes - the women in Pygmalion stories are styled to be unrealistically dowdy and Anastasia is styled to be unrealistically dumb because it gives her room to grow.  Outside the central pairing, virtually every character in this film who says or does anything is female - it passes the Bechdel test with flying colours (insert your own 'grey' joke).  Possibly the closest it comes to real woman-hating behaviour is in casting Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden as 'the mum'.  If you honestly think this film deserves to be singled out for its treatment of women, you've had the pleasure of missing an awful lot of Hollywood's output for the past couple of decades.\n\nThe film's portrayal of BDSM and the people who practise it is kind of rubbish, it's poorly researched and it relies heavily on the naivety of the mainstream audience.  That said, any offensiveness relies heavily on the fact that in portraying a subject rarely touched on by mainstream film, or even in indie film that follows a traditional narrative, there's certain to be an extent to which it is taken to be 'the' story of whips & chains romance rather than 'a' story.  Yes, the film centres on a character whose interest in BDSM is suggested to be closely aligned to negative stereotypes of alternative sexuality; past abuse and emotional unavailability.  But these intimations come principally from other characters - who share the same preconceptions and prejudices as folk in the real world.  To criticise the film for taking a negative stance on BDSM is to criticise the characters for their inability to accurately pathologise themselves.  If anything, it meets the kink community halfway by its declamation that dominance is no excuse for abusiveness and shan't be taken as such.\n\nIs it any good?  No, not really, but benignly rather than offensively so.  There's no point rushing out to see it because there's nothing to get excited about, but if you saw either of the leads on the poster and thought \"I could stand to watch something that features that person's arse prominently\" and it's offered on your streaming service of choice half price one day and you've got an enormous pile of ironing or something to do, then you could actually do worse.",

Particularly when the book in question's main selling point was making curiosity about sado-masochistic sexual relationships trendy and mainstream ( \" I can read a book and talk about S-M stuff and not feel a weirdo!\" ) .\n Plus the fact that the movie failed in its prime objective- to get some real chemistry between the lead actor and actress.. Well, actually, I suspect that  the prime reason for making the movie was to make money, and it  kinda showed.\nThe male lead had a hard job - he was supposed to be a Dominant, but actually showed classic submissive behaviour throughout the film - it would appear that the film-makers were a little sketchy on the nature of S-M/  top-bottom relationships.  I can't imagine ( although I clearly don't speak for) women were much attracted to Mr Grey, however much they might have wanted to be. Anastasia(!)  Steel  also showed a rather transparent lack of pull towards Mr Grey- her best moments were when he took her for a spin in his glider. ...\nSo a poor to average date-movie where the chap is attractive because he's rich.....I think it's been done a thousand times before, and often better.\n\nMind, I was VERY jealous of the \"red-room\" and all the beautiful equipment in it.   ;)    And MIss Steele did have a nice bottom.",

Independientemente de todo el morbo que se generó por las redes, de toda esa crítica, a mi gusto, mal fundamentada (especialmente de personas que aún no han leído el libro pero que se sienten expertos en el tema como el resto de todólogos de internet), y aunque esté en contra de muchas opiniones, se me hizo una buena película, con algunos cabeceos, pero por demás bastante interesante cómo adoptaron el tema. La disfruté mucho, pero, contrario a otras películas basadas en cómics donde yo tengo que dar explicaciones, ahora me tocó ser a mi el instruido y que me fueran explicando de la mano cada una de las cosas que no muestran en la película o que bien, por la falta de tiempo, no alcanzan a explicar, y es que, como me comentaron, es bastante difícil adaptar una obra así de completa en tan poco tiempo (algo muy común con las adaptaciones literarias... con ligeras excepciones en donde sí las han extendido como el caso de las dos últimas de Harry Potter, las dos últimas de Amanecer y las 3 últimas de El hobbit). Sin embargo el tabú que crean este tipo de temas o la parodia de la que son objeto y demás críticas se desbaratan cuando te sientas muy a gusto, con la persona que amas, a ver una película de esta categoría donde el erotismo, pero más allá de las imágenes fuertes, de esa filia que es el \"bondage\". Resulta un buen manjar al gusto de conocer comportamientos y de verlos dramatizados de una forma tan cuidadosa y con un excelente soundtrack. Definitivamente no es una cinta para verse en pareja y mucho menos una película que necesite toda la ridiculez y faramalla de disfrazarse para verla como parodiaban en las redes. No, esta es una cinta para ir a verse en serio y disfrutarse ampliamente.",

            "content": "While people cant help talking about this film, they also keep bashing it im reminded of Titanic and everyone hating Leo DiCaprio. Now, years after the joke is on them, Leo is a great actor of his generation and the movie went in history record with multiple awards. Bullying, if its not your cup of tea? Just go quietly to another shop. I say I really liked it. If you wanted more explicit sex?: watch porn [theres an Asian 3D to help you involve], because sex in this movie is an intriguing sexy excuse, [which might have some educational reward, ;) if you try it in your bedroom] just as it is to their characters, an excuse of meaningful human interaction. As all we know men look at an adventure, women look for love this is a movie thats starts with rules, propositions and boundaries, but its about pushing limits, wanting more, daring, enticing a game. And how he's lost in his own game. He meets the one chance to learn what he's never dare to learn before, because of his own false beliefs and the big thick walls he created thinking he'd be untouched in, protected by control.\nIf you want to dumb down the movie and disregard how often in life you see people making the same mistakes and passing down on love for being stubborn and short sighted, then agree with pety critics comments its your loss you must then, be used to limit youre your capacity to think what movies, books, painting and artists really have to offer.\nNow, technically I think the focus puller needs another job or another crash course. I started a game and quickly got pretty tired to look around the frame, \"where the hell is the freaking focus now?\"\nDirection: There are a lot more shots than still shots Mrs Taylor-Johnson, there is more that Long, mid shots and Ill let you in a lil secret shhhh, you can get movement in a shot! without being in a glider how about some dancing? How about some free fall thats what the movie is about. Side dollys , steadycam and track in/out MUCH needed. Not as a solution, but as narrative intention.\nI know you like Dakota, but a lot of your choices were wrong, needed more Christian, reacting to the emotion, action and the lack of it.\n[spoilers from here on] -Theres one particular example here, Christians dark past confession theres a looong shot to the sleeping Ana, when hes the story how about some handheld? Or at least a big spider dolly closing in? detail shots to his hands, he must have had tight fists, tight shoulders, he had a freaking fight in him, in his face, his eyes all these choices, unexploited, unexplored -a created- moments that could have been use to cash-in in psychological-thriller that is his mind but nah\n-at graduation: no reactions at all to \"Mr Steel, this Is C. Grey Anna's boyfriend\"?? no one thought that was monumentally odd?? Grey is scared of commitment, Anna's never had a boyfriend and dreads Greys reaction, Kate vomits that news out shaking everyone. While Kate rejoices in the aftermath, Anna is panicking about so many things, and the Directorial solution to everything is a short collective mid shot? [that really seems to belong to another movie] completely detached from the truth of EVERY character poor doesn't cut it Mrs Director.\nperformances: Dakota is great docile, shy, sublime thoughsublime and docile at the end of the bad spanking?! no shaking, no reaction to the belt? I don't think so. Where the awe? The shock, the disappointment, the hesitation, shes appalled! And she whispers with a few little tears on her face?\n-She orgasms! Multiple times! with a faint exhale? really? a tiny bit more doesn't hurt anyone, its only natural. Generally, Dakota reacts to everything she's supposed to react, well, natural and graceful. But I think she needs a bit more dynamic range. After all Anna seems to be a natural submissive, but she doesnt have a submissive bone of in her body just a bit ?\nJamie: He has a lot of potential, but he can do more. Id suggest tone inflection and micro-expressions training, veru short sutil, sublime face reactions, that reveal in a fraction of a second the true feelings, that every human has, universal expressions. He does them, but inconsistently. Disappointing, but I wont put this all on him. The Director has the power to keep doing retakes until she gets what she wants so if she took that, maybe she didnt know what she needed or misdirected. Ex: the infamouse interview scene! And Claitons; who was he glaring at? Paul or Anna? That game needed to be more fun, more hot!!. Its not the words, its how he says the words Christian is always teasing sex with unrelated topics uncontrollable suggestion. Book 3 prologue gives you HIS mind on those scenes, completely! But in the movie, you barely see a tiny glimpse, when after that moment they are both hooked. Reading the of book 3, i was hungry to see all the micro expressions that SHOULD have been there! the exasperation, the confusion, the duality \"i fight the impulse to set the recorder for her\" Im sorry, but it needed so MUCH more! More expression, more inflection, more shots!\nIm not sure on the filming order, though he tends to remain too much on the inexpressive or tense\"closed-off/controlling freak\" mode, Jamies performance gets increasingly better for a solid end. \nScript: Im both happy and sad, happy because is more real mature and classier without voice over or any remark to the inner goddess and self-conscience. A bit sad, because it also takes some funny bits.\nIm extremely displeased (and hoping for an extended edition) on those VERY important info and plot changers no one will complain with extra 15-30 minutes of film! [Titanic and Lord of the Rings to verify that.] The email from Savanna and some examples of that exquisite teasing over email!! The game itself! Is pretty much missing. For such little snippets of the emails, my choices would have been different. Christian not only reassures her by holding her hand, but encouraging her to speak upand when she does, hes disarmed.\nThe sleep over at here place after she cries, when theres no sex because shes upset, huge game changer!! just to mention one.\nOther important things they omit! Internship interviews!! \nThe protective side of Kate towards Annas wellbeing.\nThe crying nights. And Joses photo shoot!!!! All of these imperative to ground the second film. They only needed random short lines in existing dialogues\nMusic and score: 10/10\n\nI would have loved to write this screen play! I can only dream.\nWaiting for film 2, hoping Jamie and Dakota come back just have to say this; they can always use body doubles!!! film is creative, many ways to make something appear real! [Chris Hemsworth kisses HIS real life wife for a passionate kiss in Thor!, did anyone notice wasnt Natalie? No one can! They are all distracted by the mindblowing passionate kiss!] but altogether recasting either of them?! Is a crime. It would  break the project and is quite insulting.",

            "content": "Sam Taylor-Johnson's character driven erotic romance drama thriller falls flat just ten minutes into the movie. The picture has a lot of issues. When one is dealing with a drama involving characters or in other words a character driven picture the emphasis all the way should go to how the characters are written , shown and performed.The first major problem which marred the whole narrative was the ludicrously boring and badly written screenplay by the four writers. Not only are the characters poorly written but also poorly developed throughout the length and breadth of the film and as a consequence it does drags and takes the venom of the plot revolving around the characters.A film which possess erotic romantic scenes must and should be well shown and there is where the direction falls apart. None of the romantic scenes throughout the picture have any sense of purpose or moments or even evocative imagery in either direction. Even thought the scenes are well lit and the plot basically rests on the imagery of the scenes , they just fall flat and redundant as the contract written. Sam Johnson also fails to bring out something special of a terrible screenplay and also the actors. Now the actors themselves are not bad in portraying what they are told to portray even though they are no way near the potential. The lead characters are such one dimensional in nature that nothing interesting can be pulled out of the hat . So the plot was ultimately and constantly reminded to us in form of SMS texts and email replies . Those were probably the only understanding of the nature of the leads. So the whole process of collaboration from the script to the director to the actor stumbled within the first couple of minutes and hence the result is a pretty much the synopsis of the picture. From a cinematography point of view , I wouldn't say it was bad. On the contrary from a technical side I thought the setting was nicely lit and atmospheric bringing some tension to the otherwise dull storytelling. There were also nice use of colors. Seamus McGarvey can hold his head high. Another tool that could have been nicely used was the score which again lacked any sort of purpose in enhancing the picture. It was thrown into it to make it sound nice. There is no artistry shown by the director in any department which could have enhanced the characters a little bit more than what was written. Having said all these and well most of them are negative I would like to say the premise of the source material was probably not the best and certainly the casting was too much for non exceptional actors to handle. So a potentially bad premise turned into a preposterous screenplay probably shouldn't have made the theaters at all and could have gone straight to video.",

I think Jamie should return to acting school because the only thing that is good about him is his look. And of course that look won't last forever. I love Dakota. I think she is funny and beautiful in a way that not many people see. The lack of chemistry in this movie does not go unnoticed and of course that is another disappointment from this movie. And maybe for those who have read the book, I believe you notice that the story in this movie was told way too fast. This is the main problem that I have with the movie. It's just too fast! They forgot to put many little details from the book into the movie and because of that I could not have the same connection with the movie that i have with the book. So, overall i think the movie is only good at making bunch of dollar for the studio but not able to give audience the romance, the intimacy, and I really hope that the sequel to this movie will satisfy our expectation for the whole trilogy which is basically romance, but with a twist.",

The talented Johnson is saddled with the wooden and stiff (and I don't just mean down there) Jamie Dornan as her co-star, leaving her to desperately grasp for any semblance of screen chemistry the movie may periodically flirt with. The direction is handsome yet lacking much real style or personality, the plot keeps repetitively dragging along in circles like a BDSM-curious dog chasing its own tail, and the titular sex scenes are underwhelming and tame, trying too hard to class up and make Hollywood-friendly what should be trashy and shameless. Top that off with one of the most frustrating and anticlimactic movie endings in recent memory and I'm left feeling uncertain as to how anyone could be satisfied enough to hunger for the inevitable sequels.",

Gosh I was so ashamed about watching this film and for the first hour (I confessed so to my husband), I was kind of ashamed about liking this film. Well not like; more not hate. \nActually it's quite an interesting love story for the most part. Yes it is hokey writing. The whole shadow of EL James insisting on final cut is all over it. It is inconceivably bollocks about the BDMS scene; considering the BDSM theme it is remarkably vanilla; being a film about female sexuality there is a lot more tits and fanny than there is male nudity. I mean not one full frontal? really queen? However I believe the major fault in this film is Jamie Dornan. In all his press junkits he came across as quite clueless and WOW does he not sell the Dominant here. Zero chemistry with Dakota Johnson and just doesn't really look suited (scuse the pun) to the part. I think Christian Grey needs a more Hugh Jackman stature about him. Not read the books, but it would seem that he needed to be more of a presence.\n\nAnyway, I did enjoy Dakota Johnson a lot. She completely sold her character and was a joy to behold. It is shot really beautifully. Nice, not to obvious grey wash to everything. \nFortunately for me the film takes a nose dive into the dung heap in the last half. The \"do your worst\" is ridiculously vanilla and it is all just rather a bit craptastic. It's like EL James took over and though Sam Taylor Johnson was being a bit too good and showing her up. Pretty awful really. \nThe fault for me lies with James's final say and Dornan's horrible acting. You wont go to hell for catching this on a plane. i heard thoughts saying that this would have been better if it was worse, but I think that if the director had been given free rein and Christian Grey had been better cast, this could have actually been quite a compelling film. What a fucking shame it really isn't.",

            "content": "Rated by my sister, Alison: \"FIFTY SHADES OF VANILLA\n\nMen who like to please their women should see FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. Women who like hot Irishmen and *think* they love being dominated in the sack should see it, too. While it's absolutely not the most erotic movie you'll ever see, it's better than its source material and much fun to see with galpals (like I did) or, I would think, your romance/sex partner.\n\nThe movie sucks because Christian Grey is such a dom that he has not only a playroom well appointed with only the finest in (to be sure) bespoke leather sex toys, but also one of those airtight \"slave contracts.\" Yet the movie wants us to believe that a grossly immature, unworldly, all-together average beauty makes him break his own contract and own rules, one by one, almost immediately after meeting her.\n\nThe Anastasia character tops from the bottom throughout the movie. This should be obvious to anyone who's even remotely read about or dabbled in BDSM. A master like Christian Grey would anticipate this and probably not be willing to let it happen. Basically, it wouldn't get him hard. But this is a movie for women who like their sexuality to be 97% vanilla, with just a sprinkle of kink. The movie is much tamer than I even thought it would be, and even in the fuckyouspeechless throes of gettin' it on. Christian uses a condom every single time. We even get to see that familiar intimate moment where the guy rips the condom wrapping open with his teeth and slaps on that sucker. The movie is just that responsible.\n\nThe movie sucks because Anastasia Steele is a virgin who, according to her own admission, hasn't even done \"other stuff.\" This confession drives Christian Grey wild with desire for her. He even wonders at the thought that men must've been \"throwing themselves\" at her for years while she remained oblivious to her charms -- the chief charm being an obnoxious tendency to bite \"the pillow of her bottom lip\" (this is seriously what we called it at True Story, True Confessions, and the lot). The message seems clear: All those Cosmo articles are dead wrong. Guys don't want an experienced woman who knows and relishes her own sexuality. Guys want a virgin they can train with their main vein. Sloppy seconds are for suckers.\n\nMr. Grey pops Anastasia's cherry approximately three minutes after she fesses up to it. Then they do it in the miss posish, a.k.a.\"the normal way\" the first time so she can develop a taste for it. You know -- because self-made business magnates have all sorts of extra time on their hands to be at a girl's beck and call, and tenderly tend to her innocent, blossoming needs and uncertainties. Every woman knows this guy; every woman has, at some time in her life, had to put up with an obscenely handsome, tycoon-level hottie who wants to spend all his time with her, cater to her every need, and possess her erotic and romantic life forever and ever and ever and ever. Yeah. Sure.\n\nYou see now why this is a perfect chick flick? Because it says this guy exists. He is out there, waiting for you and only you. You can dress dowdy, you can be dumber than a deflated blowup doll. No matter what, HE wants YOU. All of you. This is the idea that makes the movie a great flick for couples. Guys, if you want to know what many women want -- even just a little bit -- and make them all lust for your cashmere-scented wang, watch this movie, take notes, and then act like Christian Grey for the rest of your life. In addition, please own and be able to fly your own helicopter. And if your new girlfriend wants to go visit her mother, don't take it for a much-needed break from the needy, nagging ball-and-chain -- secretly fly down there in your gorgeous weekend clothes and JUST SHOW UP while your lady and her mom are having brunch. This is super hot.\n\nSadly, the movie isn't super hot. You have to wait for just about the last 12 minutes of the flick to see even a remotely decent whipping, and it only lasts for six lashings. By his own admission, Christian Grey likes to \"fuck. Hard.\", but from what we see, the dude doesn't have any amazing sexual skillz. He's a two-minute brother and he begins every sexual encounter by getting down on his knees and kissing his way down Anastasia's belly on a lick trip to her nethers. Seriously. If I were dating him, the minute he got down on his knees and started unbuttoning my jeans, I'd think, Guess we're gonna do it. And heeeerrre we go again.... The movie traffics in that precise kind of cinematic shorthand. We know that Christian Grey is unbelievably wealthy -- not to mention meticulous -- because his penthouse is enormous and cold with lots of white marble flooring and all of that sparse modern furniture that all rich people love. By the same shorthand, it only takes a few seconds of backstory to establish what we figured: Anastasia's roommate is an earthy blonde who puts out on the first date. You know. That roommate.\n\nJamie Dornan makes a decent Christian Grey. He seems to be missing some sort of light in his eyes, and we never get to see his full, dominating dong, but he's got a great body, a terrific head of hair, and, as befitting a former model, he makes the clothes look good, good, good. As for Dakota Johnson -- she should stick to light romantic comedy. She's darling and we can see her full ribcage every time she undresses, but she doesn't scream intelligence, and one gets the idea that she has precisely one layer of mystery, and that layer is made out of calico and lace. I do have to admit that I find it refreshing to see that such a sweet, simple, sunshiney girl came out of the union of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Note to the Ladies: When you take off your top, can you see every single bone and piece of cartilage in your ribcage? If your answer is no, you are an ugly pig and pretty much the entire world can't believe you have the audacity to think that some guy or girl would ever love you\".",

Another major problem is the useless characters and even some useless scenes, prime examples being Anastatia's best friend Jose and the Grey family dinner scene.\nOverall, it was not as bad as I expected but it's 2 big weaknesses are too distracting for you to be truly invested in the film",

This said, I knew if they came with a movie it would be hard to meet my personal vision!  I was excited to see them try, though. Nothing against this actor, but they started off with a poor choice in Mr. Grey I must say...  Now that I have seen the movie  I see that wasn't the end of my disappointment. This movie was terrible I'm sad to say. I knew it would be hard for Hollywood to move around the sex, but that wasn't even the part I cared about. (which I believe the same goes for most readers) The story line was my favorite part. They had SO much to work with and they did nothing with it. I don't know... maybe they gave it to amateur film makers to keep with the theme. It was a major fail! \n-Disappointed Fan.",

Oh you poor servants who have been dominated by a novel to go see the film adaptation of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Director Sam Taylor-Johnson constructs an uneven, unbridged, and unexciting film in \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". With all due apologies, Taylor-Johnson is the grey goose here. I think she should have spiced it up with an 80's soundtrack consisting of \"Back in the Chain Gang\", \"Whip It\", and of course \"Sex (I'm A....). As most of you know, this film is about a literary student named Anastasia Steele who meets a young billionaire named Christian Grey. Grey is soft spoken and sly, but he has a fetish for bondage, S&M, whipping, etc. Grey romances Anastasia and tries to persuade her to sign a \"dominant-submissive\" to-be-my-lover contract. It was about this time that I felt that the filmmakers of this garbage needed was a good spanking from their studio heads; even though that is far from happening since the movie has brought in chains of box office gold. Jamie Dornan plays Grey and Dakota Johnson is Steele; Dornan was dormant with his performance and Johnson did not provide any scene-steeling work in my book. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" was as shady as they come; and I mean that literally. \n* Failure",

            "content": "Look, this isn't going to be a review that raves about how good this film is, because it truly is trash. I feel as though this film is a genius picture on many levels, due to its manipulative styles and ways of getting people into the theatre. Looking back on Fifty Shades of Grey, it really was just a marketing tactic for a certain demographic. Sure, fans of the book watched it and may have got some enjoyment out of it, but the story, accompanied by the god-awful dialogue, really does make this film a treat to watch, even if you can admit how bad it is. I have no idea how seriously the books are to be taken, nor do I ever intend on finding that out, but this film is an absolute blast to watch, because the dialogue is completely ridiculous. Here is why you should check out Fifty Shades of Grey, even though it's terrible.\n\nFollowing Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey as they meet through a business meeting, she quickly becomes infatuated with him, only to realize that there is a lot more to him behind the scenes. Tormented by the fact that he likes to inflict pain onto women who enjoy it, he is very heavy into BDSM. Accepting her as his girlfriend and trying to get her to sign a non-disclosure agreement to participate in these events that would pleasure him, their relationship grows in very strange ways. Filled with horribly written dialogue and a plot that really doesn't go anywhere, this first instalment doesn't do to get fans to return, although I'm sure the readers will be there on day one of all three films.\n\nWhile the story of this film is obviously not to be taken too seriously, the performances in both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan definitely lifts the film from the ashes in my opinion. There chemistry may not be perfect, but they do give these roles their all, especially Johnson. These are some of the most irrelevant and dumb characters I have seen on-screen in quite some time, but their performances are what make them bearable. There are times when the dialogue coming out of their mouths is so terrible that I can do nothing but chuckle, but Anastasia could be completely in tears. There was clear effort in making this film better than it\n\nThe main reason people flocked out to see this film, was clearly due to the shock value. People who hadn't read the books were curious, people who knew it was going to be a poor film wanted a good laugh, and fans of the book were hoping to be satisfied. But were the scenes memorable in any way? Memorable in the sense that they are solely done for shock value, yes, but they really aren't that shocking, especially when they are limited even with an R rating. I did not go into this film hoping these scenes would be great though. I was hoping for great chemistry and compelling characters, which was a mistake from the very beginning. Having said all of this, these sequences should please fans of the book. In that way, I guess the film does its job.\n\nIn the end, Fifty Shades of Grey sets out to please the fans and draw in interested people. That is exactly what it accomplished and absolutely nothing more. With wooden characters and a plot that centres solely around the fact that a woman is unsure if she should be trusting this man, there really isn't much substance to be had. Overall, as I said, it does its core job for fans, but newcomers will either roll their eyes, find it funny, or walk out. Released on Valentine's Day, as are the sequels, it's the perfect spot for a film like this, especially if they are in the mood for some cash returns. Fifty Shades of Grey is a very, very bad film, but undeniably accomplished its goal. For that, I give it a few props.",

            "content": "Even at the height of its popularity (especially when the 1st edition came out), I just knew Hollywood would not keep their hands of this one, no matter how ridiculous the whole concept is. I guess this is where I should admit that I haven't read the book so this review won't be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didn't do from the book. No, this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me I can't see what all the hype is about. This E.L. James erotic best seller was actually conceived as a Twilight fan story, I cant even begin to imagine the level of atrocity that would have given birth to if the idea was picked up in the original over hyped mediocre Twilight series. Anyways lets gets to the plot, The story follows Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a depressingly ordinary college girl, who goes through life without many close friends outside her roommate leads an existence of convention and routine. This changes when her roommate asks her to interview Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), an elusive, single billionaire who's consistent protection of his private life has warranted great question. From the moment she sees him, Anastasia is smitten with everything about him because he is everything she isn't: bold, confident, unafraid, and suave. One can tell just from the way Christian looks and speaks to Anastasia, having great patience and acceptance with her that he admires her for her own traits as well: she's simple, frightened, vulnerable, and just the kind of girl he's looking for. The two quietly hit it off, with Christian requesting simple things like coffee outings and simple hangouts before going through one of his many periods of being standoffish and confusing to Anastasia. Eventually, he reveals his motives; he's looking for a sexual relationship with no commitments and no conventionality in terms of going on dates. He wants sex and he wants it his way, proposing a contract to Anastasia in hopes she will become the submissive to his dominant, in which she'll stay at his spacious penthouse on weekends to engage in wild sexual escapades. Yup! this is the plot of an actual movie, not your usual porn production from Digital Playground or Naughty America, people actually invested in this movie! There are all sorts of major issues with the film, we can start with the laughable screenplay, which would have been rejected by the Lifetime channel and in fact, I'm going to guess that it would have been rejected has a five-year-old written it. The dialogue is without question some of the most laughable I've heard in a very long time. In fact, the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the \"F\" word is used and it's used in a way to where it's supposed to be shocking. Really? It's going to take more than that. The entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really can't buy into any of the melodrama and you've just got to sit back and laugh. Yet another problem is that the film just isn't erotic. Films like Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct, 8mm are just a few examples that qualify as erotic films. A lot of the lack of erotic-ness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material. Nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan fit their roles pretty well, they are good looking & awkward (I guess that's how they are supposed to be). However, the two completely lack any kind of chemistry together. Like I mentioned above the plot was originally meant to be Twiligth fan fiction, we cant help but notice the similarities between the lead protagonists (in comparison to the very boring Edward & Bella). Maybe that's intentional, again alluding to Grey's refusal to make this a relationship of any conventionality, but it's difficult to get wrapped up in the sex scenes when both parties seem disinterested in one another and bored. Furthermore, the acting of the two leads varies from acceptable to incredibly poor and contrived. On the whole 'Fifty Shades of Grey' may go down as one of the most poorly-written films of the film year in terms of having singular lines of dialog that are capable of producing unintentional laughs and sneers.  Combine the elements of bad dialog with unremarkable sex scenes and an an overall idiotic portrayal of a sex subculture, and you have a film that flat-lines where it should have stunned & entertained. Just as Mr Gray had said \"This is fifty shades of f****d up\"!",

Sam-Taylor Johnson did what she could with the material and scrapped the inner monologue (thank Christ) and I cannot deny that the film is shot well and that Dakota Johnson has presence and wit on-camera; the positives end there. This story is a complete fantasy and in no reality I can fathom would a woman tolerate an obsessive, stalker-type even if he was super rich and I feel it is degrading how quickly she became infatuated with him just because he has a fucking helicopter. I don't think I've ever seen more inconsistent characters before in my life with the constant flip-flop of being okay with the S&M, then wanting intimacy, then him saying he won't give it, then totally does, and by the end I did not give a crap about their \"relationship\". Jamie Dornan is merely okay as the lead, though he's sorely missing the intimidating quality about him required and you'll be rolling your eyes at some of the things he has to say. The selling point everyone's losing their shit over is obviously the sex scenes, which while pushing the boundaries of the R rating, don't amount to much and feel repetitive after the first night. Fifty Shades of Grey is an over-long gimmick-movie with no conflict, no realism, and zero credibility in the writing department and if you're into the whole taboo, S&M stuff, watch Secretary instead.",

I think Dakota Johnson played Anastasiawell & it many ways I could relate to her. Jamie Dornan definitely has the looks & he pulls off the mysterious vibe as soon as you meet his character you want to know more about him. I especially liked the ending to the film I thought it was a good ending to a sequel & for that reason it made me want to find out what'll happen next between the two. I also loved the whole picture to the movie. Even thought the movie is very dark it has a clean background with lots of glass & sharp light colours such as a lot of grey, black &white which makes this movie very enticing. The only negative thing I have about this movie is Jamie Dornan's character as Christian Grey trying to sell those seductive & dirty talking lines I couldn't help but laugh when it's not suppose to be funny. But overall I'd give the movie a 5/5 especially loved the comedic scrnes with Anastasia they were funny.",

Honestly, those two women did what they could, they saved what could be saved. The movie had some funny lines and thankfully it didn't take itself too seriously. Towards the ending tho, it became rather boring and I desperately wanted it to end. The ending, that was supposed to be dramatic and make viewers cry, barely made me feel...

I tend to find anything that deals with understanding the human condition fascinating. I wonder why I  chose trying to understand computers as a career path over people? This movie is categorised as a romance but it is a torrid sort. I actually liked 50 Shades of Grey but not for the reasons as how it's marketed but for the psychological depth of the two main characters. The movie is still running so I will refrain from going into too much detail. \n\nThe movie is NOT about sex. Anyone who comes out of the theatre feeling they got their jollies off seeing some \"soft porn\" might be some sick motherf'rs. The movie is about 2 things: abuse of power in relationships and the effects of child abuse.  I felt uncomfortable thru the whole movie. Everything the male protagonist irked me. He displayed the same qualities of a psychopath. If he wasn't such a philanthropist and oh a billionaire of his own company and apparently the only eligible guy in the city, this movie would have more resembled a movie about a stalker on the prowl. \n\nBut the story is much more than some messed up guy who expresses himself awkwardly through BDSM. It is about someone who tries to deal with his own inner issues as a result of suffering abuse in his own childhood through no fault of his own I should add. The female protagonist has a face as sweet as an angel but I suspect it will be revealed she has her own personal battles to deal with as well. I suspect hers might be on par with Christian Grey. Why else would she subject herself to the F'd up situation she can't get out of? Then again, we all find ourselves in situations we can't get out of. Maybe the real moral of the story should be to steer clear of domineering partners and find your equal. Now, I have not read the books nor plan to but I hear there are already sequels in the works to flesh out the rest of the issues these two are going to deal with. \n\nThis movie is fascinating because it tackles real psychological issues. Child abuse has a way of manifesting in destructive ways in adulthood. I couldn't decide if actor Jamie Dornan was supposed to intentionally act stilted throughout the movie because of the trauma. I certainly did not see the attraction at all. He's more of a show off than a person of magnetic gravitas. Dakota Johnson sold me completely and her acting was believable. Look past the sex, the bondage, the skin on skin because these are really not the focus. \n\nThe author hooked us with rope and have now forced us (you and me) to feel the pain of the main character(s). A woman emotionally trapped to a real F'd up guy and a guy who should've gotten therapy. Unfortunately, We are the submissive and they are our dominant. Why did the author choose BDSM to tell a romance?in the world of BDSM it is a negotiation of pain and pleasure appropriation between dominant and submissive. Whereas in a rape situation, there is no negotiation between victim and victimiser. No wonder I felt that uneasy feeling throughout the whole movie.",

For a book that was so highly praised by so many people this film was all kinds of terrible, from it's plot (or lack thereof) to its characters and dialogue this movie just failed to deliver in any way. Now i know i am not the target audience for this film but even if i am not the target audience i have to be able to have at least a half decent time watching it. Right from the very first Anastasia and Christian scene this move was just so cringeworthy and a complete borefest. This movie did a terrible job of creating and introducing these characters, one comes across as a weird, over-controlling freak (some words i cannot include here) and the other a very confused ,dumb and poorly written woman. Whoever wrote the dialogue for this film whether it was the same as the novel or updated for the film needs to retire their writing career because the conversations between the two leads are so boring, all the lines seem very fake, like this writer has never had a normal human conversation. Most of this crappy dialogue is the writer's fault for writing it but also Jamie Dornan was just completely bland in this role, his delivery of the lines were so robotic and fake that you didn't buy what they were saying for a second. I do believe that Anastasia did a half decent job while having to portray one of the dumbest characters who is completely incapable of making any kind of rational decision. Her scenes when she is away from Christian are more bearable, it is when they are together that it just gets unbearable to watch.\n\nNow, the plot was just so plain and simple that for a whole 2 hours the movie went absolutely nowhere. The movie was not building up to any kind of event, it was just a series of conversations and sexual activities all spaced out over the two hours. Whoever read the script and thought that THIS would be able to capture the viewers attention the whole time was dead wrong. This film did its very best to make me fall asleep, but i fought it because i had to see what stupidity they would come up with next to keep the film going. This film was just filled with many, many weird and awkward conversations that just make you wonder why on earth this woman is interested in this man and why this man is so interested in this woman. With a bit of unsexy sex thrown in there a few times and one of the worst endings in film history this movie was a disaster waiting to happen. If it wasn't for Dakota Johnson actually making her character at times amusing this would have somehow been even lower. - 2.9/10",

Strategically placed on a Valentines Day weekend release, the millions and millions of woman who were captivated by the highly successful novel series were lining up around the block to get their first taste of a live action Mr. Grey. \n\nFifty Shades of Grey is basically Twilight's replacement. Funnily enough stemming from Twilight fan fiction, Fifty Shades follows an awkward young woman who is pursued by an improbable love interest, the main difference being that instead of Edward's vampirism, Mr. Grey sports a BDSM fetish, where he must dominate his sexual partner. And this was the big draw card to the novel, it's explicit sex scenes. But how would this translate to a modern major motion picture? Many people were shocked to find the film was rated MA rather than a hard R. Well I found that the sex scenes were quite tastefully shot, and the two leads bonded well together here, but I really thought it was going to go a whole lot further. The 'domination' scenes were pretty tame, I expected it to get pretty brutal, but I suppose we gotta leave some room for build up in the sequels. \n\nI thought the sexual tension between Anastasia and Mr. Grey was great for the most part. But then Jamie Dornan (Mr. Grey) would do something stupid like bite a piece of toast that Anastasia is holding or give a hollow line delivery that just broke any sense of coolness that this character had. In fact it is Dornan's performance that ultimately harms this film. He is almost good. But on the contrary,  Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia, is great as the girl next door type. A lot of people seem to have a problem with her but I felt that she played the role strongly and I believed her the whole way. \n\nI didn't love this film, it is lame, lovey dovey and cheesy, but that's what I expected. It is an interesting enough story that had me for most of the way, it does run a tad long though and I wasn't digging the ending much. But I'm sure it will be remedied in the inevitable sequel. If you have even the slightest interest in this film, you need to go see it in cinemas. \n\n3/5\n\n'Behind this door is my playroom,' - Mr. Grey\n'What, like where you keep your Xbox and stuff?' - Anastasia",

Watching just as a film it's pretty good, but can be very flat in certain scenes, I don't think it's the lead characters (they had chemistry) but more the directing that went wrong plus it was missing vital parts of the story and made quite a few changes to scenes compared to the book. I understand you can't get a whole book in a movie but certain things should have been included and unfortunately Dakota didn't nail the last scene like I expected, but in saying that I'll be back for the 2nd movie (my favourite book) just hoping for a different director ð???",

            "content": "By Ricky Miller\n\n   'Fifty Shades of Grey'  -- much ado about nothing\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is an is an overblown melodrama that is on par with director Paul Verhoeven's \"Showgirls\" for degree of awfulness.  Dakota Johnson (TV's \"Ben and Kate\") is the naÃÃ,Â¯ve young girl who gets seduced into the world of masochist Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan, \"Marie Antoinette\").  \n\nGoing back to the  days of my youth, I actually read the books before \nI saw the movie. I did this with Stephen King's \"Misery\" and Tom Clancy's \"The Hunt for Red October.\"  \n\nBoth were great movies, but the reason rested in the director's hands.  The reason both of the movies were so good rested in the resulting flicks done by Rob Reiner and John McTiernan.  Reiner steered Kathy Bates to an Oscar win for \"Misery\" while McTiernan introduced a star in the making with Alec Baldwin.\n \n        Nowadays, I think the movie should stand alone, without having read the book.  \n \n      With this in mind, I did not resort to reading the pages of E.L. James's  page turners.   Both screenwriters James (who also penned the novel it's based on)  and Kelly Marcel add nothing of any merit to the superficial and trite dialogue. \n         Another predicament with \"Fifty Shades\" is one does not care in the very least about these selfish lovebirds.  Sure, it might have been steamy and tantalizing on the page, but director Sam Taylor-Johnson never pulls one into the proceedings and their earth-quaking romance.\nDornan's selfish persona of Christian Grey is just that of a spoiled yahoo who does not really care for others, but just his own gluttonous selfish appetite.  Johnson's Anastasia Steele is seduced by Grey and all his shortcomings.\n \n          Adding to the credibility of the movie is the appearance of Oscar-winner Marcia Gay Harden as Christian's psychologist mom, Dr. Grace Travelyan Grey.  Her appearance, although brief, shows how unimportant Christian is to the very scheme of things in real life.  Her persona is not one of ignorance, but of a person who is just prone to look the other way.\n\nLooking back at so-called controversial movies of my youth like \"9 1/2 Weeks,\" Zalman King's \"Two Moon Junction\" and \"Wild Orchid,\" I think of how ludicrous it was to deem these movies controversial.  They are just bloody movies and nothing more.\nControversy aside, I just want to see a good movie. Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Boogie Nights\" was one of the better movies I have seen in the past 20 years.  The same goes for Michael Mann's cops-and-robbers tale \"Heat,\" wherein an aged Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino square off in a pretzel-twisting suspense action-thriller. \nThat is what I want in my movie.  Quality.  It's not asking for much, but that is what I want to spend my money on. \n\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" for all intents and purposes is a complete waste of time.  Johnson's  Anastasia is a woman who realizes all too late that there is more to life than the simple pleasure of appealing to one's loins.  Real life is far too important.\nGrade:  C-",

But what a reader's mind's eye will forgive from a subpar novel, a movie audience member's real eyes (and ears) will not. Sure, the script was weak, the miscasted actors couldn't act and the much anticipated sex scenes seemed tame but, I mean, at least the soundtrack was decent. \n\nGrade:  D-\n\nBig Al says Fifty Shades of Grey is a renter...but only if you want to hate-watch.",

James novel that actually does hit upon some deep human issues - though unfortunately it does not have the ability to penetrate beneath some of the complexities it scratches upon. At the core of the film is the deep human desire to compensate for deep physical, emotional and mental trauma. The protagonists delve into the world of sadomasochism, because that represents to Mr. Grey, a device of controlling his environment and the response of others, especially the one he allows to be closest to him.\n\nThere is essentially a great deal of disappointment in a human attempting to micro-manage their world and those around him; a great fail in the area of relating to another. This leads to the conclusion that in our mutual yearning for fellowship and intimacy, that no amount of deviancy could ever satisfy or fulfill anyone. It's too bad this potentially great topic was put in the hands of filmmakers that chose to focus on sensationalism of sensuality.\n\nIt is funny that the film shot in an ironic 9  1/2 weeks, and it shows that the cast took only 5 days to learn their dialogue. The movie has also been banned in Kenya for moral reasons and, perhaps, should have been in the United States for artistic reasons. Ironically the Seahawks won their first Super Bowl during filming, but the choices made by the filmmakers amounted cinematically to not handing off to Marshawn Lynch in the last Superbowl: a bad call (to make this film) on their part. The film has enjoyed the commercial success of its shallow, fluffy book franchise it's based upon, thus we can sadly expect more of the same in future poorly made cinema lacking any REAL substance.",
