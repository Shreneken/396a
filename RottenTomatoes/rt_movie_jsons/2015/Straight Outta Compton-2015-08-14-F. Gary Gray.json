To say that it had been anticipated would be necessary then, for the true understanding of a sub- culture, itself. It seems redundant, and misinformed with guidance and any methodology to ethics, in many ways, too, and glorifies violence in the same way as its predecessors. But in the innovative true story element, and a big enough budget, it is truly quite spectacular of a movie watching event, for the very same reasons that you would dismiss it as being over the top or uninspired. I will say that it is stupidly exaggerated in most aspects of the realistic portrayal of a real life music industry giant that has gone on to now self- produce its own movies and music videos in the capacity that the genre has begun recycling so many ideas, and still coming up with new ways to spin the story.",

She's interested in a series that will premiere at the end of the month, and when she told me how the cast was chosen, this film was the first thing that came to my mind. The producers are Ice Cube and Dr Dre (two former NWA members), and also Tomica Wright (Eazy-E's widow); and they looked for the actors who most look like the members of the NWA. And they were successful: Corey Hawkins looks like Dr Dre, Aldis Hodge like MC Ren and Neil Brown Jr like DJ Yella; Jason Mitchell is identical to Eazy-E; and Ice Cube is performed by his son, O'Shea Jackson Jr, who is the face of his father. But this is not enough, it would be a waste of work and time if these guys weren't talented, and they are. Especially O'Shea Jackson Jr and Jason Mitchell, who are the main protagonists of the central conflict. Paul Giamatti's character, the manager, isn't inconsistent, he was seen differently by each of the members, and these points of view aren't antagonistic. Also, even being produced by former NWA members, the film opens a valid discussion about freedom of speech, police brutality in the 80s/90s (the gangs' resurgence), contracts and battle of egos. And I'll make this praise again: F. Gary Gray knew that this story needs to breathe, it's something that needs an emotional connection with the spectator (even if the spectator doesn't know who were these fellas), and it's told without any hurry. 2h46min very well used.",

So many other artists can be pointed back to them (Snoop Dog, Warren G, 2Pac, and many more). A great biopic of Eazy-E and NWA, the challenges and hardships that their group had to go through. I had huge fun watching this film. Now, is historically accurate? Most likely not as they did omit some aspects such as Dre's abuse history or that it wasn't Ice Cube that questioned the manager but another member in NWA, but it did captured the cultural influence of the hip-hop community.

It was produced by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, as well as Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright. MC Ren and DJ Yella were also involved in a consultant capacity. Moreover, the onscreen Ice Cube is played by his real-life son, O'Shea Jackson Jr.\n\nIt focuses on the group from its inception in the late 1980s, through to Eazy-E's death due to AIDS in 1995. Like their music, it's filled with energy, edginess, attitude and no small measure of political relevance as we witness the heavy-handed treatment that, as African-Americans, they receive from the police. The acting is excellent and the characters are superbly drawn. Although the film doesn't portray their manager, Jerry Heller, in an entirely positive light (resulting in the real-life person filing a lawsuit), even he is given some depth and nuance through Paul Giamatti's performance. However, it is O'Shea Jackson Jr. who really shines here, in a debut role that he took two years to prepare for.\n\nIt's a compelling, arresting biopic with a true emotional gut-punch of an ending.",

Uniendo el desarrollo de los personajes con la historia; mostrando tanto su altas como sus bajas.

Tanto como el de ellos con el barrio, hasta el de la Policía. Mostrando como desde cierto punto de vista el bando contrario es el \"enemigo\" de la historia. No teniendo personajes ni buenos ni malos, teniendo \n a personajes con diferentes facetas. Las referencias están muy bien introducidas, mostrándolas naturalmente en cada escena, sin parecer que se salgan de la historia o de los personajes. La estructura de esta película deja que desear, no siendo clara y apresurando las cosas muy a menudo , sintiéndote muchas veces perdido en la trama. Haciendo que el conflicto de los personajes y de la historia pierda peso. Esta película es disfrutable. Teniendo un conflicto claro y una historia interesante.

It manages to avoid the standard trappings of the genre by delving into the social issues that continue to plague society.  The film unflinchingly touches on the criminality that sometimes arises from poverty and oppression, the unfettered abuse of power that stems from unrestrained authority and wealth, and the excesses that come with fame.  While the running time feels too long, in part due to the insanely large number of characters, and the movie may unfairly perpetuate some stereotypes, it remains a powerful film thanks to its timeless themes, strong performances from its young cast, some great music, and fearlessly gritty directing from F. Gary Gray.  Some background knowledge before watching might enhance the experience, but it's a great movie regardless.",

The film focuses on the men that would eventually form the NWA and their rise to stardom and provides a commentary on the state of racism in America in the late 80's to early 90's and what the foundation of their musical movement was made from. The film takes us from the inception of the NWA and charts the history up until the creation of Dr Dres Aftermath record label in 1996.\n\nI will preface this with I have a very limited understanding of rap and hip hop. I enjoy it, I have listened to a multitude of albums but would not consider myself an aficionado. Regardless of your interest in the music director F. Gary Gray handles the material with skill. You are invested in the plights of these young men, who are at times fairly unlikeable and I found myself wrapped up in the narrative of the sheer craziness that happened behind the scenes when this music first came onto the scene. F. Gary Gray gets an awful lot out of his cast particularly with O'Shea Jackson Jr. who turns in an excellent performance as his father Ice Cube.\n\nAs a piece of work studying a moment in history it is eye opening and I believe captures the mood of the moment exceptionally well. However it must be said it must be taken with a slight pinch of salt regarding its overall accuracy.  I don't know the history well enough but after some brief reading, one of the main points of controversy is the handling of the groups manager Jerry Heller, played here by Paul Giamatti who is clearly having a very good time and how the the events between him and the group are depicted (I believe a lawsuit was ongoing at the time of Hellers death in 2016).\n\nAccuracy concerns aside there is much to enjoy here even if you have no interest in the music. The narrative is well handled and the performances from all involved get you wrapped up in the drama. I do believe it was Aaron Sorkin that said 'don't let the truth get in the way of a good story'.",

The actors did an amazing job of portraying their fathers and their actions as well, and I really love that this movie can take you on a ride of emotions. This movie can make you laugh, cry, smile, even angry! It's amazing. The only problem is that they they didn't add the event of EAZY-E making the diss-track, 'real mothaphhucking Gs' towards Dr. Dre after he left the group. This movie has the amazing scene that is when they sing 'Fuk Tha Police' on stage in Detroit even after being told they weren't allowed to play the particular song. I absolutely recommend this movie if you want a good story about legends in the rap, or even music industry, and even if you're just looing for adventure in a more modern time or the 80s and 90s, this movie has it. Definitely five stars in my opinion.",

All the cast do very well, in truth.\n\nI love how gritty the film is too, it feels real - at least as real as film can get.

I know that some scenes in this film are not one hundred percent accurate, but that does not change the fact that this film has an exciting story along with actors that did a great job in their roles. The scene that makes this movie memorable for me was when Ice Cube released No Vaseline and the rest of N.W.A was reacting to it together. I believe that Straight Outta Compton is a film you should watch just for the experience. It is a great film to watch especially, if you are already a fan of the group. However, do not go into the theater thinking you will get a deep explanation about the formation of the group, background stories of all the members, or a accurate portrayal of everything that happened between N.W.A from when they started to blow up in the music industry, up until the group split up and stopped making music. However, If you are a fan of the group like me and want to know little things about the members and see some of the real life events that the group went through portrayed in a film, if you enjoy rap, or you are just curious about the rise of west coast hip-hop then you may enjoy this movie.",

I feel bad for Eazy-E n how he got badly manipulated by Jerry n jumped by Sug, than dies from AIDS. Sad also how the band got torn apart bc of outside influences (Jerry/Sug). Sug Knight is a bad person n if u haven't figured that out by now Idk. Things are left out of the film as far as how the many of them treated women very poorly, altho film hints at some of that. Also left out is the chaos cops have to deal with in neighborhoods like Compton, not all cops are bad cops as portrayed. Dr. Dre was also painted more innocent in this film than I think he really is, according to stories I've heard. The film touched on many of the greats in early hip hop days, except Biggie.

It does well to capture what made N.W.A. stand out in the first place. Though these are stories that have been told before, there's a sense of wonder to everything that happens. Seeing how the turmoil within the group started early makes for compelling and tense scenes. The acting is on point. O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube) plays his father and nails it. I'm sure it helps to have that much of a personal connection to who you're playing and Jackson makes the most of it. He essentially is Ice Cube. Jason Mitchell (Easy E) is another highlight. Though his character does some questionable things early, you can relate to him. The scene where he finds out he has AIDS is heartbreaking and expertly acted. Corey Hawkins (Dr. Dre) and Paul Giamatti (Jerry Heller) both do well. I also got a kick out of how some of the other characters are played by people who look, act, and sound like their real life counterparts. Keith Stanfield (Snoop Dogg) is the best of that bunch, but R. Marcus Taylor (Suge Knight) is great, too. Obviously, the soundtrack is stellar and fitting of the movie.\n\nWeaknesses: At times, it can feel excessively long. With a runtime hovering around two and a half hours, it probably could've done with some trimming. As good as the soundtrack was, it never felt like there was quite enough music in the movie. It feels off for a film about music stars. I also wasn't 100% behind the way things were depicted. The way this story goes, only Suge Knight comes across as the bad guy and for the most part, you can sympathize with everyone else. That seems like a bit of a stretch.\n\nOverall: The one glaring issue with this movie is the length. If you shave off some of the first act, it would tighten things up, especially with the other two acts moving along nicely. The acting and direction are both great, making for a very strong retelling of a true story.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube produced their own biopic. Does it deserve it s good rap?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) I m straight outta answers, Greg. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to Eazy-E, a mule for the local drug dealer. He s running drugs but he wants to move on to something a little more  sane. And a lot less dangerous. When his friend Dr. Dre proposes he invest some of his drug money in a rap album, he s dubious. But between Dre and their mutual friend Ice Cube, they convince Eazy-E to bankroll the new group. Not only do they convince him to pony up the cash to produce the first single, but also convince him to rap on it.\n\nSCOTT: The group decides on a name, NWA, and they turn out a hit single. During a live show, music agent Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) sees the group s potential and approaches Eazy E, who hires him. Soon NWA has a record label, Priority Records, which produces NWA s first album, Straight Outta Compton. It becomes a smash hit, and NWA is on its way to legendary fame.\n\nGREG: Scott, I have never appreciated rap or hip-hop music. It never reached me. And after watching Straight Outta Compton I can see why. These young men were rapping about their inner city situation, something completely outside of my experience. They were living in a world surrounded by drugs and crime. And a police force that assumed their guilt just because they were black and hanging around on the streets. No wonder they created a hit single called  F* the Police.  Unlike so many biopics we ve seen, this one had a lot of heart. Even though I felt the drugs, sex, and crime were watered down for public display, I was drawn into the world of NWA and grew to appreciate the enormity of their accomplishment. They created a new genre of  Gangsta Rap  that continues to have an impact today.\n\nSCOTT: You re right, Greg. On the surface, Straight Outta Compton is a movie about a rap group. But it is so much more than that. This film is about human relations   how those relations form, how they evolve, how they unravel, and how we clean up the mess. Compton makes you think about the ways that human beings treat each other, in the good sense but mostly in the destructive sense. For the most part, Straight Outta Compton focuses on the ability of a group of African-Americans to overcome the institution of racism. Yes, we know that the film cleaned up its portrayal of this hip-hop group, but there is still much more than a kernel of truth in Compton s message about the dangers of a racist police force. The anger in the song lyrics seems extreme yet understandable.\n\nGREG: These are flawed heroes. Eazy-E earns his money running drugs - a strictly illegal vocation. But he sees the drug business as a losing proposition. The dangers outweigh the return on investment. When Dr. Dre approaches to start a record label, he is dubious at first (a classic call to adventure and refusal of the call) but then jumps in with both feet. Dre is painted as a good kid who has dreams of setting the world on fire with his DJ mastery. There s even a classic scene where Dre is told not to spin that hip-hop stuff and play the master list. But he breaks the boss s rules and gets the crowd hopping to his mad licks. And Ice Cube has the lyrics. He s the poet of the group. In a lot of ways, this is a classic rock and roll success story complete with the excess in alcohol, drugs, and sex. But these heroes also have to deal with the seedy underworld of crime as the people running the show are criminals.\n\nSCOTT: In some ways, this movie tells the familiar tale of the rock n roll group that can t handle success and must disintegrate. There is a Beatle-esque sequence involving the group writing song lyrics that skewer Ice Cube for leaving the group, followed by the Cube returning the favor in his subsequent songs. We see redemption at the end when the guys patch things up. The sleazy embezzling Heller character is interesting. He is a mix of the good mentor and the dark mentor. He helps NWA achieve superstardom but in the end Heller reveals himself to be a lying cheat. Another manager is later shown to be crooked and pays the price by having his office dismantled by a baseball bat. We ve seen this sleaze in the music industry in last year s Jersey Boys and Get On Up.\n\nGREG: There aren t a lot of secondary characters to review in this movie. There are a lot of minions - people who are hangers on, coasting on the coattails of NWA. There is also what we call a  System  in the police - who are cast as oppressors in this film. Usually there is a single character who might represent the face of the minions or the police, but this film does a disservice by making both a nameless, faceless mass.\n\nSCOTT: Straight Outta Compton was not meant to appeal to an older, non-rappy guy like me. Yet I found myself strangely moved by the film. I found myself rooting for these underdog heroes and appreciating the systemic obstacles placed in their road to success. I m referring, of course, to the systems of racism and power-abusing law enforcement. This film was well-made and quite interesting. I m happy to award it 3 Reels out of 5. Our NWA heroes are not choir boys but they nevertheless travel the classic hero s journey that includes a departure into the unfamiliar world of celebrity status, help from mentors (both good and bad), encounters with lovers, and battles with villainous institutions. Eazy-E s death in the end was poignant, too. I ll give this group a rating of 4 Heroes out of 5. As you mention, Greg, there aren t many supporting characters. Heller is a scumbag for cheating the group but he also helped them in some important ways. The appearance of Snoop Dogg and others is inconsequential. Because there isn t much here, I can only award 2 Cast points out of 5.  Movie: Cast: Hero:\n\nGREG: Straight Outta Compton is another classic rock-n-roll story, except this time it has a happy ending - mostly. It isn t surprising that you and I identified with these young men, despite the differences in our backgrounds. We admire people who start with nothing and rise to successful heights. Not only that, but there are significant transformations here. Dre and Ice Cube grow from young hoodlums into mature adults who are leaders in their respective industries. Even Eazy-E comes to realize that he let money and fame cloud his judgement and he renews his friendship with Dre and Ice Cube, only to be struck down in his prime by AIDS. It is a story of mythic proportions, one that anyong can identify with. I give Straight Outta Compton 4 out of 5 Reels and 4 out of 5 Heroes. The secondary characters are few and far between. The one character of interest is Heller and he plays both good and bad mentor. The mass of hangers-ons and evil police are hardly noteworthy. I give them 2 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Hero:",

Maybe it's bias on my part because I followed the group and the artists that are portrayed\nin the film, but  \"Straight out of Compton \"  impressed me such as easily being one of the best films I've seen this year. \n\nStraight Outta Compton tells  of the controversial group NWA that emerges from the rough urban streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California\nin the mid-1980s and who created, developed, and revolutionize Hip Hop culture with their very controversial music in the form of 'gangsta' rap\nand also presenting the tales of life in the 'hood.\n\n' Compton' was already very intriguing to me because I followed the group and a couple of the artists who later became very popular in the hip hop\nworld and eventually Hollywood movies, I was already clued in how the group was created and formed,.. how it was decided what would be their format,\napproach and style, how they would come to form their identity, who would be the lead singers, what they had to endure from FCC, and tales of their own\nbrutal encounter with corrupted local law enforcement, I thought about the irony timing to which controversial law enforcement seems frequently\nin the news nowadays. \n\nThe movie pretty much displays some of their true to life details of how the group tried to stay together when outside (and inside) forces attempt\n to corrupt and break apart the group. Egos, contract disputes, How they were being pursued and forced to have their music lyrics censored.\n\nHow they help heightened and bring along an entirely new brand style of rap (gangsta rap) when at the time the lesser \"fun\" toned \nhip-hop rap (ala \"kid n' play\", Kool Mo Dee, Fresh Prince Wil Smith, etc.) were still on the scene.   \nIt told of how Ice cube ended up parting on bad terms with 'Ruthless'  productions (Dre, Eazy E)  they even brought up historic moments such\nas Rodney King, and major LA city riot crisis. \n\nThen there's introduction of legendary hip hop rappers Tupac Shakar, (played by Marc Rose) Snoop Dog ( played by Keith Stanfield) , the horror stories of the Scandals and corruption of Death Row Productions - and how Row's  ruthless executive producer Shug Knight  (who is currently on trial for murder) tried to manipulate Dre, Ice Cube and threaten Easy E and his managers, etc. Knight was brilliantly portrayed by R.Marcos Taylor. And of course, eventual fateful, sad demise and end of star Eric Wright (Aka Eazy E.) \n\nI was so impressed with how the film was constantly going and rolling, never really seem to have a slow-drag moment, I liked the way the actors/group members\nwas introduced in the beginning credits,  I like how a particular rap song was broken down to define/explain the lyrical wording.\n \nGreat pace, great intrigue, great characters that either had you laughing with humor or captivated with their emotional moments to\nwhere I was hype with anxiousness to see what was going to happen from one scene to the next..\nFrom being to end it kept me the viewing audience totally engaged. It made little mention of how the group decided on wearing the color black and\nsports related paraphilia the recording sessions scenes are not in the league of  \" Hustle & Flow \"  and it's edited down to give you a brief tease of the songs\n\nSuch that it stayed with me, and had me thinking about it a lot even after I left the theater, and flat out gave me the desire to so very much see it again to see it again immediately.\n \nOverall such a brilliant combination of direction, script write, cinematography and very solid acting performances that turned this film into a masterpiece:\nI thought it was excellent direction by Felix Gary Gray,  terrific acting performances by front running stars of the cast crew,\n- especially by Jason Mitchell (as Easy E.)  Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre,  ...O'Shea Jackson Jr.- who portrays his real live father Ice Cube's\n- and who draws such an astounding looking resemblance to his father 'til it's ridiculously scary.  and Paul Giamatti as manager Jerry Heller. \nMitchell brought energy and charismatic presence, both as inspiring leader and emotional tragedy, his role and performance blew me away\nthe further the movie and dramatics grew. The connection between he and his manager Jerry was a big noteworthy element to the film. \n \nMaybe this type of film is not going to be for everyone's interest,  but for me, and how it was presented, kept rolling and was so very well scripted\nand well performed, it was sheer delight. I can't think of a biopic made film about a musical group that made any better than this.\nThis film will really stay with you after you've seen it. \n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 , I'd give it an 9.0",

Their journey to stardom is easily a story worth retelling as it hits on topics all over the spectrum from gang violence to race wars to the atrocities that exist in the music business. While it's not a film you'll be pushed to watch more than once, it's definitely one that everyone should see at least once.\n\nYou can't talk about a film about a music group without mentioning the music itself. Straight Outta Compton not only provides a solid soundtrack, but gives you deeper insight into how some of the songs were created. We're used to the finished product, but it's rare that we get a glimpse into the process of the song and the reasoning behind its creation. While a song like \"Fuck the Police\" might be pretty self-explanatory in its inception, a perfect chain of events brought the song to life.\n\nThe film captures your attention from the beginning. Easy E (Jason Mitchell) enters a dope house to collect on some money owed to him. It's a tense interaction that ends in a S.W.A.T. swarming the house. You see Easy running from rooftop to rooftop while helicopters scan the perimeter. Just another day in Compton.\n\nN.W.A. lived out a sensational career from their freaky beach parties to their crazy tour bus antics. Yet in still, as you're watching it unfold on the big screen, none of it ever appears to be oversensationalized. I never found myself saying, \"Ok, that's probably a stretch.\" That's a big reason as to why it was so enticing to watch.\n\nStrong performances from the cast helped carry the movie as well. The group members weren't granted equal screen time, but each played their role in excellent fashion. I honestly can't say that I favored one over the other.\n\nHere's where the movie could have used a little bit of a boost: It refused to ever dive under the surface of the relationship between these five young men. Sure we saw the houses, the partying, the tours. However, I never got a full sense of who these characters were as brothers growing up in a less than appealing environment. What were they like when they weren't around the music and the women and cameras? In a society today where terms like \"Black Lives Matter\" receive a divisive responses, it would have been nice to see the heart that beat behind these men. To somehow show that they were more than just music, money, and parties. Missed opportunity in my opinion.\n\nSolid movie that was good, but could have been exceptional. I give it a 77.",

Different audiences will probably have different reactions, but they will all have a reaction, which is what makes this a good movie in my opinion. My only main criticism is, like most biopics, it feels reductive. It might have been better focused to avoid this.\n\nThe casting was also spot-on, particularly Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E, who pretty much carries the movie.

It is an intense film, depicting the pratfalls of celebrity and how it can divide friendships and big egos, as well as dealing with larger issues of racial injustice in America and N.W.A.'s attempt to protest it.\n\nThis film follows the rise of N.W.A. in the late 90s and the conflicts that lead to its dissolving. It follows the three biggest players of the group Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), and Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins). It's the scripts that ambition to follow the paths of all three musicians that causes the film to falter. Though all three are compelling with great performances, sudden switches from one character to the other deflates the tension and drama. As opposed to being a N.W.A. biopic, the film would've been substantially better if it was an Eazy-E biopic, which at times it almost seemed to be. Jason Mitchell's performance is outstanding, and the Eazy-E character is fascinating. I say character, because with all biopics it's hard to really know how accurate it was. Though no one in the movie is a perfect angel, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's characters are portrayed in the most positive light.  It is hard to ignore the fact that the film was produced by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, and therefore some aspects of their pasts did not make the cut. There are a few scenes of Dr. Dre dealing with women and relationships. These scenes had no place in the movie overall, but if you are going to include them, you would have to include his history of domestic violence. Yet those parts were lacking.\n\nThis deals heavily with race relations and the troubling relationship with the African American community and the police. There are numerous powerful scenes depicting police overreach in the 90s including the Rodney King beating and riots. Considering the current zeitgeist with the Black Lives Matter movement and other such issues, these themes ring true today. Straight Outta Compton runs into the same issue it had with having three main characters - it tries too much. The police brutality theme was touched upon here and there, seemingly at random. It was at times barely tied in with the character arcs and growths. There was great potential here, unfortunately squandered.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic of course. That is if you like N.W.A.'s music and rap/hip-hop. The film also includes various cameos by other artists like Snoop Dogg. And by cameo, an actor playing the younger versions of the musicians. Well except for Tupac. I'm 99% sure that they resurrected Tupac to have him act in this movie.",

While it sits at an 88% on Rottentomatoes right now, there are a few people who didn't care for it. However, when I read their reviews, it's clear they didn't get it, which I can admit is easy to have happen. \"Straight Outta Compton\" is the movie of a generation. Those younger than that generation find it interesting like I find \"Selma\" interesting. Those older than that generation can be prone to seeing this generation as not worthy of a story like this because they didn't live through the Civil Rights era, slavery, etc. However, as I explained to my children during the significant conversation that this movie sparked, the culture represented in this movie has had to overcome different levels of socio-economic hurdles since the creation of America. First slavery, then civil rights and, as represented here, artistic freedom and entrepreneurship, all had to be dealt with just to get close to being seen as equal. Having lived during these years, having very vivid memories of this era, and already knowing much of the story presented in \"Straight Outta Compton,\" I was still mesmerized by the masterful direction, phenomenal script and talented acting, especially by Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson, Jr. The movie highlights how these kids overcame tremendous odds to get out of the situation they were in, inspired an entire generation of disenfranchised youths and made our evolving country take notice of the realities with which this first generation of \"equal\" blacks still had to contend. Rodney King, black-on-black crime and intimidation, immaturity, corporate and personal greed, as well as having an unintentional responsibility of ensuring their messages were understood to the rest of the US who couldn't comprehend their realities, all played into the construction of what is now the foundation of how rap went from being an Adidas-wearing novelty in the inner cities, to the cars, bedrooms and arenas of every race and every social class. While there was some dramatic and timing license taken for the sake of story-telling, \"Straight Outta Compton\" is a remarkable achievement I hope is remembered during Oscar season.",

Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.\n\nOne thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.\n\nThis film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull.

And that's one of the biggest problems with the movie, how can you recreate history? How can you present these people who are so iconic, and yet they are being played by these actors who you can clearly see aren't the real deal. The acting isn't terrible, but it just isn't convincing. The next biggest problem is how dishonest the movie is. It treats Dre and Cube like they are brilliant, super talented do-no-wrong kind of guys, while basically kicking Eazy to the curb. The portrayal of Eazy E here is simply offensive. Not only that but there's barely any word or sight of MC Ren, DJ Yella, or Arabian Prince. If you look at who's behind the film and who has spoken out against it, you can clearly see why it is the way it is and how untruthful and false it really is. If you really want to learn some N.W.A. history then watch some legitimate documentaries or read up on what really happened. Either would be more entertaining than this overhyped bag.

It shouldn't be a surprise that their story would sooner or later be adapted into a film (or it would if you read the troubled production history this had) but director F. Gary Gray and screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff were able to pull it off with 2015s Straight Outta Compton-an entertaining and emotionally satisfying glimpse into the revolutionary group's lives and rise. The directing by Gray is a career benchmark-with clever use of supers, technical proficiency all throughout (with great camera work by Mathew Libatique), impressive use of performances from his (relatively) newcomer cast and the ability to keep us engaged with a large story that never quite seems to lose focus. There are some hiccups throughout-with some repetitive scenes, a marginal lack of rounded depth with main characters (I never quite felt like I saw the real Ice Cube-even though the acting was impressive by O'Shea Jackson, Jr.-Cube's real life son) and a middle section that loses some steam but by the end everything comes together that will hopefully have a lasting impact similar to the group the film is based on.",

There was a lot that i never knew about outside of what was told through the media during that time like the involvement of Shuge Knight and how important Easy-E was to the group's success and ultimate destruction. I was pleasantly surprised that they covered not just the NWA material but the solo efforts (although Easy-E's \"Easy Duz It\" was never mentioned) from Dre and Cube were covered. And then of course the passing of Easy-E was emotional and showed the stark reality of what Eric Wright faced in his final days. While i will never pretend to be the biggest hip hop/rap kind of guy this was a great great movie and i was happy to have experienced some of this when i was a younger man.

So, I only knew part of the story of the rise and fall of the gangsta rap supergroup featuring Eazy-E., Ice Cube, and Dr. Dre (among others).  Director F. Gary Gray follows the contours of the usual biopic - however, tracking several major characters unavoidably results in giant ellipses in their personal stories (particularly when it comes to the women in their lives).  The fact that this is yet another cautionary tale about the perils of fame and bad business deals makes it feel familiar even though Paul Giamatti executes the villain role with some aplomb and at least one protagonist (Ice Cube, of course, played incredibly by his own son) is able to defy the usual arc. So, in the end the music itself carries the picture (as it should) and just as I was wondering why I didn't remember the N.W.A. reunion that finally seems to be coming together, everything falls apart with Eazy-E's death from AIDS.  Reflecting now, it's depressing to think that N.W.A.'s bravado focus on police brutality in the black community had no effect at all. If anything, the problem seems even worse these days but that's probably just a function of the new availability of viral videos when previously things stayed hidden (and/or were ignored).",

There's a scene near the start where Dr. Dre leaves home with a carton of records. He places one in and it wasn't just any record...It was from The Sugarhill Gang, whose \"Rapper's Delight\" was the song that took America by storm and started the hip-hop explosion. I thought this was a great touch and nod.\n\nThe focus is mainly on Dr.  Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy-E. Their lives surrounded by gangs and drugs as they strive to follow their dreams and better themselves. They take that leap and work together to form a label. All the while, they are hounded by the police even when they are taking a harmless break outside of the studio.\n\nThey hook up with Jerry Heller, who manages them and helps get their name out by finding a producer.  They become famous, make records and sell out tours.\n\nBut problems ensue. Contracts and dealing become a problem and friendships are strained.\n\nThe journey is interesting to watch and we root for them. It offers us a look into how record deals are not always what you want them to be.\n\nThe acting was so good. It was like watching these guys in real life. Ice Cube was played by his son and he really got all the mannerisms down to a tee. It was uncanny.\n\nAnd it was cool to watch other rappers pop up in the movie with some rhymes to boot. Straight Outta Compton had me bopping my head. And even if you're not a fan of rap music, the story stands on its own with heart felt moments and great character relationships, be it good or bad.\n\nThere was never a boring moment.  Though, the final act played out a bit different from the rest. The first three quarters was more about the group and their goals. While the last part focused more on the individual aspect.\n\nBut I thought it was good all the way through.\n\nScore: 8.5/10 \nhttps://thelastwordstanding.blogspot.com/",

I was never a fan of the band personally, but despite this I was fascinated seeing these men come together and record the music that made them megastars, and said what so many wanted to say but were too afraid to do so. The movie succeeds in not portraying the central characters as pure thugs, but as a marginalised and oppressed minority who wrote and recorded songs that reflected their attitudes and take on life at the time. They were discriminated against, harassed and kicked around, and the best way they could retaliate was through their music. The 3 lead performances are all fantastic, each actor giving their take on the iconic rappers Eazy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, making each one memorable and understandable. It does go on a little long, and has a fair amount that could have been cut, as well as a fair amount that really out to have been included, if the historical facts I've read are true. But overall, while not the most revolutionary biopic ever filmed, S.O.C. has plenty of dynamic energy, a brutal story and plenty of entertainment value.

Sure, there were plenty of films that won best picture that I didn't think deserved it but, whatever, I could see why some people would think otherwise. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, on the other hand, was so utterly mediocre on every level it really baffled me. I bring this up because I feel the same way about STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Coming in at a very bloated 2.5 hours, SOC is in dire need of editing and streamlining. How this film scored an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes is a mystery. Perhaps those people were in a rush and could only see the first half of the film. \n\nSOC is so self-indulgent and self-important. Yes, we all know that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube were integral to the history of hip-hop and, yes, NWA's first album was breathtaking (I still remember my roommate and I playing that record over and over the first week I brought it home) but the film is so determined to remind everyone of this fact that it damages the storytelling. For example, there's a completely useless scene showing Ice Cube sitting in his living room, working on the screenplay for FRIDAY. Likewise, there's a small snippet that is supposed to dramatize the moment in which Dre discovers Snoop Dogg and they begin working on THE CHRONIC. I can see all the fan boys and girls going ooh and aah ... but as a piece of narrative storytelling, these moments are distracting. \n\nSomewhere inside this 2.5 behemoth is a remarkable story - perhaps one that more tightly focused on Easy E's rise and fall - but this ain't it.",

            "content": "A biopic is a genre I lean toward steering clear of, maybe because they so often are overly dependent on story, lacking in gravitas, or maybe because they don't always do their central figure justice.  As biographical tales prefer to tell the life stories of individuals with extraordinariness embedded in their reputation, to fail in capturing their weight is a major possibility.  It all can be presented with soundness and competence, but recurring is a problem of triviality - the idolization of an atypical human continues in the midst of cinematic sheen.\n\tWhich is why 2015's \"Straight Outta Compton,\" an exceptional biopic regarding the rise and fall of \"gangsta rap\" group N.W.A., is such an oddity.  As its focus is placed on a group of artists known better for their personas than for their character flaws, its greatest achievement is the way it transforms gods of the early hip-hop era into young men with chaotic personal lives supplemented by colossal talent.  The film does what all good biopics should - allow for us to become rapt in the lives of its non-fictional characters - but unexpected is its compassion.  Though packaged in visceral grit and telling street rawness, the exotic fantasies that come along with the visualization of the 1980s-'90s rap scene are only background noise.  More important is knowing the men behind the music, and how the industry, their egos, and their separate careers transformed them as people.  To us, Ice Cube isn't Ice Cube but O'Shea Jackson; Eazy-E is Eric Wright, and even Dr. Dre, presently the richest hip-hop artist alive, becomes Andre Young.\n\tTo strip these oft adulated men of their disparate statuses is not an easy thing, so we can hand it to screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, who look past the glitz and into the humanistic, and to director F. Gary Gray, whose authority guides \"Straight Outta Compton\" as it goes from intense to sensitive, from assured to exposed.  Why it wasn't more a part of the recent Academy Awards I hardly understand - though its subject matter might not have sat well with predominantly white voters, it is, nevertheless, a blistering piece, capable of bringing critics and audiences together with avid harmony.\n\tBut longevity speaks louder than awards, anyway, and the movie is destined to have a better shelf-life than most of its Oscar adored peers: in addition to its commiserative mastery, it is, more significantly, unpretentiously entertaining.  It covers the trials and tribulations of the members of its focal rap group, the controversial N.W.A., from their humble beginnings in 1986 to the death of the pivotal Eazy-E (portrayed by Jason Mitchell).  Most know of their place in popular culture - N.W.A. were connoisseurs of gangsta rap, represented through such classics as \"Fuck the Police\" - and while we see the conflicts that arose because of their abrasive nature, more concerning is them, not the contemptuousness that surrounded their name at their peak.  That dislike seems inconsequential now.\n\tWhat is vital, and most moving, is the way that these five young men (played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Corey Hawkins, Aldis Hodge, and Neil Brown, Jr.) found fame and fortune by drawing upon their own life experiences, amidst police brutality and a public that was decidedly split in their acceptance of them.  The first act of \"Straight Outta Compton\" is inarguably its finest, characterized by a distinguished portrayal of the group's inevitable Rise to the Top and several electrifying musical performances.\n\tIn truth, the film does lose a bit of its steam the more it goes on - two-and-a-half hours is a long time for any movie - but the majority of \"Straight Outta Compton\" is thrilling in every sense of the word.  I loved the performances, especially from Jackson, Jr., playing his father with impressive plausibility, and I love the way Herman and Berloff integrate social issues of the time, such as the Rodney King riots and the civil unrest within the titular Compton, to further the of-the-time relevance of N.W.A.  The sordid relationship with manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) is also well-crafted, and the turning up of fictionalized versions of Suge Knight, Tupac Shakur, and Snoop Dogg make for extraneous kicks.\n\tSo don't be skeptical regarding \"Straight Outta Compton\" due to a disdain for rap music or a lack of knowledge of its central group.  It's too effective, too heartfelt, to turn anyone away.  Even I, who knows or cares little of hip-hop, was enthralled.  It's a warts-and-all biopic with a discernible grip.  Watch it and see what I mean.",

You don't have to be an NWA fan to enjoy this flick.The acting was top notch and O'Shea Jr really is his father's son playing him with an air of not only intelligence but the gangster that so many had forgotten he once was. Obviously the facts aren't 100% and things have been omitted but still the gist of the story remains and is an entertaining one to say the least. Wish we got more into the lives of MC Ren & DJ Yella, but time was of the essence I am sure. While I know Suge Knight was an important player in this story I hated how much he was in the movie. He's such a scumbag but I get that's what we were supposed to feel.",

The performances are really good and the director does a great job at keeping the film moving and balancing the focus between the various subplots.  Additionally, the music is used quite effectively; covering the major hits of NWA and the various musical styles of its members.

I enjoyed the first half as it shows the abilities of each member and their love for what they do. The second half of the movie brings about the financial and creative differences the individuals experienced leading them to slowly separate from one another. For myself I enjoyed remembering the nineties when these events occurred. With excessive language and expletive music lyrics, some viewers may immediately be put off by this or the groups beliefs. Beyond those hurdles is a good documentary about a music group that started a movement and became part of pop culture history.

It's a film that both explores its subjects and also adds depth to ones' understanding of the \"gangsta rap\" genre and specifically the rise of N.W.A and, by extension, the careers of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and many others. For those we know little of the background, it will serve as a sort of history lesson, for those that are well versed, it will still undoubtedly satisfy with a film that seemingly does justice to its subject.\n\nThat it's an expansive film is undeniable. At nearly two and a half hours, the film seeks to compress a lot of time, and sometimes the transitions get a bit rough. All in all though, however, the film did a great job staying anchored in its characters and composed a movie that both educates the viewer but also unfolds skillfully- with genuine character development, and is a story that would be otherwise impactful even without the true life origins. It's bolstered by a very talented cast, which bring a lot of confidence and energy to their roles. Not only that, but the performances feel very authentic to the people they are portraying, perhaps one of the biggest measures of a good biopic.\n\nThe film is not without its problems, however. With so much compressed together, even with its bloated run time, it can be hard to keep track of the growing feuds, shifting of record labels, and all the infighting that seemingly plagued the group. The film's opening scene was astonishingly well done, transporting us to the harsh realities of Compton without preaching it to us-and yet the film never fully replicated any like moments. It was also, to be sure, a very one-sided story, essentially an apologist piece for a genre of music that stretches the boundaries of art. Its treatment of police was especially troubling. The animosity was very much real, yet the film takes that as license to paint with a broad and unfair brush.\n\nSolid.\n\n3.5/5 Stars",

I feel like all the acclaim and praise must be coming from people who are passionate about rap music and already care about their story, because this movie was extremely lackluster to me. It is the most stereotypical, unimaginative tale of a music group hitting it big. They record a big album, they become really famous, they overindulge in sex and drugs, they start to fight with each other, and then they break up. I just didn't feel that starting them out dealing with the racist police on the streets of Compton was enough of a differentiation to make this story unique from a hundred other stories like this one. Not that the film was all bad. There were moments where I was really connecting with the story, and I wanted to see what happened next (like the confrontation with the police in Detroit.) I also admire some of the actors, because they had some wide-ranging emotional beats to play and they were very good. Perhaps my biggest pet peeve about biopics like this is when they start visual name-dropping. The story that matters is the rise-and-fall of the relationship between these 5 guys, but then we have to stop and say \"Hey look, it's Snoop Dogg! That's right, they worked with him.\" or \"Remember that movie Friday, this is when they made it!\" Straight Outta Compton just did very little for me. While it is a good example of one of these biopics, it's not the kind of biopic I like to watch. But if you're a fan of the group, your opinion could be dramatically different.",

The movie seems to be working very hard to present everyone in a positive light. None of this is to say it is a bad movie, as it is pretty good. I have no history with the music or the artists really. I know of NWA, but it isn't really the kind of thing I was ever into. I think a long and comprehensive documentary would be far more fascinating than this movie, which is kind of muddled, just because it crams so much into it.

Mostly I think that because the character that is based on him in the movie is barely flawed and usually in the right always, when in reality he is kind of a shitty person. I teared up when Easy-E died of AIDS (oops spoilers!). I think this might have worked better as a miniseries because they seem to gloss over a lot of stuff. \"Oh no! D.O.C. was in a car accident, his career could be over!\" Next scene, he is in pristine condition getting ready to rap. Also, the ending seems like it's purposely meant to set up a sequel.

Because of the characters' rampant and inexcusable misogyny, I did find them rather inaccessible for most of the film, but the bleak portrayal of police violence against these men earned my deepest sympathies. Special mention goes to the following three actors: Jason Mitchell for his overall performance as Eazy-E, which becomes more nuanced as the film progresses; O'Shea Jackson Jr. for his consistently palpable rage during each of his performances; and to Lisa Renee Pitts in the all too minor role as Dr. Dre's mother Verna Young, a role that easily could have earned her major award nominations if only it were expanded.

Now maybe y'all that this movie is just all about gangsta sh*t and all about a rebellious rap group from the 80's to the 90's, but you have to watch it to believe me that this is so much more. \nSo Straight Outta Compton is a movie featuring the life of America's most dangerous group N.W.A (Niggaz with Attitude). I do not know much about rap, but I know Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy E, Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, and Aftermath records and all of the things that really happen in real life. And to portray it dramatically and how all these things put together? Just leaves you in awe! The emotion in the film was so deep I even cried. The story was great, the acting was so much more incredible. You can really see that these guys were Eazy, Cube, Dre. They were who they portray. Jason Mitchell as Eazy E? I mean why I haven't heard about this actor?! He was so great, it was my most memorable experience in this movie. \nWhat I like about this movie as well is the manifestation of self-expression. The movie really say it strong to the audience that you say what you want to say and you say what is wrong with the society. The rappers' story and the message behind it (which is the self expression and the truth behind what the government is trying to do to us) was overwhelming I could not lay my eyes off the movie.\n5 stars and my emotion tells me that after 20 minutes I wanna watch it again. If you think it does not deserve 5 stars, please tell me why. :) I'm out!",

Produced by both Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, the film definitely glorifies this time in their lives, but it's not too far-off from the truth and it's commendable in that right. The young cast embodies their real-life counter-parts exceptionally well with the stand-outs being the three main leads: Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, and O'Shea Jackson Jr playing Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube respectively, and O'Shea Jackson Jr impressed me the most; portraying his father must have been awkward as hell! The story follows the inception and eventual breakdown of the controversial rap group, N.W.A. as they made a huge splash in the hip hop world and then were systematically broken down by in-fighting and betrayals; we've seen these types of stories before, but it's handled with a bit more flavour here to keep it truly investing. The soundtrack is of course great, and seeing these guys perform all of the group's biggest hits on stage gets your blood pumping and you feel the impact their music carried. I watched the director's cut of the film which adds 20 minutes of footage, providing extra connecting pieces to some of the film's many subplots, though at nearly three hours, I didn't see all of the material on-screen as necessary. As a film fan first, and not at all a big fan of hip-hop/rap, I enjoyed this biopic a lot more than I thought I would as it had shadings of Boyz N The Hood (also starring Ice Cube) and I feel that it served its subjects very well with impressive acting and a mostly factual account of their time in N.W.A. Look out for the appearances of Snoop Dogg and Tupac (played by other people); you'll swear Tupac is still alive, this guy NAILS it!",

            "content": "Definitely one of the best of 2015, and another one of my favorites. It's a biopic about NWA and therefore we get the life stories (more or less) of Eazy E, Ice Cube, and Dr. Dre (It's almost like 4 bio pics rolled into one.....how cool is that?).      O'Shea Jackson Junior plays Ice Cube, Corey Hawkins is Dr. Dre, and Jason Mitchell is Eazy E. All three are phenomenal in their roles and are real discoveries. Paul Giamatti is stellar as NWA's good hearted but somewhat shady manager Jerry Heller. We also get cool supporting performances from Keith Stanfield as Snoop Dogg and Marc Rose as Tupac.  I will say the film is 2 hours and 31 minutes, and it does feel pretty long but it's all in the service of one of the finest, most powerful, moving and informative films of 2015 (I know I definitely learned some stuff I never knew before, and I'm all the better for it. You want to know how the phrase 'Bye Felicia' came about? You'll learn that and a  whole lot more in this film). Some of the best scenes in film in 2015 are in Straight Outta Compton, as well as some of the best performances of 2015 as well. It's a damn shame that the film was basically robbed at the Oscars (It was only nominated for Best Original Screenplay when it should have popped up in several categories IMO). Straight Outta Compton is sure to please any music lover, lover of bio pics, or lovers of great films in general. It's one of the ultimate underdog stories. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

I didn't going in, but there was something about the trailer (likely the mix of realism coinciding with racial equality issues and the current anti-police movement) that mesmerized me, so I couldn't miss Straight Outta Compton.\n\nThe film was incredible. My jaw was on the floor in regards to the talent and casting for the entire film; the actors are almost indistinguishable from the actual crew, which you realize as soon as the credits and real news footage starts rolling. Absolutely spot-on. Even though O'Shea Jackson Jr. is Ice Cube's actual son - I would say it's Jason Mitchell's Eazy E that steals the show (as he should, as the film is dedicated to E's memory). \n\nAs for the other parallels between the problems of the mid-80?s RE: gang violence and unfair discrimination, it's eerie how police brutality hasn't seemed to change. Police are just as brutal as ever, especially when dealing with minorities and the lower class. It's disgusting and it's time something changed. \n\nSo happy this film turned out to be an excellent biopic. Don't miss your chance to see it in theaters - you want that surround sound mix for these landmark songs being written and recorded.",

            "content": "Anyone with even a passing interest in hip hop history will have all the preliminary information they will need heading into Straight Outta Compton. \nN.W.A. invented not only the sub-genre known as 'gangsta rap', but hip hop as the world would know it throughout its heyday in the early to mid-90's. Their influence can still felt today, though the Kendrick Lamar's and Lupe Fiasco's have broken about as far away from the original 'g-funk' aesthetic as they can and still be considered in the same genre of music. \n\nIn Straight Outta Compton, director F. Gary Gray paints a picture of 'America's most dangerous neighbourhood' in Compton, California, and how it moulded and inspired the five young men who would use it as a jumping off point to create a whole musical empire. It's a film that is a snapshot of South Central Los Angeles at a time when it was at its bleakest, culminating with the Rodney King trial and the subsequent riots that pulverized an already weakened community. \n\nThis movie is really well made. Gray has spent a fair portion of his career putting South Central Los Angeles up on the screen, from the hilarious (Friday) to the grittily violent (Set It Off) to a host of music videos for some of hip hop's elite, including one of N.W.A.'s driving creative musical forces, Ice Cube. He places the eye of his lens on the streets of Compton like he's lived there all his life. When the group breaks big and heads out on tour, he photographs the concerts and out of control hotel room parties with equal parts fly on the wall voyeurism and in your face intimacy. When the group split up due to, what else, fights about money, he photographs the various members in wide open spaces on the properties of their massive homes, underlining their isolation from each other by highlighting the spoils of their separate successes. The end result is that it all feels very real. You buy it, from the dilapidated, worn out ghetto streets, to the multi-million dollar mansions in the Hollywood Hills. And, more importantly, you buy the journey. To be fair, it does at times feel like the Cube & Dre show. Which makes sense as both Cube and Dre are producers and were probably on set a lot to ensure authenticity. And the group's less dominating members DJ Yella and MC Ren feel like background characters much of the time. But that may have been the case in real life as well. But, most importantly, Eazy-E, who passed away in 1995, can't tell his side of things. Which is unfortunate as he was essentially the leader of the group during its dominating phase (the group was originally called 'Eazy-E and N.W.A.') \nIt forces you to wonder how much of the story was tweaked in Cube and Dre's favour. \n\nThe film packs a lot of history into two and a half hours. And while there's nothing short about two and a half hours of movie, it never once feels like it overstays its welcome. The story is at times intense, at others exhilarating, occasionally frustrating, but always completely entertaining. Yes it will be more exciting for those of us with a vetted interest in hip hop and its history, and even more so for those of us who know much of this story already (like the guy sitting behind me who had the obnoxious habit of predicting each scene before it played. Thanks buddy). But I still came home and recommended the film to my wife, who has very little interest in hip hop and even less interest in hip hop from that era. Because a good story is a good story and Straight Outta Compton is most certainly that. \n\nThe acting in this movie will play no small part in its success and can't be overstated. Of course, the funnest and most pivotal choice in this regard was to cast Ice Cube's son to play his father. Not only do they look a lot alike (a lot alike), but his mannerisms and cadence of speech are a dead ringer as well. It's a fantastic performance. The actors that play the rest of N.W.A. aren't quite as doppelganger, but they're pretty damn close. And it doesn't take long before you stop comparing the actors to the real thing and just buy them for who they portray. And then we've got Paul Giamatti, who plays the weaselly manager, basically the exact same role he played in the recent Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy. He's great, he always is, but seriously Paul, that's enough greasy bad guys for a while, time to stretch your wings a bit. \n\nA movie about what is essentially The Beatles of hip hop must be a lot of things, but above all it must be respectful of the music and the legacy. Straight Outta Compton is both, but it's more than that, it's a bridge between history and modern times that highlights the necessity of a group like N.W.A. in that particular place, at that particular time. And it highlights the necessity of likeminded groups today. I'm not saying we need another police baiting, anti-authoritarian rap group to encourage the masses to 'f**k tha police'. But we do need another artist or group of artists to come along and tell it like it is, whether the more conservative masses want to hear it or not. In some ways, surprisingly little has changed in certain areas of Los Angeles and other parts of America since the time that N.W.A. first dropped their gritty street poetry on the world. Which makes this film as relevant as it is entertaining. And part of what makes it one of the best films of the year.",

But Hollywood doesn't care and has decided to make a dramatic biopic of three young hustlers from south central Los Angeles who changed the face of hip hop for nearly a decade. \n\nThe film starts out with introductions of all the main characters and their troubles.  Easy E is having to deal with drug runners who owe him money, and then trying to escape a police raid with a SWAT tank, Ice Cube has to deal with gangsters coming onto his school bus on the way to class, and holding everyone up with guns for flashing gang signs out the window, and Dr. Dre has to ... listen to his mom complain that he missed his job interview. \n\nDr. Dre doesn't take that stupid bullshit like no punk bitch, so he packs up his records and goes to his buddies place to crash.  It turns out (spoiler), these guys are all actually talented musicians!  Well, except for Easy E, he's just a drug dealer.  Anyways, the movie picks up from there, and gets into rise of the group and their attempts to get their fair cat due to the shaky business dealings they have between both a shady Jewish music producer, and a shady ... uhh... Suge Knight. \n\nIf you like rap music, and especially early 90s rap music, this movie is like stepping into a time machine and seeing all your favorite stars.  The costumes, locations, and cars are all completely on point, and you feel like you've set foot in 90s LA.  To help really sell the atmosphere, you have a fantastic soundtrack with NWA, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, 2Pac, Tears for Fears, George Clinton, Parliament, and Roy Ayers that compliments the 90s visuals with a 90s mix tape of fantastic jams. That us until about 10 minutes into the movie, when a song from what sounds like 2015 comes on, with vocals from some Rihanna clone, yanking you dick-first out of your blissful suspension of disbelief and back into sober reality.  This isn't a big deal if you decide to make a period movie with a contemporary soundtrack, but when 95% of your soundtrack is songs you would hear in the 90s and one song arbitrarily is from post 2010 (and sounds like it), then that's just distracting as fuck. \n\nThis movie isn't anything stunning when it comes to camera work, but it does have a couple of creative shots.  Shots for revealing characters are well placed, often giving you sneaking glances of supporting roles like Snoop Dogg, Tupac, and Suge Knight, when you first meet them.  Aside from that though, the movie sort of feels like it was shot by a music video crew, showcasing parties, cars and the rock n' roll lifestyle that came to dominate the main character's lives.  Whether or not that's effective is depending on the viewer, but for me, it worked pretty well. \n\nThere is a major problem in this film, and it becomes apparent about 40 minutes or so into the film.  The pace.  It's completely fucked up, and feels like you're watching a movie on VHS and a little kid is sitting at the controls and playing with the fast forward button.  Scenes that I wish would build a little more, and histories that I'd like to see play out, are rushed through, and there are points where numerous things get glossed over and then have to either be explained through dialogue later, or you're just expected to not wonder where certain characters came from, or why certain events happened the way they did.  It's a real shame too, because the plot for this movie was surprisingly rich, and the acting was a cut above what I was expecting. \n\nTL;DR - 7/10 \nIt's hard to make a strong, memorable biopic.  Straight Outta Compton does much better than it should have, and makes for an engaging watch, but it falls flat on being memorable due to problems with pacing.  Still, if you're a fan of the subject matter, this movie is a must see.",

Gary's direction was not \"outta this world\" but it was very commendable on how he provided a integral perspective of the group's history, and its biographical tunes (I mean, tones) on Dre, Cube, and Eazy. The ensemble acting from young thespians O'Shea Jackson as Cube, Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E was sweet music to my ears; well, maybe not \"sweet\" but definitely hardcore effective. Moreover, Paul Giamatti was his usual brilliant self as group manager Jerry Heller; and the hell with all of you who think Giamatti is too loud! I guess that angry rap is getting to me. Anyways, I think it's time to \"rap\" this review up, before you get straight outta reading this (if you haven't already). Just keeping it straight! Outta here!",

Like I said, not a fan here, and yet I was able to connect to the characters, their conflicts, and the times. While there are plenty of rough edges in the story as presented, surely many have been sanded smooth in the manner of \"The Rose\", which never officially purported to tell the story of Janis Joplin, but did anyway. What SOC does is tell the story of a generation of justifiably angry black men from South LA who found a way to fight back, and sparked a revolution in consciousness that is still relevant in the era of Black Lives Matter. They also, like many stars before them, got rich and got messed up as a result. A Star is Born all over again. Dig it.",

            "content": "Topical and informative.  So this is an origins story of the rap group N.W.A., showing their rise to stardom, and the fracture that occurred in the group when egos and loyalties came into question.  I don't know if you are aware, but it has been a fantastic year for old school hip hop movies.  If you heeded my advice and took the time to watch Dope, you already know that we've got creative minds doing great things while underscoring stories with classic hip hop songs, and with Straight Outta Compton, we've got another surefire winner.  As previously stated, I used to big into hip hop and rap music, and while I don't listen to it as much anymore, there is still a part of me that appreciates a movie that can utilize its featured music to its full potential. I never got into the whole East Coast vs. West Coast movement, but I was well aware of its existence.  With Straight Outta Compton, I feel like I actually learned something about how this all went down.  It's more than just a music movie, this is an origins story, and you get to see where these artists call came from.  You buy it completely, and this is largely due to the fact that they have captured the looks of everybody down to the tiny details, and they truly become the people they are portraying, embodying their respective characters entirely.  This can't be all that surprising on all fronts, though, as they got Ice Cube's son to play Ice Cube.  The only truly recognizable face here is Paul Giamatti, so it makes it even easier to buy into these actors you haven't seen before.  I think that Straight Outta Compton lives up to all of the phenomenal things that you've likely already heard about it.  With all these numerous stories of police brutality against minorities (too many to cite), this couldn't come at a time that is more apropos, and it doesn't flinch, showing you the gritty side of what happened.  This is a group that is angry about being oppressed, and they want their voices to be heard.  In fact, it really does a great job of showing how cyclical this is; the album referenced in the title came out in 1988, and we are still facing similar issues in 2015.  Straight Outta Compton is put together with inspiration, and the energy about it is palpable.  With classic hip hop music tying it all together, this is one of the fastest 2 1/2 hours you can spend watching a movie.  I almost never say this, but I wouldn't have minded it being even longer.  Even though this is mainly about music, the stakes feel as high as can be.  This is a movie that has a whole lot to say, and in this day and age, that's far better than most.",

Their portrayals as well as the director, F. Gary Gray's direction in the movie was excellent. One of the greatest biopics made, and possibly one of THE best biopics on musical artists, it even got NWA into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, finally.",

            "content": "If there's one word to describe this movie, it's \"comprehensive.\" A mistake that most biopics make is to focus on one part of the subject's life as if it's representative of the whole. But the story of N.W.A. cannot be told within the constraints of the group's tenure: the breakup of the band has to be explored since some of the best music of the past quarter century was a result of the group's breakup. However, the movie's need to include everything related to the group stretched into the periphery (seriously, did we really need to see Ice Cube typing the screenplay of \"Friday\" in his word processor?), as as such, it lasted a little too long. But as far as music biopics go, \"Straight Outta Compton\" is a definitive one. More than any genre of music, the impact of gangsta rap (especially West Coast) has been undeniable. \n\nI never really bought Eazy-E as a front man; his voice was just a little too high, and his stature was just a little too meek. I was more of a fan of the technical expertise of Dr. Dre, and this movie (produced by both Dre and Ice Cube) makes Dre a Mozart with composing beats for hip hop. However, Jason Mitchell's performance as E lends a convincing air of authority as man who was able to rally a group together to become a team.",
