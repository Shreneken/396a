They knew what they wanted to do with this movie the passion seeps through the screen in the most testosterone filled way I've ever seen. Few say that the plots too basic and the lore isn't explained at all, yeh and? The film makers are leaving it up to interpretation, their showing glimpses rather than telling all. Its like drawing on dotted lines to complete the drawing it's why we're shown glimpses of Max's past we don't fully know what happened but it's up to us to put the pieces together. It says a lot without showing too much throughout this entire movie. What else can I say that hasn't already been said? this is a perfect action movie the best of the 2010s in my opinion.",

Mad Max 2 was the post nuclear action drama pinnacle, purely for the impact it made by literally spawning the genre. It was often copied but ironically only ever equalled once and that was by this. Its as though the pinnacle of the genre was given a massive dose of steroids and told you said its mother was a whore. A true, snarling, angry, spiritual successor that surpasses everything before it in terms of sheer spectacle. Utterly magnificent and easily sets a new gold standard in terms of live action carnage. The cast all do their jobs superbly. Theron layers her performance beautifully and Hardy provides a near monosalabic, worldweary, yet expressively wide physical performance. . wonderful. Very close to the top of my all time favourite films list and bang at the top for post armageddon dystopia. Treat yourself, watch Mad Max 2 and then this for the ride of your life.\n\"Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!\"",

This movie was strongly hyped and regarded highly but I wanted to see the original films first. Within ten minutes I realized something, this isn't a sequel, but a reboot, with a new Mad Max, like the Daniel Craig Bond movies replaced the previous Bond movies.\n\nA dystopian world that ran low on resources had led Max Rockatansky to become a once respectable lawman into a road warrior in a post-apocalyptic world who gets caught up in a fight for his life. Captured and used for resources gets involved in a violent warlord's attempt to reclaim his offspring in five innocent expecting women taken from his care by a vicious but courageous female general known as Furiosa. Max escapes from the warlord only to run afoul of Furiosa's mission but slowly but steadily gain each other's trust. But the warlord will not give up until he obtains his offspring as Furiosa and Mad Max take the fight to the warlord.\n\nI got to say I loved the previous Mad Max movies with all my heart, and just as Sean Connery will always be James Bond to me, Mel Gibson will always be Mad Max. Tom Hardy is fine but he doesn't have Mel's intensity and charisma. The real star of this movie is Charlize Theron who is amazing as an Amazonian-type character Furiosa. Not as feral as I heard described, but smart and brave as well as strong. George Miller should make more movies with her. All things considered a good movie, but not as great as the previous movies.",

Mad Max Fury Road follows a group of unknown people of each other, trying to find a way to fulfill hopes and dreams. While I have not seen the original 3 movies, the story is still really understandable, however I must say, I definitely was a bit lost the first 10-15 minutes. Mad Max Fury Road has some of the most impressive practical effects ever put to screen, combine that was sublime VFX and you get some of the most gripping action ever. While Mad Max Fury Road has build its reputation of being an action movie, the movie certainly has so much more to offer storywise. George Miller his direction is fantastic, very stylisch editing and colors, but still remaining it grounded. The movie has some top notch make-up and hairstyling, score and incredible sound design and mixing. Mad Max Fury Road is definitely one I will be revisiting in the future, however then I am going to check the older movies out as well!",

Of course, the dust storm scene has CGI, but the motorcycles, the monster trucks, the explosions, the running back and forth on the big-rig: all of is done as real stunts, and they look great. Best action movie, best chase film, ever made. Just sit back and enjoy. And don't worry about understanding the dialog. There isn't any.  ;)",

Otherwise, don't entitle the movie Mad Max! He's amazing to watch and very entertaining but it seems to me he took a backseat in this one. Nothing against Theron but now I can understand why there may have been some conflict between the two of them. Theron is an amazing performer but I was hoping to see more of Hardy. Just my opinion! Kudos should go out to the rest of the cast, though. They were all wonderful and I can understand Theron being frustrated making this movie because all I saw was desert and more desert. I would have gone berserk! However, I would hope that Mel Gibson would be proud of Hardy for what he was able to contribute to this movie!",

The action is of course the highlight, and it's full of unique and memorable moments, just nothing that can redeem the pretty basic story of a point to point end goal, as everything that aren't fights or battles feel like exposition for the fights, leading to the ending and any attempt at emotion feeling lost as it comes off as too forced and I just can't care much about the characters other than Max and Furiosa.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nTom Hardy and Charlize Theron are two wonderful forces of nature, bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning. Mel Gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role, but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what Max is all about. Hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive. He has that hard look, driven, and with all of his priorities set to survival mode. He recognizes that you can't sit still here, and there is no sense in worrying if you want to live.\n\nHe finds himself prisoner of a set deviants/mutants that plan on killing him for sport. Max soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before. At first, he observes everything around him, as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of. In the opening scenes, he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched Earth, with lighting storms, sand storms, wind storms, and just about anything else that can be thrown at him. He pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames, but in \"Fury Road\", this is just the beginning, and in the hands of George Miller, a man who is around 70 years old, we get what was just a promise in the previous films.\n\nThe universe is fully developed, with just about every hellish detail up on the screen, every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions, reactions, and powerful images from what his camera captures, a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film. As I said before, the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable, breathtaking, and utterly satisfying.\n\nIn this film, vehicles will burn, crash, tumble, fly, and spit fire continuously, and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release. There is power, disgust, hate, hunger, envy, and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen, even the angelic wives/prisoners are not empty shells. One can feel every emotion by letting Miller's sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration, not believing that what we have seen is possible. Here CGI doesn't overpower and sterilize the content. Many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources. Here Miller works with what he knows best, but he still uses CGI to increase the power of what one sees in this movie. Very little looks fake, and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of money.\n\nMiller has given us a film that captures the magic of movie-making, the realization of its power. This is the masterpiece many dream of, where nothing and no one is spared. Every penny is showcased one way or another. There are no egos to satisfy, just goals to achieve, and these are accomplished. Miller should, like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves. Much has been made of a gimmicks recently. \"Birdman\" tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh reality,and it sorely failed. Here is film which entertains, never bores, and certainly is able to mix intelligence, the hells which some beings carry in their souls, and the possibility that a future like Max's might not be that distant. The film is not fantasy, it's the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be coming.\n\nI never understood why some films had a certainly look, but they lacked vision, charm, or anything remotely intelligent, and the disappointment hurt. No one will walk away from \"Fury Road\" because Miller respects the audience, understand that unless some is \"real\" and we are able to somehow relate, the experience will be meaningless. \"Fury Road\" combines the best of acting and craftsmanship. It's pure, powerful, and it delivers a visceral punch, making the best use of everyone of our senses, giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary. Miller hasn't copied anyone, instead he has set the bar high for many, and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film, something with much imagination and power, something that is quite remarkable, considering how Hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics and/or surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies. Here is a film that proves that it's possible to dream, even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on Earth.",

It's so well written and beautifully delivered and it goes so well with what's actually happening on the screen. What a great start to an even greater film!\n\nI think one of the most unique and intriguing things about Mad Max: Fury Road as a whole is the way it's filmed. It's beautifully shot but it's very different from other movies. There's times where it'll speed up, and while the dialogue is at normal speed, the scene in the background is at 1.5x speed. Super unique and I love it!\n\nThis cinemaTOGRAPHY! Good heavens I'm in love with the colors and the angles and the shaky effect… gosh it is so visually pleasing. When I first watched this I didn't quite have my \"directors eye\" (as some might call it) but upon rewatch I'm absolutely in love with the camerawork in every scene. I can't get over this cinematography. The colors are just so stunning, especially when it switches from orange to blue. So so great.\n\nThe jumps and transitions between scenes is perfection. The pacing overall is actually amazing and I'd say that this is the most intricately timed film I've seen which makes watching super enjoyable.\n\nI'm also in love with this score. It's at times rock music which gets you hyped but at other times it's an orchestra playing a somber song… perfectly split between exciting and devastating. The music itself is extremely emotional and will bring you into what the characters are feeling whether it be excitement or trauma. Let me reiterate this, the score is phenomenal. There's simply no other word to describe it.\n\nAn underrated(?) part of this film are the VFX! Every time a car would blow up or blood would spill I was blown away by how real it looked. You can tell a lot of time was spent focusing on the visual aspects but especially the visual effects!\n\nNo one could direct this the way George Miller did. Mad Max: Fury Road could only be written, produced, and directed by a mad man, and George Miller proved his worth. Arguably better than its predecessors, Fury Road is revolutionary. It's a film that could bring you into the realm of film, as it is perfect in near every aspect. It will make you love cinematography, will show you what a films score can really be, provides a wonderful example of the different forms of acting, and so much more. I somehow forgot how good this film really is. Absolutely amazing, 10/10!",

It takes its simple premise and executes it nearly flawlessly and I love all of the female empowerment throughout. Like, yeah, I'm completely sold that a dozen badass women are gonna come destroy capitalism and save the world. I'm all for it; let's go already.\nThis movie is like watching Olympic gymnasts try to murder each other, which is basically exactly what it is. It's extremely action-heavy, but all of the choreography is so unique and well-done that it's incredibly engaging. The battles between characters are ridiculous and impractical, but the movie makes the world feel alien enough that it doesn't stand out as distracting, just as freaking awesome. The violence is brutal but oh-so-satisfying. The set pieces are all really impressive and each location feels different, despite having a fairly consistent desert backdrop.\nIt has a few cliches, like how the main characters refuse to die despite having concussions and broken bones that could have killed them dozens of times over. Injuries also seem to heal themselves in a matter of minutes, allowing our heroes to continue the fight when they should be immobilized at best. This takes away some of the gritty realism (which sounds ridiculous for this movie, I know) and ultimately hampers a bit of the experience. Also, as much as I appreciate the practical effects and lack of CGI, the occasional moments of CGI feel very out of place.\nThat being said, I still love this movie and the visuals will never fail to amaze me.

The people in this movie are so detached from humanity yet the movie never explained how humans wavered so far in the first place. Also, this movie is predictable especially the third act. This film has an interesting premise and does a good job world building but most of the movie is just car chase after car chase after car chase. When the actors and actresses are able to do their thing, that is when this movie is at its best even though we don't get much of it. As an action movie, it does what action movies are supposed to do in terms of action sequences, but it was not my cup of tea and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this way.",

I was in awe at how they were able to film these long sequences of car chase in the desert. \n\nThe first half was unrelenting. Two major action sequences made for an intense and fast-moving experience. The editing that focused on the face of the characters created the sense of intensity and craziness. The second half was pretty much the same thing and I was still amazed at the incredible work put into these sequences. \n\nMy only problem was that at the middle, the movie slowed down, which was fine initially. However, I felt it took a bit too long. I honestly didn't care much for the characters, and just wanted the action. Therefore, the emotion wasn't too much there. \n\nOverall, one of the best and relentless action movies that entertaining me from the start to finish. It was quite a fury road indeed. 9/10",

I went into this movie having not seen any previous Mad Max movies and the movie plays out as if the audience is already well aware of Max's backstory (including a sub plot with a hallucination of a girl which I still don't get). Since the last movie in the series came out in 1985, I was hoping that backstory would be re-established (seriously, a 5-10 minute flash back at the beginning of the movie would've been awesome). Instead you are dropped into the movie and it took 20 minutes before I was really hooked. I feel that one piece alone would've helped my movie experience incredibly. All that aside, it's was still a great movie and I look forward to the next installment. I will probably go back and watch the old ones as well. If you are planning on watching this movie it is very well worth it but I suggest you try to get the backstory first.",

Max does barley any fighting at all compared to the original 3 and the only action that is in it is people chucking explosive spears at cars. THATS IT! maybe 1 scene with Max using his shotgun or Furiosa using a pistol or something. Basically the film is drive to point A, get spears chucked at them, reach point B, realise they got to go back to point A, drives back to point A, gets hit by more spears, reaches point A again, frees people. there ya go thats the film. \n\nAnd I love the actors and actresses in this film but Max isn't Max anymore. He just grunts and nods and has zero character. Fanboys will say he doesn't say much in the originals but if you watch them again you will see not only are you wrong but there is so much story to him in the originals that even his grunts or nods mean a lot more in those films then the words Max finally gets to utter in this film. Tom Hardy could be a great successor to Mel Gibson but the writing of the character ruined it.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a complete chaos orchestrated by human beings in their most ambiguous insanity in a post-apocalyptic world. George Miller created an extremely fascinating, perverse, and brutal work, portraying a world where people are at their emotional, physical, and especially mental limits. The first feature, 1979's Mad Max, came with a somewhat daring proposal, where the focus would be on unbridled action in an Australia where the streets were taken by people and their vehicles in a state of madness, and at the same time that Max (played by Mel Gibson), a police officer respected by his comrades and the city where he works, sees himself with his ideals coming to the fore when he goes through an experience that will shake his life forever.\nWith the original trilogy finished in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Mad Max - Beyond the Thunder Dome) in 1985, it was 28 years before the filming of the new feature started, which started in July 2012 in Namibia, and was released in 2015. There was an expectation coming from a director like George Miller, but as images and trailer were being released, it became a work with great potential, and this was realized with its release, only the maximum potential of everything was raised. what was expected.\nThe experience of experiencing (or rather saying \"witnessing\") this feature in a movie theater, was certainly one of the best things of that year. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best films of 2015, and of the past decade, the biggest and best action film in the history of cinema.",

But because of some issues with the plot and some inconsistency with the action, Mad Max Fury Road is nothing more than a fun action movie with some issues you have to overlook on purpose in order to enjoy it.\nSpoiler Alert. \nGasoline has always been at the heart of the battles in the wasteland in the Mad Max movies. In this one, the battle centers around some women and ultimately, water. But the truck that they are hauling is full of mother's milk and although it works as a concept in service to the theme, it does little to build any tension whatsoever. I don't think anyone really cares about the milk. It's just...there. And so the only reason they are hauling that huge as truck is because...they all fit in it? Speaking of which I still don't think I understand Max's motivation to help Furiosa and the other pretty ladies out. And so like the milk in the truck Max is also...just there. \nThose problems aside the movie features some really awesome action. Lots of explosions. And it all looks great. There is a hue cast over everything by the sun that looks so nice. Some shots in this movie are jaw dropping, even the subtler ones. But there is a slight problem with the action that ultimately had me take away one star. It's not quite consistent. At one point, during an action sequence, in which a lot is happening, I noticed that one of the ladies stabbed a guy in the face with some spare bullets she grabbed off the dash of the truck. Have you ever in your life seen someone get stabbed with bullets? It's just not possible because bullets aren't sharp enough nor long enough. Little moments like this ruin the gravity and validity of the action. There's not many of these moments, maybe just one, but with the issues mentioned earlier, it becomes hard to justify this film as something other than just a fun action movie with some issues.",

No doubt about it, the most creative movie I've watched in years.\n\nThe car builds are amazingly crude and complex. Each one with names and personality of its own. Real crashes with real cars. And man, what awesome stunt work this movie have. Fully functioning cars, mechanics and bikes. Music leaded by the excellent blind guitar/bass player and the fellows of the percussion, that begins only when they are close. Great acting from every one of the cast, lead and support. Charismatic and believable characters. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are two equals in every way. Power, strength, appearance, will, reason. One the lone survivor and the other a savior.\n\nCome on! Writing this down makes me want to see it again. Witness the madness that the post-apocalyptic has become. See the war boys praising the lord V8. The aquacola waterfall. And the survival of men.

            "content": "Mad Max: Fury Road tells an important and relevant story to one of the biggest long run challenges the world has to face, extreme scarcity of resources. In this fictional world, humanity is enslaved under a tyrant warlord named Joe and his gang of war boys. Joe keeps all of the worlds water for himself, and exploits his slaves for breastmilk and children from some of the women as well as draining blood from universal donors like Max. Max meets up with the female driver and warrior Furiosa as she attempted to flee from the oppressive society to the greenplace safehaven with all of the women Joe enslaved as his childbearing wives. Unfortunately and quite expectedly, the greenplace no longer existed as Furiosa remembered as it was now a swamp. So of course this means Max and Furiosa will face Immortan Joe head on to end his tyranny, and Joe's death is at the hands of Furiosa in the end.\n\n\tDelving into a deeper analysis of the film we see there is a lot going on here besides impressive CGI and the anticipated explosions of a generic action movie. The story is interesting because it deals with the issue of scarce resources after a nuclear world disaster, which is a reasonable fear considering the Cold War and rise of nuclear arsenals in powerful nations. Due to the depletion of resources, and most importantly water, Joe was able to hold power by constructing a power dynamic where he possess all of the water and therefore everyone must obey him in order to live. We see him waste water through an extravagant waterfall which the common people are supposed to collect in a bucket as it falls, as Joe seems to remain apathetic towards the finite resources. This is the reason we want Furiosa and Max to succeed so badly. While their escape to the greenplace might have been an surface level satisfactory ending to the film, it doesn't really solve the problem. We need Furiosa to succeed for some inner peace and a sense of true resolution. She is the only woman warrior in the society as the rest are under the slavery and oppression of Immortan Joe, which gives us another reason to cheer for her. Furiosa being the individual to kill Immortan Joe highlights this dynamic, as we see one of the women of this society that treats females as physical things rise up and literally put an end to her authoritarian oppressor. A large feminist theme stood out to me throughout this movie, however despite being an action movie, Mad Max: Fury Road is rich with several themes and a conversation sparking social commentary about the moral rights and worth of humans as well as women.",

            "content": "Fast and Furiosa: A Review of Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is a film that starts out fast and never slows down. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland of the world. Mad Max is captured by war boys owned by Immortan Joe, the antagonist of the film. The film follows the journey of the two protagonists, Max, and a woman named Furiosa, on their quest to free the five wives from Immortan Joe's control. Much of the film occurs on the Fury Road, a passageway through the wasteland of the Earth. This film is fast, hot, and chaotic. \n\nThis film was brought to us by Warner Brothers in 2015 and is directed by George Miller and is an example of the \"Young Woman From The Provinces\" archetype. Furiosa escapes the grips of Immortan Joe with his five wives in search of \"The Green Place\", a place full of hope and prosperity amongst a wasteland. Furiosa wants to free the women from a life of sex enslavement. Mad Max also escapes his captors and aids the women on their dangerous quest for freedom.\n\nOne tool George Miller uses effectively in this film is cinematography. The camera angles and shots of the high-speed chase are award-worthy. One scene in particular depicts Furiosa coming to terms with the fact that \"The Green Place\" has turned into a wasteland. Her anguish and defeat are captured perfectly in this scene as she falls to her knees and the wind stirs up the sand around her and lens flare is used. This film also uses rock-and-roll music predominantly as the soundtrack. This choice effectively conveys the chaos and speed of this film. \n\nImagery is another tool used effectively in this film. Immortan Joe is depicted as disgusting, ugly, and rotting. This matches his greed, misogyny, and cruelty. Whereas the wives are depicted as beautiful and embody purity. However, graphic imagery and violence is overused at times and seems to detract from the overall message of the film. The stunts and explosions are still impressive nevertheless. \n\nGeorge Miller is able to convey a message about gender roles in society and socioeconomic divisions in the backdrop of a high-speed action film. Immortan Joe's greedy control of the earth's limited water supply shows how the wealthy control the majority of resources in our society. Additionally, the women in this film are treated as property. Women are depicted as useful only for their reproductive abilities and men are depicted as vehicles of war or misogynist dictators. The ultimate defeat of Immortan Joe symbolizes the downfall of misogyny and sexism in society.\n\nAlthough this film is certainly entertaining, the storyline and plot are a bit confusing and chaotic. The film has little to no exposition and begins as bizarre and obscure right of the bat. Viewers are left to play catch up to figure out what is going on as the film progresses. However, unlike many other Sci-Fi and Fantasy films, George Miller successfully conveys a social commentary amongst the backdrop of a high speed thriller. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars.",

The protagonist/ antagonist relationship is obvious in this movie, but what is not clear (from a person with no introduction or understanding of Mad Max) is the situation in which the people find themselves in. Furiosa, being the young woman from the providence, finds herself starring as the guiding light for others to follow. Uniquely, we find that the power relationship between men and women is not as straight-forward as it might seem, as the side of the antagonist is guided by men but dependent upon women. The protagonist's side is made of women but characterized by Mad Max and Furiosa's journey. \nThe feminist perspective the movie highlights the strong male dominance that this world portrays. They call water \"aqua-cola\" but depend on milk for strength and maintaining health, they call this \"mothers milk.\" Furiosa can be slanted as the mother of five as she rebels from her duties of driving a war-rig to guide these young women to \"a green place\" likely referring to green pastures or a better place. \nAnother scene that highlights the importance of females in this movie is the scene of the sniper rifle. When one bullet remains in the rifle, Max hands it over to Furiosa as she only needs one shot to take out the followers. \nHowever, power dynamics exist strongly in Mad Max. Two scenes highlight this directly, women are chained up to be milked like cows for the service of the men who fight. And, the entire movie (based on my perception of the movie) is about the antagonist tribe trying to recollect the wives to preserve their survival. Resources seem to be the only thing that matters in this movie, as it is set in a post-apocalyptic world.\nOverall, the film is unclear to someone new to the Mad Max universe. Who is the young girl that Max keeps having flashbacks of? Many questions not answered.",

And I can tell you, even without dangling chains, squeaky spikes plastered all over the exterior and modifications that put the motor right behind your ears, it's impossible to have a normal conversation in a junk rescued car, there's no way those soldiers could hear their mobile metal fest.\n\nIn practice, that truck only served the purpose of giving away their location.\n\n3 Biker grannies... I would've bought one biker grannie in a big gang, because there's always one trigger happy octogenarian who enjoys riding motorbikes, right?\n\nBut so many biker grannies with enough upper body strength to control a big bike with one hand while aiming, shooting and withstanding recoil with the other, all of that mid-jump, without any impairment usually found among that age group like high blood pressure, back pains, arthritis or shaky hands?\n\nWatching all those old women jumping around the dunes like a team of red bull \"x fighters\" was more than what my suspension of disbelief could handle.\n\n4 Why is Joe the bad guy?\n\nSeriously, after a post apocalyptic scenario, he was able to build a shelter big enough to securely house an entire town, he found drinking water and designed a system to preserve it, built an army to defend his settlement and organized his people to create all sorts of low tech monuments to ingenuity, like his human powered elevator.\n\nDespite all the poor living conditions they had, their people had it better than other settlements, and definitely way better than the alternative of dying alone in the radioactive wasteland.\n\nJoe had commercial arrangements with neighboring settlements, and with that, he set society back in motion.\n\nAnd how they repay him?\n\nFuriosa betrays him and kidnaps the rest of his wives, one of them insisted on going back, but her captors, insisting in the \"we're rescuing you\" narrative, denied her freedom.\n\nJoe was a man who spared no resources on rescuing his family, and he was even denied a decent time to mourn his wife and child, who died falling from their captors' vehicle.\n\nFuriosa returned to take away the small oasis this man built in the middle of the barren desert after her absurd fairy tale turned out to be a lie.\n\nThe worst part, his own people cheering for the traitor after a populist move of irresponsibly opening the floodgates to waste unholy amounts of water.\n\nThis movie angered me so much...",

The acting from Theron, Hardy, and Hoult was deep. This film is very visual. From the cinematography, color grading, production design, special effects, and costuming, the film creates this amazing world filled with gold, red, and bright turquoise. It is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and white-clothed females. The combination works as these elements often go hand in hand. I enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic, and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story. Although there was minimal dialogue in the film, the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film. I enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film. ",

I quickly realized that fans of the franchise must just enjoy the sight of supermodels in skimpy clothing wandering around in the desert and vehicles blowing up, sights that aren't aligned with my own personal tastes in cinema. I appreciate the fact that the film commits to it's mindlessness and is essentially just one long extended car chase and the technical elements of the film were impressive but it was hard to invest in anything when all of the characters were so flat.\n\nMax Rockatansky, Tom Hardy, is a lone wolf traveling through a post apocalyptic world where he has been traumatized by a past event by a young girl. He is captured by the members of an immoral cult who bow down to the evil Immortan Joe, Hugh Keays-Byrne, who forces women to have his children against his will. He is able to escape from his bindings and teams up with Furiosa, Charlize Theron, who had been hired to transport some of the pregnant women but who is helping them escape to the \"Green Place.\" They are chased by the villainous cult members throughout and several of the women die but they also make friends with cult member Nux, Nicholas Hoult, who aids them in their mission. \n\nThe most amazing sequences in the film come when the dizzying action stops and we are allowed to simply marvel at the barren landscape. While the film was shot in Namibia not Australia the film has a distinctly Aussie feel and if you have ever been in the outback it is hard not to have fond memories of your time there while watching this film. The sand storm is visual stunning as much as it goes on for too long and would have been more interesting if surrounded by a story willing to make us invest in characters and conflicts. Miller is clearly very interested in showing how an environment this harsh would push people to be extremely resourceful and ruthless in order to survive but he doesn't provide us with anything beyond these visually intense but unemotional shots to provoke these thoughts and feelings in us.\n\nThe action sequences in the film are entertaining enough as we see lots of violence and gore, the stunt work is all excellent and the imagery very on brand even with my limited knowledge of the franchise. This would all be fantastic if the film was only ninety minutes long and the sequences were less repetitive but at two hours you begin to feel numbed to the sight of cars blowing up and pregnant women dying. I wasn't expecting the film to be as restrained as The Wages of Fear (1953) or Yojimbo (1961) but I would have appreciated some analysis of the character's actions or some deeper exploration of how violence impacts people.\n\nThe performances received a lot of praise but I don't see anything special in them as while I think Theron is one of the greatest actresses of her generation I don't think she gets an opportunity to do much with this role. Hardy is inscrutable in the lead role but I suppose he is a decent strong, silent type even though he is hardly Henry Fonda in Jesse James (1939). As for the supermodels in the background they bring their considerable beauty to their roles but deliver some of the worst lines in the screenplay with a complete lack of conviction that belies how difficult it is to bring life to roles that require them to be sex objects. On the whole I would argue that this element of the film has been overpraised and I hope that Theron brings more to Atomic Blonde (2017) than she does to this or I doubt her abilities as an action star.\n\nI would call this film decent but never brilliant and it is hyperbolic to call it one of the best films of the 21st century when Margaret (2011) and You Can Count On Me (2000) exist.",

As much as passionate and meticulously driven this post apocalyptic world is, I would like to think that the genre sci-fi; which so it blatantly claims to be, is either misinterpreted or taken for granted in here. This film is far from being thought provoking. This raw ruffian ideology that George Miller; the writer-director, thrives upon, is more admirable than overwhelming. His utter fierceful confident in his vision is frankly dangerous. To pull off such a heist- if I could call it- at this scale is purely inspirational.\n\nIt is so bizarrely grand that the narration or characters or even the cinema itself gets lost into the dust. Aforementioned, it can be difficult for some viewers to swallow in this whole tale, swirling around in a pathos unapologetic world, there is barely any host for us to root for. And this very three dimensional take is what helps the cast to portray a fluid creamy persona in this bumpy road. Charlize Theron as the most lethal and convincing among all, is more than a match for Tom Hardy's \"one instinct-ish\" iconic character Max.\n\nIn fact, if anything, Hardy has to try hard, even snatch a gun in order to helm charge on her, a fatal attempt as Theron refuses to share the steely cold looks with anyone on screen. Another fascinating factor is the supporting characters and how invested they are in telling this story, crossing boundaries and showcasing a feat of bravery and commitment, this ensemble of cast defines the term \"teamwork\" to a whole new level. Mad Max: Fury Road iterates the theme of the world in its long action sequences, a game of chess, not the sacrifice or the head scratching tricks of it, but a succession of winning attempts.",

The best thing about it? 3/4 of the effects are in-camera. No CGI. Mostly practical. Yes, even that fire-spewing guitar is a real prop. It also deals with the theme of feminism as well as Aliens did back in 1986. No stereotypical \"woman talks down her mean boss\". Feminism done right. It's difficult to say anything about this movie that other people haven't already but Mad Max: Fury Road deserves its positions as one of the greatest action movies of all time, one of the best movie sequels of all time and the best Mad Max movie out of the four.",

Most action movies, especially summer blockbusters, have a tendency to suffer from a lack of development in their storytelling. Among its many strong points, Mad Max: Fury Road manages to develop its characters as well as introduce different story arcs at a very fast pace. All of that while blowing up cars, blasting old school rock music and giving the audience some incredible one liners. Tom Hardy also gives an incredible performance, considering that Max Rockatansky is not a very talkative character and that most of his lines consist of a maximum of five or six words. Charlize Theron also manages to steal the show as Furiosa, a character so loved by the audience that the studio is currently in talks to get her own spin off movie on the road (no pun intended).",

            "content": "!Warning: Mild Spoilers !\nI will have to start my movie critic journey with one of my all-time favorite movie's and arguably the best action movie ever. Before this movie I have never watched any one of the Mad Max films. It's one of those days where you don't have any idea about the movie but end up shattering all your expectations and you just came out of the theater ecstatic. I couldn't believe what I saw.  The movie redefined the post-apocalyptic action genre and made all the recent action movies like fast and furious franchise, marvel franchise look childish. It did it with mind boggling visuals and perfectly orchestrated stunts. The most surprising one was the film was directed by an veteran guy whose last film was Happy Feet.\n\nComing to the movie, it exists in an post-apocalyptic future following an energy crisis. The highlight of plot was the female protagonist named Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who was the Imperator of the main antagonist Immortal Joe who resides in Citadel. Five woman who were selected for breeding with Immortal Joe were taken by Furiosa in a war rig to save them and take them to a safe place. She was supposed to go to fetch gasoline but when Immortal Joe found out that the wives have been missing he leads his entire army to capture Furiosa and wives, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. The group finds a support in Max (Tom Hardy) who is the main male protagonist. He is an universal donor captured for donating blood to one of the war boy's named Nux who also joined the pursuit in capturing Furiosa(He later turns against the Immortal Joe and gets killed).\n\nAfter going to the safe place (called the 'Green place' in the film. It's where Furiosa was born and was kidnapped as a child), Furiosa discovered that it was destroyed due to severe drought and got more support in her clan. They return back to Citadel again as Max made them realize that it has resources full of water and food and it's th eonly way out. While they were headed to Citadel they kill the immortal Joe and trap all the war boys by blocking the canyon path.\n\nThe movie is little less in plot but the CGI were so good that it completely overshadows the plot. Especially there is a scene where Furiosa and the team were chased into a desert storm, the visuals were in the scene were so good it puts the scene probably into one of my top 3 scenes of all time. The movie also didn't deviate by placing any romantic scenes between Furiosa and Max nor by putting any flashback scenes which drag the movie and make it less interesting (There were some glimpses of Max's past but that's about it).\n\nThe energy was exhilarating right from start to finish. The sound design, editing, music are arguably the best that the genre has ever seen. The action scenes are so engrossing, the movie captures the viewer' mind and eyes right to the end. Even in the midst of chaotic action scenes the viewer can still follow the dynamics of the scene (Where all the war vehicles are located relative to each other and relative to the ground, who died, who attacked, etc.) by constantly giving the viewer overhead shots. Mad Max: Fury Road is probably one of the best action movies made since Terminator 2 is not an understatement.\n\nTo quote one of the movie quotes:\n\nIf I'm going to die, I'm going to die historic, on the fury road! - Nux",

Towards the end it gets a bit more formulaic for Mad Max fans and even a one armed Charlize Theron with warpaint and skull tattoos still looks to sexy to live in the end times, but I will take that as an added bonus.My only gripe is less a gripe and more a disappointment the supporting cast out side of Theron and maybe Hugh Keays-Byrne were pretty generic even for a Mad Max film, you can thoroughly enjoy this movie without knowing or caring about any of the side characters which is good and bad.",

The costume design is noteworthy, as each actor is transformed into an apocalyptic survivor that is almost unrecognizable. Combined with marvelous acting by Tom Hardy (Max), Charlize Theron (Furiosa), and Nicholas Hoult (Nux) gives the movie Mad Max Fury Road is not just the best film in the franchise but one of the best action movies to date",

            "content": "- In Fury Road, Mad Max steps aside and the girls drive -\n\nWhen I bought my ticket to see Mad Max: Fury Road, I had never seen a single Mad Max movie in my life. I knew it was an Australian dystopian franchise from the 80's starring Mel Gibson, and had a substantial cult following, but not much else. So when I eased into my seat, I was pretty unprepared for the visual and thematic feast about to unfold before me.\n\nLike its predecessors, Fury Road is set in a grim desert wasteland where water and oil are scarce. Pockets of surviving humans are desperate for resources and power, and nobody has more of either than Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).\n\nFury Road begins with Max as a prisoner of Joe's War Boys, an army Immortan Joe has bred himself using sex slaves.\n\nThings kick into high gear when Furiosa (Charlize Theron, Dark Places), a mysterious lieutenant in Joe's army, is sent across the desert to fetch oil. Joe discovers that Furiosa has broken his five \"wives\" free from their prison and stowed them in her oil rig. Max is thrown into the action when his captors engage in a massive desert chase against Furiosa, who is bound and determined to reach an oasis called \"The Green Place.\"\n\nIf Max seems like a bit of a footnote here, he is. Furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of Fury Road, championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros.\n\nWhen Max joins the women on their rig, initially self-preservation is his only goal. But these women, two of whom are pregnant, show him what it means to want survival - not only for yourself but for your children and a future world as well.\n\nIt's not a perfect movie, or one that's universally appealing. Nearly the whole two-hours is a car chase, which can be tiring if you're not into that sort of film. Tom Hardy (The Revenant) delivers a somewhat vague performance; at times it's not easy to engage with his character. The action is continuous, the roars loud, and the explosions vivid.\n\nBut on the whole, Fury Road impresses and surprises more than almost any other 2015 release (as evidenced by its 6 Oscar wins). Movie nerds, especially, will be thrilled to watch the energy and prowess of incredible stunt performers. Casual filmgoers will be delighted to see the tactile grit of real choreography and real explosions after a decade of shiny computer-generated stunts in almost every other action flick.\n\nAs a writer, my hands-down favourite aspect of the film is the utter restraint displayed by the screenwriters. Putting good sci-fi on screen is no easy feat. It can be way too tempting to get bogged down in tons of unrealistic expository dialogue and explanations of the World and its culture.  \n\nBut Mad Max suffers from none of these rookie mistakes; it truly knows how to \"show, not tell.\" We aren't told why Furiosa has a mechanical arm, but we understand that she's a warrior who realised she wants to fight for life instead of slavery. We don't need definitions of the terms \"Valhalla\" or \"blood bag\" or the history of Gas Town and its relationship to the Citadel. We're swept up in the chase, the fights, the conversations, and we're told just enough to keep us engrossed.\n\nAt the end of the night, Fury Road offers us a well-made, tightly-written critique of greed, oppression, and dehumanisation. It may be a bumpy ride, but it's a ride like you've never taken before.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/mad-max-fury-road, and was written Debbie Holloway.

Miller ha diretto qualcosa di pazzesco ed è proprio la pazzia al centro del film, non a caso \"Mad Max: Fury Road\". Il tutto è perfetto, dalla fotografia alla scenografia, dai costumi e i trucchi ai veicoli, non da meno le ambientazioni e il montaggio. Tant'è che il film si è aggiudicato tanti Oscar e ha ricevuto anche altre candidature. Le scene d'azione sono girate in modo magistrale e non ci si perde nemmeno un momento di tutto quello che sta succedendo. Unico piccolissimo difetto è il fatto che alcune battute non si capivano bene per il fatto che fossero pronunciate in mezzo a tutto il caos, alla pazzia del film. Tom Hardy e Charlize Theron bravissimi ma è stato ancora più bravo Nicholas Hoult (Nux), un Figlio della Guerra che ha una bella evoluzione nel corso della pellicola. Proprio a proposito dei Figli della Guerra e di Immortan Joe, il loro capo, a me all'inizio hanno fatto abbastanza paura, mi hanno intimorito per la loro pazia e i costumi con cui si vestivano. Fantastico il fatto che durante gli inseguimenti ci fossero delle persone che suonavano i tamburi o la chitarra creando una atmosfera unica. Il film inizia da subito con l'azione e non si ferma praticamente mai, in 1h e 50m ci saranno stati soltanto 5 minuti di \"calma\". Un film PAZZO. AMMIRATEMI!",

And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in \"Ben-Hur.\" Simply said, this movie is brilliant.",

The film has plenty of strange tidbits and ideas that all worked wonderfully together; from the unusually delivered dialogue, to the outlandish characters, to the dystopian culture imagined by George Miller himself. It's an action thriller where the true treat of the film is not the action itself, but rather it's everything else surrounding it. Tom Hardy helms the title role, but its Charlize Theron who owns the film with the strongest performance out of everyone, portraying a character of ferocity and guts who also has vulnerable side to her. Also recognition to an excellent supporting cast including Keough, Kravitz, H-Whiteley, and Eaton as the \"wives,\" and Hoult as \"Nux the war boy.\"",

Also a question was lingering: would a new mad max movie have the same mind-blowing effect 2015 as it had in 1980?. To this question my answer was rather 50-50 but george miller proved not only me but,  i suppose, many WRONG!!!!This guy is simply what you call a great director. MAD MAX:FURY ROAD takes its stand from ROAD WARRIOR but with the essence of the first movie. Tom Hardy does a great job as MAX ROCKATANSKY but its Charlize Theron's FURIOSA who stole the show; indirectly, this movie is a female-lead action packed explosive fun ride.Dazzling visuals, mind-blowing actions and a great performance by the lead as well as the secondary cast and the vision of a legend like george miller simply makes MAD MAX:FURY ROAD one of the best movies of 2015 and certainly a cult-classic action movie which will be remembered for years just as its predecessors.",

This film is a close cousin to \"Beyond Thunderdome\" in its autocratic ruler of the McGuffin. In \"Thunderdome\", it was Bartertown. In Fury Road, it is the clean water. \nThe road sequences are thrilling and ear-shattering. The action is incredible, and the fight scenes are tough, if not impossible, to beat.\nI just wish there had been more connection to the previous Max films without a need to have SEEN them all to understand what the heck is going on.",

Furiosa's robotic arm was never covered in the film because it does not support the main story, however, it is still in the film).

The premise is somewhat simple but the execution is excellent and the film actually has something to say. In a post apocalyptic world, gasoline is of great importance and water has become a luxury horded by tyrants like Immortan Joe who enslaves and uses young men as war boys to fight & die for him and young, healthy women as wives to be used as breeders. Max, played by Tom Hardy, is captured by the war boys and is used as a 'blood bag' for one of the war boys, Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult. On a run for gasoline, the driver of a huge, armoured 'war rig', Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, drives off course and it's discovered to have helped It Joe's wives escape and that's when the shit really hits the fan. \n\nThis film is beautifully shot, with great costumes and the action in this film is incredibly well done, with the majority being practical stunts and effects in an almost relentless car chase that keeps ramping up the tension and the excitement. For an action movie, Mad Max has a surprising amount of depth and story to it and brings us a great new female action hero, which are few and far between, in the form of Furiosa, whose story the film focuses on rather than Max. Overall, an incredibly fun, action packed film that's well worth watching the making of as well just for the stunts.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, I thought we were done with the Fast and Furious series. Now we have Fury Road?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Movie audiences appear to be clamoring for movies filled with endless car chases. And with great fury and furiousness. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: In a future world where gas and water are scarce, we re introduced to Mad Max. Max was apparently some sort of police officer who was charged with protecting women and children. We learn this through flashbacks of little girls asking Max  why didn t you save us  in accusatory tones. Max is taken hostage by the wild boys and hung from his heels in a cavern.\n\nSCOTT: We then see Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) secretly steal five breeding wives of the tyrannical and maniacal Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Joe and his henchmen give chase using a strange assortment of battle-equipped vehicles with Max strapped to the hood of War Boy Nux s (Nicholas Hoult) car. Soon Max escapes and joins forces with Furiosa in an attempt to find a way home and to safety.\n\nGREG: Scott, this movie was one long chase scene. There was hardly any time to create a plot. But there is one. Furiosa is trying to get these five young woman back to her homeland - The Green Place. When they arrive the land is dead and the only alternative is to go back where they came from. It s a very basic story, just enough to justify all the car mania. I have to say, though, I was impressed. It s dazzling display of roadwork and a nightmarish vision of the future. Most people I ve talked to were impressed by two things: the guy playing electric guitar on the front of a war vehicle, and how hot Charlize Theron looked despite being hairless and having just one arm.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Mad Max: Fury Road is a stunning technical and action-adventure achievement. The look of the movie is unlike anything I ve ever seen. The surreal visuals of the characters and their bizarre motor vehicles are simply incomparable. This dystopian vision of humanity s future is disturbing yet creatively appealing. Now, having said that, I was disappointed with the complete lack of character development and storyline. We are never introduced to the main characters. These characters just show up and are being chased, hounded, and tortured by Immortan Joe and his minions. I suppose I should root for them because they seem less dislikeable and bizarre than Joe and his gang, but we have no way of knowing if they are worthy of our support. There simply is no backstory to any of these characters. All we have is one heart-palpitating car chase scene after another. Yes, these chases were fun, but I hoped for much more from a storyline and character development point of view.\n\nGREG: The star of this film was definitely the world created by director George Miller and writers McCarthy and Lathouris. We can only judge the characters by what they do, rather than what they might say. Max spends most of his time in the movie being victimized by others. He shows he s not a bad guy because instead of killing Furiosa when he has the chance, he merely shoots the sand around her. He s not a killer it seems. Later, when he has the chance to go his own way, he instead chases down Furiosa and her clan to convince them they are going the wrong way. Then he helps them to create a plan to return to the Citadel where there is ample food, water, and gas. So, he s a good guy after all, but we can only learn this through his choices rather than anything he says.\n\nSCOTT: I agree that Max and Furiosa follow the arc of the buddy hero story, in that they are two people thrown together who dislike each other at first but slowly develop a strong bond. The villains in this story depart from the usual pattern that we see in the movies, Greg. Usually, the mastermind villain (in this case, Immortan Joe) is a man who calls all the shots from afar, safe from any harm. Only his minions and henchmen come in harm s way. But in this movie, Joe is in on the action in a big way, and he ultimately gets his comeuppance at the end. Overall, the supporting cast is as memorable if not more memorable than our two heroes. This may be the case partly because the two main characters are so poorly developed, but also because the supporting cast members show some depth, not to mention unusual behaviors and vivid makeup and costuming. Props go out to Immortan Joe and Slit as the memorable villains, and to the friends and allies of our two buddy heroes. Specifically, the five breeding women and Nux, the bad-guy-turned-good-guy.\n\nGREG: It s interesting to see the transformation in a secondary character such as Nux. He starts out literally living off of Max s blood and chasing the escaping brides. He s a bad guy being lead by a dark mentor (Joe). But he soon falls in love with one of the brides and becomes one of the good guys. Here is a secondary character who undergoes a moral transformation. In the end he martyrs himself to save Max, Furiosa, and the remaining brides. He is a heroic, redeemed sidekick. I enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road more than I expected to. Despite the lack of plot I was entertained by the imaginative and detailed dystopian future created by director Miller. I was drawn into the relentless chase and was able to appreciate the transformation of our buddy heroes as well as the sidekick. I give Mad Max 3 out of 5 Reels. While Max and Furiosa don t really create an alliance until the midpoint of the story, it s clear we re witness to a convergent buddy story. Our two heroes couldn t be farther apart at the beginning of the movie. But their common desire to escape the villain Immortan Joe and find a safe place draws them together. I liked this buddy story and gave them 4 out of 5 Heroes. The supporting cast was interesting as well. I ve already talked about the evolution of sidekick Nux. The five brides pretty much played the damsels in distress. Aside from an occasional opportunity to reload guns, their job was to look beautiful and be rescued. The villains were more interesting than usual. Immortan Joe certainly played the classic mastermind villain (although as you point out, Scott, he definitely got his hands dirty). Joe had his own henchman in Slit and countless nameless and faceless minions. But there was a nice addition of three other factions of bad guys, each with their own mastermind villain.Two warring factions came to Joe s aid, and the gas guzzling motorcycle gang chimed in to help our heroes. Sadly, we didn t get much depth to their characters, so I give the supporting cast 3 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie:  Cast:  Hero: \n\nSCOTT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a visual spectacle and dazzling feast for the eyes and ears. But there is little substance in the form of storyline and character development. If you enjoy the Fast and Furious franchise, you ll enjoy this movie. I ll give this this film credit for being highly memorable in terms of make-up, costuming, cinematography, and visual effects. But I can t give any movie high marks without good meaty characters that we get to know. As a result, I can only award Mad Max: Fury Road 2 Reels out of 5. Our two buddy heroes, Max and Furiosa, were disappointing because we never get to know them. There is no backstory and almost no dialogue whatsoever that can give us insight into their values, their history, or their character. As such, they do not change over the course of the movie, other than they grow to like each other and depend on each other for survival. Let s face it -- this is an action movie that assumes (perhaps correctly) that audiences only want chase scenes. I can only award these two flimsy heroes 1 Hero out of 5. The supporting cast was more interesting than our two heroes. We re not given much insight about Immortan Joe or any backstory, either. But he is obviously a deranged, maniacal cult leader with loads of charisma. Max and Furiosa s friends and allies play a nice supporting role, and as you point out, Greg, Nux is the one character (albeit a supporting character) who undergoes a transformation. I ll agree with your rating and assign this group a rating of 3 Casts out of 5.  Movie:  Cast:   Hero:",

The start of the movie made me think about the things that can happen in the future.\nFuriosa is the main character because she is the one who is going to fight immortan joe and she rescue the wives but Max is also like a main character because without him Furiosa wouldn't made it and beat Immortan joe at the end. I think the movie would be fine without the level of violence it has because there is too many killing scenes in the movie but I guess that's what makes the movie excellent. All the violence that happened in the movie is because all of them want to rule the world.\nFury Road's vision of the future can come true I think because if a war happens in the world and nuclear explode everywhere, I think the only thing that will left is sand, everywhere in the world because it's going to kill all the nature and I think this is kind of realistic. It doesn't really matter how realistic it is to me. I think the film is trying to convey an environmental message by showing us what can happen in the future if war starts so, it warns us.\nIn Mad Max Fury Road, most of the men are fighter or workers to serve their king and most of the women are used to help their king and do whatever he wants them to do and they use women to get babies, because they need more people so their kingdom will become more powerful. I think men are more leaders in the movie.\nI really enjoy the movie because all the shooting and killing scenes and the story line, I think this movie is really great to watch.",

The movie was so fast that you felt that there was too much happening in one place at one time. Max and Furiosa are a good combination, they both are intelligent strong and work well as a team. I think Max is the main character in the film because the film is based around him.\nI think that the violence in the movie is a necessary thing otherwise the movie would be bland and it would not be any different to an ordinary film. I think the violence fits in with the topic and that the characters played there parts well. I think Fury Road's vision of the future is an accurate vision of what life could be like if we ran out of important materials.\nI do not think that feminism should be included in the film because it is an action film and is more about the fighting then telling a message that women should be treated equally to men. Fury road doesn't work as a feminist film because it is too fast paced and full of too much action for someone to focus on the feminism side of the movie. I think the way Miller included feminism is a good way to include it into the film because it is very easy to see the feminism.\nMad Max Fury Road is a good film that I would suggest to someone who is willing to watch the film multiple times because there is too much to take in, in one viewing. I enjoyed Mad Max Fury Road and I think that the topic is suitable for modern day because it shows us a preview of what life could be like.",

The first thing to come up through my mind when I first saw the cover for the film I knew that it was going to be very action-packed. And the film would be set in a desert location.\n\t\nThe obvious main character in the film is Max since his name appears in the title and he does most of the fighting. The intro scene of Mad Max Fury Road introduces the audience to Max as he is seen with having a troubled past when he loses all his family and friends. However, Furiosa can also be considered to be a main character as she has the role of commander of the war boys and helps Max throughout his journey. Both characters Max and Furiosa aren't one dimensional which is good because it improves the storyline and doesn't make the film boring/uninteresting. \n\nViolence in Mad Max Fury Road is required most of the time to fend off some of the war boys, however in situations such as; when Max wanted to have water and his chains taken off him violence wasn't required he just wanted full control of the wives and Furiosa. \n\nThe film itself is trying to convey an environmental message, but I doubt this is either believable or realistic to the audience as water is a renewable source and wouldn't be limited resource in the future. Mad Max Fury Road is trying to convey a environmental message of how the future may become like the scenery of Mad Max Fury Road if we humans don't conserve resources like gasoline and oil.\n\nIn most cases, Mad Max Fury Road isn't feminist because the women are treated poorly and don't have the roles men do. Although Furiosa is portrayed as a strong character with a lot of power and the film passes the bechel test meaning the film has more than two women and the women talk about topics other than men.\n\nOverall, Mad Max Fury Road is a great film with many thrilling action scenes and great fighting scenes, but with minor tweaks here and there it could have been more realistic or believable to the audience viewing the film.",

            "content": "Mad Max Fury Road review\n\nAs we started watching Mad Max Fury Road, I had the vibe that this movie was going to be a boring action fiction movie and definitely not going to amuse me and be boring. I do enjoy action movies but from looking at the setting and reading up what it was about, I didn't see that I would enjoy it whatsoever and I wasn't enjoying it at the start. The main character in Mad Max Fury Road is deal was made about the fact that the lead character of the film was a woman, but according to George Miller it had to be that way. When what is being fought over is women, it needed to be a woman who does the fighting. Overall, Furiosa had to be the main character in order to make the story make sense and work. Violence is needed in this film because the plot of fury Road involves many fight and action scenes which leads to violence. It isn't a problem in the movie because it structures the movie together and without violence, I guess the movies wouldn't be that entertaining and wouldn't make sense. As you can tell after watching the full movie, it is 100 percent an unrealistic movie but, that does not matter because miller has set Fury Road in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce. What I think millers message is in this movie is that he is telling us what he thinks the future may turn to. As it may seem a little too unbelievable, just remember that aliens are believed to be a myth but yet some in fact many, still believe that they are real existing creatures so who knows. Maybe millers prediction of the future is correct and our country or even earth will turn into a desert wasteland. As said before, feminism does work in the film because Furiosa (the main character) leads and takes risks which is showing the woman are worth the same as men and they are Miller is sending a messages out to the world that the world should be equal and proves that women are strong and can do dangerous and risky things that men can do too. Overall, I did enjoy the film and my opinion of the film changed dramatically from the beginning which is a good thing and means that you have to watch the whole film to enjoy it you can't just watch the trailer to come up with your opinion.",

It made me think about the world and its devastation, and who was responsible for the cause of the world's corruption.\n\nMax is supposedly the main character because his name is in the title and the storyline originally revolved around him and his fight for justice. Furiosa also plays a big part in the movie as Max's ally and Max spends a lot of time trying to help himself and Furiosa survive. The minimum dialogue has no effect on their portrayal as their actions speak louder than words. I can see depth in both of these characters as their past that has made them who they are.\n\nIn the film, violence is always used to solve problems and I don't think that these problems could be solved any other way. The violence is a vital part of the movie and it is necessary as the characters are beyond verbal negotiation and have to resort to violence. Some of the violence is unrealistic, such as the weapons that they use and how the vehicles are made. \n\nThe setting is supposed to be the world's future, but I think we will be able to solve our problems with communication and negotiation so that we share the resources fairly. I don't think it matters how realistic and extreme the vision of the future is because it is only for us to watch and enjoy. The film could be saying that we need to make the unsustainable resources last as long as possible so the planet doesn't become corrupt. \n\nI think it is great how the film shows how women have as much strength as men. Furiosa and the Breeders prove their strength by fighting off the war boys and Immortan Joe. Furiosa is technically the main character and she is using her strength and power to free the Breeders and herself from Immortan Joe's captivity.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the film immensely as it was filled with action and engaging moments, keeping me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend watching the first 3 Mad Max films before this one, to understand Max's journey.",

Put two acting gods, Hardy, Theron, together and they skyrocket Fury Road into cinematic heaven. \nMiller directs the sh*t out of this movie and it is GREAT.  His touches are unmissable: quick, dirty, anxious. Not to mention the story. \nAction has never met an apocalyptic plot so fit for the genre. Somehow, Mad Max marries a somewhat brain-dead movie drama into a thought provoking and meaningful story, leaving moviegoers like me intrigued and actually emotionally interested in these characters and the resolution of the film. \nVisually? A+. Grimy, stylistic masterpiece. I could feel the dry heat of that desert! Deserves all that Oscar talk. My only complaint was probably the ending-i was left unfulfilled after an extremely satisfying action sequence-what gives?",

I don't know the last time I was so swept away by a movie this visceral. The passion into making this by ALL involved bursts from every frame and we can only marvel at its existence and be thankful. Charlize Theron is granted a life time pass in my book because of this movie and of course she is the real lead. Max is a bit of a cyphre and not really present that much to the viewer. Nux knocks it out of the park though, but none of it would have come accross the way it so overwhelmingly did without George Miller at the helm.\nI'm very grateful for this movie and will revisit many, many times",

It's full of fuel, fire, blood, metal, spit and dirt but hey, isn't that Mad Max? And what a turbo reboot it is! The stunts, the editing, the effects are quite exasperating to say the least. When it does let us catch a breath, we are given moments of recollection and storytelling under the expanse of a starry outback sky which are a thing of true cinematic beauty. Max is still a laconic, tortured individual who this time, plays second fiddle to Charlize Theron's equally stoic heroine, but we are given some back story here and there to make up for this. This is not just a reboot for the franchise but it's an intravenous fuel injection for the Australian film industry!",

It should be a reminder to filmmakers that CGI should be used as a garnish, not the entire entrée. Intelligent director, George Miller, gave a purpose to every insane shtick in the story that people often like to regard as meaningless nonsense. Some of the voices in the audience say, \"too much action\" but I say that too much action in a Mad Max film is like complaining that you're getting more steak than you thought you were paying for. There is a plot and there are relatable characters who develop. Max Rockatansky is a man who has had a terrible life and has a guilt complex - I can name a lot of people like that. Furiosa is a redemption-seeking woman who seeks 'home.' Granted, the one complaint that is understandable is that the story has too much Furiosa and not enough Max. In my opinion, Max was important enough to the story and had enough screen time to count as a main character alongside Furiosa. \nIt's of no surprise that the sound mixing and film/sound editing won Academy awards. The music provided by Junkie XL also kept the adrenaline pumping from behind the movie very well.\nLastly, I'd like to note that Hugh Keays-Byrne made another excellent performance as a villain.",

The standard of craft here is mind blowing; maintaining an expert blend of practicality and CGI to the extent in which it is often very hard to tell which is which. Additionally the editing is by far some of the best I've ever seen; entirely fluid but radical hops between shots. \n\nHowever, I simply couldn't get invested in the action, as I simply did not give the slightest inch of a shit as to what would become of the characters. No matter how phenomenal the destruction, no matter how absurdly drool worthy the wide shot, there was nothing pulling me to it because I could not relate to anyone in the film, and there was very little time and effort establishing the characters that inhabit this film. \n\nI also noticed that some of the dialogue is truly ridiculous. I am aware it is meant to be mental however if the glossy radical filter was stripped away from this film; many instances of character communication would just be comparable to idiots in a script run through screaming at each other, something that I just couldn't find myself enjoying. \n\nBelieve me, I would have loved to give this film a  higher rating than a mere half mark but since the script seemed to be incredibly boring it significantly reduced the impact of the clearly incredible stunts on display. As a result, I do not think this film is worthy of a higher star grade. If this was entirely based on the craft and direction; 5 stars would not be a problem at all for me.

            "content": "George Miller, the wonderful Australian director, struck gold with his comeback movie Mad Max: Fury Road.  The marvelous choice of actors, with Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, and the wonderful camerawork, that seemed to cover every necessary angle for every battle, help explain how this movie left me on the edge on my seat. \n\nMad Max gets things rolling by having Max crawl out from under his badass vehicle.  The entire movie you get to see these amazing sand vehicles coming at you from every direction, trying to capture Max.  When he escapes with ease from his first set of enemies, you start to realize that he's never going to be alone with a sense of safety (Literally, I don't think that there was ever a scene without an intense, high-speed chase).  George Miller does a wonderful job of never letting you take your eyes off the movie.  \n\nI think the production is what makes this movie fantastic.  The camerawork, the terrain, and the backgrounds all provide nice, jaw-dropping scenes that give this movie life.  I caught myself many times taking a step back and saying \"Damn, that's a nice shot there\".  The first three Max Movies were all filmed in Melbourne, Australia and Mad Max: Fury Road was moved to the southern African country of Namibia.  The lengthy scenes were filled with roaring trucks flying through the desert so you never wanted to look away.  Shots are always filled with chaos and many antagonists that are just waiting to make their move.  George Miller keeps the images and backgrounds coming at you like a meteor shower.  One second you're looking at a huge sandstorm and the next you're looking at a battle filled with over 50 vehicles.  The stunk work and tracking shots are unreal as it shows people flying off their vehicles left and right the whole movie. \n\nMax goes through the movie having constant flashbacks that hurt his ability to focus. These flashbacks consist of rapid, unsteady close-ups of his lost daughter.   This aids to create a story that will also keep the non-action lovers craving more.  Mad Max however has its fair share of funky, unnecessary scenes but the film doesn't seem to suffer from it at the slightest.  Does every movie make sense the whole time? No, so just go with it and strap back in your seat and continue to watch the action-packed film. \n\nBefore watching this movie, I didn't know what to expect... And even after watching it, I still couldn't tell you what was going on, but I weirdly was fond of that and how George Miller left me feeling a different type of way.  This movie has its own personality and I think it might be years until a similar action film comes out.  This movie won an Oscar, was nominated for numerous other ones, and after watching it, you can easily see why.  Mad Max will leave you craving more so get ready for a new standard of action movies because you won't know what hit you. If you think that a scene is breathtaking in Mad Max, just wait about 5 minutes until the next one and I bet you'll be saying the same words.",

            "content": "Over the opening credits of Mad Max: Fury Road, our title character says in gravelly narration, \"my world is fire and blood\" and he could not be more right. Set in the same post-apocalyptic wasteland as The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, where oil, gasoline, and water are scarce, but not as scarce as civilization, this adventure finds Max (Tom Hardy-brooding and often silent) as almost a side character to the main narrative. The action really kicks off when Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) smuggles a group of women away from their captor in her massive \"war rig\" and is pursued by countless bad guys in suped-up weaponized vehicles-and Max is forcibly brought along for the chase. That is about all the plot there is in the screenplay written by director George Miller with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, but with a film as well-executed in direction, cinematography, performances, visual effects, and costume and production design as this one, that is enough. \n\nThe villain of Fury Road, Immortan Joe, (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was also a villain in 1979's Mad Max) is a cross between Darth Vader and Skeletor in appearance. He rules The Citadel with equal parts cruelty and tyranny, giving the people of The Citadel little water to live on and keeping women in a vault as his wives (or, put more bluntly, breeders). When he discovers Furiosa's betrayal, he sets out with a massive war party, including, most memorably, a barge stacked with amplifiers and speakers and a man whose sole purpose is to play heavy metal riffs on a flame-throwing guitar. Immortan Joe's minions are shirtless, chalk-painted men called War Boys, desperate to impress their leader and die gloriously on the Fury Road. \n\nMax, being \"a Road Warrior searching for a righteous cause\" after all, eventually decides, albeit reluctantly, to help Furiosa, but not until after they have an intense fight in the desert with the war party quickly closing in and Max chained to both a car door and a War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult). However, despite Fury Road being nominally Max's adventure, it is Furiosa's mission which drives the story. She is our main character and Theron-who can perhaps be best described as \"super badass\"-is the real star and standout in this movie. Her performance is quiet, but perfectly measured; and our emotions-yes, there are emotions in Fury Road-are invested with her. \n\nIt might seem odd to call the gritty, violent, high-octane Fury Road a feminist action movie, but that argument is not a difficult one to make. Max does his fair share of driving and killing, but he does not swing in to rescue these women-they are equally his saviors. The group of young women led by Furiosa are not damsels in distress and this movie makes each of them feel like a full person and treats them accordingly. Though they are not all experienced road warriors like Furiosa, the women display other strengths like bravery and compassion. When one of the escapees, Capable (Riley Keough), finds Nux in the back of their War Rig, curled up in shame and humiliation at having failed Immortan Joe, she convinces him through gentle conversation to become an ally in their escape. Fury Road is a movie about women rescuing other women from male cruelty. \n\nThough Fury Road is essentially one big, unrelenting chase, Miller finds ways to give the audience moments of respite and a chance to breathe. One of my favorite scenes in the movie happens when our protagonists' flight comes to a halt. The engines of the War Rig have overheated and must cool down before they can continue, but Immortan Joe's forces are only getting closer. Max gathers his weapons and begins to walk toward the pursuing villains. Furiosa asks, \"What if you're not back by the time the engines are cool?\" Max quietly replies, \"Well, you keep moving\" and sets out into the blue tinged night. A battle ensues-we hear gunshots, but rather than jumping into the middle of the fight we stay with Furiosa and watch from a distance.\n\nWhen watching Fury Road, you get the impression that George Miller was mostly left alone with little to no studio interference or notes from the marketing department. There are many unpleasant, grotesque images in this movie, but there are also many fascinating and exciting ones, too. The costume design, production design, makeup and hairstyling, and visual effects are all deservedly nominated for Oscars. Watching Fury Road again I noticed more and more intricate and impressive details. The score by Junkie XL was not nominated for an Oscar, but it is a great nonetheless, and used to perfection. Fury Road feels like it was a true collaboration between all of the people involved with the production both on and off camera. \n\nThis fourth installment in the Mad Max series comes 30 years after the third, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and for fans of the earlier films Fury Road does not disappoint. However, you don't need to have seen any of the other Mad Max films to enjoy this one, since each film has its own standalone story which is explained and changed slightly at the opening of each movie. I was immensely entertained when I saw this film in theaters and again when I saw it on DVD. Everything I had enjoyed about the film the first time still had the same effect on me and my excitement for the film has not waned. This is an epic film of tremendous quality, which is usually not the case with big budget summer action movies or sequels. Fury Road is a full bore, action movie executed with noticeable care and meticulous thought at every turn.",

This reboot is not subtle. It's full of fuel, fire, blood, metal, spit and dirt but hey, isn't that Mad Max? And what a turbo reboot it is! The stunts, the editing, the effects are quite exasperating to say the least. When it does let us catch a breath, we are given moments of recollection and storytelling under the expanse of a starry outback sky which are a thing of true cinematic beauty. Max is still a laconic, tortured individual who this time, plays second fiddle to Charlize Theron's equally stoic heroine, but we are given some back story here and there to make up for this. This is not just a reboot for the franchise but it's an intravenous fuel injection for the Australian film industry!",

Love how they blend in the contrast in every scene and the characters were colorful within. I'm just glad there were no shaky cameras in this movie. Vehicle scenes were really, really good. I think it's hard to pull off such scenes because the actors have to interact perfectly to set things in motion and preventing to get a lot of takes. I was aware that the movie was in development hell but I'm glad it finally came out and it's a really good movie.\n\nSurprisingly it's a continuation of the overall story of Mad Max. I haven't watched the rest except first one and like I said before, it's been a real long time. But I do remember how hardcore Mad Max is and he is a force to be reckoned with. Something about lone wanderers and their calm before the storm attitude that makes them stand out from the others.\n\nCharlize Theron. Oh what a gal. Love her performance as always. A pretty good actress in a pretty good movie. I can't describe well anymore than I already can but to say that she adds the spice into the whole story of the Fury Road. Made her character tough as nails and would do anything to bring the oppressed girls to safe haven. One thing I didn't like much but it's probably just me is there was not enough Mad Max but I guess it's not bad to give other characters the spotlight and while we know Mad Max is just coming along for the ride. Surviving day by day, of course. While that was just my gripe, overall the movie is great nevertheless.\n\nMad Max Fury Road is another one rollercoaster ride you don't want to miss.

Tom Hardy does a pretty good job as Mad Max, but he barely has any dialogue and it kind of annoys me because it sound like a lot happened in between the films and I would've love to see him talk about but not to much. Furiosa is an interesting character, but her rebelling all of a sudden is kinda of a weird introduction to the character. All  the other actors do a great job in this film.\nNow the action, funny a lot people say this is some of the best action in cinema, but it barely goes farther than mission impossible and 007. What I mean is that it's pretty underwhelming and it does that instead of talking about scenes that are never brought up or explored.\n\nIt has some ok action and it's well acted but it kind of gets boring as it goes on.",

Immortan Joe is a dictator who presides over his subjects with an iron hand.\nWater, guzzoline (and common sense) are in short supply.\nIt falls upon a rebel, Imperator Furiosa, and Max himself to liberate the country from the clutches of Joe's oppression.\nIn fact, Furiosa (Charlize Theron in a stellar turn) is the heart and soul of this enterprise. She completely owns the screen each time she appears on it, lending a sense of urgency and gracefulness to the film's proceedings.\nTom Hardy, on the other hand, is completely out of sorts. He lacks the charisma and easy charm that a leading role of this nature would inevitably demand.\nThe whole film is basically one long explosion-filled chase down a barren, dystopian landscape that could give Panem from Hunger Games a run for its money.\nProblem is, the aforementioned chase takes all of two exruciating, mind-numbing hours.\nMiller's vision is grand and has a sweeping quality to it. The same cannot be said for his execution.\nA good film goes far beyond just expensive CGI and VFX. It requires a solid script, cracking dialogue and characters whom you can empathise with and relate to.\nIn his zest for making a film that redefines the action genre, Miller unfortunately seems to have overlooked this elementary fact.\nI could have slept through the entirety of this film's duration and it would hardly have made a difference.\nIn the film's very beginning, Max says, \"My name is Max. My world is fire. And blood.\"\nAnd boring, he might have added. This Road is full of potholes.",

And this is exactly the part that many critics seem to neglect for some bizarre reason.\n\nOn the one hand we have the world of men: infused with phony ideology, drunk on fake glory, and built for the sole purpose of feeding into power of a single man at the top. The rusty hierarchy is squeezing out just enough juice to keep the masses eke out an existence, but always wanting for more. The only exception is Mad Max, who, although an outsider, has also given up on hope.\n\nOn the other, we have Furiosa in the midst of a rebellious act, fleeing this pathetic existence with the few drops of purity it birthed, toward a Green Place. Through methodical hard work, she came to possess just enough trust and power to escape - for redemption, she said, but we learn soon after that she needed hope more than anything and anyone.\n\nThe attention to detail is astounding. In the action movie, which would normally just settle for a lot of CGI and loud sounds (and which MMFR has plenty of), the details are so abundant that they seem almost gratuitous: the school yard lingo you'd expect from a gang that maybe got stranded and grew up on an island and knows no one but each other; the unusual arsenal of tricks and weaponry suited for road wars; the war drums and flame-throwing electrical guitars that fulfill the role of military marches, yet much more shrill and insane; the skeletal arm drawing on the side of the rig. These couldn't have possibly be fashioned by anyone other than someone absolutely obsessed with that violent and grotesque world, someone who lived there for decades, and who survived to tell the tale. That's why this world, like a powerful magnet, clicks into place so naturally, into a hole that was apparently there - no lengthy explanations are needed, because the darkness it exposes lives in all of us.\n\nAt one point, I felt the anger so boundless I couldn't contain myself; it just exited in a shriek and left me shaken to my core for the remainder of their journey. I hesitate to call this an 'episode' of a 'film' for fear that it would diminish what it stirred. It is belief in justice, in freedom, in peace that is defiled and trampled upon if we only give in to the darker demons of our nature - if what rules instead are greed, bigotry, and violence.\n\nWhat really got imprinted into my brain were the Many Mothers. The old women with dry chuckles and winks and smiles were the most reassuring, the most human sight of the entire spectacle.  We need these women in our lives: those who don't listen to the war cries and war horns, but believe in their own righteousness and purity. Given the chance, they will create and grow and nurture, but they will fight with all their strength to preserve what's right when the have to. If only men were not so caught up on their greed, lust, and war games, we might have had a better, kinder world. If we trust our better nature, we just might, eventually.",

It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. \n\nThe characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. \n\nI just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience",

            "content": "I was hugely disappointed. Worst film I've seen for years.\n\nFirstly, it's not a Mad Max film. The character that's supposed to be Max does not have Max's personality and does not seem to have Max's past either. (Max did not have a daughter) There is no attempt to link the events in the previous films to this one.\n\nThat does not necessarily make it a bad film in its own right though. Complete lack of plot, characterisation and realism do that. I didn't find my self caring about any of the characters. They just seem to be mindless automatons. Max was always fairly stoic and terse in the old films, but in this one he barely says a word. The action is relentless and there are no breaks to discover anything about any of the characters.\nThe film also suffers from inconsistent tone. Lurching from cartoony violence on one hand, to serious issues like slavery on the other. It feels rather like Waterworld in this regard.\n\nThe film was widely praised for its feminism, which I find bizarre. There is nothing feminist about this film. Yes, the protagonist is female, but she acts like a man. The message is basically: To be strong, woman has to become a man. Contrast this with a genuine female action character like Ellen Ripley from Alien: The Ripley character could not have been played by a man.\nThe other female characters are in two groups: The antagonist's harem - five beautiful, helpless waifs who need rescuing; and the Vuvalini tribe. The Vuvalini tribe are at least somewhat more interesting. Middle-aged women rarely appear in action roles. However, they are almost all killed off as cannon fodder without really leaving any impression.\n\nThe first two Mad Max films had a gritty realism to them. Their setting was just about plausible and the plot was completely believable. Beyond Thunderdome lost a bit of this, but Fury Road does away with it completely and goes pure comic-book. Everyone's a hero, wounds are shrugged off, guns have infinite ammo. Some people obviously like this style but for me it just makes it boring.\n\nThere are some good points: The film is beautiful. Some of the action sequences are very good.",

            "content": "Almost 24 hours after I saw Mad Max: Fury Road and I think the adrenaline is still pumping through my veins. A thrilling two-hour ride through George Miller's post-apocalyptic wasteland, Fury Road is the best movie 2015 has seen so far.\n\nI will not lie, being a fan of Mad Max and The Road Warrior, Miller's first two stories following Max Rockatansky in his world, I was skeptical when I heard there would be a fourth movie (I have avoided watching Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, full disclosure). Upon hearing it was Miller who would be at the helm again, it put my mind at ease. My expectations were fully set when I found out the superb Tom Hardy (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises, Bronson) would be playing the titular role.\n\nThe film begins at breakneck speed and continues at that pace right up to the very end - with maybe a ten minute break in the middle which allows the audience to catch their breath and ease back into their seats. Within the first three minutes, we have our first flipped car - Max's - and he is captured by minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villain Toecutter in the original Mad Max - a nice homage to the past by Miller), a dictatorial warlord who seems to have complete control over the population of the Capital, hewn into the rock in the wasteland desert. The ensuing chase scene when Max attempts a daring escape from the Capital sets the pace for the rest of the film, as Max races through the tunnels, jumping over cars, jumping out of the structures onto crane hooks...keeping in mind that 80% of the film's stunts were real action and not CGI, this is a pretty cool chase but not even the film's finest. The chase that is the next hour and fifty minutes is even better.\n\nAmong the populous of the Capital are Nux (Nicolas Hoult, X-Men: First Class), and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, Monster), two very different characters. Nux, one of Joe's \"war boys\" is a sickly lad whose only two real friends are growths in his shoulder which he has tattooed smiley faces on (this should give you a sense of the common person in Joe's forces). His ultimate goal is the same as the other war boys, to bring back the escaped fugitives, achieve Joe's recognition and upon death arrive at \"Valhalla.\"\n\nFuriosa has committed the crime of stealing Joe's wives, five beautiful girls who he has been breeding with in order to try and further his population. Driving a war-rig filled with gasoline, a valuable item in this world, Furiosa sets out with the wives to try and find a new home free of Joe's terror.\n\nMax is pulled into all of this by virtue of being a universal blood donor, and spends a good portion of time with an iron mask over his face attached to the front of Nux's car. Hardy proves his acting chops here, as he did in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, by acting with only his eyes as he reacts to the gunfire, explosions and wild stunts occurring around him as his car speeds through the desert.\n\nThe rest of the film is essentially a long car chase that left me breathless at several points. Miller's penchant for dramatic stunts is accompanied by strong performances by Hardy and Theron, while Hoult provides a craziness to Nux that offsets the calmess of Max. A man of many words, Max doesn't speak until nearly half an hour into the film, and while he speaks more than he does in The Road Warrior, he never delves into lengthy explanations. His longest lines are delivered with hesitancy and many pauses, reflecting his lack of conversations over the years.\n\nTheron's Furiosa essentially becomes the film's true hero, since Max is viewed as an antihero in many ways. Furiosa is a woman of determination who still has hope for a better place that, as Max reminds her, may not exist. This sense of optimism is not as present in Miller's other Max films, but Theron captures it without being carried away by it, and when she realizes it is not to be, she switches back seamlessly into her goal-oriented self who is just trying to keep the wives alive.\n\nA spine-pounding score by Junkie XL accents the action which goes on on the screen, making it an action movie opera of sorts, which the majority of the action taking place in car chases, as is the common theme among all Mad Max films. Miller has said in interviews that the whole script was actually written and presented in storyboard form, allowing the action to be fully fleshed out to the best it possibly can be. Filled with homages and references to the first set of Mad Max films, it also works well as a stand-alone film, so those who haven't seen the originals don't have to feel the need to prior to seeing this (I would recommend them though).\n\nAfter seeing Fury Road, it's almost hard to believe Miller is the same mastermind behind the two Happy Feet films, but easy to remember that he created this world that Max inhabits; \"My world is fire and blood,\" proclaims Max in the opening voiceover, and he is 100% right. The action is fast, but unlike some recent action films, the action never seems too fast. The cuts and shots are quick enough to reflect the high tension and action, but not so quick as to have the audience lose their bearings or fall behind in confusion.\n\nWhile spectacular acting might not be required in such a visually striking film, the A-listers deliver, as mentioned, with Hardy, Theron and Hoult leading the way. Hoult's mad antics, particularly in the early stages of the film, counterbalance nicely with the grim coolness of Hardy and Theron's characters. It should be noted that I did not even think about Mel Gibson or what he might have done with the role in this film once during it, which should stand as a testament to Hardy's performance. Keays-Byrne is as intimidating and terrific as he was in 1978, and the women who portray the five wives definitely don't reflect the typical traits of damsels in distress. This is as much a testament to Miller's storyboard script as it is to the acting skills of the women in question, led by Rose Huntington-Whiteley.\n\nSome viewers may say that Mad Max:Fury Road lacks plot, story and even character development. But I don't know if any of that is necessary in the action-packed thrill ride that is the most recent product of George Miller's marvelous imagination.",

Deleted it off my harddrive 0.003 seconds later.\n\nI'm reading reviews to understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this heap of nonsense, but I just don't get it. Who cares about cinematography or \"real\" vs \"cgi\" when you're watching the absolute worst film of all time. There is no story, no direction, every character is ridiculously underdeveloped and the \"world\" that it's set in isn't even constructed according to the laws of what's possible and what isn't. Still people rave about how meticulously it is designed, and how it's a metaphore for the underlying storyline? Am I delusional? Is everyone else?",

The last time we had a film that we could say \"how great it is to have a summer blockbuster that's actually fantastic and gets nominated for loads of oscars\" was gravity, and that was 90 minutes long and was essentially an exploitation film with a huge budget, got in, told the taut thriller, got out, wonderful. When a quarter of your film gets tiring, especially in a film of this kind of break neck pacing, that's a major problem. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, I love the film, I own it on DVD, the cinematography is amazing, the effects stunning and oscar winning, the costumes even more amazing and also oscar winning, no where else will you find a blockbuster film showing in multiplexes with a major antagonist wearing nipple clamps, I'm sorry but that alone will make it always have a place in my heart. \n\nTaut pacing, a convincing world as immersive as Blade Runner, and several kick ass ladies, make Mad Max: Fury Road a success, and an instruction manual for how to do Hollywood action in the future.",

I can kind of see why people may have thought this was feminist driven because in some of the scenes they really did water down Max's ability to be a badass. While he had some great scenes i think it would of been better had a couple of the scenes actually allowed him to show and strut his own stuff. But its of minor consequence in the long run as it didnt hurt the movie any and more of just a personal preference for me as the viewer. Im also convinced that this is supposed to take place after the first 3 due to some of the flashbacks in the film. I also loved the fact that there were more groups of villains than just the ones from the Citadel as it certainly added to more of the mayhem. Overall loved this flick as it wasnt a letdown at all.\n\n10/10",

So, the movie is an endless chase at top speeds in phantasmagorical hot rods and super-trucks taking in a variety of vistas and oddly-dressed tribes along the way - but that's all it is.  In other words, a gloriously well-realized moment in an imagined dystopic future populated by brutal characters that we never really get to know (particularly Tom Hardy, who has taken over the role of Max from Mel Gibson).

Combine the two and we get the famous Australian dystopian world of Mad Max, so mesmerizing, enchanting.\n\nEverything is a marvel to behold. George's direction is exceptional. He creates new cinematic techniques of conveying action sequence without much reliance of cliche shots. The end product is very fast-paced, effectively creating the sense chaos that comes with good action sequences. Ambitious is one word to sum this up.\n\nAs the background characters yell weird monologues, while others swing to and fro over the War Rig commencing more and more crazy, feral action, the films keeps on delivering the thrills under such a unique ambience, and I can't help but be captivated by every one of its key moments. Marvel, X men, DC dominate the box office nowadays, but those action scenes are just for fun. Airport scene from CA: Civil War for instance, the one scene everyone extols, is admittedly for fan indulgence and fun. Fury Road is alone, but it is much more.

In fact this was really apparent in every character in this movie as you didn't get to get to know about them really feel like you could relate to them.  At least in the original movie when Max's wife was run down out in the middle of the road you felt the horror and disgust of what was going on and could sympathize with Max for vengence. However this movie had none of that real grit teeth clenching moments where you could identify with any character.  Furthermore, it just pained me to see how secondary they Max himself  when he was what all of em were every about. No longer was he intelligent and cunning he just seems empty and stale like the very theme of this movie. To say more, It just seemed like this movie was nothing but one long ass car chase there an unbelievable dusty surroundings that looked like a back lot of any movie studio and not anything familiar to the Australian Outback.  Which brings me to the next thing I hate about this movie was just didn't feel the apocalyptic surroundings as i did with the 2 original movies and that really took me out of the movie big time to carry the backdrop of the chaos of the tone of the film. it was the same reason that  beyond thunderdome in my eyes was an abomination. This made it terrible because it lacked that antagonist feel of appending doom that was always lurking near to what was going around Max in any other film.

Now, 70, the director, who one learns, indeed, finished his residency before fully succumbing to the dubious life of movie making, is one of the unacknowledged architects of the 21st Century, or at least it's most grandiose obsession - the end of the society. Miller's post-apocalypse vision has proven a cultural influence as seminal as George Romero's \"The Night of the Living Dead\" and it's unleashing of the zombie fixation that still flourishes without sign of a cure. Miller's second film in the the Mad Max series,\"The Road Warrior,\" starring the then-untarnished and astonishing beauty of young Mel Gibson was, in 1980, the excelerant to the let-it-all-burn frustrations of disenfranchised youths everywhere. Miller's genius, beyond plumbing the arid roads of Aussie outback, ala Leone, as his revisionist Western wasteland ridden by monster trucks, was to populate his tale of society in its last stages of entropy with mutated punks and steroid-ripped glam rockers in glorious leather and chainmail. A product of the energy-crisis era, he distilled the lifeblood of the humanity down to precious drops of high octane, fought and died for, to be fed reverently into Big Daddy \"Ed Roth\" hot rods that roared in the dust, sustaining and taking life, while spewing flame like pyres lit to Moloch. Miller's was a wholly original vision - a ripping post-apolcalyptic yarn that tapped into Sex Pistol's anarchy and stoked mohawked youth's ambitions to be last-rockers-on-earth. As a seer of things to come, time has revealed the acuity of Miller's dysto-vision as matched only by steampunk grandaddy H.G. Welles and techno-paranoia of Orwell. Today's apocalpyse fashionistas, pierced, tribally tattooed and encyclopedicially-versed in automatic weapons from their endless practice at survivalist video games, are the spawn of good Dr. Miller's vision. And when the power plants grind to a halt and the mayhem begins, he may even be cursed for his mad tetralogy of the road being the source a self-fulling prophesy.",

            "content": "Serving as a huge inspiration for countless post-apocalyptic tales, the Mad Max series was the original progenitor of the merciless wasteland setting in the eighties. Since then it seemed that Mel Gibson, Warner Bros and director George Miller had left the series for good. After three decades of absence, Mad Max makes his thunderous return to the silver screen and the result is one incredibly enjoyable action flick.\n\nMad Max Fury Road pursues a simplistic yet engaging plotline, which feels very distant from the previous films in the series; the world is little more than an endless wasteland with numerous bandit clans warring over the precious oil and water needed to sustain life. While being held captive by the War Boys, Max (Tom Hardy) seizes his chance to escape when War Rig driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) defies the clan's leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) to get a group of wives (who were specifically selected by Joe for breeding) to safety and possibly find a new home. From here, the tight-lipped Max forms a shaky alliance with Furiosa and it's full speed ahead across the wastes with Joe and other factions in hot pursuit. If you were expecting some action that the series is known for then Fury Road delivers in spades and then some; the film barrels along at top speed, only pausing to deliver a few moments of drama as the characters attempt to find a new home. It's complete madness, yet ironically this kind of plot is a perfect fit for both the ravaged setting and the characters that inhabit it. Despite not learning too much about how the wasteland came to be, it is still bursting with character and the psychotic clans go a long way towards selling the film's patented style which has been missing from the silver screen for so long.\n\nThe characters of Mad Max Fury may feel a little lacking at first; they're certainly far less outspoken than your usual action heroes. But then you realise that the casting forms a tight parallel with the overall setting. If you're new to the series, you may be surprised that both Max and Furiosa are fairly quiet and sane when compared to the raving lunatics that populate the gangs of the wastes. When Theron and Hardy do have lines, they are delivered with the gruffness and seriousness you would expect from characters forced to survive in a world like this. Theron in particular makes her presence felt as a strong willed and determined heroine who often steals the spotlight from Max over the course of the film. The quiet protagonists contrast against the War Boys who are characterised by rambling jargon mixed with peculiar religious undertones that give hints and clues about the nature of their clan. Often times there's a wild range of facial expressions on the actor's faces that definitely put across far more than any dialogue can. Ultimately, Fury Road proves that a lot can be done without dialogue, which is certainly a welcome change from other films in the same genre.\n\nWith a thirty-year gap between it and its predecessors; Mad Max Fury Road seizes every possible opportunity to push the boundaries of the series and the visual result is something to behold. The film is absolutely stunning, both from a technical and artistic standpoint. Imaginative car and costume designs put across the sheer chaos of the post-apocalyptic desert and both of these elements interact beautifully with the computer generated sandstorms. Then we have the chase sequences which all utilise practical effects, real stunt-work and pyrotechnics, meaning that the film never loses its punch no matter how many cars get tossed and mangled on-screen. Fury Road truly does honour its pedigree; you simply won't be able to take your eyes off the screen throughout the entirety of its run-time because the film succeeds very well at making its action impactful at every turn. Pulse-pounding sound effects and a rocking soundtrack also heighten the tension, whilst the cinematography is quick, clear and fluid despite the pure insanity of the action on-screen. Dare I say it, Mad Max Fury Road could be the most technically advanced movie ever to be based in an apocalyptic setting. You get the sense that the filmmakers didn't just want to bring Max back, but also wanted to set him apart from all other action sequences on the big screen.\n\nThe post-apocalyptic setting is ripe for all kinds of stories and Mad Max Fury Road is the tip of the spear by a substantial margin. It revitalises and updates the series whilst not forgetting what made the previous three films such stand-outs. Strap yourselves in and get ready for one of the year's best action films, Fury Road is the most explosive and rip-roaring good time you will have at the cinema this summer.",

In de vierde aflevering van de Mad Max franchise, het is een Australische en Amerikaanse onderneming geproduceerd door Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment en Village Roadshow Pictures. De film speelt zich af in een toekomstig woestijn woestenij waar benzine en water schaarse grondstoffen zijn. Hieruit volgt Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), die krachten bundelt met Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) te ontvluchten cult leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) en zijn leger in een gepantserde tankwagen, hetgeen leidt tot een langere weg gevecht. De film heeft ook Nicholas Hoult, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee en Courtney Eaton.\n\n--Kritische ontvangst:\n\n-Mad Max: Fury Road door velen geprezen. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes geeft de film een 97% goedkeuringsscore en waardering gemiddelde score van 8,8 uit 10 gebaseerd op 348 reviews. De sites consensus luidt, \"Met spannende actie en een verrassende vertelling , Mad Max: Fury Road brengt George Miller's postapocalyptisch franchise brullend krachtig terug tot leven.\" Op Metacritic, die een genormaliseerde score toewijst, heeft de film een score van 90 uit 100 gebaseerd op 51 critici, met vermelding \"success\". CinemaScore polls meld dat het gemiddelde cijfer bioscooppubliek de film  een \"B+\" op een A+ naar F-schaal heeft. Sommige critici bestempelden Mad Max: Fury Road een van de grootste actiefilms ooit gemaakt.\n\n-De film is ook geprezen door feministische critici op meerdere fronten, waaronder de dominante rol van Furiosa en het bereik van atypische vrouwelijke rollen waaronder de echtgenotes en de schietgrage Vuvalini.\n\n--Sequels: \n\n-In 2011, Miller en McCarthy vonden tijdens het schrijfproces voor Fury Road dat zij genoeg verhaal materiaal hadden voor twee extra scripts. Eén van deze, getiteld Mad Max: Furiosa,  waren reeds voltooid, en Miller hoopte te filmen na de release van Fury Road. In maart 2015, tijdens een interview met Esquire, Hardy onthulde dat hij was aangewezen te sterren in vier meer Mad Max films volgend Fury Road. In mei 2015, Miller vertelde Wired: \"Zou Fury Road succesvol zijn, ik heb twee andere verhalen te vertellen.\" Later in mei, Miller onthuld dat de plannen voor de sequel veranderd waren en de volgende tranche getiteld zou worden Mad Max: The Wasteland. In oktober 2015, Miller onthuld in een interview met TopGear.com dat ze twee scripts hadden voor sequels die ze verkregen tijdens het schrijfproces. Later in oktober in een interview met Digital Spy, hij onthuld dat Furiosa niet zou verschijnen in het vervolg en verduidelijkt dat Mad Max: The Wasteland is slechts een werktitel voor de sequel. Miller herbevestigt zijn voornemen om door te gaan met de franchise nadat rapporten van het tegendeel opdoken na een interview in januari 2016.",

Just lots and lots of fast driving and oodles of fighting. But it is spectacular to look at. The cinematography is sublime and the imagination of the film is writ large. So it makes for a cinematic blast but in the end I just really didn't care. I'm probably not the target audience for such a film.

While the previous movies of the franchise had a lot of visual chaos too, it was interwoven with tranquil scenes with many dialogues, things that conveyed the story and every new movie was connected to the previous by something: the car, the shotgun, etc. And it connected with other movies of the same theme too.

I enjoyed the mayhem, the big world depicted, the over-the-top characters... I even enjoyed what Charlize Theron and tom Hardy did with the characters they were depicting.  If the movie is a commentary on modern society, or if the movie is a critique of sex slavery, or if the movie is a deep philosophic expose of the need to face our demons, I'll leave to other critics.  I give the movie many stars because it is exactly what I anticipated it to be, namely, a balls-out nonstop fortissimo idiot-show of eye-bending, bone crunching violence and shit blowing up.  There is little reason to ask for more in our day and age.  \nThat being said, the larger commentary on this video is parallel to the comments I made on Jurassic World (seen in the same evening as this film): a staggering amount of violence and a puerile plot.  As I've already commented on the violence bit in the review of \"World\" this one receives the juvenile commentary.  \nWhat happened to PLOT in cinema?  Even action films in days of yore had a cohesive and somewhat interesting plot most of the time.  The ones that did not, the grindhouse cinema movies of the 1970s et alia, received little praise and rightfully so.  But this movie has a frickin' 97% rating from critics and 86: from the hoi poloi!  \nMovies are not just for entertainment but are a medium to tell stories and when the story is thin the other flaws are magnified and no amount of Michael Baying the explosions, revving up the video ramping, or adding extra red dye to the blood bags can improve that weakness.  \nIn Fury Road the plot is this; escape the trolls, drive out with the trolls chasing, turn around and drive back with the trolls chasing, defeat the trolls.  Really.  What else is there in this movie?  And though I might see it again, the grabbing power of that plot is so weak that I would just as soon crack open a beer and watch the crows attack my garbage cans.  Sure there were some neat explosions, some guys on long poles doing maniacal things, a dwarf attached to an oxygen machine, some sexy chicks getting run over by tractors (what else, like I said, do you need in a movie, amiright?)  ...but there was also a guitar-playing fella with no face strapped to one of the trollcars who played vamp music the entire time.  Who auditioned for that coveted job?  And when he auditioned why didn't he learn more than TWO FRICKIN' CHORDS?  Were the judge trolls like, \"Uhhh, THAT GUY!\"????   The soundtrack was like \"Barracuda\" without all the nuance - and on meth.\nAnd all the Deaths Heads (C) that covered everything ---cars, walls, ceilings of cars, necks, rock walls, tires on cars, grills of cars, cod pieces ... what? was there some company like \"Deaths Heads (C) Incorporated!\" saying, \"we got you covered, oh great Homunculus, sir\"? when the chief troll demanded a Deaths Head (C) codpiece to adorn his groin?   And how did these nubile creatures like Miss Kravitz, Miss Keough, and Miss Huntington-Whitely stay so pristine and lavender-smelling in the midst of this dusty, brutal, overheated world?  After a long chase, wouldn't they start smelling like everyone else? And the ridiculous names \"Imperator Furiosa\"?  \"People Eater\"? \"Corpus Collossus\"?  \"Rictus Erectus\"?  Hell - it sounds like something out of Spinal Tap or Loaded Diper.  Might as well have had a character named \"Biggus Dickus\".  None of this would have been problematic but that the story itself was a load of government cheese; enjoyable, tasty, but utterly worthless in the long run.\nMaybe that's my main beef with the beefcake in this film.  The whole thing seems like it was written, directed, produced by some testosterone-foaming 12 year old boy who wanted to see how much he could mash up women, tear out fetuses from the stomachs of their mothers, explode drug-crazed rockpunk psychopaths, maim old people, depict fat women hooked up to milking machines, portray anemic albinos hooked up to human blood bags, or explode vehicles in spectacular fashions.  It is two hours of fortississimo violence, noise, revving engines, vamping guitars, ramping cameras, and sand.  Without an ounce of story.  \nBut if you like that sort of thing?  Give it four stars out of five as I have so done.  There is little reason to ask for more in our day and age.",

Fury Road is a breathe of fresh air in a seemingly crowded over CGIed mess of an action movie genre. We haven't seen an action movie like this since the 2008 The Dark Knight. The design of the cars, costumes and makeup are fantastic, things I've never seen in a movie(be aware I've yet to watch any of the other Mad Max films, but will definitely do so after Fury Road). The cinematography and look of the film is gorgeous. Tom Hardy plays a great Max that has the potential to be even better in the next 2 movies he signed for. But Charlize Theron as Furiosa completely stole the show in Fury Road. She was awesome and badass character and really is kind of an inspiration to other women to fight for their rights and what they believe in. I honestly don't know why, but I felt that Charlize Theron deserved AT LEAST an Oscar Nomination for her role. The cherry on top out of all of this is the biggest reason why Fury Road is getting all the praise it deserves. The use of practical effects and real stunts. Little did I know that after watching Fury Road did I find out that most of this movie does not have any CGI. It's incredible, especially for an action movie as big as this. Which is why I emphasized why Fury Road is the king of the action movie genre, because it\n stands out from normal CGI filled action movies. George Miller, yet again created an action movie masterpiece that deserved his Oscar nomination. All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece on a massive scale that is more than worthy of its 10 Oscar nominations and it's 6 wins. I don't think anything will come close to the kind of production and action Fury Road has done. Mad Max: The Wasteland can't come soon enough.",

Not only that, but it has arrived within a fantastically-detailed and well-realised world that isn't afraid to be freaky or unconventional. instead, it thrives on such characteristics.\n\nThe cast are great (even though Hardy really isn't doing that much) and it's Furiosa who comes out as the real star- she may well simply oust Mad Max altogether and take his place (as long as Theron doesn't start saying the kinds of things that Mel Gibson does...)\n\nIt's a giant chase movie and it has a ton of action and instantly-quotable lines and a great villain and a rich and beautiful world to explore. I sound like a little boy as I try and summarise it but that's just how exciting this film is- seeing it was like watching Die Hard for the first time as a kid; the whole time I was just thinking 'man, that's awesome'. It's rare that a straight-up action film grabs me in that way anymore. \n\nWith most good action flicks I' d add the usual 'switch your brain off and dig in' line but for this one you can rest assured- feel free to delve into the film's meaning/social commentary/whatever because enough care and attention has went into that that you might actually take some things away from it if you go down that route. This is a smart action film that is still an action film at its core- it isn't trying to make us think, it just wants to entertain us and gives us some extras to go with it. \n\nEVERYTHING LOOKS REAL TOO (I only saw one shot where I felt like the effects took me out of the movie- ONE SHOT OUT OF SO, SO, MANY OF THEM). I was looking too- I was trying to catch it out, but, no Fury Road packs a real punch and you can see it right in front of you (unless all of the dust gets in your eyes!\n\nWhilst I clearly love this film, I will say that I was somewhat disappointed with how it began to come to an end. It's satisfying and fair but I also found it somewhat anti-climactic and just a little too easy- this film could easily have went on for another half hour without it even slightly beginning to bore due to its fast pace and constant action. I think it went for a happy ending (well, 'happy' in the context of its deranged world) and I'm not sure that it had to play it quite so safe. Also I wasn't hugely interested in Max's flashbacks as they just didn't feel necessary with so much else going on. \n\nAnyway, enough talk- WATCH IT.  IT IS GLORIOUS.",

            "content": "First of all 'No', just 'No' this is not a good movie. It's an over the top farce which simply cashes in on a dusty franchise without building on the character, the insanity, or the cunning of Max Rockatansky.\n\nThe movie's most interesting aspect is its opening where we get a taste of post apocalyptic life as Max is captured, inked and branded in a nightmarish city run by the evil lord Immortan Joe. The opening scenes feature mutations, deranged drug induced youths, fuel guzzling engines and a people enslaved by the control of water supply in a barren desert landscape.\n\nWhat happens next is a very sandy two hour car chase, incorporating a desert storm of biblical proportions, a flame throwing guitar, victoria secret virgins, monster trucks, and various gangs which help give pursuit to the increasing escalation of nonsense.\n\nThe problem with the movie is that there is no realism, not that it hurts to be removed from reality in a science fiction movie, but what I mean is that the lead characters are indestructible despite several run ins with death throughout the movie. For the first twenty minutes Max is used as a Type O blood bag without so much as receiving a cookie, then he unflinchingly partakes in two hours of truck driving combat. There is no connection to Max or to the female lead Furiosa, we don't know their motives, how they've both wound up at the citadel, where they're going, how they intend to survive, and worse is that we don't feel any empathy for them despite the severe lacerations they receive throughout. Ultimately the characters are sub material to a movie that concentrates on being loud and jam packed with adolescent fantasy. Although the landscape is vast the movie has no depth. There is no tension in the fight scenes, car chases truck, some meaningless extra gets killed, truck gets speared, car blows up, repeat for two hours, charge ten bucks a head, release to DVD.\n\nFor me the film fails to fire from both barrels, it's more of a 'Max and his moths' kinda movie than the rage filled road warrior epic I was expecting. My only advice is if you go to see Fury Road don't be afraid to walk, it never gets better, and don't be fooled into thinking it's nearly over, it's not. Just get up off your seat, don't apologise to the idiot beside you, kick them if you must, shout abuse if appropriate, just do whatever it takes to make your way to the green exit sign and go.\nRead more reviews @ http://www.thechampsvoice.com/movie-reviews",

Breathtaking action and road rage that Miller keeps from us for so many years finally gives us back in mad franchise sequel. Every planed scene and desert wasteland is escape to mad adventure that you can't get out until the end of the movie. Vehicles and chase is portrayed with power in them and badass destruction. Once more Hardy shows us that he is capable of doing seriously fantastic movies and giving us special performance. Charlize as Furiousa is something special as she takes us to journey of good and mad. As Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings universe, George Miller gave us Mad Max universe. 100/100",

            "content": "From beginning to end, Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop, thrilling action film that manages to balance the characterization, effects, and direction of this chaotic dystopia in the most beautiful manner. Two times was the charm for me to be convinced that Mad Max deserved every single piece of acclamation it was getting. Director George Miller created the most engaging, fictional world with the right amount of action, with the perfect cast, and without never overloading the film with too many explosions or special effects.\n\nThe main cast, Tom Hardy and (Who would have thought?!) Charlize Theron, are just phenomenal and work perfectly together. While the plot can easily speak on its own, this would've never worked without the right cast. It is impressive how they manage to make a mostly serious movie with extremely small hints of comedy here and there, entertaining and interesting.\n\nNow it is time to praise everything else. Sound and visual effects, production design, cinematography, costumes, makeup, and hair styling. Seriously. When I was talking about having an unexpected perfectly good balance I was not joking. The sound mixing and special effects are truly remarkable, bringing the movie to life and letting you in into the mayhem this world is. The costume, makeup and hair styling, hint at everything each character is, their personalities, and a glimpse at some back-story there is no time to tell within the two hours. And the cinematography directs you to what's important, and you are able to appreciate how involved each scene is.\n\nMad Max is successful because it manages to turn an insane film, a chaotic film, into one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. Mind you, I am not big on action movies. It is not easy to control and shape this amount of chaos and confusion into a good film. At one point I had to ask myself, is this really an action movie? Because it is so freaking good. Mad Max is just incredibly good.",

Director George Miller proves action can still be as exhilarating, unique, and narratively profound through practical effects and by using action as a vessel to his overall story. Fury Road not only demands constant attention to the small, non-verbal narrative details, but also requires some thought process. Viewers should not be surprised if they're still finding details in their third or fourth viewing that they didn't find previously--a feat that many hollow action films should've aimed for. Tom Hardy gives a superb performance in a role Mel Gibson left behind, but it is Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa that steals the screen, and our hearts as one of the more memorable characters in any Mad Max Film. For those who haven't previously seen a Mad Max film, I would definitely encourage them to check out the first and/or second film, but Fury Road can be watched and mostly understood on its own.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de George Miller transformierte das post-apokalyptische Entertainment in eine singuläre Zukunfts-Vision von zunehmender Verzweifelung. Drei Dekaden nach dem letzten Film kehrt Miller nun endlich in die desolate Landschaft von Mad Max zurück. Die Titelrolle übernimmt der ständig nörgelnde Tom Hardy. Mad Max Fury Road zieht mit einem Versprechen ins Feld: Wie werden die Wüsten-Vehikel aussehen? Wie umwerfend werden die Stunts ausfallen? Von der ersten Minute an, besitzt Mad Max IV die Energie eines Veteranen auf der Höhe seines Könnens: Miller reisst uns mit ohne die billigen Special Effects oder papierdünnen Charaktere, die Sommer-Blockbuster so gern aufbieten. Der Erfinder des post-apokalyptischen Genres führt einer ganzen Generation von Filmemachern vor, wie sie ungeschickt und stolpernd versuchten, in seine Fuss-Stapfen zu treten. Die Welt ist verrückt geworden in einem logisch nachvollziehbaren Ausmass. Die Bewohner von Max Rockatanskys Welt sind nicht länger Wilde auf der Jagd nach Benzin. Sie wurden zu Kreaturen ihrer Lebensumstände. Zurückgelassene ohne besondere Bedürfnisse oder einen Grund zum Weiterleben. Fury Road ist ein gewalttätiger Film, aber die Brutalität resultiert nicht aus herkömmlicher Action. Sie resultiert aus blankem Wahnsinn. Max ist kein Krieger mehr. Er stellt einen Mann dar, angetrieben von Erinnerungen aus der Vergangenheit, der nicht mehr tut als zu überleben. Während Max am Abgrund wandelt wird er entführt und dient nun im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes als Blutsack für einen Krieger namens Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Nux ist einer derjenigen, der den Launen des irren Anführers Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne - er spielte bereits eine kleine Rolle im Original Mad Max) dienen. Miller gönnt uns keine Minute, uns an diese Welt zu gewöhnen. Er wirft uns einfach ins Geschehen (ich wusste überhaupt nicht, was ein Blutsack ist!). Die Bilder beschleunigen, der Schnitt wirkt hyperaktiv, der Bösewicht spricht durch eine Maske, so dass wir die Hälfte seiner Worte gar nicht verstehen. Die schreckliche Vision von Millers Zukunft kommt schnell und zornig! Immortan Joe wirkt wie ein kaum lebendiger Freak, der nur durch Schläuche atmen kann. Seine Untertanen sind entstellte Figuren mit Namen wie Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) und The People Eater (John Howard). Eine von Joes auffälligsten Kriegerinnen ist Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), die einen Convoy anführt. Es kommt heraus, dass sie Joes \"Breeders\" entführt hat: Junge Frauen, die sein männliches Erbe sichern sollen. Sie bringt sie zum \"green place\" und natürlich lässt Joe sie verfolgen. Eine lange Jagd durch die erbarmungslose Wüste folgt. Mit Ausnahme von einem längeren Dialog (dem Herzstück von Mad Max Fury Road) ist der Film permanent in Bewegung: Rasend, jagend, explodierend, prahlend durch Millers verbrannte Landschaft. Max strebt einfach nur noch voran, um zu vergessen, Nux ist ein Trottel mit Gehirnwäsche (er glaubt, er würde in Valhalla wiedergeboren werden). Das Gewicht aber liegt auf Furiosa: sie glaubt an das Einzige, das ihr Hoffnung gibt - die nächste Generation. Das soll nun aber nicht andeuten, die Action ginge in dieser Botschaft unter. Mad Max Fury Road lässt mit allen filmischen Mitteln jede andere Autojagd aussehen wie einen Sonntagsausflug. Wie Joes Männer Furiosas Vehikel entern ist nur der Auftakt für den grössten Action Film aller Zeiten! Miller denkt dabei an etwas, dass die meisten Filmemacher vergessen: Er grenzt seine Action genau ein. Wir wissen genau, wo wir uns befinden und wohin es gehen soll. Der Film liegt vor uns wie eine Landkarte. Dann wird all das in die Luft gejagt! Es gibt dutzende an Explosionen und Unälle, Körperteile fliegen durch die Luft und ein Krieger spielt Heavy Metal Gitarre. Dabei werden die Emotionen immer grösser. Schliesslich tritt Miller auf die Bremse - und begeistert drückt es uns in die Kinosessel: Rache und Vergeltung, die Essenz von Mad Max Fury Road. mehr auf cinegeek.de",

        {
            "content": "Thirty years is a long time to wait for a new installment in a film franchise, but Mad Max: Fury Road overcomes this problem for a variety of reasons. Firstly, director George Miller simply doesn't care if you're familiar with what's come before. He's also smart enough to forge a path down Fury Road that avoids Reboot Alley, Sequel Street, Prequel Avenue, and Remake Boulevard. This Mad Max is its own movie, which is wildly refreshing. Even more importantly, it's an insane orgy of fire and carnage that contains more originality and vision in its first 15 minutes than did last year's entire summer movie season.\n\nTom Hardy is the new Max Rockatansky, and we're reintroduced to the road warrior just as he gets picked up by a rabid band of War Boys, the white-skinned lizard-like army that worships the old tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). While Max is being held as a source of blood for sickly War Boys like Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Joe's most loyal soldiers betrays him. The Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) absconds with Joe's most powerful rig and five of his most desired breeders.\n\nI've already said it, but it bears repeating: It doesn't matter that you don't know what this stuff means. It's all there, and it all makes sense in the context of what's on the screen. By the time Max is hooked, masked, and strung up on the hood of Nux's vehicle, we know everything we need to know about this world, its inhabitants, and their motivations. Why does Furiosa have a mechanical arm? Doesn't matter. What's the deal with all the breast milk? Doesn't matter. Why is there a guy playing a guitar that shoots flames in the midst of all this carnage? Doesn't fucking matter.\n\nThat balls-to-the-wall, I-don't-care-what-you-think style of filmmaking is cool, but it also serves a purpose here. It forces you to constantly stay in the moment. These characters don't digress, and they rarely pontificate. Their pasts, fears, and hopes will sometimes define their choices and actions-like Furiosa's decision to take the women away from Joe-but they aren't things that need to be discussed and debated. The thing they're most concerned about is survival, and the thing they're second-most concerned about doesn't exist. That state-of-mind is not just apparent, but tangible in every sweet frame of this movie.\n\nAnd the actors convey this state-of-mind perfectly. Neither Tom Hardy nor Charlize Theron says much over the course of the film, but they don't need to. They're two of the finest actors of their generation-capable of relaying more with a look than could any amount of words. (With this film, Tom Hardy reclaims the title of best male actor from Joaquin Phoenix in my mind, but we'll see what Irrational Man brings later this summer.) In their eyes are a lifetime of pain and exhaustion, but there's also a fire and a fight that burns as brightly as any explosion we see over the film's two hours.\n\nAnd there are a lot of explosions, a lot of fire in Mad Max: Fury Road. On Miller's monochromatic desert backdrop, it looks amazing. Perhaps more amazing than the blazing reds and oranges are the night scenes' sumptuous blues. Even in 3D, the film's colors pop spectacularly, and you'll be treated to some eye-popping moments, especially toward the film's finale. (You won't find a better post-conversion than this.) Let's not screw this up; John Seale needs an Oscar nomination here.\n\nI'm not sure where the Mad Max series goes from here, but I don't really care. I'm happy that a film like this can get made today. I'm happy that Miller revived this character to tell an important story that strives to advance the cause of feminism in film. Hell, I'm simply happy that there are people as creative as those behind this movie working in the industry. It's easy to forget that with so much disposable nonsense out there. But this film refuses to go down that road, and the result is something that sets the bar high, not just for the summer of 2015, but for every studio, every filmmaker, every creator.\n\njohnlikesmovies.com",

It's the purest and one of the best straight action films I've seen.\n\nWhile the film rarely takes a breath during its two hour runtime, the little snippets of characterization provide compelling reasons to root for the heroes, and even sympathize with its villains. Also, while I don't know if you could call it a \"feminist piece\", it handles a surprising wealth of female characters with incredible grace, never falling prey to the genre's most common failings of damseling its women or having them overcompensate with fierce masculinity. In fact, all the colorful characters in the film simply... are. They feel like effortless extensions of the mad world they inhabit. Even the antagonist's crazed henchmen are given proper motivations for their behavior.\n\nFor the full review, visit http://powerwolf.ink/meme//mad-max-fury-road",

I was expecting it to be a super cool action flick and was pretty dissapointed. Also the guitar guy is barely in the movie so I don't know why he had so much hype.

It does create some stunning backgrounds, but that's that. Critics hail it's feminist POV, but I have no idea what the hell they are referring to. Is Max a feminist because he helps a group of women try to escape their bondage to a family of insane, power hungry men? This could have been written in 1950, but never made because of the over the top, gruesome treatment.\n\nI'm afraid its another overpraised, stinking turd of a film, not funny, entertaining or involving in any way at all.

I wanted to watch it again because of how high it was rated after looking it up on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. To my full surprised even Critics were raving about this. HOW?

This however works beautifully here, surrounding itself with beautifully vibrant scenery and the ever present threat that chases the rig. Action scenes are inventive, dramatic and among the very best that I have seen before.

Rarely have chase scenes been so exciting, rarely have landscapes looked so gorgeous, and rarely has a colour palette been so varied and striking. By opting to stage practical action sequences with stunt drivers and real vehicles instead of CGI and computer simulations, not only does the action feel more kinetic, it also feels more human. We're seeing real people doing real driving and taking real risks. As it was with the Indiana Jones trilogy, it gives everything a more authentic feel, and proves that special effects are no substitute for human involvement.\nWith all that said, the story in the movie is where a lot is left to be desired. The characters, while underdeveloped, do interact and co-operate in a believable way, united in the universal quest for survival and freedom, but all of them exist in something of a narrative vacuum. The entire thing is more or less a 2-hour car chase, and while all of these sequences are executed beautifully, they don't really serve a higher purpose. I definitely wouldn't hail it as the best of the series, as many other viewers have done. The political commentary is familiar to anyone who has seen the other MM movies, and Max is, as he was in the second film, relegated to a supporting performance in his own film. But with all that instalment, if you're in it for the action, this movie delivers like no other in recent memory. It could do with being a fair bit meatier, but for the adrenaline junky in all of us, it's more than enough to satisfy our appetites.",

I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, it's out there, but it's a great film. Tom Hardy is supposedly contracted for more films, and if they are as good as Fury Road, I'll be there to see them.",

I heard all of the hype about how Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the greatest movies ever made and how it's a cinematic masterpiece. About how it gives you a rush and sometimes you need a break just to slow your heartbeat. \n\nI honestly don't get it.\n\nMaybe the hype behind the movie is what I see when I see Fury Road. What I see when I watch Fury Road is something that is just all spectacle. Is the action good to look at. You're damn right it is. The car carnage of the wasteland is incredible to look at. There's a guy with a flamethrower guitar! But that's not what I want to stand out the most when I see a movie.\n\nThe main thing I look for when I'm watching a movie like this a a combination of exciting and engaging action, as well as a good story. This movie lacks the story part because it is too simple. There is not a lot about the wasteland and it's inhabitants that makes me interested about them. How did Furiosa get that arm? How did Imorton Joe rise to power? Who were those people that Max was haunted by? Who were those people on the sticks? There is no context given so I'm not interested and do not care. Is Furiosa a badass? Yes! But as cool as that is I don't care about her because I know so little.\n\nIn summation Mad Max: Fury Road is all spectacle and nice to look at, but really nothing else.",

Mad Max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle, and we watch cars blow each other up.  There's not that much more going on - until maybe 60% into the movie when the Charlize Theron character explains she's trying to get back home - and eventually needs to return to where the movie started.\n\nThere are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears, again with little context.  People spray themselves with paint, one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front, whose axe shoots flames out of its neck.  And this goes on for two and a quarter hours.\n\nHowever, the way the visuals are conceived is stunning.  The home city has mammoth levels strung on hyper-industrial styled gears, with muscular percussionists pounding out something - for some reason.  It looks cool.  But to no intelligent end.",

            "content": "'Mad Max: Fury Road' Review: Explosive Madness, Out of its Mind. 9ish.\n\nHis name is Max - and he's a man of few words.\n\nWriter/director George Miller has brought his apocalyptic franchise back from the wasteland for a \"revisiting\" - he refuses to call this a reboot or sequel. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is filled with gorgeous, chaotic action, all shot in a spectacular fashion.\n\nFiery vehicle chases? Check. Lightning-filled sandstorms? Check. Deranged war boy playing a guitar with flamethrower attached? Um, check.\n\nWe mustn't question the madness - we must just accept it. One may get a dry throat and need water watching the film - I'll pass on the scarce, worshipped breast milk though.\n\nMax Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has visions of his murdered family as he seeks ultimate redemption. He wants to go home, but there's a problem - he doesn't have one.\n\nThe movie opens with Max being chased through a post-apocalyptic desert and captured. He is taken to Immortan Joe's citadel, where Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), viscously rules by controlling the only supply of water. Max is hooked up to be a living blood bank for the War Boys, Joe's psychotic army.\n\nMax is chained to Nux's (Nicholas Hoult) car, as the War Boys chase after the rebel, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). She's on the run for stealing the five wives of her boss Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Her plan is to take the women - the \"breeders\" - in search of the \"green place.\" This is home to water, fruit, plants and grass - a sharp contrast to the apocalyptic desert where they live - and a better life.\n\nAfter Max escapes - and after a few early scuffles - he and Furiosa form an uneasy alliance, more a case of \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" than true friendship.\n\nEventually, Max, Furiosa and the wives, along with a reformed War Boy, Nux, decide to turn around and take down the psychotic empire that's after them.\n\nIf it was wild when Furiosa turned left, it gets a whole lot wilder when they turn around.\n\nThe movie itself is worth the cost of the DVD/Blu-ray, but the special features are really what set it apart from the rest. The insight is important to truly understand why this film boasts a 97 percent, certified fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe most fascinating thing about the film is the stunts, which use real stuntmen. The production crew even brought members of Cirque du Soleil to help out. There were many moments on set when George Miller was quite concerned about potential injuries from blowing cars up or pole dancers (not that kind of pole dancer) mounted on moving vehicles.\n\n\"Fury Road\" was created entirely from storyboards, 3,500 panels of them in fact. The crew decided the deserts of Africa were the best place to shoot, for there were several chases involved that covered many miles and they needed that environment.\n\nThe conditions were tough on the cast because it was extremely cold when they began the eight-month-long production. The actors said it was isolating and seemed to make them a little crazier.\n\nIn one special feature, Hardy says he had lunch with Mel Gibson, the original Max, who passed the torch.\n\nThere's an underlying feminist stance throughout the whole movie, which is covered in a special feature with the five wives and Furiosa. Miller wanted to create a powerful woman who had great beauty but was also a warrior, to stand against Max. The five wives are worshipped because they breed Joe's babies. Hardy said it is very much Furiosa's movie and Max is just along for the ride as a companion.\n\nThere is a special feature included that is dedicated to the 140 vehicles created for the movie, with many different makes and models. Military trucks were used as the foundation due to their bulky, strong bodies. The crew covers the most important vehicle in the movie, the War Rig, in depth. Miller refers to it as the most important character other than the humans.\n\nExpect the film to hang around during award season, because there has never been an action movie like this - it will kick your ass. To paraphrase the War Boys cry, \"Fury Road\" is \"perfect in every way.\"\n\nCheck out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!",

You could analyze this movie and make it seem like a piece written by a literature master: protagonists taking their freedom, woman empowerment, and environmental awareness. To some extent, this is all on display. How much credit should be given to Miller and Co.? Whether or not Miller wanted to just use a story to display precise/huge action sequences, or he actually wanted to \"say\" something, we won't know. But some credit should be given for its \"narrative heft\" (RT.com), intentional or a result of just good story-telling. For me, the  action did get redundant. Also, I didn't root enough for the five \"wives\" escape. It seemed they had it better than the rest of the city. Many cultures accept multiple wives. Were they slaves that hated their lives? Most likely, but this was made even more unclear when one of the five wives actually contemplated going back. I also wish Max got back into his car and wreaked more havoc. Overall I liked it, but it's not the best of the year like some claim it to be.",

A likeable cast heads a dystopian piece packed full of beautiful cinematics and jaw clenching action sequences. Yet despite this I left the film feeling a lack of awe and inspiration. This is in part due to the tiresome plot which acts as a prophetic odyssey but instead frames as a consistent action pursuit romp. Although played by the talented Hardy I found the titular lead underwhelming and underdeveloped. I feel this had less to do with Hardy's performative efforts and more to do with the characterisation in the script and plot. This may be in part a nostalgic attempt by Miller to homage its previous incarnation or an unfortunate side-effect from the emphasis on Theron's Furiosa. Whatever the reason, I find the underwhelming nature of such an original and iconoclast character to be a great departure from Gibson's lunatic apocalypse cop and as such the major downfall of the piece. \nWhilst certainly a good movie, one can't help thinking its not deserving of the multitudes of praise which it is being given",

Miller started out actually dealing with editing and the vehicle chases in the earlier Mad Max movies. This film is sped up literally in order to keep the pace and you definitely lose a sense of rational. It is a chase to be remembered with wild special effects. Tom Hardy is passable as Mad Max although he could be any man fighting his way through a dystopian society. Charlize Theron added her touch to her heroine of the piece with a relish that would make Sigourney Weaver in Aliens proud. Yet I kept on saying that this film is nominated against films like Spotlight and The Revenant. It certainly is well made though I do not think it warrants the nominations. I loved George Miller's eye for detail; he hired a mega team to handle it all. And its focus for detail showed up in earlier films. My favorite would be Babe; a story about a pig's life. Yet this picture is beyond Cecil B. DeMille and borders on a Pink Floyd' The Wall approach. You know there's a good guy, people to be saved, and the bad guys. And you work your way to the end. Afterwards you feel assaulted (the theatre had the volume turned on super high) and left breathless. It is a roller coaster ride of a movie. Yet I left the theatre not knowing or caring much for the characters. i wanted to explore Max's psyche further; he was no more than a persona much like Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. In the age of video games, you would hope that detail would not be lost. In this case you will lose yourself in the design of the movie. Fantastic special effects and makeup are present. You can't help but admire the technical artistry. You just hope there would be more heart lurking somewhere in such a technical achievement.",

The story is pretty basic: women escape from hell looking for liberty and life, only to return after killing the evil ruler and his main henchmen to start anew. Oh, and the top babe almost, I said almost (remember now this is the apocalyptic future; no time for hope here) has feelings for her accidental saviour. Ah, what a romance. \n\nWith many of the horrific, destructive fight scenes fought at such an exaggerated,  frantic pace, it's a surprise all involved don't merely die from heart attacks. But you get a general idea what the film is going for when the bossman's babe is dead, and he has one of his henchmen cut the dead mom open only to see if his baby is alive, and upon finding that he is dead (I almost had a baby brother! I almost had a baby brother!) he is tossed aside like so much dead meat. At times the antics of the death squad is so silly its almost comical, such as when they spray their teeth with chrome, an allusion to the love for the shiny vehicles they worship as they hope for a battle death to take them via glory to Valhalla. \n\nAn often silly, even unnecessarily abusive film to convey a story of little import that means little to most, that is unless you're an aspiring death squad recruit looking to take out the boss man to glory and victory.

Story? \"A woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper(sic), and a drifter named Max.\"\n\nI guess if you have great memories of the original movie or if you have a thing for George Miller, this was the greatest thing ever --especially in super duper 3d. To me, it was a never-ending car chase from point A to B and then back to A, filled with fighting scenes, flat characters, supermodels turned wannabe-actresses and an almost mute protagonist. What else did I expect from a schizophrenic writer/director who not only created the Mad Max franchise nearly forty years ago, but whose last three writing and directing credits are Babe: Pig In The City and Happy Feet 1 & 2?\n\nI guess I expected too much. Even with so much garbage polluting the big screen these days, this one didn't rise above most of the big budget muck that we get to 'enjoy' as entertainment.

Upstream, the first Mad Max was a unique & exhilarating dystopian nightmare of a semi-horrific road rage film encapsulating the raw brutishness of the Australian collective consciousness of the 1970s. Remember it wasn't made that long after Aboriginal First nations peoples gained the right to vote. And then truck engine sized cars roamed the Aussie roads where roadside eucalyptus trees had big American copies of GM and Ford cars wrapped around the trees making them look like tinsel on Aussie Christmas trees set in the blinding heat and dust of the outback. One could be forgiven for feeling like being in A George Miller film even outside the cinema in the Australian reality of the time. Fury Road has a Jerry Bruckheimer-ish feel to it with Australian models who act like a gang of bangers from Zoolander walking down the catwalk with David Bowie wincing at their garish Derelict Ozzie-style clothing. But the film has somehow captured an audience who seeks solace in a cinema from the ever-present real thrills and spills of the dominant paradigm of daily worldwide terrorism events.",

Yes the visuals are fantastic, Charlize Theron is fantastic of course, but I just couldn't get past how shallow and silly the whole premise of it all is.  Sure, there are some ironies there and as a popcorn flick for the masses it is not exactly difficult to follow. I just can't do it and despite the manic action sequences I was bored and as soon as they said they were going all the way BACK to where they started I was out.  I simply do not have the patience to go through all of that nonsense in reverse and could care less how it ended.  I rate the story at like maybe a half star but gave it 3 because Charlize's screen presence mixed with the high budget style and CGI is worthwhile just to look at despite the story line.

Very weak at best, with so little character development it left gaping holes in the whole escape from the tyrannical bad man scenario.\n\nAnother glaring omission, was no Australian actors! This apocalyptic world of Mad Max is suppose to be in Australia. I guess the Casting Director went out for drink when these actors were chosen. Bad idea. All American accents, and NO Aussies. Maybe for this flick, it didn't make much difference as there is so little dialog between actors and their weak-ass story. Non-stop chase scenes w/gratuitous killing gets a bit stale w/o a decent story to fill-in. Under The Thunderdome quality it ain't there by a long shot.

The casting is pretty awesomely perfect, and Tom Hardy's demeanor fulls up the pages of script he doesn't talk through.\n\nA few big takeaways: obviously, the action and stunts were breathtaking. If there's a film out there that makes a better case for practical stunts and effects, I haven't seen it. Everything in this movie is based around real explosions, real crashes, and the interaction with the physical environment, therefore you end up with an incredible scale of thought and detail put into the reasons for everything and some pretty amazing visuals to accompany the story. Another thing is the extreme visualism with which George Miller has brought back to Mad Max is absolutely stunning; it creates amazing editing and action that is so in your face but at the same time easy to follow and understand. Finally, the soundtrack almost never leaves and, while loud and crazy, sets its paces and sticks with the action incredibly well. The movie is even self-aware about it's music, pairing it with a specific vehicle in the film that forces the viewer to be reminded about the music playing and brings it to light constantly, but not so much as to distract.\n\nAs with most, there's also an incredible feminism empowerment plotline to the story that shines, but doesn't feel forced. There's just strong and powerful female characters that kick all the ass, straight and simple. There's no reason why or why not, and that's what all movies and filmmakers should take as a huge lesson from Fury Road.\n\nDefinitely make a point to get to the theater for this one - a small screen will GUARANTEED not do the action justice.

A film so energetic, so well-oiled and with a story that moves along faster than Max's own Interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished. The first thing I love about it is Miller's direction. He almost completely does away with the shaky-cam fight scenes of recent action films and now, finally, we have someone who knows when to employ what technique. When to use slow motion (or when to go fast motion), when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact. Miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film - here we have fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue. Characters are developed as we see the world they live in. We feel for Nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder, unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys (A surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world). We feel for Furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side. The character of Max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films, but Miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations, so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon. Something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads, and personally I have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does. Yes, the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men, but it never addresses this, it just lets them do their thing, almost as if - could it be possible - woman can be proactive too??!",

It is an incredible action film and marrying the story with the action is important and it's main strength but I am suggesting that the action/chase movie is could be bigger. There is little time spent on building relationships between the characters and the viewer. Now is a good time to remember that I prefer drama films so this could be the perfect feminist action film and I may not recognize how perfect it is.\n\nI waited to watch it a second time because I wanted to have a better sound system which I now have.

It seemed unlikely that the director, now known for such family-friendly fare as Babe and Happy Feet would decide to revisit the world he created with the first Mel Gibson as Mad Max back in 1979. So I was surprised when Miller decided to direct another installment with Tom Hardy taking on the role Gibson played in the first three films. Hardy is an excellent choice, he is good actor and has a great physical presence and can suffer photogenically like Mel did (especially in The Road Warrior). But Max is almost a secondary character in this film, Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa whose rebellious act stealing the brides of Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the Toecuter back in the first Mad Max film). Missing an arm (thanks to CGI) and with her hair cut surprisingly short, the de-glamorized Theron is just as riveting and physical in her performance as Hardy.  The first half of the film is a chase and second half is a race. And yes, there is a surprising feminist subtext to the film as well as a not-so-surprising environmental subtext to this film.",

A film so energetic, so well-oiled and with a story that moves along faster than Max's own Interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished. The first thing I love about it is Miller's direction. He almost completely does away with the shaky-cam fight scenes of recent action films and now, finally, we have someone who knows when to employ what technique. When to use slow motion (or when to go fast motion), when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact. Miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film - here we have fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue. Characters are developed as we see the world they live in. We feel for Nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder, unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys (A surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world). We feel for Furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side. The character of Max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films, but Miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations, so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon. Something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads, and personally I have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does. Yes, the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men, but it never addresses this, it just lets them do their thing, almost as if - could it be possible - woman can be proactive too??!",

            "content": "The surprise smash hit of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel/reboot to George Miller's Mad Max (1979). What's strange about Miller is that apart from his Mad Max franchise his biggest accomplishments have been writing both Babe and Happy Feet. Very peculiar then that from the same director comes literally the most action packed film of the last decade. Unfortunately however this very strength becomes its greatest weakness.\n\nWhilst visually stunning there is barely a narrative driving the action foreword. The story goes that in a post apocalyptic wasteland, where chrome and oil are worshipped and water is in short supply, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) decides to run away from Immortal Joe, the man in charge of said chrome, oil and water, taking all of his 'wives' with her. That's essentially it, what follows next is a two hour long car chase. Somehow this Max character (Tom Hardy) tags along for the ride and apart from being able to drive in a straight line and being nifty with a wrench doesn't really add much.\n\nTheron's Furiosa is amazingly bad-ass and the only really likeable character. It's worth mentioning that it's great to see a strong female lead in an action film such as this. Hardy's Max on the other hand barely says ten words and doesn't really feel justified as the titular character. Nicholas Hoult gives an unrecognisable performance as Nux a young 'war boy' but any real hope of a character arc, for him and nearly all characters, is sacrificed in place of crane cam shots of exploding vehicles.\n\nThe mostly practical visual effects are amazing to behold and Miller should be applauded for his return to physical effects and sparse use of green screen. It's visually stunning but only remains interesting for so long. Coming in at exactly two hours it felt at least half an hour too long. When Max and friends finally escape their pursuers I thought it was over and the perfect ending point, however this was not the case. They make the decision to return through the desert from where they came to confront their captor. At this point I felt cheated, not only were all the previous car chases pointless now there was to be another half hour of exactly the same.\n\nFury Road is an amazing technical achievement and should be recognised as such but unfortunately in order to uphold this, narrative and character development are sacrificed.",

            "content": "15 year old production hiatus, drastic changes in shooting locations, cast revamp. The fact that Mad Max Fury Road, the 4th installment of a long forgotten but highly revered franchise was made braving all these odds is nothing short of an incredible event in the recent movie history. And oh yes it's a sight to behold.\nFury road takes us back to the arid dystopia which auteur George miller introduced about 35 years ago. Only now Miller has upped his game by several notches. Thanks to the massive $ 150 mn budget and creative freedom conferred on the creators by the studio.  Landscapes are brighter,  more dreadful, vehicles bigger and more revved up, the mad madder. Enter Immortan Joe, a ghoulish dictator/self-proclaimed messiah who has taken over an entire citadel by stealing its water supply.  Under his wing is an army of ailing  skinheads called the 'War Boys' who have been promised slots in Valhalla in exchange for suicidal fanaticism towards Joe and his ideas.  This works very well given the downcast society where everyone is looking for redemption . Status quo turns into bedlam when Joe's army imperator, Furiosa (Played by the dazzling Charlize theron) goes rogue after stealing Joe's most prized possessions, his wives during a supply run. What ensues is a long exhilarating, chase sequence between furiosa and Joe accompanied by his army of white minions. Thrown in the midst of all this chaos is Max Rockitanksy who is picked as a human power cell by Nux, a starry eyed war boy for his pursuit on fury road. While max was rigged with ample gadgetry in the previous movies he is stripped down to one single instinct, that of survival (The Famous interceptor is shredded between two giant trucks in one of the scenes).  Against will he is forced to help furiosa and the wives flee to a safe haven called the green place. Lean plot? Yes. Shallow? Definitely not.\n\tAmidst all the edge of the seat action sequences it is easy to miss the subtexts which the writers have carefully interlaced with the main story line. While the original script was slated as one long chase sequence, it became denser with time like a bottle of aging wine. Furiosa's missing arm (the elephant in the room), freakish figures scavenging swamps, Max's strange time hopping visions might all be part of a bigger universe whose surface was merely grazed in fury road. We will have to wait for the promised sequels to watch these elements unfold. (Yes there are more movies in line).\n\tAt the helm of the movie is a mastermind who has crafted his art of direction over years. While he might be pretty inconsistent in making movies George Miller's devotion and bravura puts most his younger contemporaries to shame. Millers uses his outlandish creativity and visceral filmmaking style to make some of the most unforgettable action sequences ever made. Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale (The English patient) who came out of retirement for the project delivers with some stunning shots of Namibian Desert. The art direction and production design are equally stellar. Be it the adorable tumors on Nux's neck , the super cool skeleton engraving on the war rigs door or suave interiors of Immortal's Elysium , the amount of detail that has gone into each character, vehicle or set piece is simply staggering. (Check out the vehicle gallery on the official movie to know what I'm talking about). It would be a sin not to mention Margaret Sixel who puts her editing skills to to make the entire movie look like one long thrilling chase sequence.  Junkie XL's operatic score works as a perfect complement to the mood of the movie. \n\nBut the real stars of the movie in my opinion is its stunt crew. It is incredible and admirable how these guys pulled off a majority of death defying, jaw dropping, and plain batshit crazy stunts with real people and real vehicles instead of doing it the easy way. War boys, polecats, flamers would all have stayed as concepts had it not been for their raw calculated gutsiness.  My adulation goes for the entire stunt team.  This is analog movie making at its best. If you didn't see this on the biggest loudest screen, you definitely missed something.\n\tOne of the biggest surprises of Fury Road was how the movie was not about Max but Furiosa, a warrior equally or more broken than the titular character (We see what you did there with the deceiving trailers, WB). Deeply conflicted and often poignant she tries to bring sense to a mad society. Played flawlessly by Charlize Theron, Furiosa is easily one of the strongest female characters to emerge out of an action flick. She is definitely among the ranks of Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conor and likes. Replacing Mel Gibson is a more reticent, feral, Tom Hardy who gets the job done but becomes subdued by Furiosa's intense screen charisma. Nicholas Hoult also puts a heartfelt performance as Nux, a rather demure war boy and Hugh Kayes Byrne as the nefarious yet graceful antagonist. \n\nAgainst all the praises I have heard some strong criticisms about the apparent feminist undertones of the story, but I wonder does it really matter? At heart Fury Road is a straight up action flick with beautifully choreographed stunts, minimal dialogues, strong characters and a seemingly linear storyline. There is no subtle way to put it. Fury Road is every adrenaline Junkies dream come true. If road warrior is the punk's Sistine chapel, Fury road is summer action flick's Holy Grail .",

John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. \n\nAs for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. \n\nNow Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was \"Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman.\" I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. \n\nNicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. \n\nNow with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. \n\nThe lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to it\n\nThe entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. \n\nThe villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10.",

One, was that Nicholas Hoult's character, whilst a great character, had a romance with some girl which blossomed in about 3 minutes, and I'm not even exaggerating.\n\nAlso there was admittedly a lot of screaming and nothingness in terms of plot.

He's already mad), he has the look and his terse acting actually helps him sell his traumatized road warrior persona. Charlize Theron is the woman of the hour as Furiosa, a badass warrior woman out to redeem herself. The plot begins with Max being captured and Furiosa making off with some precious goods that Immortan Joe, the ruler of The Citadel, can't let slip away. Max is serving as a \"blood bag\" for Nux, a Warboy with terminal cancer. Nux figures chasing down Furiosa is his last chance at immortal glory, so he drags Max along for the ride. Thus, the chase begins.\n\nEvery character cast for this film is pretty much perfection. If you remember the bizarre characters from Road Warrior, you'll recognize similar horrors and mutants here. The world is dead and irradiated, so there's plenty of twisted creations all around. The gangs themselves are all very well-defined, as are their leaders (I loved the Guntown dude's vehicle). The music is fantastic, and the environments are legit video game-quality otherworldly (the storm sequence and the swamp were particularly awesome). The action as a whole puts the end chase in Road Warrior to absolute shame, which is a tall order but one that Fury Road fulfills.\n\nMy only issues with the movie were that the 3D stuff was overdone, the movie should have been an hour longer (I still prefer 3-hour movies for films that aspire to real art), and some leaps in logic (apparently everyone in the post-apocalypse has the same blood type). But those things aside, Fury Road is well worth the price of admission. Action movies will be compared to this for a long time to come.",

All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.\nRating: 5/5",

            "content": "George Miller burst onto the cinematic landscape in 1979 with the 70's exploitation car chase masterpiece Mad Max then exceeded the brilliance of that debut with a sequel (Mad Max 2) that truly cemented him as a visionary and visceral filmmaker. Now, almost thirty-five years later, Miller demonstrates with Mad Max: Fury Road that he's lost none of his vitality; however, where previously the thinness of plot and character felt appropriate in this franchise, here they read as omission and highlight the fact that at the end of the day this is little more than a well-executed two-hour car chase.\n\nFuriosa (Charlize Theron) is the true hero of this story. Despite living in the aggressively patriarchal society of the Citadel ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) she has attained a position of some authority. When she sets out on a trade mission she takes with her a group of Immortan's breeders with the intention of seeking refuge in a remote society of women. Max (Tom Hardy), spends the first half hour of the film held captive as a human blood bag for one of Immortan's goons until he escapes and teams up with Furiosa.\n\nMiller's strong point is the detail with which he paints his world. The colours, the costumes, the makeup, the souped up vehicles, the dare-devil stunts, the magnificent collisions, the heavy metal guitarist screeching out the pursuit's soundtrack. It's riveting stuff. Imaginative and witty. And as an exercise in action direction it's pretty flawless. But the film aspires to being more than a thrilling roller coaster ride. It asks us to care. And on this level it falls short.\n\nWe learn in the opening scene that Max failed to protect his wife and daughter and so (groan) there are subsequent snippets of his daughter haunting him throughout the film. The breeders are all so damn beautiful (including super model Rosie Huntington Whiteley) and given little chance to develop individually that their shared plight is easy to dismiss. The developing bond between Furiosa and Max thankfully doesn't end with a kiss but nor is it of much consequence. Nicholas Hoult, as one of Immortan's gang, has a defined arc in the story which only makes you wonder why him and no one else?\n\nTheron, with her buzz cut, racoon eyes and prosthetic arm, makes a fine action heroine. Hardy, similarly, has just the right brooding presence (and pouty lips) to more than comfortably fill Mel's boots. They look great together and I wish they were given more to do than drive from A to B and back again. Another subplot, another significant complication would've been welcome meat on these narrative bones. Fury Road is indeed audacious and thrilling but you'll come away affected far more by Miller's virtuosity than the film itself.",

            "content": "\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is completely unique. Its visual appeal and creativity can't be denied, but it is also one of the strangest films that you will ever experience.  In a market where every genre is saturated with films that recycle the same concepts and ideas, it is rare to find a film as unique as this one.  It even feels unique when compared with the \"Mad Max\" films of the 80's.  George Miller is no stranger to the film industry and \"Fury Road\" may be his masterpiece.  I think that it is really cool that Miller wrote a new chapter into his series 30 years after the last film.  Most of this story is told without dialogue.  The action is constant and the imagery drives the story for better or for worse (we will never forget the brief milking scene or the idea of a \"blood bag\").  Immortan Joe's mask is terrifying and the production team convincingly transformed all of the actors into nuclear holocaust survivors.  I appreciated the performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, though any sort of emotion seems to be overshadowed by the previous and next action sequence.  This one won't be winning any Oscars in acting categories, but it will certainly make a run in categories like Production Design, Film Editing, and Sound Editing.  To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the film.  It had so much hype for its entire theatrical run, augmented by a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 97%, and I just did not receive the amount of character development as I expect from a critically acclaimed film.  Still, I will be the first to admit that I need to see it again to process everything that happened and may adjust my rating afterward.  My wife and I are still scratching our heads about the electric guitar guy (who we have discovered is named \"The Doof Warrior\").  We assumed that he was symbolic or sort of reference to the original films, but apparently he is exactly what he appears to be: a flame-spewing guitarist who pumps up the rest of the troops.  I suppose that he left a big enough impression that he is the only character that I have discussed.  The most well-written character in the film is Nux and we grow attached to him because he undergoes the greatest transformation.  I look forward to watching this film again and believe that the sequels will be even better if they deliver the same amount of action while including a greater transformation of their characters.  There are a lot of cheesy sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's that involve vehicles (\"Death Race 2000\" is the first one that comes to mind), but the vehicles are perfectly incorporated into this film's creative atmosphere and they are just cool.  Everybody loves \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" for its creative post-apocalyptic story and constant stream of action.  I believe that the Academy Awards will acknowledge its effort and remind the film industry that action films can blow our minds with more than just the action.",

The crazy answer is \"yes, yes it can\" and the funny thing is I'm not talking about that little film with Star Wars in the title. Since the 1979 original, writer/director (and doctor) George Miller has given the world two other iterations of Mad Max-1981s The Road Warrior and 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (whom George Ogilvie shared a co-directing credit)-but this newest take proves an old vehicle can learn many new tricks with 2015s Mad Max: Fury Road-a legitimate candidate to be one of the most influential films currently made. With a plot told almost exclusively through visual storytelling, Miller and his staff have truly outdone themselves with what the cinematic medium can do-driving from one scene to the other with frenetic pacing, inspired use of editing (which it should win an Oscar with) and subtle yet dramatic acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy and Theron-playing main protagonists Max Rockatanksy and Imperator Furiosa, respectively (you have to love names like that)-epitomize the brawn and finesse of Miller's filmmaking aesthetic. Amid the brutal carnage of the chases there is a chaotic fluidity to it all that evokes a beautiful dance-blending music and movement to please the senses. This level of sophistication has been hinted at in the previous films, often with socially sensitive issues that evoked the times they were made in. With real-world oil shortages in the 70s being a major headline, the preservation and fight for gasoline was at the focal point in the original three. This has now been replaced with the preservation of life, an inspired and logical way to go, showing the value of conscious awareness and preserving this place called home; Earth (similar themes were touched upon in Miller's 2006 Oscar-winning film Happy Feat). The underlining theme of survival (that spans each entry) is representative of what Mad Max: Fury Road is-a film that breathes life, has a \"never say die attitude\" but expresses the limitless freedom and determination of what people can achieve.",

            "content": "Loud, proud, and yet relentlessly incoherent, Mad Max: Fury Road is a disaster of a film masquerading as bold. A reboot, at least of sorts, of the franchise previously headlined by Mel Gibson, director George Miller brings the outlandish post-apocalyptic world back to the screen. We find Max (Tom Hardy) captured at the hands of a crazed war lord, only to find himself mixed up in the escape of the vaunted female Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the Warlord's many prized wives. \n\nThose that are prone to like Mad Max will point to the action scenes as proof of the film's inventive and unabashedly brutal nature. To a large extent this is true, the film does look good, and the action sequences feature uniquely conceived devices, feel impactful, and are extremely well choreographed and otherwise executed. Mad Max, to be sure, can be fun to watch. This is all fine until the point in which one dares to ask, 'what am I watching'?\n\nSimply put, Mad Max is an absolute narrative mess. Very little is explained, only the thinnest most idiotic delivered exposition is ever given, and then the sole purpose is to set up a 10 or 15 minute fight or chase scene, meanwhile leaving any characterization, plot, or coherent narrative structure in the dust. Big vehicles blowing up are good, eyes being gouged out-that's great, but in order to constitute a movie there needs to be some semblance of a storyline, some reason for us to be invested in the characters. \n\nThe script deficiencies don't stop at a lack of storytelling, the dialogue is extremely sparse and quite literally dumbed-down. It feels as if it's penned by a behavior disorder fifth grader trying to be naughty during language arts. Utter nonsense comes out of characters with inexplicable motivations, histories, or personas. \n\nOne might think the film's cast, featuring Charlize Theoron and Tom Hardy would be a saving grace. Talented actors as they are, they are adrift in a film that wallows in absurdity and disorganization. Neither actor is developed, and one must ask, why Max had the honor of the film's title? The character of Max in this film is relegated to that of a side character, and a rather uninteresting one at that. The reasons for this are curious and perhaps politically motivated but, regardless, it was a dumb one. Hardy is an incredible talent and to have him so underutilized is perhaps one of the greatest cinematic crimes of 2015. \n\nOutrageously terrible. \n\n1.5/5 Stars",

This goes for both the stunning scenes of vehicular carnage, as well as the costume designs, including Immortan Joe's mask. This film's cinematography is Oscar-worthy.\n\nCharlize Theron gives an iconic performance as Imperator Furiosa. Nicolas Hoult, as Nux, delivers the best character arc of the film. And Tom Hardy - who proved with Locke that he doesn't need to move much to command a fascinating performance - proves that he doesn't need to speak much either to be a captivating. The backstories are implied enough that they don't need to be delved into and fleshed out. What's on the surface is gritty and excellent enough. And the bizarre scenes - including a guitar-wielding flamethrower called the Doof Warrior - add to the film's intensity and post-apocalyptic world-building. Needless to say, Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the best action thrillers in a long time. It's certainly one of the best films of 2015, by far.",

Absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a post-apocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk. The exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score (97%). Tom Hardy (known for Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) has become the next big thing in Hollywood due to this remake. Charlize Theron (an absolutely top actress overall) is simply great in the post-feminist role of Imperator Furlosa. Nevertheless, as one might expect, the fight for gas idea, which was original, innovative and to the point in 1979, has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today.

            "content": "Fury Road, a fourth installment in the long dormant Mad Max franchise, feels simultaneously familiar and inexplicably alien. The desolate backdrop, thrilling chases, and camera work recall The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome but it's all so damn useless. Our long standing hero Max, presumably the character audiences are coming to see, all but disappears behind the narratives of new additions Nux and Furiosa. Why make another Mad Max film if Tom Hardy has to sit in the passenger seat?\n\nWriter/director George Miller never had much success fleshing out back story for his characters or the origin of their world and he seems to have completely lost interest in trying. Viewers who did not see the original trilogy of films are given no understanding of who Max is or why he's fighting for survival alone in the wastes. Fury Road provides little more information about its supposed lead than \"I used to be a cop\" and \"Max. My name is Max\". Wow. Profound.\n\nFriends and fellow reviewers alike have countered these critiques by reminding me of how \"beautiful and exciting\" the film is. I agree that Fury Road is visually impressive but I'm not sure what's exciting about not using your brain. Tom Hardy grunting and shooting his way through a thin script certainly doesn't thrill me, no matter how well-lit the sand is. If you want car chases and explosions for hours on end then why not just play the video game? ",

            "content": "As a fan of the dystopic movies, I saw the Mad Max trilogy a couple years ago b/c I heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot. I came away disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the over-the-top action sequences and the post-apocalyptic setting (the two sequels in particular). So you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel. But after seeing rave reviews from friends and critics alike (e.g. this site), I decided to give the franchise another try, expecting somehow this time would be different.\n\nApparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasn't enough adrenaline and proceeded to make the same mediocre movie, but with everything turned up to 11. So instead of a mere waste time, Fury Road was a spectacular waste of time. I mean this in the literal sense: the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility; and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department. But those positives were rendered hollow by a script (one which I can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 year-old) that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as (spoiler) \"Guy and girl go from point A to point B and back to point A, kill bad guys along the way and save the day\". The chases, fights and explosions soon became trite and, after two exhausting hours, something to be tolerated rather than relished. The handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced, as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the near-constant industrial drumming that filled up most of the run time. In the end, this movie offers neither hope (e.g. Children of Men) nor despair (Brazil), just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again -- at least until the next sequel comes along (which shouldn't be long as there is a 5th installment on the way).\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot, this is your flick. But if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence, avoid this movie like the plague. In fact, if you just want to watch Tom Hardy drive around the whole movie, you would find Locke a far superior alternative.",

            "content": "\"Witness me Blood Bag!! Witness!!! I live, I die, I live again!!\"\n\nThere's one word that comes to my mind after watching \"Mad Max Fury Road\", and that's the word \"madness\". This is a perfect visualization of what the term madness means. I truly believe that the creators and writers of this hallucinatory trip were fed with hallucinogens. A spacious cocktail of exotic mushrooms, barbiturates and other drug-related products. Otherwise I wouldn't know how they could think up this crazy, wacky post-apocalyptic film. A film that feels as if it consists of a single action scene. You're not given a moment to catch your breath. It's undeniable that this movie adopted the concept of \"Mad Max\" from 1979, a legendary cult film with young Mel Gibson in a leading role. The same desolate and parched Australian landscape with a shortage of water and petrol governed by fanatical gangs.\n\nI must confess I've already watched this film a while ago and I never saw the need to publish my review. I thought that my opinion would contribute nothing to the general opinion that you could read here and there on the internet. Everyone uses the same superlatives and glorifying terms for this extravagant action movie. In general, everybody agrees this is an insanely great, explosive, ingenious and never tedious re-boot.\"It's loud. It's unrelenting. It's crazily exciting, and, at times, it's just bloody weird\". \"Why repeat this again?\" I thought to myself over and over again. But recent events forced me to rewrite it a bit and highlight an additional aspect that's applicable to today's events.\n\nWe return to the scorching desert in a post-nuclear world where people struggle to survive and follow crazy figures that rule over vital resources such as oil and water. Someone like Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who thinks he's a kind of god and tyrannically keeps his followers in his grip. He rules the Citadel (an old water reservoir) and has his own private army of fanatical War Boys. This Mad Max episode shows how this lawless gang of lunatics start chasing Imperator Furiosa (Charlize \"The Italian Job\" Theron). She kidnapped Joe's harem (including Zoe Kravitz, daughter of). She's later assisted by Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) who serves the first half hour as a living blood supply for War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult).\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks in Europe and hearing a debate about the motives of a suicide bomber, I came to the conclusion that the creepy War Boys exhibit similar characteristics. They follow blindly a charismatic leader and sacrifice themselves for the greater goal. A hero status is awaiting them when killed in battle. They earn a one way ticket to a paradise they call Valhalla. By sacrificing themselves they become immortal in one fell swoop. Strange, but after the IS attacks, I immediately thought of this brainwashed gang. A similar motivation and the same destructive self-sacrifice.And then there's the guitarist firmly attached with elastics who's stirring up the troops into action, while he's playing his flame-throwing guitar. An absurd image amidst total chaos. Similar to the drummer at the forefront during the battles at Waterloo. Or \"Piper Bill\" who walked undisturbed on the beach with his bagpipes at Normandy landings in WWII.\n\nIt's evident that every fiction film contains comparables with reality sometimes. But beyond these serious digressions that overtook me, I can only recommend to watch and enjoy this macho blockbuster, filled with action-packed chase scenes with futuristic cars. A with diesel and gun smoke smelling stunner that deserves to be titled \"Furiosa: Fury Road\". Charlize Theron effortlessly outperforms Nicholas Hoult. It's not Mad Max who demands the lion's share of attention. You can call him Mad \"Drip feed\" instead.\n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",

Everything about the Mad Max universe is so different and special Bringing back Miller was the by far the best decision.Without him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was. Miller makes the movie feel like an original Mad Max film. From the weird skull guys, bad ass cars, and post apocalyptic wasteland, A great thing about Mad Max are the characters. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa, a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain, Immortan Joe, that all of his followers are after. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the highlight of the movie. She is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen. Fury Road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie. The action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing. Every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular. Definitely one of the best looking films of the year. The movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you don't want to miss anything. My biggest flaw in Mad Max is sadly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max. I didn't feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be. But I overall I loved Fury Road.

            "content": "This movie is one of the most insane and chaotic movies of the summer. With George Miller returning to the helm for another installment of Mad Max, it is our viewing pleasure that we get to witness such a high explosive film.\n\n This film stars Tom Hardy, who plays the role of Max, alongside fellow stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult. Most of the actors in this movie do a phenomenal job, and even though Tom Hardy's character was the least interesting, he did an amazing job, as always. If we're on the topic of characters, George Miller really fumbled the ball here. Max is definitely the 3rd most interesting character along with being the 2nd strongest character. Charlize Theron's character was definitely put in the spotlight more and she was the bigger bad-ass. I'm not saying this out of opinion, but the movie clearly shows on several occasions that she is the stronger power and even the more interesting.\n\n Max had the least amount of depth given to him (which is ironic considering his name is in the title) and he had the most basic, undeveloped back-story you can imagine. They spent more time developing the character of Nicholas Hoult (which was actually a good surprise), rather than developing their main character. \n\nThis movie though, was filled tons of action and was the equivalent to a 2 hour video game. The cinematography is amazing and everything looks so well done. The CGI is solid for the most part, but the movie does a great job of relying on practical effects and explosions. There were some moments where I felt that the CGI background looked really bad, but other than that, they did a good job of utilizing their budget. \n\nOn the contrary, watching a video game for 2 hours doesn't leave a whole lot of room for plot development. The movie sports a basic plot that says get from point A to point B. That's all the movie really is. Nothing is really explained and nothing really has meaning. They just see how much action they can fill into 2 hours. Like I said, it makes for an extremely entertaining movie, but I wasn't able to connect to the situation nor the characters. When they tried to develop plot in the movie, it felt like it came to a dead stop. There was a point where nothing was going on and I was actually bored. They seem to throw in random, useless plot elements and it makes me groan. For example, at one point, Max and the crew meet up with these \"mothers\" that help them fight for their freedom. I'm sure this was connected to the other Mad Max movies, but if it wasn't. then this was the most useless and boring plot device in the movie. They seemed helpless and unnecessary and the whole pit stop derailed the movie. \n\nI know it seems like I have a lot of gripes about this movie, but I really don't. It was a great action thriller that was extremely crazy and intense. I love a lot of the unique aspects in this movie and the level of crazy that they go up to. They do things unimaginable to most human beings and it's a really fun summer movie. In the end, Mad Max is certainly worth watching and one that I myself own on Blu-Ray.",

For years it was nothing more than a ghost story, limping along in production hell, until finally its trailers released and piqued little to no interest. Now, with the feature finally in cinemas, an unwitting audience has had its eyes opened and re-emerged crazed and amazed. Without warning, \"Mad Max\" has become a must-see theatrical experience and required viewing for filmgoers and filmmakers alike.\n\n...Don't skip what I just wrote. Must-see is what I put, and must-see is what I mean. This is an unexpected hit that has shaken audiences in the most awe-inspiring and thrilling way imaginable. After a decade of planning, George Miller has finally shown his hand and taken the world by storm - electrical sandstorm, to be precise. After making children's movies for the past couple decades, Miller somehow convinced the studio that he was fit to direct a sequel, not a reboot (the Hollywood weapon of choice), to a film series that hadn't been popular for 30 years. In addition, he seems to somehow have maintained complete creative control over a property of which many millennials (read: target audience) have little to no knowledge. How he pulled this off is a mystery and a miracle - and one of the best things to happen to movies in a long time.\n\n\"The Avengers: Age of Ultron\" (2015) has been hotly anticipated, but this summer belongs to the mad.\n\nIt is simply the most gorgeous, exhilarating film I have seen all year. Breathtaking action is conducted with balletic precision; Miller masterfully leads the eye from beat to beat, giving his scenes room to breathe and his audience a broad scope to behold. He is not afraid to pull back and let every element of his rich, textured world be absorbed, studied, and most importantly, understood in the midst of incredible chaos. The direction and editing stands in stark contrast to the claustrophobic, frenetic camerawork that has dominated action films over the past decade.\n\nIt's been reported that Miller spent the years leading up to production crafting every element of this post-apocalyptic future in the greatest detail. From mechanical body art and dashboard decor to endless storyboards and a choreography of violent, perpetual motion, Miller's own gleeful madness has crafted a movie so eye-popping in its reality that repeat viewings are a happy necessity. The camera brilliantly frames and deftly tracks through increasingly intricate, explosive, and dynamic chase scenes with deft purpose.\n\nCinematographer John Seale presents us with generously saturated shots, resplendent with deep blues and fiery reds. Even the night scenes are a triumph of art: Seale overexposed these shots during daylight before giving them their midnight blue tint, thus allowing the shade and depth of the elements to be captured and clarified in the dark. Even if you hate everything else about the movie (impossible), it's intensely beautiful just to look at.\n\nAlthough titled \"Mad Max\", Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron absolutely share the lead, with the warrior Imperator Furiosa given just as much narrative depth - if not more - than Hardy's wild dog of a Max. Like Max, Furiosa is a professional badass - even with a missing hand. Their gradual alliance is destined to be one of the most classic pairings in cinema. The nihilistic Max is put to the test by the idealistic Furiosa, her sense of morality a bright light in a dark future. In turn, Furiosa's gambit against Hugh \"I Played Toecutter\" Keays-Byrne's tyrannical Immortan Joe proves disastrous without Max's honed, remorseless instincts. Both the hero and anti-hero plunge into the insanity with only a faint hope of rising above their personal tragedies.\n\nSignificant portions of the thundering soundtrack are played by Immortan Joe's own band on the run, a raging, tireless team of drummers led by a mutant guitarist shredding an axe so rock 'n' roll that it literally spurts flames. The absurd concept is a wonderfully bizarre choice for the film and a terrible temptation for those of us forced to drive the speed limit on the way home.\n\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a spectacular victory in filmmaking and has rightfully earned its status as a new standard for action movies. Its balance of practical, in-camera effects with tangible CGI imagery, coupled with Miller's patient planning and meticulous layout of his story, is exactly why a movie that could've been another run-of-the-mill action flick has instead become an instant classic.\n\n...What a film! WHAT A LOVELY FILM!!",

The movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off I think. I was amazed by the costumes, the make up, the vehicles, everything! The music of the movie was so good! \n\nI liked the \"bad guys\" as they seemed and were really really bad and I enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie! The fiction part was there, but it's something you expect in such movies.\n\nI was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10, but I decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre.

It's mindless action fun, of course, but it's an incredible ride, an adrenaline rush from start to finish.  I honestly cannot believe that this is the same director that did the first Mad Max films more than 30 years ago.  The direction is so fresh and energetic, it seems like someone MUCH younger with a fresh perspective on action films would be responsible for such a film.  I'll admit that I was never a fan of the first films (never even saw the third) and found them exceptionally boring.  This film is a complete 180 of the originals, it's jam-packed with action, action and more action.  And it's all awesome.  The whole film is a series of car-chase/fight scenes (Car chases!  Fights!  Fights on top of cars!), yet it never gets boring.  It's visually eye-popping, everything is well-choreographed and composed, and the stunt-work is freakin' incredible.  Luckily, there are some moments of down time where we do get to learn a bit about the  characters. It's just enough to let the audience catch its breath, then off it goes again.  The film doesn't bother explaining the hows and whys of this dystopian future, but shows you the world and society as it is now, complete with a culture that is surprisingly well-developed.  The story isn't that deep or compelling, but it's got more substance than I expected it to.  The acting is solid too, especially by Charlize Theron, who is completely believable as a badass (don't let the title fool you, this movie is Theron's show).   I do wish there had been a little more explanation of the backstory, sometimes the story and characters' motivations get a bit murky... but there is simply not enough room for that in the movie like this, it would have disrupted the flow.  This movie is pure action spectacle and raw entertainment.  It's a Wham Bam Thank you Ma'am, and everything a summer action flick should be.",

Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip.

It is really succeeds best  at drawing you in visually and not letting go. You are chained to this balls-out burst of blood and oil spectacle which hurtles along at such a pace that thinking too reflexively is not advised. There has been much made of the film's feminist elements, and they are intentional and well-intended. However, it falls short in the end; as the plot still relies on the trope of the strong silent man with the brave plan whom the queen needs to convince her to not despair and risk the messy death again to do the \"logical\" thing.

Were the years of waiting worth it? Hell yeah! but not as much as everyone thinks. Of course, it's an action movie, and a phenomenal one at that. Fast-paced, outlandish, and incredibly creative driving sequences make up a decent portion of the film, and these scenes are incredible. But of course, this is what everyone is expecting. I'm noticing very few people are asking \"how's the story?\" or \"how about the characters?\" or \"how does a dystopian future lead to cult driven biker gangs?\" This is the biggest problem with the film, nothing is explained. Why is Max captured by the strange cult? Who is Immortal Joe? How does he have control of all the water? What is the basis of his religion? Who is Furiosa? Why is she leading this convoy? What's the story of all the other gangs? Are they friendly with each other? enemies? Why do Joe's minions spray chrome on their face? Why is Max really involved in all this? All these questions and more will NOT be answered in this film. This is what turned me away during my second viewing of this film. There's a lot of sacrifice of character development and filing in plot holes to make room for all the action. But in theory, that's what Mad Max is. The only film that really had slow moments and focused on the story was Beyond Thunderdome, a film that's overblown by the other two, as well as getting lost in the 80's. At the end of the day, that's all Fury Road is, a chase movie. Although I personally prefer Road Warrior if I'm watching a chase movie. But Mad Max is definitely a great addition to the emerging genre of the Secretly Smart Dick Flicks",

But by far the best Character/performance in the Whole movie is Charlize Theron as Furiosa who steels the entire show and makes it her movie. In fact she is more of a hero than max is in this movie. Visually this movie is absolutely fantastic. This movie is gorgeous to look at if this film wins the Oscar for best Cinematography I will not be disappointed.\n The number 1 thing fans go for in this kind of film is the action and boy do we get a lot of it. The action scenes pretty much take up take up almost the entire movie and to say that it keeps you on the edge of your seat would be an understatement. But once in a while the film slows down so that we can learn more about the characters especially Furiosa now granted it is very short lived just so that we can get back to the action but I at least give the filmmakers for at least trying for trying to help us latch on to the main character and making us feel for them during the action scenes. Also did why is no one talking about Nicolas Hoult in the movie. He did a great job and I really felt sorry for his character.\n My only problems with the film would be that the flash backs that max kept having did get a little overused. Yes we get it movie he has a dark past you had 3 Movies to establish this. Also the Villain was really underdeveloped but with a good look and a bad ass voice that does not matter.\n All around a great film and probably the best experience watching a movie in a while.",

            "content": "Review:\nWhat an epic ride! I'm not one for remakes but this was a great movie. It's full of action, right from the beginning to the end and the stunts were amazing. Personally, I think the movie should have been called Mad Furiosa because Max hardly said a word through the whole film. Anyway, in this movie you see Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) being captured by a group of rebels who keep him in a dungeon as there prisoner. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is told to pick up some gasoline for the rebels, she takes his five pregnant wives with her because they want to escape from the ruthless warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Whilst travelling across the dangerous wasteland, Joe soon realises that his wives have escaped, so he gathers his various gang's together, so he can get them back. Max also travels with the rebels and he manages to escape from them and ends up helping Furiosa on her impossible mission. The storyline was great and the intensity throughout the movie, kept me on the edge of my seat. Charlize Theron's performance was outstanding and the whole look of the movie was brilliant. It does end quite abruptly so I hope they come out with a sequel soon. I'm waiting to see Mad Max kick butt because there wasn't that much depth to his character. That's not to say that Tom Hardy didn't play his part well but there was just way to much going on for the director to go into his story. Hopefully he will do in the sequel! Anyway, it's definitely one of the best films that I have watched this year and for a remake, it makes the original look mediocre. Brilliant!\n\nRound-Up:\nCharlize Theron, 40, first came on the scene in the Children of the Corn III, if anyone actually saw it but most people remember her in Two Days in the Valley in 1996. After starring alongside Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do, she played a major role as Keanu Reeves wife in the Devil's Advocate in 1997 which pushed her to the big league. Her next major role was alongside Johnny Depp in the Astronaut's Wife in 1999 and after the successful Legend of Bagger Vance, she starred with Keanu Reeves again in Sweet November. After that she had a string of average movies like 15 minutes, Trapped and Waking Up In Reno and then she starred in a leading role in the Italian Job remake. In 2004 she won an Oscar & Golden Globe award for the best leading role in Monster and she was nominated for the same award for North Country in 2005. After the disappointing Aeon Flux movie in 2005, she didn't really come back into the limelight until she starred alongside Will Smith in Hancock, which I quite enjoyed. She then got high praise for her role in Young Adult in 2011 and she also starred in the long awaited Prometheus. After that she proved that she can tackle most genres by starring in Snow White and the Huntsman and a Million Ways to Die in the West and then she comes out with this movie were she put in a terrific performance. I just hope she returns for the sequel! This movie was directed my George Miller who also made the original Mad Max movies. He also directed the Twilight movie, the Witches of Eastwick, Lorenzo's Oil, Babe and Happy Feet 1 & 2 so he definitely has experience in different genres. Its planned that he will be directing the sequel Mad Max: Wasteland so I hope that he doesn't spoil the franchise, now that this movie made such a healthy profit. Anyway, the cast was perfect and the concept was fresh and definitely worth a watch.\n\nBudget: $150million\nWorldwide Gross: $375million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies about a man who helps a radical woman to bring 5 pregnant women to safety. 8/10",

Like Gibson or not, and the original was a bit before my time, the new Mad Max is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know what the lead actors' names are and don't want to know either, because  their completely uninspired performances have me wanting to forget everything about them. Oh, Charlize Theron, not my favorite and further down on the list after Fury Road. The movie reminds me more of the Italian knockoff films made to resemble Mad Max than the original Mad max series of films.

Are we to believe that anyone survives on such a brief outpour with so much lost to the ground?  And what gasoline shortage - everyone and their grandmother, seemingly literally, has an engine in good working order and plenty of juice. \nWouldn't have cared less if Max bought it, didn't care when his car bought it.  The actors just don't pull any of their scenes off.   When the villain fixes to hate the heroes (death of pre-mature son) it looks like he may of just called it a day (silly mask didn't help the actor).  When the young hottie takes to meaning business with watching the back or using a gun, it doesn't even live up to the cliché.  \nZero sexual tension through-out.  The Nux and redhead relation wasn't even sweet - again the scenes were weaker than the cliché.   I don't even know any names besides Nux and Max.\nI did like the cinematography of the cool desert night.  However, this is where they hatched the idea of travelling 160 days on bikes.  Well, maybe if they travelled a mile a day.  And of course  in a post-apocalyptic world that was short on gas beforehand, there are plentiful bikes -  in good working order - enough that the stranger guy gets  one laden with supplies and brimming with fuel.\nHarding is either a bad actor or wrongly cast.  Mel Gibson, or any number of others, would have shown guile when turning them all back towards the citadel, a bit of sexual tension when the blonde was in tight beside him in the hatch, and so on.",

The story is thin, characters are thinner, mostly this is two hours of car chases and crashes in the desert.  It assumes too much.  Mad Max was a character driven film where we see Max go from a family man that wants to live in peace, to his trial by fire towards the Road Warrior.  By Thunderdome we knew Max, so so it was the development of others against Max's foil that made the story.  In this weak tale a Warlord named Joe keeps many wives and has many more sons.  Imperator Furiosa helps several of Joe's wives escape while on a \"gas run\".  When Furiosa takes a detour Joe finds out immediately and engages in pursuit, catching up quickly, thus begins the bulk of the film, an endless chase scene across the desert.  You'll notice I've said nothing of Max as Max appearance in this film is merely gratuitous.  He really isn't needed except to convince Furiosa to turn back to the Citadel and that could have been done by any of the characters.  This was not a worthy addition to the Mad Max universe.

There's action, guns, drugged up skinheads who want to rush to \"valhalla\" (Or in otherwords, death.), Post apocalyptic setting.. It has a ton of things going for it, but the issue is.. There's no story OR characters.\nThe story is just a simple chase-movie. Main character get caught after which he escapes from being a blood-bag (Skinheaded druggies need his blood to continue functioning.) while accidentally meeting up with a truck full of women who are escaping from the Cult leader of the skinheaded druggies. They're trying to escape to \"eden\" which by the words of Furiosa (The manly woman who kicks ass) is a green land from which she was stolen from.\nThat's it for the story. 80% of the movie is about getting to that place while fighting lots of skinheads in crazy spiky cars.\nCharacters also aren't built up. Max is the blandest of characters. His character is literally just looking at things angrily and shooting at them. Occasionally sees phantoms of his daughter show up (Which isn't explained at all in the movie.) and shoots more people.\nFuriosa's reasons for escaping are explained and that's also literally to \"save other girls\" not really a character trait that has much to it. And otherwise she's also similar to the main character, a hard-ass who gets shit done.\n\nAnd there comes the issue. You will feel interested in side-characters that come from the enemy side because there's simply no reason to LIKE the main characters. Until the end I was actually cheering for the enemies because hey, they were interesting. There was literally a guitar guy who sat on a huge truck which had HUUUGE speakers and was shooting out fire from his guitar!! That's BADASS! Immortan Joe also looks like a barely alive bulgy old man who's like \"GO TO VALHALLA NOW\".. Which is again.. Pretty neat.\n\nBut this movie, although it isn't horrible.. There's nothing \"GREAT\" about it.. It's a solid 60% imho. It's being kept up by its licence and style, but half of the movie is simply less than mediocre.",

Sure there will be some film snobs tired of the increasingly more common orange/blue palette, but it plays to great effect here.  And it makes the Chrome so shiny!\nMiller has created yet another wonderfully bizarre fictive reality, rich with original characters.  If there is to be one criticism of the film it would be that it should drop the Mad Max moniker and simply call itself Fury Road, as Max himself plays much more as a supporting character (indeed he spends much of the film as a hood ornament).  The real lead in this film is Charlize Theron's Furiosa, and Theron infuses her performance with such a cool badassery that she seems to be channeling Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conner, and Beatrix Kiddo all at once.\nThe best advice I can give anyone just now diving into the world of George Miller is that it's going to be weird, it doesn't have to make sense, and it's ok to laugh and have fun.",

They made a star of Mel Gibson and gave us the unforgettable image of Tina Turner in a chainmail cocktail frock. I was a little sceptical at yet another reboot of an old movie franchise, there've just been so many disappointing ones churned out over the years. Here however, we have a great movie, that not only honours the originals but could almost fit easily between any of them. In style, it is more like the first Mad Max movie. It is graphically violent and filled with some great car chase and stunt sequences. The character of Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is almost an anti-hero and says very little. Indeed much of the action and plot centres on Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed, oil tanker-driving rebel who is trying to rescue a group of concubines from the evil clutches of a local warlord. There's a definite feminist undercurrent to this movie and the female characters are refreshingly strong for a movie of this genre. It is telling that George miller, the original director of the series has returned to his baby and taken it forward. He has managed to recreate the visual feel as well as the spirit of his ground-breaking stories and clearly has a tight control over his vision. This is a real edge of your seat movie. Gripping, good fun and I really would like to see where the \"Road Warrior\" ends up next. Hopefully, the rumours of more adventures to come are actually true.",

            "content": "Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.\n\nThe film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader \"Joe\". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'-women she brought with her-into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.\n\nAfter a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader \"Joe\" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.\n\nEverything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.\n\nMuch of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.\n\nAmid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history",

            "content": "First things first, I have to rant a little bit about something that's been bothering me since I finished watching this film last night.  And that is the reaction to the film among men's rights activists, or MRAs.  Now the very idea of men's rights activism is an absolutely preposterous one since, and think about this, what rights don't men have.  Think about it, what rights are these men actually fighting for.  What rights DON'T men have?  Specifically white men.  But, anyway, the reaction to this film was very negative, despite many of them not actually having seen the movie, because of the 'feminist agenda' by having a 'forced female character' in Imperator Furiosa.  I guess the complaint comes in the fact that these men believe that women, in action movies, aren't allowed to be badasses because real women take a subservient role to men.  Either that or they're damsels in distress or they're the romantic interest for the male lead.  These men have got clearly defined roles for women and being strong leaders isn't one of them, at least in films.  Even if the film had a forced female character, which it doesn't, as the lead and the one that really drives the narrative forward, it wouldn't be a legitimate complaint.  It's not like they make a big deal of Imperator Furiosa being a woman at any point in the film.  The film just tells its story and lets its characters speak for themselves.  The film having a strong female lead isn't a valid complaint and it will never be, because you are focusing on the gender of the person playing the character and not on the content of the film.  So, MRAs and their opinions about this film are not valid and they are human filth.  Why would you listen to human filth?\n\nWith that out of the way, and I do apologize for that but I really had to get it out of my chest, I was honestly really fucking looking forward to this film ever since I first saw the trailer late last year.  I really like the original trilogy.  The Road Warrior, or Mad Max 2, if I were to compile a list of my favorite action movies, would place very, very highly on that list.  Like maybe top 3.  I thought that Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was a huge disappointment, but that was probably because of George Miller's lessened involvement.  It just wasn't as good as the previous two films in the trilogy.  But ever since I saw The Road Warrior, I absolutely fucking loved it.  So, when Fury Road was finally announced for release, almost 30 years after the last Mad Max movie came out, I was super excited yet also careful in my expectations, cause the reality might've been that this movie might not have ever matched up to The Road Warrior.  Well, I'm here to say this film was pretty much everything it should've been and even then some.  You know how I said that The Road Warrior was one of my favorite action films ever.  Well, I can definitely say the same about this film.  It's really that fucking great.  It'd be one thing if it was just for the action/chase sequences, which are out of this fucking world, but the film also has a surprisingly good interesting narrative with some really strong character development for Furiosa, Nux and Max.  Here's the thing about Max, while the series is named after his character, since The Road Warrior, all he has been is a pawn in someone else's game.  He's a means to an end for some of these people, so that's why I wasn't bothered that Max, while still an integral part to the proceedings, took a backseat to Furiosa because her story to save the wives of Immortan Joe from sex slavery is the driving force of the film.  Nothing happens without her involvement.  Honestly, Furiosa herself is a fucking badass.  I don't give a shit if the MRAs hate me for it, but she's one of the better characters, in any action movie, since, probably, The Bride from Kill Bill.  Notice how both those characters are women *gasp*.  She's strong and vulnerable all at the same time, like you know there's something about her past that simply fucked her up for life and her actions during the film is sort of her way to redeem herself for what might've happened.  Max is also haunted by the past and the people that he failed to protect that ended up dying and how that's the reason that he, usually, goes off on his own rather than stick to a group.  Contributing to Furiosa's quest to free the brides also offers him a chance at redemption.  Though I do think Nux is the more surprising of all the newer characters, at least from how he transitions from one type of character to something completely different.  Nux is, essentially, a War Boy, essentially a fancy name for cannon fodder for Immortan Joe.  Nux wants desperately to reach Valhalla, a place where warriors who dies in combat reach in the afterlife, imagine like a heaven or something.  Pretty much everything about Nux is about reaching Valhalla because this is all he knows and all that Immortan Joe has taught him.  So seeing him evolve as a character is really interesting and Nicholas Hoult is great in the role.   Charlize Theron is also pretty incredible as Imperator Furiosa as she, surprisingly, plays the character very subtly.  By that I mean the fact that she never hams it up, like there's much more to the Furiosa character than what you actually see on-screen.  And that's something that is, hopefully, explored upon if ever a Furiosa prequel ever gets greenlit.  Tom Hard is always amazing, so no complains here, but Max is a character that never says, or emotes, much.  Have I mentioned how amazing the chase sequences are in this movie?  Like the first extended action sequence of the film is one of the best you will see this year, or ever for that matter.  The beauty about a film like this is that with, very few exceptions, it's all actually taking place with real vehicles.  There's some computer generated crashes here and there, but, by an large, it's actually taking place and that means that it has so much more impact than it would've otherwise.  The visual of the apocalyptic dust storm is a sight to behold.  I can't even explain how much detail there is in this one desert storm scene with fire tornadoes and shit.  It's a visual feast for the eyes honestly.  Something tells me that, technically, this scene was probably a bitch to put together.  The spectacle of this dust/electrical storm has to be seen to be believed.  It's stuff like that that puts this film over the top.  The chase sequences in this film are some of the best ever seen on film.  Find me a film with better chase sequences than The Road Warrior or Fury Road.  I got all fucking day.  The costume design is, obviously, excellent.  No one does post-apocalyptic costume design better than Mad Max.  The Road Warrior pretty much set the standard of what post-apocalyptic costume design looks like.  The climactic action sequence is also out of this world.  The action in this film is world-class.  And, of course, the editing has to be top-notch as well in order for it all to make sense from a visual standpoint.  There's so many things going on from a visual perspective in this film that the editing needs to be especially commended because of the difficulties in placing this all together to where it looks amazing to a viewing audience.  So Margaret Sixel, the editor of the film, deserves a standing ovation for her work here.  I tip my hat off to you madam.  But perhaps what I like most about the film is sort of the little moments of character development that you get in between the action sequences.  Like how there's a certain respect that's building up between Furiosa and Max throughout the film.  They don't do it in a heavy-handed fashion, but you can notice the respect building between the two.  The interactions between the wives and the gang of women is really cool as well.  Those small little moments of character development is what makes this film and the world feel so fully developed.  It's a dark and brutal world to live in and the film does a fabulous job at representing that.  With that said, I fucking loved this film if you couldn't tell.  My favorite of the year so far and one of the best action films I've ever seen.  Though it's so much more than just an action film.  That's one of the beautiful things about it.  I, obviously, highly recommend this film.  Long live Imperator Furiosa.\n\n\n\nAnd fuck the MRAs.",

I was happy with the story until everyone decided opps let's turn around and go back the exact way we can for the past hour and a half of the movie, WTF. Weak story. Where did the ambino war children come from? Why is there no towns other than a gas town? Even shanties would make sense of the story world. Story world environment was lame also. Desert, more desert. I know it was a post nuclear war world, but there could have been more than what we were given. Anyone see Oblivion, way way way better story world environment.

I wish there was more to the storyline and how they just turn around it is just dumb.  Now for the action scenes, they were great.  They got this right and this is why I gave it 3 out of 5.  If you watched the old mad max movies you will enjoy the action sequences since the action is pretty much 95% of this movie.  Other than that you are going to be let down.  In my opinion, the old movies were the best ones, but the action scenes on the this movie were actually better.

The film speed variations, close ups and panning and zooming contributed significantly to the riveting and seamless action. Amazing aerial drone footage and natural settings. Excellent casting and authentic looking extras. This film is a direct result of professionally coordinated hard work. I thought there was just one element it could've used.

Things, however, take a turn for the worse once he finds himself a prisoner of a citadel tyrannized by an evil warlord and must join a group of strangers in hopes of escaping out alive.\n\nFrom director George Miller, the original mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise, comes a new post-apocalyptic tale of vengeance and solidarity. Fueled with stylistic chaos and amped with 150% beautiful insanity, Mad Max: Fury Road is like a nitro-boosted adrenaline rush straight to the head! Every shot was flawlessly staged, lit and framed like an artistic photograph that simply screams pure genius. This goes without mentioning the awesome, heavy metal-infused orchestral score by Junkie XL. Now some viewers might feel a little awkward accepting some of the steam-punk attire, eccentric props and unquestionably weird characters, but they shouldn't be too quick to judge. Everything in the film, no matter how odd, has a sense of logic and a functional purpose to support its existence. Not only does this sensible approach make things feel more realistic but it also couldn't look more genuine, thanks to the abundance of practical effects and real stunt work. Even more impressive is the clear dedication from our leading actors who performed the majority of their own stunts. One fight sequence even resulted in Tom Hardy breaking his nose, but judging by his interviews, it's pretty clear that everyone's proud of what they've accomplished.  \n\nPutting the film's obvious strengths aside, one of Fury Road's most impressive aspects is the technical brilliance behind the cinematography and editing itself. Regardless of how fast-paced some of the scenes were and how many quick cuts they included, I never once had to struggle to process the visuals. It's safe to say that the director knew exactly how to frame the characters in each shot to ensure everything flowed together without nauseating the audience, regardless of its high-paced action. Too bad most modern action movies aren't competent enough to film and edit sequences this way. Maybe Taken 3 rings a bell? Keep in mind, viewers may find disappointment through the film's relatively thin plot and lack of dialogue, but one could easily argue that Miller effectively makes up for this with his clever use of visual storytelling techniques. I for one felt the characters' actions spoke for themselves and am confident his storyboard- based script had a lot to do with why this approach worked so well.\n\nThis might be the 4th chapter in a pre-established saga, but Millar has proven his concept is far from dead and Fury Road completely justifies all the critical appraise it's receiving. With just enough nods to the originals to please die-hard fans but more than enough fresh material to engage new audiences, anyone getting on board is sure to enjoy the ride. If its unique style or genuine originality isn't enough to catch your attention, the high octane and unquestionably explosive action sequences are sure to blow you away!",

Tom Hardy does a descent job as Max Rockatansky not as good as Gibson but good enough for the film. Charlize Theron is also very good I think Furiosa will be an iconic female action character like Ripley and Sarah Connor. The action in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen with great stunt work and no terrible CGI like most action films these days.

Easily one of the best films of the year, it incorporated so much well-shot action and so much meta-commentary on resource usage and women's rights that it's amazing no one was clamoring for this sooner. Now, everyone wants to be witnessed. Tom Hardy was a solid choice to replace Mel Gibson, but everyone knows that Charlize Theron was the true star of George Miller's return to prominence. Theron's Imperator Furiosa  is easily the best written female action character of the last few years and honestly, probably of all time. Her character's sole mission, after achieving military greatness, is to rescue Immortan Joe's concubines from a lifetime of breeding. Her performance is both subtle and in-your-face, which is what pissed off the last remaining \"men's rights groups\" that still laughably fight for relevance. Theron deserves massive credit for bringing humanity to a world that is massively devoid of such things, but George Miller deserves so much credit for crafting this desolate world. The action scenes are perfect- the creative decisions are beyond impressive, what with an entire vehicle dedicated to a guitarist and his wall of amps.

Every time you discover a really bad visual blunder or terrible editing job, take a drink. I guarantee you'll see less than half the movie before you're passed out on the couch. \n\nAnother possible drinking game.....Charlize Theron is beyond beautiful. For this role, she cut all her hair off and rubbed axial grease on her face. Guess what, it's still f**king Charlize Theron only with short hair and grease on her face. So the drinking game is, when you first realize you're looking at the \"transformed\" Charlize, start drinking and don't stop till you pass out. Unless you have the intellect of a grape, that'll be in the first five minutes of the movie and you'll be spared death by boredom which occurs within a half hour. \n\nPositive note and suggestion. It's better to rent the streaming version as opposed to the less expensive physical DVD. This will actually be less expensive in the long run. Having the actual physical DVD, in front of you will give you the strong urge to destroy it and relieve the world of one copy of this crap. \n\nInvestors gave money to this project. They're out there and they're giving money away. \n\nCONS\nWriter has serious Mother issues. \n\nThis movie took two hours of my life which I will never get back.",

Yes, it's true. These films are hardly the sort that you'd suggest to just anyone - the violence alone is something that not every viewer can stomach, but for those who already enjoy violent action films, the need for a more progressive approach than the usual macho-masculine type is all too apparent. After all, the action genre's core demographic is not as male-heavy as Hollywood would have us believe and it hasn't been for a very long time - movies like \"Fury Road\", \"Dredd\" and \"Kill Bill\" are simply acknowledging that at least half their viewership is not male - these films don't needlessly alienate female viewers with (what I think we can all agree is) lazy writing. This film in-particular goes a little father than \"Dredd\" in terms of creating a plot that legitimately subverts harmful gender stereotypes - while keeping in perfect consistency with it's post-apocalyptic patriarchy backdrop - all in one fell swoop. This movie genuinely gives me hope for the future of the action genre as a whole.\n\nFull review here:\nhttp://www.emfaust.com/?p=2057",

First and foremost, Fury Road is a high-octane visual spectacle, but it's also masterfully crafted work of cinema, so if nearly 2 hours of car chases, guns, and destruction sounds at all played-out or uninteresting to you, think again.",

            "content": "I would best compare this film to another film that came out in 2013 by the name of Gravity. Gravity, much like the film I'm reviewing right now, was a spoon fed, overly praised film that places more value on aesthetics than it does on engaging characters or a worthwhile story to be invested in. Just like Gravity, one bewilderment towards the overwhelming positive reception versus the actual quality of the film shouldn't be a surprise since if you remove the technical achievement all you'll have left is superficial entertainment with a two hour car chase. It's a dumb action film with a high budget, and cool car stunts which is sadly all it has to offer.\n\nAround this portion of my reviews I would provide a synopsis of Mad Max: Fury Road, but any sort of synopsis should be considered a spoiler. There's very little plot in the film that required three writers to create. To put it in perspective the film without giving away thin specifics is basically like driving a couple miles away from your home to get water while being chased by lunatics, remembering there's no longer anyone guarding your home for some reason, and returning home the same way you came even though it was blocked after an explosion. That is all that occurred within two hours. Like mentioned before, this took the effort of three writers to create is pretty pathetic not just in writing, but filmmaking as a whole.\n\nIt's titled character, Max, is a man of few words, fewer defining characteristic beside having a tortured past, and less of an engaging character. Max is relegated to a supporting role who just goes with the motion of events. Some attempts are made in providing a backstory to Max, but it is thinly stretched out. All that is told about Max through hallucination is that he failed to protect people. Their importance is never specify almost as if discluding any newcomer in the franchise. If it fails to stand alone as it own entity then it failed before filming began. Nope, instead of providing stronger context it's better if that time was better spent on very long car chases instead.\n\nMore ridiculous than the thinness of the story is the presentation of serious moments. Car chases take up 90% of the film are bombastic, and loud which when applied to a character, Furiousa, talking about redemption can't be taken seriously. That's the clear points of these moments, though once again I want emphasize it took three people to write this story. Without much exploration into character backgrounds it further deteriorate into an eye candy spectacle that only manages to hold your attention because of it belief it would lose its audience if there wasn't a extensive car chase for every few minutes focus on plot.\n\nThe film opens up with our main character Max being captured, and in an attempt to escape shows to the viewer(s) how insane the world is. This very early scene shows a crowd of people gathering around to get water with the images presenting a clear picture of how important this resource is in the world. Yet, the three writers felt the imagery of this scene wouldn't be enough to convey the desperation in its world either being water, healthy people, or fertile land which is why lines like \"As the world fell, each of us in our ways were broken\" is spoon feeding to the definition. Much like the example I use in the opening paragraph, if it was entirely muted (we're talking about virtually no dialogue) the film would actually be an achievement in storytelling regardless if it needed to use simple caricatures for an action movie. Unfortunately, with spoon fed dialogue like that it's a blessing and a curse the characters don't talk as much as they do taking away from the experience.\n\nCharacters are simplified to very basic character arcs; most notable examples comes in the form of Nux and Furiousa. Nux wants to be taken to Vahala which loosely can be tied to religion as much as Furiousa search for redemption from an event that's makes a very loose connection with the antagonist. Nux doesn't suffer as much as Furiousa in his basic characterization due to his simplistic loyalty painting a clear picture of his arc when he enters the picture. Max goal is to possibly get over past demons and survive without talking much. Now, Max getting over his demons isn't an issue since it's what drives his character to be a better person than he was before. However, Max being muted when Furiosa is trying to kill him is idiotic. He's man of few words, but not very intelligent...or is he? The script can't decide on that as in one scene Max manages to get a truck out a swampland that got mired in the desert by the use of the only conveniently found tree in that area. So his reluctance to speak in a scene where women are trying to run away from the same lunatics chasing Max, and the leader is attempting to kill Max a simple explanation would have avoided a well choreographed, but rather pointless action scene.\n\nSo earlier I made a rough outline of the film general story by making up an example. That outline has serious issues. First, there is an explosion in a canyon with only one entrance way being shown. That entrance gets blocked by rubble of rocks. Yet, when the characters decide to return to where Max was taken seemingly using the same road. Second, we're in the desert and making further suspend your belief is despite the large locations shown throughout the film Max takes the same route to return to the Citadel (where the film basically starts). Lastly, the antagonist took all of his men when chasing down Max? If not, how come the citizens of the Citadel didn't kill Immortan Joe (the antagonist) if his power was so limited? It would explain the ending, but if so, even if the antagonist did strike fear in the people's eyes the numbers of baddies still in the Citadel is larger of that of what the Immortan Joe took with him when chasing down Max and his Five Wives. In context characters finally stop looking for answers in other places that might not exist, but also in context it basically means the outline of the story is unbelievably goofy.\n\nIf you're looking for action, but mostly in the car chases variety Mad Max: Fury Road has impressive stunt work. For starter, the way Mad Max: Fury Road is filmed is done like an expert. The camera in these car chases usually follows the cars without shaking the camera. No matter how many cars are on screen together or if there's an explosion the camera doesn't need to shake to emulate the chaotic nature of just occurred in a scene. It does it through visuals favoring long takes with wide shots angle to see every bit of carnage done in the film.\n\nAnother aspect of the car chases is the smart uses of wide shots throughout lengthy sequences. A common problem for directors of higher budgeted action movies is that a director would make the mistakes of using many mid-shots instead to be closer to the action instead of pulling the camera further for a better flow. One of the best example is a scene where Max is attempting to break the window of a car from his capturer who's planning to kill himself in a blaze glory during a desert storm. In the background, Max is seen struggling to hang onto a car and attempting to break the window while in the foreground his capturer is preparing to kill himself. This paints a picture of struggle, and a time limit within the same shot. This also applies to car crashes as when a car gets destroyed the camera shows the entire car as it gets destroyed. However, instead of pausing to display this demolished car it will instead continue to follow the action. One prime example of a George Miller expert direction is in the film there's tanker that explodes, and how he displays it incorporates many techniques. From this lone scene in a couple of seconds Miller combines CG, shot composition, and editing to seamless effect. As Max is fighting against a Warboy on a pole/ladder that's very close to touching the ground in motion he successfully kills the Warboy; with the ladder now having less weight Max attempts to get himself onto safety in the foreground on a moving car while the background a tanker is exploding within the same frame of shots. This moment doesn't last any longer than seven seconds, but seamlessly through expert uses of CG, shot composition, and editing it's a seamless flow of coherence that Miller often succeed in duplicating throughout the film.\n\nThe stunt work is nothing short of amazing. Cars are demolished on screen alongside obtaining a high body count from in the film characters death. In general, the stunt will require a dozen or so cars as well participants to do insane set pieces. Not only do the stunt crew having perform a dangerous stunt on constantly moving vehicles, but also do it with visibly little protection and sometimes with props like spears, pipes, baby bottle, spray can, and anything that can be found in this post apocalyptic film. What's pulled off successfully is a string of convincing looking stunts that at some point in the film you'll begin to believe every single stunt was done by actual person. In some scenes a dummies is used, but with an expert stunt crew it blurred the lines between a real person and dummy that it's not even noticeable even among action aficionados.\n\nCGI is used in virtually every single shot of the film, though it's mostly use on either filtering colors or enhance the effect of a scene. For instance, going back to the tanker explosion if you removed the CG from that explosion you'll still have the same explosion and stunt in place. The only thing the CG is adding was enhancing the effect of an explosion to give it more visual finesse by darkening smokes and brightening up the flames. Sometimes CG will add an explosion or make a scene colors pop out. Fury Road usage of CG is smart as it only uses it to add to a larger piece of the film instead of it taking over for an entire scene.\n\nSet design is also detailed with a rough-hewn general look for the clothings. Getting across a clear picture of this dystopia fascination with worshiping cars like a religion. There is no normal looking car in the film as you have muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. There's a lot to admired from the vehicles including the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers. The guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack, with Junkie XL using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey, mixing in suspenseful, looming soundbites to show the ever-nearing distance between threats.\n\nThe acting I can't complain about, but that's mostly because the cast provide a lot more conviction in their portrayals than the script does in providing details. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the film with most of his performance relegated to simply grunting and facial expressions. Despite the limitation in his performance Tom Hardy sells the image of a broken, desperate man. Everything his character is feeling is received by the viewer properly. Charlize Theron plays Furiousa a cool looking character with a no-nonsense attitude. Playing a complex character whose composure hides a lot of her inner turmoil. Having to display a rough surface while at the same time a character whose holding onto what little hope for a better life there is left. Her chemistry with Hardy is excellent displaying the changes in their relationship through the film going from strangers, to enemies, to partners convincingly.\n\nNicholas Hoult plays Nux a character heavy on a visual arc. He has the most easily definable character traits utilizing them in his portrayal of Nux. A character that enthusiastically goes into blindly following a belief of the antagonist to a more down to earth person contemplating a new view for life. His changes are among the most evident in the film benefiting from a character whose entire journey unlike the other two characters is seen to the finish line. Hugh Keays-Byrne is a appropriate looking \"Obviously Evil Bad Guy\" type of antagonist. His costume leaves little imagination for what kind of person he is. Consumed in the role Byrne exudes desire, hatred, and vengeance through his portrayal of the film antagonist. I also must give credit to the casting of largely unknown actor Nathan Jones and playing on his strength by giving him little words to speak and allot to express. This movie was expertly put together needless to say.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road will make you mad and furious for the wrong reasons. It's more of an issue of the shallow writing that excuses itself to be a two hour chase scene. Gazing upon it you'll be in awe at the large scale practical stunt work, and gorgeous cinematography before realizing its product of its time that is only appreciated as such. The biggest drawback to the film is it uncertainty to trust the audience; it's powerful images tell its story majestically, but due to the spoon fed dialogue the reward that comes with figuring out what occurred in the story yourself diminishes the impact when it does it for two hours. It's technical achievement on all fronts, but if the spoon fed dialogue was virtually removed than it would have also obtained a storytelling achievement to go along with its wild world.",

The acting was fine, and the action was great. It was the pacing that bothered me and the CG. The story was shoehorned in and it took the backseat like it was supposed to so, no real complaints there. I never really cared for any of the characters or their plights, the use of flashback to humanize Max didn't do that at all and rarely made any sense. It became cartoonish at points, and the other characters were underdeveloped to care about their motivation or plight. The acting was there and there wasn't a bad performance out of anyone.\n\nThe graphics when not practical, but CG looked terrible and extremely CG. There is an establishing shot of the base in the beginning and it looks like a paper cutout diorama you made in middleschool, it looked like a comic book since there was a thick outline around the people in the foreground, it was weird. Most of the CG was bad, there wasn't enough textures at times, so it had that weird plastic look to it. \n\nThe pacing was the worst offender in the film. I get that it's an epic car chase, but there were scenes that took too long and didn't really feel like it fit or did anything to further the story. There's this \"night\" scene (which is clearly a blue filter over the lens of the camera, it's that bad) that nothing seems to happen, I get that they're trying to strength the bond between the two leads, but it felt out of place and annoyed me. Then the whole movie is about running away from the problem (which is totally fine) to go to this \"Eden\", that takes a great chunk of the movie to get there, but SPOILERS, there's something wrong, \"Eden\" is dead, so they have to go back to where they came. So the first part of the movie takes 1.5hrs to get to eden and 30mins to go through now an army of cars and ruthless killers (that weren't there going out, but on their tail) to get back to the starting point. \"Eden\" should have been the middle point, the \"blue\" scene should have been cut a lot shorter (develop that relationship with action, not exposition, since nothing gets resolved there, since they tell each other their history, kind of, which we the audience already know) and more time should have been given to the fight to go back to the start. There were more problems going to \"Eden\" (don't remember what it was called in the film), then there was going through a fleet of murderous men and their vehicles. That doesn't make sense. \n\nIt's a good film, that would have been made better if Miller kept it as a mindless action film and didn't try to make it just above that. The story/pacing and CG were the biggest retarding factors in this film with a very basic and somewhat cliche premise. Ironically, Max is the most useless and unnecessary character in the film, to the point where I think he was a hinderance. His character trope is so cliched it's annoying. Guy with a troubled past that closes himself off to the world, yet it affects him enough to retard progress in the real world. He was overly melodramatic and it got annoying.",

Charlize Theron as Furiosa spends the entire movie with a single facial expression -  scowling up and to the left. It's a movie that spends 2 hours going no where - both literally and figuratively. Whereas Daniel Craig breathed new life into James Bond bringing out a dark and sinister side - almost an anti-hero - to a film classic Tom Hardy neuters Max and takes character development no where. He says about three words (does he have an inability to remember scripts or was the scriptwriter just lazy??). If they had put Mel Gibson back in the role he wouldn't even have had to act - just pay him in Jack Daniels, throw him the keys and follow him around with a steady cam.

        },
        {
            "content": "What a grand, insane work of vision is Mad Max: Fury Road. What a bold and visionary exercise has George Miller created.  In a world of action movies that are mostly thin soup, this is what you wish for from all of your action movies: something created out of sheer ingenuity and imagination, a movie that gets rolling and doesn't have time to stop; a movie in which the bright and colorful visual palette is so audacious and so fully packed that your eyes can't catch everything that the director is trying to show you the first time around. Half the time you don't understand everything that you're looking at, but you don't really mind. It's so big, so grand, so full that it demands to be seen in a theater. I pity those who hold out for television.\n\nWhat surprises me is that all greatness happens in the midst of a modern practice that I normally despise: The Reboot. Yes, George Miller is rebooting the classic genre that he helped to create, but he's not just slapping a coat of paint on an old fence, he's embracing the new while taking us happily down an old familiar road.\n\nThirty-six years ago, when Miller first conceived of Mad Max, he effectively wrote the book on how to make a movie about the apocalyptic future. His was a world gone mad, a savage and unholy world in which The Bomb had tossed humanity back to its tribal state but only far enough back that it still had trucks and motorcycles to mow each other down with. The participants dressed like professional wrestlers and shot each other at will when they weren't driving spiked vehicles into one another, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. It was unique, it was visionary, and it was such a riotous journey that filmmakers have been chasing his vision ever since.\n\nIn Mad Max: Fury Road, the McGuffin is a little more potent than just a race for gasoline. The plot here is thin enough that it doesn't bungle the action, but what it boils down to is the soul of humanity. We meet Max (Thomas Hardy) a haunted man suffering with painful bouts of PTSD - he has flashes of memories of people he failed to save. Before we can get a good look at Max, he is captured by The War Boys, a bald and skin-bleached band of cultist working under the thumb of the tyrannical King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a fearsome being where wears plastic armor and a skull mask that is really unsettling - imagine if Sweet Tooth from \"Twisted Metal\" were a rock star and you've got the idea. His cult is so vast and so audacious that his caravan travels the wastelands of Australia with it's own war drums and guitar solo. No kidding, there's a guy in this army whose function is to play guitar while strapped to truck specially designed for that purpose!\n\nWhat follows along a pattern of Miller's four Mad Max movies is that in each movie, the world appears to be getting worse. In the first Mad Max, the world was devastated but still resembled one that we recognized. In Fury Road, the remnants of humanity have returned to their feral state, still able to drive cars and have religious rites, but closer in common sense to apes then to man.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, one of Joe's warriors, the one-armed Furiosa (Charleze Theron), goes rogue and steals one of Joe's War Rigs. What the rig is carrying is more than just gasoline and weapons. I won't spoil it, except to say that Mad Max: Fury Road isn't all boys with toys. As the movie moves into its second half, it really becomes a story of tough women fighting for their own survival.\n\nThey exist amid a world in which every this is always moving. George Miller doesn't want you to catch your breath. He allows you two or three slow beats, but for most of it's running time, this is a movie that is always on the move. Essentially, it's a chase pictures, but there are so many crazy images filling the screen at all times that you have to see it twice to catch them all. Even better is that fact that his action scenes make sense. The chase scenes have an orientation so that we don't just feel that we're watching a lot of nonsensical editing.\n\nHis palette is refreshing in that it's bright and colorful, forcing you to realize how many movies these days are grim and dark and hard to see (look at the trailers for Dawn of Justice and The Fantastic Four and you'll see what I mean). But Mad Max takes place mostly in broad daylight under blazing sun. We see everything, and there are bright colors, definitive colors. Every vehicle, every costume, every location and every character has their own texture and their own look.\n\nWhat a crazy ride this is! What a unique visionary is George Miller. He is a man who can create something as violent and bloodsoaked as Mad Max and then pull the reigns back for something as sweet and beatific as Babe. What he proves with Mad Max is that there are original worlds to be created in the movies. It is still possible to make a great action picture that moves and pops and sings and excites us. He had a plan and he executed it beautifully. Just like his trucks, he kept his eye on the road, and he didn't stop for anything.",

It was a 2 hour crapfest of a whole bunch of Michael Bay B.S the storyline was horrible and made no sense this movie was an absolute boring and stupid movie... I don't understand what was so special about this film. In the acting department Charlie Theron stole the show it was her movie. Why was Tom Hardy there? It should have been called Mad Charlize: race for random crap. Seriously what were these people going after water or fuel? and 90% of these people need oxygen tanks to breathe. Then there was this one moron I'm telling you he was wearing red pajamas and looked like a mummy that was wrapped 2 days ago. Overall to its roots Mad Max: Fury Road was a comedy I laughed during this movie and people laughed during The Transporter: Refueled really?

            "content": "George Miller regresa a sus orígenes, aquellos que lo hicieron famoso al principio de los años 80... ¡Y Dios, cómo regresa! Con la que es simplemente la mejor película de acción de los últimos años.\n\nLa película nos devuelve al mundo post-apocalíptico que conocimos en la trilogía original de Mad Max. Seguimos a Max Rockatansky (Hardy), quien cae prisionero de Immortan Joe, el tiránico Lord de la Guerra (Keays-Byrne). Al verse involucrado en una persecución provocada por Imperator Furiosa (Theron), Max une fuerzas con ella para llevar a las esposas de Immortan lejos de él, a salvo en un lugar llamado \"Lugar Verde\".\n\nEsta película es un evento. Es una obra maestra. Es brillante. ¡Es perfecta! Ésa es la definición adecuada. Perfecta. George Miller ha dirigido una perfecta obra maestra del cine de acción. No exagero ni miento cuando lo digo.\n\nPrimero lo primero. No es una película hecha enteramente con efectos prácticos. Los que creen eso son idiotas. ¿Fue filmada en el desierto? Sí. ¿Son los vehículos de verdad? Sí. ¿Son las explosiones y las acrobacias genuinas? Sí. Pero créanme cuando digo que gran parte de todas esas secuencias de acción tienen CGI agregado. Y eso es lo bello del cine moderno y la tecnología. Encontrar el punto medio, encontrar la perfecta mezcla entre efectos prácticos y digitales. Sin embargo, dije que no fue hecha enteramente con efectos prácticos. Pero los efectos prácticos que tiene... ¡Son espectaculares! Asombrosas persecuciones en el desierto, explosivas, adrenalínicas, rápidas, y por supuesto ambientadas con la música personal de Immortan Joe.\n\nHay que reconocer que la verdadera protagonista de la historia es Imperator Furiosa, interpretada de manera poderosa por Charlize Theron. La actriz demuestra su inigualable talento dándole una fuerza y un carácter a su personaje que permiten que sea capaz de llevar una película en sus hombros. Furiosa es quien define los tres actos del film. Nos presenta la trama, avanza por la historia con Max como su compañero y nos da la resolución. Tal vez esa pueda ser la única \"falla\" válida que se pueda argumentar contra el largometraje. ¿Por qué el protagonista es Furiosa en una película llamada Mad Max? Muy bien, es justo. Eso no significa que esta no sea una grandiosa película. Y Max se mantiene siendo una fuerza presente durante las dos horas de duración, gracias a la actuación de Tom Hardy. Más que un digno héroe de acción es un digno Rockatansky. Su aura silenciosa y letal nos mantiene dentro del misterio de su vida personal. Lo único que se sabe de él en esta película, aparte de su nombre, es que es un hombre con un pasado traumatizante. Nada más. Y no es necesario. Este es un film situacional en el que seguimos el camino de los personajes con respecto a este arco argumental individual. No necesitamos nada más.\n\nMientras escapan de Immortan Joe, a Max, Furiosa y las esposas de Joe se les une Nux, interpretado por un irreconocible Nicholas Hoult, quien es un ahora renegado de la legión de los War Boys luego de un fracaso al intentar recuperar a sus mujeres. El grupo cruza día y noche el desierto en busca del Lugar Verde. En este punto es importante mencionar la fotografía de este film porque es maravillosa. Las tomas amplias del paisaje son impresionantes. La paleta de colores utilizada captura la vista en una forma que hace que las escenas se vean beneficiadas de su tonalidad y contraste. Incluso si no te gusta el género de acción, esta película es hermosa para simplemente admirar visualmente.\nAl llegar a lo que ellos pensaban que era el Lugar Verde, se encuentran con las Vuvalini, comunidad de mujeres en la que nació Furiosa antes de que fuera raptada junto a su madre por el Lord de la Guerra. Las Vuvalini, si embargo, ahora no son más de diez ancianas, buscando lugares para sembrar semillas. Cuanto todos deciden volver al lugar de donde escaparon Furiosa y las esposas, pues ya no está custodiado por el ejército de War Boys, es el momento en que Miller saca su carta bajo la manga y le da al poder femenino su fama definitiva en el film. Un batallón formado por Max, Furiosa, Nux, las esposas de Joe y las Vuvalini es lo que lucha contra el ejército de Immortan en una persecución que excede cualquier expectativa. ¿Ancianas montadas en motocicletas, disparando con ametralladoras y luchando cuerpo a cuerpo contra sus enemigos? ¡Esto es lo que una película de Las Indestructibles debería ser!\nVale mencionar también la banda sonora por Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) que incorpora elementos rápidos y frenéticos a la ya acelerada película de manera increíble. Y por supuesto, si hablamos de la música, hay que hablar del hombre con la guitarra lanzallamas. ¡Brillante! Se roba cada escena en la que está, tal vez la misma película. Interpretado por Sean Hape (también conocido como iOTA), es sin duda el personaje secundario más memorable de la película.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas, este film es el espectáculo de George Miller. Su genio y talento inundan este largometraje hasta el borde. Cada escena está filmada con un cuidado y majestuosidad que varios directores contemporáneos deben tener presente al admirar a este hombre de 70 años que salió del retiro para realizar este film. Esperamos con increíble ansia la secuela...",

Nicholas Hoult played a real character, I was glad to see him come out of his \"pretty boy\" shell, in my opinion. I hope to see more from him...now that I have seen this film, lol.

It had the right blend of practical effects and CGI and most of all, it made me love a movie about one big left turn.\n\nThe story was as straightforward as that of Gravity, but it's the storytelling and the performances that took it a step further for me. The first 20 minutes set the tone perfectly, allowing people to realize that there are creepy people involved in this bizarre ecosystem and they seem to be running the show.\n\nCharlize Theron is brilliant as Furiosa and, despite having Matt Hardy's character's name in the title, owns the movie. Matt Hardy performed like a true filmmaker's actor and, thankfully, didn't become overzealous to make this movie just about himself. He barely has any lines and relies on his superb, and sometimes subtle, acting chops. I keep on forgetting that these are A-list actors and not these characters everytime I watch this movie. They are that good in it. \n\nFinally, George Miller not only proves that he's not invalid because of his age, but instead, he showcases how valid he is because of his age, by making this year's greatest movie. Aces all around. Now, Bring us a sequel !!",

George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane \"chain to a speeding truck\" kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" was a road for me that will be less traveled. \n*** Average",

            "content": "I always wondered about lone critics who disagreed with the general consensus.  Did they not see the same movie the rest of us did?  And yet for Mad Max: Fury Road, I find myself going against the grain.  This was a good movie, but certainly not a great one.  The Road Warrior was a great movie.  At the risk of sounding heretic, the first half of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome might have been even better.\n\nWhat those movies had that Fury Road does not were two welcome qualities in an action movie, which are attitude and restraint.  \n\nIn regard to restraint, this movie was almost non-stop action.  That sounds good on paper, but it tends to diminish the impact of action scenes as they pile up throughout the film, one after another.  It's a bit like Indiana Jones riding off on a horse and stealing a truck from the Nazis.  It's one of the best action scenes ever filmed, but part of why it's so great is because it's not 2 hours long.  \n\nDuring parts of this film, I felt like I was watching a Cirque De Soleil performance.  It was too much, too often.  \n\nAnd though the movie had character development, it lacked attitude.  As an example from Beyond Thunderdome, there's a scene where Gibson's Max has to relinquish his weapons.  As he pulls more and more of them out from every nook and cranny, the collector of weapons has a look on his face that says, \"I've seen it all, and even I know this is one bad man\".  It's an incredible scene that sets the tone for what Max has evolved into since The Road Warrior - and it didn't take 5000 extras to film or require a massive explosion.  That's what I mean by \"attitude\".  \n\nIn Fury Road, Tom Hardy's Max never has a single moment of even that magnitude, much less a Thunderdome-esque scene where all eyes are on him.  Instead, we get that for Charlize Theron's character.  And while that might please some who are looking for more female heroines, I didn't pay to see \"Tomb Raider\".  I paid to see Mad Max.  \n\nIn The Road Warrior, the villains knew who Max was by the end (though not by name).  And the people he saved?  They knew him as well, hence the haunting monologue at the end.  But in Fury Road, it seems the only one who knew him by the end and was truly impacted by his presence along the way was Furiosa.  Which brings up a natural question, \"If the grand majority of the characters in the movie don't know or care who Max is by the end, then why should the audience?\"",

The movie critics gave it great reviews, rotten tomatoes, and IMDB all show it having approximately a 98% approval rating and now the international film festivals all giving it awards and high accolades.\nThese are all opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinions. There was just something missing when I watched this reintroduction of one of my childhood heroes. That despondent loner who was first on the search for vengeance for his life that was torn apart and then as a he wanders the dessert in a post apocalyptic Australia he finds himself an unlikely hero to people more desperate than himself. He always manages to win the fight against overwhelming odds.\nWhen watching the former Mad Max Trilogy I always felt a sense of isolation, and desperation. I felt I emotionally connected and could empathize with how lonely his world could be; His family and friends gone, food, gasoline, and water are so scarce they are priceless and coveted by all.\nMuch of what had built that emotional connection for me in those movies were the cinematography, the sound track/audio work, and the pacing. It wasn't a rip roaring adventure chase scene throughout, it slowed at times and built a sense of suspense and offered time to know and understand key characters.\n\nIn my opinion I felt at the opening of Fury Road we should have received a more thorough reintroduction to Max. Those of us who know him already, have not seen him in 30 years (certainly some have re-watched the films), others may have no clue who he is, also he has lived for a period of time wandering the post apocalyptic wasteland on his own since the last film. Show me how this has affected him. In the opening of Fury Road we get a brief voice over monologue as introduction and we see Max forced to eat a lizard as a means of sustenance. Then he is almost immediately captured by bandits from the Citadel.\nEven a brief montage of Max searching for something, fuel, food, civilization, show him on the outskirts of the Citadel contemplating if it is a safe place or hostile, give me a camera shot of a small section of road sand blowing over it as a hint of the world that use to be but is now forever lost, Max shaking an empty canteen thirsting for water, shaking empty gas cans. These small things could easily build an emotional connection to Max and make me feel a need to root for him as I then have a better sense of what it would be like in this desperate situation. \nThen we find ourselves at the Citadel... Lots of dirty skinny people here, it must be a crappy place to live but better than wandering the dessert alone. I really don't know how bad these people's lives may be but they get really excited when that rare and coveted resource called water is released...\nWait is water not such a rare resource or are these people just idiots, because when the water is released they catch about 1 cups worth in their random pots and pans then splash around in what is left on the ground. Is this a utopia of plenty filled with a population of morons?\nThen their leader Imperator Joe the one who controls the water tells them to not become addicted to the water. Everyone needs water, it's not an addiction it's a necessity Joe. Just bad dialogue...\nJoe is a God like figure to this community we later find out because he controls the water and it is pumped up from the ground and only he can command it to be released. So obviously this clan is beholden to him. Also there is plenty of water he is just holding back to maintain his hold on the community\nHe does have a very ominous mask and costume so I honestly like him as a bad guy figure regardless of some of the less than stirring dialogue he is given.\nThen we meet Furious. She gets to drive the truck. Why? I don't know. Apparently she has proved herself in this male dominated militaristic society. I appreciate woman in a strong leadership roles but this society clearly doesn't seem to be heavily dominated by women. I would have appreciated Furiosa's character had I some idea of how she managed to become so entrusted that she gets to drive the truck that hauls their most precious resources fuel, water, and breast milk. That's right the Citadel is a lady milk dairy farm. It doesn't specifically say that but it is conveyed through brief shots of women in a milking room. Just a brief glimpse into her past, flashbacks something throughout the movie to show me what she overcame could really help elevate her character and make you cheer for her. Again it's all about creating an emotional empathy for a character for me.\nSo Away she goes with her small contingent of security vehicles on her way to the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, I guess to trade milk for supplies... ROAD TRIP!!\nWe are driving, we are driving, whoa wait what? she went the wrong way...WHY!?! Don't know. Joe's crew is watching, Uh oh she's gone rogue. Why? Uh oh Joe is mad apparently Furiosa stole his lady friends or prized breeders as Joe calls them. You know pet names and all. So cute.\nJoe sends out the call to chase down Furiosa and get his ladies back. Rally the WAR BOYS!!\nNow we meet NUX, who I really didn't like in the beginning but now I will say he is the only character in the movie that was dynamic enough to make me care about him. NUX as a war boy has one purpose in life and that is to do as Joe commands and if he does an honorable job and pleases Joe he will enter the gates of Valhalla; which I can only assume is some form of heaven. As the movie progresses NUX goes from only wanting to please Joe to realizing he can do good for others and in doing so he would be more significant in this life than he ever was when he was just a war boy out to please Joe.\nAdditional characters that I believe could have used better development are the Breeders and the Mothers or old ladies, I'm not sure what they were real called because by the time we meet them I was just wishing the movie would end.\nThe breeders are taken to safety by Furiosa, or they were kidnapped by her because she thought they were abused and didn't want to be with Joe. I'm not sure if the Breeders wanted to leave or Furiosa convinced them they should leave because once they are being pursued by Joe they seem to want to return to him. A simple scene showing how these women suffered under Joe's captivity would have made me care much more about these women. Not that I want to see abuse or cruelty to women but an indication that they had suffered would build an emotional connection that you then want to help save them as well.\nThe Breeders are the central component of the movie; we should be made to care if they escape.\nThe old women seriously they just loosely tied a few things together like hey there is no green place turn around and go home. Honestly they could have driven there met no one and formulated a plan to go back.\nNow the guitar guy...\nI enjoyed the concept of the guitar guy jamming out as the war party moved along but I wanted him to actually play the music that you hear. Instead he plays a bar and then there is a score that takes over and includes none of his guitar work. I wanted him to be James Hatfield from Metallica melting my face with Fuel for fire...makes sense they need fuel, guitar guy is shooting fire. Also guitar guy is shooting fire but not using it to fight anyone, super wasteful!\nHere in a post apocalyptic world where fuel is scares and this idiot is just burning it up!!\nI don't feel a sense of scarce resource or desperation. The Breeders are wasting water when they get one of their miraculous escapes from a horde of fast moving vehicles. All the vehicles are supercharged gas guzzlers, NUX empties about 10 gallons of gas into his car in an attempt to kill himself and blow up the war wagon. Really if I was in charge and someone wasted that much gas there would be no Valhalla for them.\nI just didn't get the same desperate, these are hard times sense from this movie. I wanted to feel suspense, the whole time you just knew these guys were going to make it and Furiosa and Max would live but you knew NUX was going to be dead before the movie was over. Of course they had their close calls but never did you think \"oh man this is the end for them\".\nIt was a great bit of Cirque Du Sole style chase scenes pieced together again and again but I really could have done with 45 min less chase scene and 45 min more character development.\nOn top of all of this I'm a car guy and there were a number of ridiculous vehicle related items that were wrong or nearly impossible.\nClimbing around touching hot exhaust pipes, an 18 wheeler can escape motorcycles and supercharged cars, Nux drives with a flat tire at high speed (Max would have to stay in place for this to be somewhat possible but still incredibly unlikely, spitting a fuel mixture into the supercharger and getting boost, climbing around in an engine compartment fixing the engine while driving down the road and its not just a single engine it's a dual engine setup. This rig would lose so much power after losing 50% of its power it would be crawling along not out running all those other vehicles.\n\nYes, Yes it's just a movie don't nitpick the silly details but really character development could have tied it all together in a Lovely package for me.\n\nOkay enough of the why I didn't like it. Honestly I just wanted more of an emotional connection to the characters.\nPositives\n\tThere were lots of explosions\n\tIt was well shot\n\tThe action scenes were well choreographed\n\tJoe's costume was unique-ish (Post apocalyptic Darth Vader)\n\tPro-Breast feeding",

Instead of a dark tone, Miller chose to color the movie with nothing but bright and vibrant shades. Even the night-time scenes are a very vibrant blue.\n\nIt's quite mind-boggling to think that Miller, a 70-year old man, creating this master-class non-stop action thrill ride. The first twenty minutes are filled with more energy and passion than about any film that's come out this year. The only movie in recent memory that I'd say rivals this one in sheer intensity is Whiplash.",

            "content": "Mad Max is a sequel (one could suppose) to the three films of the Mel Gibson era, although it is more of a reinvention of the Mad Max world (or perhaps reimagining is a better word). To this end Miller brings a creative hand that is sheer spectacle on a grand scale. A little digging reveals that this film was reportedly made over a period of 14 years, initially constructed as a single chase sequence. Although the final product provides some ingenious ways of narrowing our focus in on the characters (through colourful imagery and attention to the small details), the thrill of the chase is very much intact. \n\nAs with the Mad Max motif, the setting is a post apocalyptic world where resources are slim. Max (the man of little words) finds himself enslaved in a majestic desert enclave where, along with the rest of the slaves, finds himself at the feet of a merciless leader who has been hoarding an underground water source for his own purposes. The film's plot, which is refreshingly simple against this backdrop, moves forward when (as a character suggests at one point) the people start to push back. This push back comes in the person of Furiousa (Theron), who creates a plan to free the wives who have been taken by the merciless leader for their ability to repopulate the new earth with perfect human offspring. Here the world of Furiousa and Max intersect. \n\nThere is much to be said about the details themselves. It feels like every aspect has been meticulously handled with not just intentional oversight, but intimate and personal motivation. The cars themselves become each become a character, and you almost feel a hint of sadness when they meet their demise. They are a fusion of time periods and eras, an effort to sentimentalize a time that is long past perhaps. Some of the vehicles emerge with some familiarity (the spiked menaces and the long fuel truck), while others elicit some surprises in ingenuity (the acrobatic sequences with the long extending poles come to mind). \n\nThe colour red is used for striking contrast in the desert setting, symbolizing the fine line between life and death (illuminating an epic sand storm as well). The colours merge with the characters themselves (the white attire of the retreating women also providing a striking contrast), with the underlying emotion and subtle sexual tensions that arise (which are wonderfully and tastefully explored with a degree of subtle modesty) colouring the movement of the film itself.  \n\nAt the heart of the film is the question of hope, which comes as both an idea and a character. The question that looms is one that Max assumes at one point in the film, suggesting that one needs to be careful about the idea of hope, for when hope fails your world fails with it. The idea of hope also becomes a question of the chase and the journey, a question of choices and direction. The film's concluding sequences, which I won't reveal here, becomes an intriguing commentary on these ideas, taking the layers off of the question of what happens when hope fails. \n\nThe character of Nux (Hoult) is perhaps the most intriguing, especially in a discussion of the film's heart and soul. As we move from the spectacle to the chase, and from the chase to the person, Nux, a man who knows only one form of life (blood and war) gets swept into this journey of hope. His transformation reaches outwards to the nomadic purposes of Max (whose sole purpose is to survive) and to the community minded mission of Furiousa. Nux becomes a picture of the possibilities that hope can provide in such an immersive and merciless apocalyptic setting. Life is about more than living and dying. He becomes an embodiment of redemption, of new life, even for as crippled and hopeless as his body and circumstance appear to be. Set against such an epic back drop (which includes a massive vehicle to transport a blazing electric guitar and a riser of drums.), this idea becomes somewhat monumental. \n\nMad Max is a reinvention that brings the series to a whole other level. It is spectacle and it is commentary. It is post apocalyptic and it is wonderfully retro. It moves with fury but it demands attention to detail. It is what a summer film should be.",

These films aren't big on story or character development, but I think it's more the idea of the series. You have to get lost in these films like the other characters are. You'll understand why they have do the things they do in this terrible, post-apocalyptic world, and have a good time while you're at it.\n\nThat being said, Mad Max: Fury Road is just as absurd, bizarre, unique, and... well... mad. Tom Hardy gives a funny and great performance as Max, he's a great addition to the series and a good replacement for Mel Gibson(who had a quick cameo). Charlize Theron is also cool, but I think Nicholas Hoult was far more interesting. He absolutely disappeared under the white makeup and surprised me of how much effort he was putting into this performance. I love seeing George Miller expand on his universe and really show us just how screwy the future could be if society truly would fall apart. The bigger budget makes this movie look and sound amazing, and somehow, it still contains the same feel as the first two Mad Max films(\"Beyond Thunderdome\" kinda got bland).\n\nI look forward to future installments. Continue expanding this world, George Miller. Take all my money.",

What a movie Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Mad Max (Tom Hardy) as he follows Charlize Theron as she and a few fellow women try to outrun patriarchal tyranny in the guise of the white Darth Vader aptly named just,Joe. Although Mad Max is the titular character the main protagonist is Furiosa with a story that is all the same; a feminist movie in the setting of masculine, testosterone driven, balls to the wall beginning to end action frame for frame. George Miller returns to make the fourth entrance in the film series that made him famous over 30 years ago. Its also funny that as a grandpa who has made such family films as Babe and Happy Feet shows modern day action filmmakers how it's done. He uses more practical effects and CGI sparingly to give us a fully realized encompassing story filled with so much action that will leave you in awe. If you're not captivated and don't buy into this movie you either don't like action movies, which is understandable, or you're just numb from overindulgence of action and a good old fashioned action film can't satiate you're lust for all things destructive. I recommend that this film be watched by everyone, everywhere, at any time even though its a general four out of five I must give the film a 4.4 out of 5.",

Yeah, Borderlands has more story/dialogue if you think of it over Mad Max (Mad is more action than dialogue...something I don't like very much on movies since I love more to think than to sleep). Honestly, this movie works coz it's visually stunning and if you have played those games, you will love it even more OR if you grew up watching the original...nostalgia must be the correct choice. So yes, I recommend this film only for those reasons. The music score is not that bad neither the make up but editing has it's flaws (to much speed on scenes that could work with the correct slow-neutral touch?).

            "content": "After a surprise premier at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Mad Max: Fury Road is poised to melt audience's faces off this weekend.  Supposedly picking up things where the 1985 film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome left off, George Miller's new installment in the franchise sees the titular character (this time played by Tom Hardy) facing off against more carnage, blood, guns, cars, and chaos. Max has just pissed off a local warlord/cult leader named Immortan Joe, and he is out for revenge. His escape through the Australian outback sees him cross paths with Furiosa, a dangerous and unpredictable rogue leader with her own agenda. The two form a makeshift team of sorts, and the pair must to to rely on each other in order to outwit Immortan Joe's ever growing pursuit.\n\nEssentially, this all boils down to one hell of a chase movie, filled to the brim with hyper-masculinized batshit crazy antics. Miller directs the action sequences flawlessly with a kinetic, constantly-moving energy, which adds a mesmerizing layer of visceral appeal to the whole thing. Fury Road is pure spectacle and looks great - even in 3D, where objects fly in and out of the frame without feeling too gimmicky or distracting. The level and precision of detail that went into this film is almost as crazy as the stunts; various tattoos, weapons, clothing, vehicles, makeup, etc. are all incredibly well-crafted and give the film a unique feel of time and place. Oscar nom for Best Production Design anyone?\n\nDespite the film's desire to be constantly churning on a violent machismo overdrive, Fury Road feels perplexingly feminist at times. Charlize Theron's portrayal of Furiosa easily makes her the coolest character in the film, and her determination to be both wickedly badass but still sensitive when needed overshadows Hardy's quiet and one-dimensional performance as Max. And then there is a scene where an all-women militia take out a human trafficking gang. Girl power for the win.\n\nFury Road, like many other films of its genre, suffers a bit from lack of characterization, dialogue, and undervalued performances. The most we ever hear from Max is during the opening voice-over, where he sprawls on giving the necessary exposition to explain that this is a post-apocalyptic film where survival is valued and ethics and law are not. I wish we could have seen more of an explanation for his backstory, or more interactions with him and Furiosa - just something more to show that Max is indeed a person and not some lifeless prop.\n\nDespite it's few setbacks, Fury Road keeps the narrative tight and compelling, which compliments the unstoppable fluidity of the action. It's a rich and immersive film, sure to impress those who can stomach it's brutality, and a rare treat to see something so adrenaline-packed without compromising on story.\n\nLeaving me feeling like a child at the amusement park, Fury Road no doubt sets the bar high for what a summer action flick can and should aspire to.",

Strong yet human and real and tougher than you, she delivers through and through.. Her portrait of Furiosa is nothing short of epic and it's her sub-plot that drives most of the movie. Even the redemption of the warboy outshines Max. Using Max as the pallet to mix the other stories is a brilliant bit of film making. \n\nThere was no need to make this a Mad Max movie and I suspect it was a device Miller needed to get the studios on board.

Even more surprising than watching a 70 year old George Miller hand Hollywood's action filmmaking elite their own asses, is that Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the star of the film. Theron has created a badass for the ages and the decision to have her character drive the narrative is brilliant. This film is a triumph of high energy, action filmmaking and deserves to be seen repeatedly on the largest screen humanly possible.",

            "content": "Get ready to replace your eyeballs after this experience, as Max Rockatansky is back in his most explosive, sensory overloading, vehicular led journey yet! Fury Road, a petrolhead's sand infused dream come to beautiful yet utterly bonkers existence in George Millers long gestating action extravaganza, that not only laughs in the face of modern blockbusters, but blows them away by creating some of the most outstanding carnage ever captured for our screens. \n\nIn a modern day and age where it's hard for action events to differentiate themselves from each other, blockbusters that are CGI laden and shaky cam heavy, Fury Road does the impossible and turns what is essentially a 2 hour long desert set car chase into something that is unique and refreshingly mad. With a budget in the hundreds of millions and a crew that clearly knew how to deliver the goods, 70 year old director Miller has had his visions come to roaring fruition, from the cars, the inhabitants and the milk productions, this is the apocalyptic wasteland that Miller must of envisioned all the way back with the original Mad Max, but only know did technology met the requirements. \n\nIt's without question that what elevates Fury Road to the next level of pure cinematic enjoyment is the fact that the world we enter into for these 2 adrenaline fuelled hours is a world that feels like a living breathing entity, a handcrafted and often destructively beautiful labour of love. There will be a constant reminder to oneself that what you are seeing is largely perfectly constructed stunts and props played out to painstakingly elaborate setups. Every clash of metal on metal, every loud burst of exhaustive vehicle power and every swaying stunt man is a sight to behold and thanks to a thankfully strong cast of leads and supports, Miller's orchestrated chaos is not lost by the wayside.\n\nIt was never going to be an easy task for the actor stepping into Mel Gibson's leather boots, but man of the moment Tom Hardy does a solid if slightly unmemorable job in his new gig, in what is a role that sees Max play wingman to Charlize Theron's feisty and soon to be iconic Imperator Furiosa. It's a criticism of the film that it does seemingly waste an opportunity to get more out of Hardy and while there are small moments of greatness and thankfully humour (Max heading off at night-time to take care of a car full of bandits springs to mind) his turn is not a highpoint of the film. While criticism can be made of this aspect of Fury Road, it's also in an opposite effect a huge win for the film that it doesn't rely solely on the charisma or bulking presence of Hardy to succeed and finds great moments when Theron takes centre stage and in the moments from support from Nicholas Hoult as bad luck War Boy Nux and a fantastic bandit named Doof Warrior who takes inspiration from Jimi Hendrix with his axe work. \n\nAn action event of recent times unparalleled equals and quite possibly one of the most purely visceral and intense action films ever made, this wild and frightfully wild car chase is going to please fans of not only the Mad Max universe but cinema fans the world over. George Miller toiled long and hard to get his ultimate vision to our screens and after all his blood sweat and tears its fantastic to be able to say Fury Road is the great success that it is and hopefully the beginning of an all new saga for our beloved road warrior. \n\n4 and a half dedicated guitar players out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check into - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

When you come up again you find yourself in a beautifully put together movie that grabs your hand and yanks you by the arm down its path until the final minute.  Leaving you with the sense that you have just sat through the greatest two hours in action movie history. And that is what Mad max is, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It doesn't slap you across the face with politics or social issues and doesn't try to shove the directors ideals down your throat. It is pure action, unadorned and as naked as the wives. If you are looking for Max to deliver some deep monologue about his feelings, you might be disappointed. If you expect him to be Max. He is spot on.",

            "content": "30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.\n\nSo the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian  science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.\n\nThe first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!\n\nSo one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.\n\nMost of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.\n\nLastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.\n\nThe action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.\n\nThat's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.\n\nThe greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.\n\nStill, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.",

Before I ramble on and on, I'll keep it short and simple: Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie ever made. I enjoy bringing people who haven't seen it to see it so they too can experience what I think with time will be considered the best action movie ever by not just me, but by the majority of long-time film critics. See it twice, three times, see it ten times (I've heard of someone who has seen it 11 times), just make sure and see it once and get ready for roller-coaster adrenaline soaked 2 hour movie experience like no other. All I can say is it's so shiny, so chrome.",

From seeing the sandstorm on the big screen to feeling the seats shake with the soundtrack I couldn't imagine seeing this movie on the small screen. Overall I give this movie an 8.5/10. It is a great movie for anyone who likes action movies\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is the 4th film in the Mad Max franchise. It takes place in an apocalyptic future where fuel and water is scarce. The plot revolves around Max teaming up with Furiousia after she frees a group of Immortal Joe's (the leader of the Cult like city known as the Citadel ) sex slaves. As they try to escape to the fabled \"green place\"\n\nPros: over all this movie was a great action movie therefor this movie had great action. The action was all fast paced and exhilarating. The range of different cars and weapons created many interesting and dynamic fight scenes. Each was fast paced and unpredictable while still making sense. The character of Furiousa was great. Her lack of lines is made up with the impact of her lines and the depth to her character. The effects were great, since it was mostly practical the little amounts of CGI all looked great  especially the sandstorm scene. The soundtrack was awesome, it was great how they actually integrated the soundtrack into to the action scenes. It also took full advantage of the surround sound in the theatre. At times the sound would actually make the sets shake. The colour scheme was dynamic and the setting was great. The dessert setting was used perfectly. It was used in a wide range a ways that helped advanced the story for things like not having characters die when they fall and showing how far points were  from each other. \n\nCons: Max as a character was slightly flat. The first act of the movie was hard to follow. It seemed to just to flow from action scene to action scene without having much story in between. Another issue was the culture of the syndicate wasn't really explained. This cause more confusion, but eventually the audience is just forced to except it.  \n\nThis is a movie that you need to see in theatres.

The chasing scenes are the most brutal and jaw dropping as far as I can remember. The movie is beautifully shot with well great pacing. I've seen the last 3 Mad Max films but this one, it's just way beyond Mad Max. It is superbly amazing in every way. As far as the characters goes, I like Tom Hardy as Max, he might be different compared to Gibson's version of Max but, this guy nailed it. But Charlize Theron as Furiosa, I think this character will be remembered. She is super badass in this film. She really brings the impact of this film, the real hero till the end. Everything in this film is fantastic. It will or should have a sequel that's for sure. And people are furiously excited for the next one.

The entire movie basically takes place on the back of one specialized fuel truck, and that is pretty much it!\nThe casting for Max himself, was not right either...

Max Rockatansky has emerged from the waste land in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) to show us the light of epic cinema. George Miller gets another bite at the Mad Max apple and produces a Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) type epic while making a strong feminist statement in a post apocalyptic acid trip fever dream.\n                 \n        I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the uncanny valley but the epic scope of Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) versus Revenge of the Sith (2005, George Lucas, USA) is apparent to anyone whose viewed both.  CGI is helpful and can be a great asset to a filmmaker. Fury Road has over 2,000 visual effects shots[i]. That being said it's not how much CGI you use but how you use it. It's the motion in the ocean not the size of the boat. Often Miller's use of CGI is used to color correct shots, add clouds to the clear Namibian sky, and dessert rocks turned a much richer hue.\n              \n        After screening Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) themes George Miller was hinting at in Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (George Miller, AUS, 1985) became much clearer.  The Triple Goddess helps redeem Max when he is at his most feral, his humanity holding on by a shred and our titular hero can only manage guttural sounds in lieu of language. Tom Hardy plays the titular character in this latest Mad Max incarnation. Max fights to protect the maiden or in this case maidens. He is aided and rescued by the mother and in this case the mother is the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron crushes this role), and lastly he is aided by the crone. In Miller's post apocalyptic wasteland the crone is a bunch of motorcycle driving, seed toting, rifle shooting bad ass grandmas.\n\n        At one point Max washes blood off his hands using the contents of a tanker full of mother's milk.The themes in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) are often not subtle but don't seem heavy handed in a movie that has little to no exposition. In an era when movies find it necessary to have a pseudoscience explanation for our super heroes and science fiction it's refreshing to have a movie not crow bar in needless exposition. Much like Sergio Leone Miller uses action and his actor's body language and facial expressions to convey story instead of relying on dialogue.  In Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) there's no time to waste with monologues as the drums of war beat in the distance and a war party race towards you and among them is flame throwing guitar player strapped to a flat bed full of speakers racing down the dessert with dozens of other maniacs painted white. Oh did I forget to mention the maniacs in white body paint drive hot rods that have gentlemen with explosive spears ridding atop them.\n                 \n        I've heard the notion bandied around that George Lucas is treated unfairly by adult fans who didn't like the prequels. That the movies were not bad they were just now adults and not the target audience as they were in 1977. Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) takes that thesis and crumples it up and tosses it in the rubbish bin. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, AUS, 1981) & the Star Wars trilogy live in the same sweet spot in my pre-adolescent heart. In fact they are probably neighbors and enjoying going over each other's homes for summer BBQs or drinks around the holidays. Coincidently they live down the street from Raiders of Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, USA, 1981). If my review hasn't been clear up till now stop reading this and go see this movie NOW!\nBy Jake Cohen\n5 out of 5 Martin Riggs(s). RECOMMEND",

I will admit when I first saw the trailer I was unsure as to whether this would be any good, but after seeing it in theaters I had absolutely no doubts. It manages to stay surprisingly human while also completely suspending all logic with thrillingly insane action. Many people might say that there is no story, however I would argue that one reason why it's so good is its nuanced yet rich story. For example, the reason that the little girl in Max's mind is so haunting is because she's such an enigma. We never fully see her backstory or get hit over the head with clunky exposition about it, and yet she is an essential part of the story. All-in-all, I would say that out of the many I saw this summer, this is by far the best action movie of 2015. Full stop.",

So I took my chances and saw it.\n\nHoly shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.\n\nThe reviews are all true. This film is fantastic and by far better than any other Mad Max film produced to date. It's not one of those brainless action movies, it has everything. An thrilling story, outstanding acting, score that fits well, and even makeup/costumes.\n\nOf course, the action is absolutely epic. One of my very minor complaints though, is that the film doesn't take full advantage of its R rating. The film was action packed no doubt though, and with our futuristic technology, it became miles better than any of the other films.\n\nThe performances as well, blew my mind. Charlize Theron is almost as bad-ass as it gets. She stole the show, which brings me to Tom Hardy. He was quite good and I think he was the perfect match for the role, but he rarely had any lines. So to me this seems more like a Mad Furiosa movie rather than a Mad Max one.\n\nOf all the films I have recommended you to watch, this one tops it all. Its a must watch, but is not just mindless action. It has a story and everything a good movie comes with. If this film is out of my top 10 and even top 5, its going to be one heck of a year.

I still remember flocking into the IMAX theatre for the very first time in my life in Bangalore. The screen was much bigger and clear in comparison to other theatre. But then, you cant really attribute all the amazement to the environment. I'd say that this day was memorable only because of me being able to witness a film which would mark its place in cinematic history as one of the finest action movies of ALL time. George Millers vision is so captivating that the moment we see the brown sand simmering in the screen, we know what this planet would be like in decades to come. As the film progresses, I kept wondering that how well were the scenes choreographed, the action set pieces , characters, make ups et cetera. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron acted well and played their part with absolute perfection but the real surprise to me was Nicolas Hoult. He was a show stealer in some of the scenes. Especially the last one, wherein he rams the CAR at Rictus and mentions \"Witness Me\"",

So many summer blockbusters feel like they've had all their creativity and originality picked away to dumb it down for a mass audience.  Then along comes 75-year-old director George Miller, who was given a big pile of cash and left all alone to continue his Mad Max franchise.  Tom Hardy successfully steps in for Mel Gibson, but otherwise this retains, and actually improves upon all the elements that made The Road Warrior such a classic.  While the performances, production design and cinematography are all impressive, it's the fact this film relies on 100% practical effects and stunt work for its thrills.  Unlike every other mega-budget movie Hollywood barfs out, Mad Max isn't drowning in pointless, over-the-top CGI.  You know everything you're seeing on screen is actually happening and that's what makes it such an insanely enjoyable experience.  If I have one complaint, it's that Max pretty much remains on the sideline for much of the film.  Which is a shame considering what a great actor Hardy is.  Here's hoping he comes out of his shell and is front and centre for the next chapter.  Otherwise this is without a doubt one of 2015's best!",

            "content": "Taking one look at the theatrical poster for Mad Max: Fury Road, gives you all the suggestion you need that this won't be what you expect.\nThe titular character is masked, facing off screen, his eyes fixed on something entirely different, and partially eclipsed by a shaven headed, badass woman in war paint. She's close to us, her eyes fixed just beside us, right here with the problem at hand. There is a lot of meaning in that arrangement, as you'll soon see.\n\n The post-apocalyptic genre has seen an awful lot of come and go over the decades, with sizzling hits and staggering failures throughout, all because it's a polarizing genre. Not everyone gets or enjoys it, and some just can't stand the bleakness of the concept. Sure, it's bleak, morbid even, seeing the future of a destroyed world and the barren folk who still live there. For those with a taste for adventures taking place after the world as we know it, you pretty much can't beat Mad Max: Fury Road. \n\nMore so than any other film in recent years, Mad Max: Fury Road lives up to its title. Usually the words after the colon in a film title seem to be chosen entire at random, like they just chucked a bunch of words like 'Redemption' and 'Revelations' into a bingo machine and just had at it.\nIn Mad Max, you better believe there's a road. And damn is it fucking furious. Right from the ass-kicking opening, our titular hero being captured by crazed white painted desert marauders, you can't be ready for the chaos that will ensue, as before you know it, you're thrust along on a 2 hour non-stop, high speed car chase through the wastelands of the world that once was. \n\nMax has been captured by the foot soldiers of Immortan Joe, the god-like leader of his own personality cult filling an entire city. Immortan Joe holds the thousands under him in rapturous worship, controlling all the water and all the power in the known region. Organizing cargo runs that control the supply of bullets and gas with sister cities across the wastelands, Joe is master of all he surveys, most of all leading the white painted Warboys who serve his wishes with an obsessed zealotism.\n\n Setting his latest tanker full of supplies off on a run across the wastes, Joe basks in the idolatry from his audience, unaware that what he holds most dear is being smuggled out from under his nose by his most trusted of soldiers, the one armed sharp shooter Furiosa.\nWhen Furiosa turns off the planned course in her tanker, taking the precious cargo contained within, the enraged Joe gathers a force unlike the world has ever seen to reclaim his property. The poor-fortuned Max, currently being used as a living blood bag to a sickened warboy, is dragged along, and strapped to the helm of one of a thousand revving cars, trucks and crazed automobile monstrosities that blast out to give chase after Furiosa. From that point on, all you can do is hold on for the ride.\n\nThere are great characters at play through the action, and they're a huge part of what makes the film so enjoyable. Furiosa, the driving (badum-tish) force behind the heroes, is as strong a character as you'll see on screen today. A brutal woman with a shattered past, a killer shot, and a Mean-Machine style mechanical arm, it's tough to take your eyes off her. \n\n The villains of the piece are works of art in themselves. Immortan Joe himself is the echo of a military general crossed with a spiritual leader, bearing a booming voice and a horrific breathing apparatus rigged to his face. He's a great villain, not just for his silver tongue and commanding screen presence, but because he leads the forces of the wastelands at every turn personally, he's a constant threat at the heels of the heroes, not a distant enemy, and it makes him a far more enjoyable villain.\nAnother fascinating personality at play amidst the chase is Nux, one of Immortan Joe's warboys. Young, feisty, and desperate to please his beloved Joe by any means, Nux drives a flaming classic car armed with explosives and a death wish. Nux is a wonderful alternate viewpoint to see the events of the film through. So different from the cold, determined logic of Furiosa, Nux is impulsive, obsessive and blinded by worship. The travels of Nux through the story is one of the films highlights.\nLost amidst the races and flames and fire blasting guitar players suspended from trucks? Max himself is there too. It's easy to forget the unfortunate man strapped to the front of Nux's car. \n\nMax is an interesting spin on the classic action hero. He's not as good a driver as Nux, he's not as skilled a shot as Furiosa. He has no personal vendetta against Joe, he doesn't know where he's going, and he's just along for the ride. He barely grunts a few lines of dialogue through the entire film. Thrust through the storyline set into motion by Furiosa, and contested between her goal and her enemies, Max is a lost soul who we can watch the crazed proceedings through, who never overshadows the rest of the cast. The titular hero is not the most interesting character, so in a remarkably wise writing choice, isn't hamfisted into being main focus. \n\nThe closest thing I can compare Mad Max: Fury Road to, is a great anime film. The old ones, the ultra-violent, apocalyptic worlds populated by the most crazed, disfigured villains you've ever seen. Watching Mad Max put me back in the place of unique excitement I first found watching Violence Jack or MD Geist as a kid, that crazy, wild fun that you almost don't believe you're seeing for a moment. From start to finish, it's larger than life, it's noisy and wild, and It. Does. Not. Stop.",

            "content": "Mad Max: Fury Road | Review | ?????\nPlot | In a post-nuclear desert dystopia we follow the story of Road Warrior, Max and Rebel, Furiosa and their attempt to overthrow the patriarchy.\nReview | A lot of people claim that this film lacks plot and dialogue, it is to my belief that people have become accustomed to over complicated plots, over explanation and too much exposition. This film really stripped filmmaking techniques back to basics. All of the characters are defined by what they do and not what they say. I think that by using this technique they have proven that simple really is best. The plot follows the story of four rape victims and a military rebel as they escape from a vicious warlord. They are then faced with joining forces with Max, who for the most part, doesn't really say much. Whilst a lot of people have put the lack of dialogue down to 'Broody Characters' tropes, I believe that the use of silence to explore how the characters are feeling is well done. Do you honestly believe that prisoners of war would have much to say? It is implied that Max hasn't spoken to another human in quite a while and I think his lack of dialogue shows that he isn't comfortable or trusting. I think the characters are incredibly complex and although they are difficult to connect with, you do root for all of the characters. Because of the lack of dialogue, we only know what Max knows and I think that really establishes the lack of trust between the characters, this keeps the audience on their toes, constantly. We are most certainly along for the ride with Max. \nIn terms of story, I personally interpreted this as a social commentary on feminism. With the main plot line of four rape victims running from the warlord master, it is to my belief that the film comments on female life and where it is in terms of a hierarchy in gender. There are also numerous other scenes, which really make the audience think about issues other feminist centric issues. There is a scene in which a pregnant woman is heavily injured and the warlord (without question) cuts open the woman's belly to save the life of a child. Which poses the question: When did a fetus' life become more important than that of a 20 (ish) year old women. Just an interesting thought because regardless of whether or not you yourself would or wouldn't have an abortion, shouldn't the choice be that of the woman's, (Who in this case bled to death after having a C-section to save the rape child of her warlord. Whilst the events in the film are dramatized for the purpose of storytelling, the incidents strongly resemble issues that span outside of first world feminism, such as FMG, Child Marriage & Sex Trafficking.\nIn terms of climax, the whole film builds up to a fantastic female lead victory in which the warlord is murdered by his other rape victims and the group of misfits head back to society in which they live to offer equality for all.\nThe visual aspects of the film consist of steam punk inspired desert warriors with exciting and unique editing. Shout out to Margaret Sixel (The Editor) who did an incredibly bang up job. The editing was innovative, new, fast & captivating. The majority of the film was made up of practical effects, and it was brilliant, everything seemed so real and I really felt like I was part of the chase.\nPerks to this film:\n Female lead cast.\n Disabled female protagonist.\n Social commentary on the patriarchy. \n Makes you question world issues. \n Teaches us about inclusive feminism.\n A brilliant narrative and well-written characters.\nIf you haven't seen this film already, go watch it. If you aren't really a fan of strong female characters, you won't like this film. Over all this film is a fresh view on the social commentary of the societal patriarchy and hierarchy of gender and I loved it.",

The strong performances help; performances that also elevate the occasionally ridiculous script and give it hard hitting depth. Tom Hardy is sensational despite being effectively mute and muzzled for a great deal of the film. \nThe attention to detail in the visual style, narrative universe and cinematography is worthy of accolade and is probably the reason such an outrageous movie is so immersive. \nI saw it twice within a week.",

I still don't think it is in any way a masterpiece, but the action sequences are glorious and at times truly thrilling. George Miller can't be praised enough for avoiding CGI as much as possible, and instead relying on death-defying stunt work, and a huge lot of practical effects. It's hard to imagine how much planning and rehearsal had to go into orchestrating these sequences of pure exhilaration. Still, there is not much beyond the fireworks to hold everything together. The actual story isn't all that compelling or surprising, and a tad more characterization would have been welcome. When it comes to dramatic weight Fury Road is fairly bare bones, to say the least. There are also a lot of stylistic flourishes that I just didn't really care for. With that said, the extended chases are certainly impressive and the cinematography and editing is truly outstanding.",

I'd seen many say that it was the best pure action movie of the last 10 years. Did Fury Road live up to those expectations for me? Mostly, yeah. I wasn't a fan of the original movies (though I did have a small fondness for Beyond Thunderdome), and thankfully MM: Fury Road blows those movies out of the water. Which is pretty fantastic that the original's director is the director/creator here. With the film technology and budget present, George Miller seems to have made the Mad Max movie he's always wanted to (I assume, perhaps having had 30 year to think about that world he came up with better ideas after his original movies). So is this the best pure action movie of the last 10+ years? I'm not sure, though surely there's not much competition. The old school action movie is mostly dead, with comic book movies and martial arts movies taking their place. I don't consider comic book movies to be part of the \"pure action movie\" genre/type, so that seems to mostly leave martial arts movies. I feel Asian cinema is still the leader in action scenes, but Fury Road comes close. It's certainly the best action chase movie that I can think of since Terminator 2. Beyond all of the ranking, the movie itself is great. It's hard to single out any moments of greatness and I'll just single out the whole movie as being awesome. Charlize Theron is the real action hero of the movie, not Tom Hardy as Max, she has the best female action hero character since at least Uma Thurman as The Bride in Kill Bill, and a spiritual successor to, again, Sarah Connor in Terminator 2. She just rocked the whole movie, and Tom Hardy really takes a back seat in his own character-named movie. Also, this is the first movie in 20 years that while watching I was thinking \"I want these vehicles to be toys I can buy.\" I'm not a car guy, but the different vehicles in this movie were so freaking cool!

            "content": "Here's this year's best post-apocalyptic science fiction film, which wonderfully restarts a franchise that has influenced a whole number of sci-fi films. Partly rebooting George Miller's first three films, this film acts as a Mad Max for a new generation of filmgoers. \n\nThe film is one big chase, with ten or fifteen minutes of a breather so the audience, and characters, can take a short rest before the final big action piece.\n\nTom Hardy fills Mel Gibson's shoes nicely, making Max a gruff and silent character. Hardy brings real charisma to the role, proving that he's definitely the next big actor in the industry. Charlize Theron commands the screen nicely, working alongside Hardy perfectly, as a tough, no-nonsense woman who isn't the usual damsel in distress. Theron is tough and calculating. Nicholas Hoult is terrific as a young man who joins Max and Theron's character, Furiosa, on their journey, and Hugh Keays-Byrne is truly menacing as the central villain, Immortan Joe. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton are also excellent as Joe's wives, also being very fierce in the film as strong women.\n\nThe film centers on Max, who is kidnapped by Joe's forces, and used as a blood donor. Max than teams up with Furiosa, who has saved Joe's wives from imprisonment, which results in Joe leading his forces after them to retrieve his wives.\n\nThe action, which is mostly practical, is outstanding in the film, since most of the film is one big chase, wonderfully staged. Seeing the use of practical effects over CGI is a welcome relief when many films now a days have started to mostly focus on CGI, which with most films have been very tiring. The chase, as the practical effects, wonderfully supports the plot, further moving the characters along and the story, while even going in unexpected directions that you don't see coming.\n\nThe cinematography, which goes away from the desaturated look of most apocalyptic films, is very colorful. For the day it is orange and for night blue, which gives a very beautiful, original look to the whole film. John Seale actually came out of retirement to shoot the film, bringing a very new and different look to the genre. Junkie XL's music is action packed and very explosive, supporting the action, chase aspect of the film and the characters. The music, like the film, never calms down.\n\nThe film also acts as a great new take on the first three films. This film mainly intended as a new take for a new generation. Going into this film, you don't even need to see the first three films, since Miller, who also directed the first film in 1979, Mad Max, and its two sequels, allows this film to feel new and fresh. While flashbacks are shown of Max's family being killed, the approach is new in a way, which works very well for a new audience going into this for the first time.\n\nThe film also does a good job of empowering women and giving them strong roles, which supports this film very well. There have been a few men rights groups who have criticized this move, since they feel that this has put Max in the background (even though they haven't seen the film when an article on this topic was revealed during the film's release). Max is still given a central role, just as much as Theron, while the film allows all of the characters, man and female, to be very strong. This works very well, since the film is trying to go against female slavery, which Joe, the villain, is trying to do, enslaving his wives so he can have strong children.\n\nThe end result is a film that is not only terrific, but utterly outstanding, doing something that has been seen before. No doubt that this film will live for ages and also change the science fiction genres and take it in a completely new direction. This is a film everyone needs to see.",
