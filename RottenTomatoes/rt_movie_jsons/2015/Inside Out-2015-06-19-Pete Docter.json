            "content": "Inside Out, the 2015 animated film from Pixar, is an absolute cinematic masterpiece that captures the complexities of human emotions in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant way. Directed by Pete Docter, the film takes viewers on a journey through the mind of an 11-year-old girl named Riley, as her emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust - navigate her life during a challenging period of transition. Here are several reasons why Inside Out is a masterpiece:\n\nGroundbreaking Concept: Inside Out presents a fresh and groundbreaking concept that delves into the inner workings of the human mind and explores the intricate world of emotions. The film personifies emotions as characters who operate in a control center, known as Headquarters, and their interactions and dynamics are brilliantly portrayed. The film's unique concept challenges conventional storytelling and provides an innovative and thought-provoking approach to depicting emotions on screen.\n\nEmotional Depth: Inside Out delves into the complexity of human emotions with remarkable depth and authenticity. It portrays how emotions are intertwined and how they shape our thoughts, memories, and actions. The film masterfully depicts the interplay of emotions, showing how Joy and Sadness are not mutually exclusive, but rather essential for each other's existence. The exploration of Sadness as a crucial emotion, often overlooked in society, is a groundbreaking approach that highlights the importance of embracing all emotions as part of the human experience.\n\nVisual Brilliance: The animation in Inside Out is visually breathtaking. Pixar's attention to detail is evident in every frame, creating a vibrant and immersive world that represents the inner workings of the mind. The creative use of color, lighting, and visual cues to represent different emotions and memories adds depth and richness to the storytelling. The stunning visuals enhance the emotional impact of the film, making it a truly cinematic experience.\n\nRelatable Storytelling: Inside Out tells a universal story that resonates with audiences of all ages. The film depicts the challenges of growing up, dealing with change, and navigating complex emotions in a relatable and heartfelt manner. It explores the struggles of adolescence, the importance of family and friendships, and the emotional journey we all go through as we mature. The story is presented in a way that is accessible to both children and adults, making it a film that can be appreciated by audiences of all generations.\n\nMemorable Characters: The characters in Inside Out are lovable, relatable, and memorable. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are not just caricatures of emotions, but fully fleshed-out characters with their own personalities and motivations. Their interactions are both humorous and poignant, creating a deep emotional connection with the audience. The film's endearing characters are a testament to Pixar's ability to create multi-dimensional characters that resonate with audiences long after the credits roll.\n\nImpactful Themes: Inside Out delves into meaningful and impactful themes that are relevant to everyone. The film explores the importance of emotional intelligence, the need to acknowledge and embrace all emotions, and the value of memories and experiences in shaping our identities. It also delves into the complexity of mental health, highlighting the importance of taking care of our emotional well-being. These themes are handled with sensitivity and depth, making Inside Out a thought-provoking and introspective film that prompts meaningful conversations.\n\nFinally, Inside Out is a cinematic masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and animation. Its groundbreaking concept, emotional depth, visual brilliance, relatable storytelling, memorable characters, and impactful themes make it a film that resonates with audiences on multiple levels. It is a testament to Pixar's storytelling prowess and their ability to create films that are not only entertaining but also thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. Inside Out is a must-watch for anyone!",

The CGI is very good and I enjoyed the variety of different, somewhat hyperactive characters, not just the 5 main emotions but the imaginary friend, Bing Bong, who cries sweets (candy), among others.\n\nI enjoyed it - it is a little cheesy and rather sickly sweet at the end but its not too bad overall, for a kids film.\n\nWould I recommend it?

            "content": "A film created both for children and adults, which approaches psychological concepts in an outstandingly creative and accessible manner.\n The Fantasy, Animation, Comedy, Kids & Family movie \u2018Inside Out' (2015), directed by Pete Docter, finds an original way of depicting the processes our mind goes through during the times it is taken over by different emotions and memories.\n After freshly moving out with her family to San Francisco, 11-year-old protagonist Riley Andersen, whose mind is controlled by 5 basic emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger, is having a hard time getting accustomed to the new environment, thus longing for the old days and bringing back the bittersweet memories of her birthplace. This, however, means that the lead in the Brain Headquarters would be taken by Sadness, which is seen negatively by the other emotions, especially Joy, who took the leader role. In her attempt of getting Sadness to step back from the control panel, the both end up sucked out of the Headquarters, accompanying Riley's core memories, which they now have to find a way to restore, in order to keep Riley's personality, all while Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take charge of Riley's life, with disastrous results.\n What I mostly liked about the movie was the writing, which was done very accurately to portray how emotions and memories help make us who we are. The team managed to illustrate Joy as the most complex emotion, envisioning her as vulnerable and intangible because she was \"unapologetically positive\". They had the idea about Joy's potential to excessively manipulate youth, creating Riley's \"social storms\", which is an excellent way of addressing toxic positivity. The key-message that is highlighted throughout the events in the film is that happiness implies feeling sadness as well. Loving someone intrinsically means feeling hurt when we lose them. We NEED sadness in our lives, in order to fully experience joy. We need to cope with painful situations from time to time, in order to grow and become better as a person. (\"Crying Helps Me Slow Down And Obsess Over The Weight Of Life's Problems.\" - Sadness)\n Another great aspect of the movie is its animation, particularly the character design. The team had been assigned a hard job of visualising and turning abstract concepts into understandable for kids animated characters. Not only have they given every character a unique colour and shape pattern (with Anger being shaped like a brick, Joy - a star, Sadness - a teardrop and Fear being tall and thin like a nerve), but they totally moulded each of the emotions from different textures, as well as even making their moves different, accordingly to their personalities (making Fear to be all floppy and dangling all the time and Anger to always keep his stiff, still posture). On top of that, they even went as far as making Joy glow from within, by creating a \"sparkly\" aura for her, which took a lot of time and efforts.\n All in all, I can admit that having watched the animation more than 3 times doesn't make rewatching it every time any less of a tear-jerker. It is hands down a brilliant production, put together for both children and their parents to enjoy. I absolutely recommend it for a family movie night, not only because it's a much simple way of teaching a child about how their mind works, but also because it's a great tool to help people of any age understand themselves more and learn how to figure out their emotions and besides, it offers some great insight into psychology and neuroscience in a highly uncomplicated way.",

            "content": "Pixar has made movies of all kinds - What if toys had feelings, what if insects had feelings, what if monsters had feelings, what if cars had feelings, what if fishes had feelings, what if rats had feelings. And now they have made Inside Out - what if feelings had feelings? Inside Out is probably one of the most underrated movies that Pixar has made. It was the first original Pixar movie which I didn't get to know about when it released (the first such one was a sequel, Monsters University), and I'm really surprised how this movie gets overlooked so easily.\nThe way I see it, this movie is a social commentary about how we perceive life with our emotions. Riley here is a metaphor of us, how we feel when we move to a new place and are unable to handle the new life. In such situations we either feel scared, angry or depressed. When Riley starts crying in class, Joy tries to stop Sadness from ruining her memory with a vacuum but ends up destroying all her other memories. This is another metaphor from our lives, where we end up forgetting all our happy memories in times of desperation.\nLater on Joy and Sadness are in her memories, where they see Riley's childhood drawing of Bing Bong whom she considered her friend. The plot has been made with a complete sense of nostalgia. When we feel nostalgic, we feel both happiness and sadness at the same time. We are happy because we got to live those times, the time which was better than what we are living at the moment. We are sad because we know that time never stops, and so everyday we are straying further away from when it happened. We will never be able to live the day again, and it shall only stay in our memory.\nWhile Joy and Sadness are not present Fear, Anger and Disgust control her. I don't think I need to explain this. Riley has lost all her happiness and does not feel any sadness. Keep in mind she had previously cried in class, which is something very embarrassing for a ten year old child. As a result she does not want to show her sorrow in front of everyone since she fears people will laugh at her, so instead she tries to cover it with anger and disgust. This is just like how we behave when we are depressed but are also too afraid of what others might think if they learn about it.\nAnd then there is the memory dump, the place where the old memories are forgotten. This is one of the deepest messages that the movie gave us. To save Joy and Sadness and allow them to get out of the pit, Bing Bong readily sacrifices himself. This is because he had always considered himself and Riley friends, and he was ready to sacrifice his own life for this. It also shows how Riley has now lost the memory of Bing Bong due to her depression and frustration, and it is something she will never remember again. This is a metaphor of how we forget the small details from our childhood which gave us joy once we grow out of the phase. It also symbolises that although Bing Bong has been lost forever, Riley's joy and sadness will always remember him. This is similar to how we get nostalgic whenever we see our childhood writings and drawings.\nAnd finally when Joy and Sadness do make it back, then Joy chooses to let Sadness guide Riley. If she wanted she could have guided Riley and make her feel happy about reuniting with her parents. But in that case the moment would have completely lost the impact. So instead Sadness did it, which is why Riley started crying, something she had not done for a long time. This is yet another metaphor of when we are unable to hold our sorrow for too long and burst out crying. As a result her parents are finally able to understand the situation she is in and give her more love.\nIn the end Riley starts feeling happy, since everyone has understood the value of Joy. She was the first emotion that Riley felt, and the one who guided them all in the time of desperation. All the other emotions came to her afterwards, which is why they are not as emotionally attached to Riley as Joy does. Joy knows what is the best for her, just like how we feel the best thing for our life is what makes us happy.",

Let's just make sure Pete Doctor directs every Pixar movie ever and we will be a-ok. I don't want to talk about all the good things with this movie, because let's face it: everyone has done that. Instead, I want to talk about all the things that this Pixar movie does better than all the others. First, I think this is the best voice cast for any Pixar movies prior or after this. The only one that kind of comes close for me is Toy Story 4, but that's for a different review. Biggest highlight is of course the great work of Amy Phoeler as Joy, it was just spot on. Next, comedy. Seeing how the main character is literally the concept of Joy, I would like to think that this movie was going to be funny. And I was right with this being, in my personal opinion, the funniest Pixar movie. Lewis Black as Anger is just a laughing riot to me. He was hilarious! Finally, how can you not talk about this movie without mentioning the ending, with two big emotional parts that really leave a huge impact. The first being the death of Bing Bong, which feels a little like it comes out of nowhere, but you're going to remember it. And, of course, when Riley comes home from running away and the parents also say that they miss the old home\u2026.OMG it's so good! The only kind of problem is that Anger is mainly the reason  all the islands get destroyed, and no one addresses it at any moment. But that's minor, and no one is going to be thinking that in their first viewing, I only noticed it in my most previous viewing of the movie anyway. I really think someone should do a deeper dive into this movie, cause it really deserves it. However, I can only praise it for so long. Go to Disney+ and watch this flawless film and to see the best Pixar has to offer!",

After they had another similar disagreement Joy and Sadness cause the core \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nmemories to be knocked from their containers and accidentally vacuumed along with them into Riley's emotional interior. With this problem, it leaves the other emotions Fear, Disgust and Anger to run the emotions until the others return changing RIleys behavior. \nThroughout the film it shows the many obstacles and challenges Joy and Sadness must go through to reach the headquarters.

But I have not seen it yet until two months ago that I watched it. The first time I have seen this movie to the end. I understood to many media why they rated this animated movie very high. First It is about the graphic of the animation. As we have known. Disney and Pixar are one of the best animation studios about graphic, and they have done to this movie very well, such as an appearance of a character. There are lots of details about graphic, sharpness of the video, etc. Second, sound effect. In my opinion. Sound effect are very important to every movie in the scenes that want to show, or express more the feeling to the audiences than only the movie scene. And this movie expresses the feeling to the audiences very well such as happy, sad, scared. The last thing and it is the most interesting point is about feeling. It is what this movie expresses to us. For me, this part is the point that makes this movie different to other animation movies that Disney and Pixar have made. It is more than a movie for entertaining. It  teaches us how we can control our feeling ,  however I will not tell you what feeling that I mean. I want you find it by yourself in the movie. Then after you watch it, you will understand what I have told to you.\n\nBut there is one inferior point in this movie. It is distribution of the character. Some characters are very notable, but there are few characters have a few of air time, scenes that they act.\n\nIn my opinion, 'Inside out' is still one of my best animation movie. For me, I give it 1/3 of the best Disney and Pixar movie of all time. If anyone is looking for some full of quality movie. 'Inside out' is the great choice.\n\nconcluding, very well work for Disney and Pixar making this movie. I give 9 out of 10. I hope you enjoy my review more or less. Thank you so much!",

This is comedy, but it's not all just a light-hearted ride. And it's the heavier elements of the story that make this such a fully-realized take on the base concepts here. \nRiley moves with her family half way across the country, to a place far different from her Minnesota hometown; too different, it would seem. Stellar work by the voice-over cast. Poehler is always great. Smart choice in casting Smith as Sadness. She knows her way around some sad, as she clearly showed on The Office. Kind was a great Bing Bong. Kaling was all over Disgust. And Hader was....well...Hader; which means brilliant and funny and just unbeatable. \nThe movie does tread a bit close to overly sweet at moments, but it never gets too saccharine, sentimental or dark. There's a wonderful balance between the emotions that show the very real feelings of a kid going through such changes. Overt sweetness that is typical in kids animation is sorta replaced with nostalgia; a common but strong emotion. But along with the fantastical, the eye candy visuals, the depth and cleverness of the screenplay, they always remember to bring the funny. 4 stars",

I'm glad that I was already a parent when I saw the movie & wasn't a kid going into it with a blind faith in all things Pixar as it does seem like at least portions of the storyline would be difficult to follow, but watching it in my mid-20s it's clear that this was a film created by and, really, for parents. The score was awesome & the voice acting was among the best that I've ever seen as the casting choices were absolutely impeccable. I found the pixellated aura around Joy & the others to be rather distracting but mostly because it seemed like the rest of the film was very finely animated & ended up with an internal debate over whether they were supposed to seem like they were fading away or not; also, knowing that hair is among the hardest things to animate, I found Joy's immobile hair a bit lacking in nuance. The personality islands stretched my suspension of disbelief a bit & I can imagine retrospectively them going a different direction with the screenplay in the form of the emotions conquering some sort of antagonist made up of the outburst Riley seemed destined for over the move, but I digress. The movie was still very good viewing material exactly how it was. Kudos!",
