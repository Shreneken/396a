            "content": "This is Not good. the acting is subpar being very lifeless and really lacking any chemistry with anyone. Jordan is definitely a less obnoxious human torch which is a major plus but everyone else is worse than the 05' version which is saying something. This also has no humor in it and makes things extremely boring. The cinematography is the worst part of this film, it is horrible. I'd say about 85-90% of this film is so dark you can't even make out half the shot. This is Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight's Night Scenes on Crack. When you and what you can see is really boring to look at with basic camerawork and very lifeless locations and average CGI. Nothing pops in this at all. the music is the best part, it is ok and generic and forgettable. The editing is subpar. While the first half is actually not that bad after they get their powers it feels very underdeveloped and jumpy, like its trying to hit these story marks as quick as possible to overcorrect for spending too much time on the boing stuff in the first half. This leads to not very good pacing overall as the first half is boring and the second is underwhelming and rushed. What's bizarre is this is a very short film to begin with. I hate to say it....but the 2005 one at least you could see and had some color and bad humor and that was a mess. This isn't so much a mess as its lifeless and rushed at points. I can't really recommend this to anyone. Skip It. Huge disappointment once again for the Fantastic Four.",

Seg√∫n tengo entendido, la primera hora fue sacada de los c√≥mics y est√° bien, pero se me hizo demasiado larga y extensa. El problema que veo en esta pel√≠cula es que tiene demasiado relleno y es bastante aburrida, los efectos no son muy llamativos y los personajes son poco carism√°ticos. El dise√±o de La Mole me pareci√≥ p√©simo por estar hecho con CGI y el dise√±o de Doom tampoco me convenci√≥ ya que parece un androide. No me molesto que la hicieran seria y sombr√≠a, pero algo de humor hubiera mejorado la personalidad de los personajes que se sienten algo b√°sicos. Adem√°s cambiaron demasiado el guion durante el rodaje y por m√°s que esta pel√≠cula pretend√≠a ser el primer cap√≠tulo de una saga, al menos le hubiesen puesto m√°s emoci√≥n para mejorar la situaci√≥n. Claramente de todas las pel√≠culas de Los 4 Fant√°sticos, esta es sin duda la m√°s inferior y por eso le doy un 4/10.",

I have absolutely no idea what the problem with this movie is. Sure, it's not the best, but 18%? That's REALLY low. It was certainly better than the old ones. I've heard a lot of complaints about its lack of energy. But the story was engaging enough for me to bear through that lack and it didn't really matter to me. It wasn't boring at all, in fact when I paused it to find out that I was only 20 minutes in, I was actually happy. I enjoyed the visual effects, especially on Doom and that alternate dimension.

But the script and the emotional detachment among these characters can really be felt. Other critiques include terrible costume designs especially for Reed Richards (Miles Teller), and a second act that is completely unrelated to what the movie was aiming for. What really makes this film a one star for me is the fact that this film is somehow worse than the previous film adaptions of the Fantastic Four property.",

I actually like how most of this movie is character development and people talking. In the age where giant 1 hour long CGI 3rd act battles are huge in superhero films, it's nice to have a change of pace. I had this same liking for the Loki series in that regard.\n\nDoom is very intimidating, much more so than the 2005 Doom. The action, while in short spouts, is pretty good. The CGI has some moments where it's REALLY bad, but they're short. and the rest of the CG is pretty good. Also I love Doom's design and the F4 suits. \n\nThis movie does however suffer from having a (short) final battle that is in a dark dimension that has horrible lighting so you can't see a lot of stuff. This happened in Thor: The Dark World (which is a MUCH worse movie) too. \n\nI kept waiting for this movie to get really bad, but this is just a decent superhero movie.

            "content": "I don't know if it was just me, but the whole movie felt like exposition. I kept waiting for it to get to the team bonding and ass kicking, so much so that the movie actually went by pretty fast? We finally got to the action and it was like wait, it's over? Not sure if there's a sequel, I'll probably never watch it, but here are some things I'd personally like to see explored: (1) Dr. Doom said the other dimension kept him alive, took care of him. I feel like this implies a level of sentience. Does the other dimension love him? Has it been lonely, a lifeless reflection of it's sister planet? Has Dr. Doom come to love this alternate dimension planet? (2) I need the Rock Guy to get some loving. Even in this shitty ass movie his loneliness was palpable. Seems like he's coming from a home with a lot of fighting, has gotten turned into an ugly ass rock guy because he trusted his best friend, and then turned into a killing machine by the government while they room him in some dank basement. Like damn he deserved better. I mean why did they make him stay in a windowless, prison-esque, absolutely barren room?? All while sending him out to do their dirty work in other countries. And now that I type this out it's really feeling like a direct metaphor to how the US military treats our veterans. (3) Just some good old fashioned found family bonding. Where was the banter? The friendship? The love??? Such an empty movie :((.\n\nAnyways, here are the people I'd fuck in this movie:\nMichael B. Jordan: The obvious choice. He's just so cute! And the fact that he could \"flame on\" while inside me and burn me alive at any moment would give me that kind of fear rush, but at the same time I would have complete trust in him to never do that, real sweet spot of good vulnerability. plus I think Michael B. would be a very attentive lover :)\nSue: She seems like a real stick in the mud but I've always been kind of into that with women? I had the weirdest crush my senior year of high school on this JROTC girl who (if my memory stands) always wore the same (ugly) pair of jeans, boots and crew neck sweatshirt, talked in the most matter of fact way, and literally reminded our teacher she hadn't collected the homework multiple times. So annoying you know any high schooler that does that has confidence coming out the ass. Can't deny I used to dream of sneaking away during class and kissing her in the girls bathroom with the weird ass short stalls. Erin, if you're out there, I may or may not still be in love with you.\nThe Rock/The Boulder: I just want to make him feel loved and beautiful. Not a pity fuck, but to remind him that he's human in the most primal way. I think it would be beautiful and tender and we would both cry.\nDr. Doom: But ONLY in the very first scene where he has longer hair and is all depressed and living in a dark, grungy room. He got like 75% less hot after the hair cut (in my personal and professional opinion). We would smoke weed and play our respective video games in the dark (sims 4 for me, animal crossing for him) and the sex would be good enough that I don't realize what a toxic, shitty relationship it is for at least 3 months.",

This reboot recycles most things not to say everything from the 2005 movie and adds new, lazy and boring dialogues, bad casting with terrible performance, there is no character development and in the end the movie doesn't seem to follow a next story line as there is no cliffhanger like a postcredit scene like in every other Marvel movie. On the brighter side visual effects are better that its predecessor as it was produced 10 years later, visuals do not dissapoint, CGI is acceptable. - Your friend, Requiem.",

            "content": "For all the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, no one has been able to translate the first Marvel superhero film properly to the screen.\n\nFirst there was the 1994 Roger Corman-produced film, one made simply to secure a copyright and never intended to be seen. Then, there were two films made in 2005 and 2007, Fantastic Four and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, that had some star power but ultimately didn't do well. The creators should have taken a note from the cartoon versions, as both the 1994-96 series and the 2006-07 Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes captured much of what makes these heroes so special. Unlike the Avengers, they are two things, a family and also adventure scientists, not truly superheroes.\n\nDespite the first two trailers building big excitement for the movie, it failed at the box office, earning only $120 million on a budget of $167.9 million. Why?\n\nWell, first off, no one could line up on what movie they were making.\n\nLet's start with Josh Trank, who became the youngest director to have a number one at the box office with his first movie, the superhero found footage film Chronicle. He had a fresh new take on heroes and all seemed great.\n\nRight?\n\nX-Men: First Class was another well-regarded superhero movie and the writers, Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller, started writing the script. Sounds awesome!\n\nRight?\n\nExcept that their script followed Avengers as the way and had Dr. Doom as a herald of Galactus and was very comic book-oriented, which Trank did not like. So he wrote his own script.\n\nRemember when comic book movies didn't pay attention to the source material?\n\nTrank left Slater out of discussions with Fox Studios and withheld certain studio notes. Slater added \"I never saw 95% of those notes,\" and left after six months and was replaced by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter writer Seth Grahame-Smith, with a final script written by Dark Phoenix (oh no, I have to watch that one soon, huh?) director Simon Kinberg.\n\nAnd then, some stuff went really wrong.\n\nDuring filming, producers Hutch Parker and Simon Kinberg rewrote Trank's original script and gave the film a different ending. Despite this, execs demanded reshoots, saying that this movie felt more like a sequel to Chronicle than Fantastic Four.\n\nTo compound matters, Fox ordered their own changes to the film without Trank's supervision, changing and omitting certain major plot points from his movie. Now, that's usually where movies go wrong, but there was also reports that Trank was erratic on set. I tend not to believe these things and then he posted on Twitter days before the release.\n\n\"A year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would've received great reviews. You'll probably never see it. That's reality though.\"\n\nHow did a movie with a budget like this one get so far into filming that the studio was blindsided by how dark the film was? How could a movie be that close to release and not have an ending decided on or filmed? How bad was the movie before Avatar editor Stephen E. Rivkin was hired to fix it in post with Trank referring to him as the director of the new cut? Were comic book fans so angry that Johnny Storm was black that they made death threats and Trank had to sleep with a gun under his pillow?\n\nLook, I haven't made a big budget Hollywood movie, but I have some theories.\n\nIndulge me.\n\nThe biggest problem is that we've already seen the origin of the Fantastic Four. We want to see them in action, we want to see the drama between Dr. Doom (Tony Kebbell) and Reed Richards (Miles Teller), we want to see the Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and the Thing (Jamie Bell) pick at each other, we want to see Sue Storm (Kate Mara) prove that she's the real heart of the team.\n\nThe original origin of the FF doesn't make sense today, with them needing to go into space before Russia, but that's an easy fix. And as pushed out of the spotlight as Sue was in the 1960s comics, she's not even on their first flight. Doom is. She gets called in at the last minute.\n\nIn fact, the movie is an hour and twenty minutes past when the conflict between Doom and the heroes kicks off. Until then, we see Reed, Doom and Johnny get drunk and petulant after learning that they won't be the ones going into the Negative Zone ‚Äî never referred to as such ‚Äî so they take the trip without telling anyone and chaos (and powers) ensue.\n\nNot really the stuff of heroes.\n\nYou know when a movie is bad? When Marvel kills off its actors ‚Äî except Michael B. Jordan, who redeemed himself by playing Erik Killmonger in Black Panther ‚Äî in a comic.\n\nYou can't really blame Kate Mara. She wanted to read the comics to prepare and Trank explained to the cast that it was unnecessary as the film was an original story not based directly on the comics. Well, at least she met Jamie Bell on set and they got married. She was also allegedly bullied by the director on set, which isn't as bad as getting into a fistfight with him, as Miles Teller discovered.\n\nIt's sad because this movie had every chance to succeed. I still can't fathom how a script isn't locked down on projects with this much money and so much on the line. But hey ‚Äî I just write about movies. I don't write movies.",

It should start with the fantastic four being bad ass, do brief visual flashbacks or short dialogue to explain who they are, then go back to action/plot etc and use flashbacks to show bits of how they used to be. Otherwise it is like reading fantastic four comic #1 over and over for 90 minutes. The pros of the movie are its cast are strong, they make a decent representation of a young F4, I actually liked Doom once he went full homicidal maniac it was a good costume acting job etc.  The final fight ends too simply.

The F4 we have here get their powers from their own stupidity, as well. And the final battle is five minutes long? FIVE MINUTES?! Is that all they could do after all that buildup? And is that why the movie's only 100 minutes long? I'll let you guess if that's true, but my other problems with the film are still there.

            "content": "The problem with this film is the fact that he tried to establish itself completely distinctive from the previous two films. I think that's where it fails. It's overkill at best because not only is the cast chosen against type, but it's done so in all the wrong ways possible. I'm not saying that the decision to have an interracial family regarding Sue and Johnny was wrong and not contemporary. But things really go wrong with the casting choices and characterization of both been Grimm and Victor Von Doom. It starts out solid based upon the beginning of Brian Michael Bendis's first issue of ultimate fantastic four, showing Reed and Ben in their childhood. Hell, there's even an allusion to what will become the Fantasticar in the first scene. You see these two kids who are outcasts right off the bat; Richards is the boy genius whose parents don't understand him, and Ben is the younger brother living in his family's scrapyard and picked on by his older brother Daniel. But then you cut to the high school scene and it's Billy Elliot as Ben Grimm. This guy is supposed to be Reed's protector and best friend and you don't get that vibe. The kid is athletic, but those scenes are cut and you only see his background in the trailers. Plus Ben has a very deep tragic background; his brother was killed in a gang war. It could've gone into that, the desire to get strength back and be tough because you have to be tough to survive. Ultimately these character traits almost influence his mutation later on in the film. Then of course there is Victor, whose background is again fucked up beyond any recognition at all. He is supposed to be European and yet they make him again American and this time a recluse. The foundation does not hold up after his transformation which again takes reference from a poor choice that WASNT Bendis's call which was organic armor. There is nothing wrong with Michael B Jordan's portrayal of Johnny; he only service from the bad script. The fast and furious angle works, but there is zero familiarity beyond that. Johnny is immature and the fact that he tries too hard and gets upset too easily. And he does so because he knows either his sister or his dad will bail him out of trouble. And let's not get started on the CGI thing. Put some fucking pants on him for god sake. He looks good, but the fact that you keep him naked throughout the entire film separates him even more so from humanity and that's a mistake. The reshoots are evident through the different tones of blonde for Kate Mara's hair. The comic worked because the first bad guy they go up against is the mole man who starts out as a professor. This fails because, as mentioned by a previous reviewer on YouTube, it becomes a body horror tale. It rushes the plot too quickly and the climax does not hold up. The team has no chemistry whatsoever. There is no chance to bond after the transformation, and the subplots get buried. This is a horrible misfire that could've been great if the writers and the Director were both not interfered with by the studio and had taken the time to develop it further.",

Origins still hurts me more than this one did and that‚Äôs coming from a diehard comic book fan.. I also don‚Äôt think this is as bad as some other comic book movies that have come out before. I think the cast was amazing here and it‚Äôs a shame because they really could have pulled off something great. I feel like after the origin, when there is a time jump, at that point the movie just felt forced and was a completely different tone shift than what the first half was setting up. Essentially it was a setup with no payoff... I think they did a very bad job with Dr. Doom, nothing against Toby‚Äôs performance but just in general Dr. Doom is one of the best marvel villains to ever exist and they made him look like a freaking robotic crash test dummy... I think in terms of the origin they did a rlly good job, other than the fact that Sue got her powers without even going to space smh... but I actually somewhat enjoyed the first half of the movie and enjoyed the star studded cast well enough to tolerate the second half of the film as much as I possibly could‚Äôve, given how painful it was. I feel like Josh Trank had a vision and that vision was seen before the movie had a time jump, everything before it was good for me, but I feel like after the time jump it felt like another example of forced studio interference... it was almost like Fox was saying you better keep this at a 1hr 40min runtime at all costs... this movie would‚Äôve been better off with a runtime 30-35 min longer so that these characters could have had a proper setup and execution and I truly believe if that happened we‚Äôd have a better movie and not a film that was only subpar and half well done. Now this isn‚Äôt the worst superhero movie, but it‚Äôs definitely a missed opportunity especially when it had the elements to be good. It just felt like Fox threw its own script off a cliff and rushed it. Michael B Jordan and Miles Teller are unbelievably amazing actors and I honestly wish the studio didn‚Äôt interfere and that the movie was good FOR THEM as well as the marvel comic book fanbase which I‚Äôve been a loyal member of since I was 5. Overall this movie was decent enough to keep me alright up until it became a dumpster fire after the unwanted and ridiculously forced time jump... the final battle was terrible and parts of the dialogue were super super cringe... it was just hard for me to accept how the movie shot itself in the foot and just crumpled because the first half of the movie layed a groundwork for a potentially better finished product! Thanks for interfering Fox... (2.5/5)",

            "content": "If film history of the past 25 years is any indication, there doesn't seem to be a successful way of making a Fantastic Four movie. The low-budget one from 1994 isn't worthwhile beyond being unintentionally funny, and the hokeyness level of the two Chris Evans and Jessica Alba ones makes them not much better. Try to approach it as a weird science movie with body horror elements reminiscent of David Cronenberg's classic films, and the studio will panic and ruin everything by ordering reshoots so it can be closer to a Marvel movie, then dump it into theaters while everyone watches it flop horribly. The filmmakers behind this latest entry went for that wholly different approach that, while perhaps seeming valiant and provocative in theory, falls totally flat for a Fantastic Four movie.\n\nDespite director Josh Trank's apparently obnoxious behavior during the making of it (showing up to work drunk, trashing his living space, and hiding in a tent during shooting), I actually feel a bit sorry for him. Trank, known for his great found footage sci-fi movie Chronicle, seemed to want to do a fresh spin on the F4, but just chose the wrong subject matter to focus his ideas and fell victim to the studios that ruined it. What resulted isn't a complete failure, but it also doesn't work as a finished movie or seem to be aimed at any audience in particular either.\n\nThere are no Avengers style heroics or light-hearted banter to be found, instead wallowing in a dull slog and never even getting going with a plot by the time the climax rolls around. The protagonists don't get their superpowers until the halfway point after numerous scenes of disposable dialogue and hardly any character development to be found. There're some weird sequences of the characters escaping captivity after their transformations, along with Dr. Doom's return, that all evoke the dark horror elements from The Fly and Videodrome that Trank was going for. These are the most interesting parts, along with the scenes at the otherworldly planet where they get their powers. The climax when the Fantastic Four finally come together to fight Dr. Doom and let their abilities loose lasts only about seven minutes, and feels obligatory more than anything else.\n\nWhile focusing on the mutations of the characters is more appropriate in a realistic tone than them going out and saving people like Superman, the F4 not interacting with anyone outside the science lab makes the movie feel isolated and small. The strange body mutations that happen and the scary, unknown feeling that would give one in that situation evokes Cronengerg as opposed to a fun comic book movie. With a completely different plot that had nothing to do with the Fantastic Four, these elements could have been interesting, but the context they're in largely deflates the impact.\n\nThis movie is too dark and boring for children, doesn't have enough of a story or ideas to engage adults, and is not consistently scary enough for horror fans. The visual style and special effects are effective, but none of it is in service to anything worthwhile. With four attempts now at making a Fantastic Four movie, none of them succeed despite each one being notably different from each other. With the rights now being in the hands of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we shall see if they're able to salvage the Fantastic Four in the future. Until then, stick with Cronenberg's movies for body horror and The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy for fun comic book team-up movies.",

However, this movie describing the origins of the team, which includes Mr. Fantastic (Miles Teller), Invisible Girl (Kate Mara), Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and Thing (Jamie Bell), and their plot to defeat the evil Dr. Doom (Toby Kebell) had been critically thrashed, warranting a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, after seeing this, part of me can see why, but on the other hand, on the other perspective, it's not exactly worthy of a low rating. The story splits into two segments: Reed Richards building the dimensional transporter and the four superheroes fighting Von Doom. Although the story takes itself way too seriously, most of the movie is shot in the dark, and the most of the action happens in the background, Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is competent on visual effects, the musical score by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass, and the performances by Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell. Most of the faults in the movie come from producer and co-writer Simon Kinberg, who wanted to capitalize on the success on The Avengers and X-Men and make a realistic version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's story. His obsession with dimming the lights and desaturating every scene makes a chuck of the movie unwatchable and drab. On top of everything else, Trank tweeted that he wanted to be faithful to the source material except with a body count, resulting in a drastic tug of war game between him and Marvel. Despite the messy storyline and blatant studio intervention, Fantastic Four wasn't a good movie, but I'm glad I saw it. (2 ¬Ω Black Hole Sky Portals out of 5)",

They even took Ben's mechanic abilities away.\n\nThey also dehumanize Doom, completing changing who he is, his powers, his motivations, and even his classic look: which cosplayers have shown works in real life, they just had to tweak it.\n\nI'll maintain, pre-disney, there hasn't been a good F4 movie.

They are all written and act like a bunch of whining tweens. Which they seem too old for and isn't great entertainment. There's also barely a story and Dr. Doom - the group's big nemesis is vanquished so quickly I didn't think that could possibly be it. The visual effects are decent and Michael B.

In fact, I actually quite liked it!\nchronicle is one of my favorite superhero flicks ever, the gritty style that trank did with it was so unique at the time and he doesn't stray too far from it here. From the get go it's a very serious and dark film with most of it either taking place in labs or on Planet Zero. This is where most of the criticism takes shape where people argued they didn't get their powers into an hour in but I found the development refreshing, nowadays we are so used to seeing the heroes become their counterparts so quickly we skim over some pretty good material. Seeing Reed and Ben form their friendship in the beginning was great, Sue and him occasionally flirting: hinting at their future relationship. As for Michael B. Jordon I found him to be a great Johnny Storm! Doom of course is in it but barely but when he shows up towards the end man is it awesome, you can tell there Trank was going for something different and the studio clearly didn't support his original vision. I'm sure somewhere on the cutting room floor is a really great film but for the one we got I found it be a compelling small scaled origin story.

Shoddy screenplay coupled with poor character writing makes this one of the worst movies of all time. Dr. Doom is an egotistical tyrant who views himself as beyond everyone and the film depicts the exact opposite. Michael B. Jordan does the best with what he has been given and even that is atrocious. There have been many stabs at a successful spider-man movie and it has been done with Tom Holland and the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 but apparently Hollywood has trouble with Fantastic 4. Kate Mara also does the same as Jordan but none of these arcs even makes sense as portrayed in film. Doom's motivations seem really stupid as he is trying to get back to the world where they accidentally found their powers and it is a complete backward approach for his character. Overall, really terrible can't even believe that the pitch for this film made it passed the studio executives.    ",

But I actually thought the movie was pretty decent up until the point when they get their powers. And strangely enough, this is supposed to be the turning point of an origin story. When the protagonist (or protagonists) gets their powers it is too be expected that there will be big, explosive and intense action scenes that will ultimately make the film more entertaining. But funnily enough, Fant4stic's script only with holds one action scene, but is horribly contrived by clich√É (C)s and a really bad villain. From the trailers, this fight looked like it would be a dangerous and emotional confrontation, due to the footage shown in the trailers, but it wasn't! So Fant4stic is the first, and probably only, superhero origin movie where once the heroes suit up, the picture falls into an abyss. \n\nTo be honest, I was actually fairly excited for this film because the trailers looked absolutely amazing but the one clip that got me pumped was the final big action scene that was shown in almost every single trailer and TV spot. The mini clip involves Ben Grimm (more commonly known as the Thing) dropping from an airplane and landing right on a Humvee and destroying it; it conveyed that he's an indestructible rock man and that he is totally unfazed and the clip ended with an extremely badass hero shot, which shows Ben walking towards the camera whilst he is being shot at, however all the bullets bounce off his rocky facade. I loved the design of him, the rock textures looked great and the CGi model looked like how I always envisioned his character to appear like on the big screen. I waited in anticipation throughout the entire runtime for this one action scene to come on, for it too blow everyone away and to level up with Marvel's current standards. But, this sequence wasn't included in the film. In fact, the only action sequence in the film is the boring and anticlimactic final fight which sucks every emotion out of it because these character aren't developed as superheroes because the movie skips through it all. When they get their powers the movie jumps ahead a whole year, where snippets of action segments are only merely seen on TV's, which are being watched by politicians. By the way, there is one character (played by Tim Blake Nelson) who, annoyingly, chews gum in every scene he is featured in for literally no reason, it is cringe worthily dumb. Also, we never see them fully use their powers and the movie never express interest in showing us them. The Four are never utilized as a team before the climax and we never see them use their powers together because for most of the film, between the aftermath of the accident and the climax, there are just uninteresting conversations in dark rooms. \n\nDid I mention the costume design is extremely bland and Von Doom's make up is laughable bad, Mr Freeze and the Batman suit from Batman and Robin looks masterful when compared to this. The villain is just atrocious in this movie, his arc is extremely messy and he can somehow graphically blow someone's head of. There are scenes with Victor where he is walking down a corridor and he is randomly blowing people's brains out, however, I kind of expected it as the whole movie has a seriously dark tone. And there is not really much else to say except this movie could of been brilliant but wasn't. The CGi is mostly laughable, the villain is disposable and the stakes and violence feel more nonexistent than the chemistry between these characters. I wanted a Fantastic Four movie that included unbelievable action sequences, a great plot and visuals and, from the trailers, it looked like we would get that - even director Josh Trank's vision was to make a brilliant Fantastic Four and this guy can clearly show that he is a great filmmaker. It isn't Josh's fault that this movie is bad, his version would of been great but it's disappointing that the studio cut in. Overall, and unfortunately, we are left with a disastrous movie that crumbles as it progresses, that just wants to make a seriously dark Fantastic Four feature instead of a joyous and enjoyable new superhero blockbuster, but, at best, the film has a few redeeming qualities within the first act and Michael B Jordan's performance isn't half bad but c'mon, B Jordan is one of the best actors working today. Fant4stic isn't the worst comic book movie: Hulk 2003 still holds that record.",

            "content": "This is a bad movie, but in MY opinion is better than the last Fantastic Four. I believe this is an improvement in the last one but not by much. Michael B. Jordan was an amazing Human Torch. As you know it may not be a comic book like but does that matter that much. Also, it helps to show that Johnny and Susan are not apart of the same biological family. In the old one, it was harder to get that across. As well as loving this one's Human Torch, I also love The Thing. I prefer this character to the old version since its more comic book accurate, more stronger, and his rock texture is super cool. The CGI way is the way to go. I didn't like Kate Mara who played Invisible Girl. I believe she has great acting skills and she had a great opportunity to show it in this film as she goes through Inhuman changes but she doesn't. She says, \"I refuse to see this film, it's terrible.\". Terrible is a big word for this film. But I won't lie, it's no cinematic masterpiece. Luckily for her, the special effects made up for her effortless acting. Now onto - unfortunately - this Fantastic Fours' Mr. Fantastic is very, very bad. The way he projected his words was great but everything else about him is trash. His facial expressions are bad, his special effects aren't up to standards for 2015, and the actor (Miles Teller) looks way to young for the role.\n\nIn this film they show flashbacks of Mr. Fantastic and The Thing as they build the portal for which were they got their abilities from. Miles Teller plays 16 years old him from the flashbacks, which is fine when you add some makeup or some sort of special effect usage. But they didn't make him look the same age in the present. I just didn't like the young Mr. Fantastic. The film wasn't stretched but the timeline was. This film seemed to take place over years and years. Also, there are many plot holes. Stan Lee didn't have a cameo in here. So that sucked. I believe they could of have done better with Doctor Doom abilities because he's quite overpowered. It seemed easy for him to win in seconds. I would not recommend this. I would age this 12 for gore, bad language, and violence.\n\nGrade: B",

The visual effects made the movie a lot more worse than it already was. \n\nMiles Teller was way too young because when they was in the present day he look exactly the same to when he was 15 years old (he would of been a good Peter Parker). The story they added about sue storm being adopted into a black family, was actually a very good story that wasn't in the comics. What I didn't like about Sue Storm's character is that she had to listen to music on her earphones so she was able to work, WHY!!! The Doctor Doom that we received was horrid because is costume design was terrible, his death was one of the worst things that i've seen in a movie, and he also went way over the top because he started to blow up people's head. I didn't think that Jamie Bell was bad as the thing and the CGI they used for him was better than the 2005 version of Fantastic Four.\n\nI found the subplot about Reed Richards going on the run really stupid and it also wasn't comic book accurate. So i have no idea how Josh Trank thought of that atrocious idea. Overall this film is horrible and the terrible visual effects made the film really forgettable. Do not watch it even if you are the biggest Marvel fanboy on the planet.\n\nGrade F",

The movie didn't even get Doctor Doom's real name right. In this movie his real name is Victor Domashev. His name is supposed to be Victor Von Doom, not Victor Domashev! Von Doom is Doctor Doom's last name in the comics. This was the worst live-action version of Doctor Doom, even worse than all of his other live-action incarnations. Toby Kebbell was miscast as Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom was nothing like the real Doctor Doom from the comic books. The CGI is awful. The runtime is too short. The plot makes no sense. The tone is all wrong for this movie. A Fantastic Four film should always be fun, light, bright, colorful, cheerful, and humorous, This movie was the EXACT OPPOSITE of that. Fant4stic was boring, dull, lifeless, joyless, humorless, dark, and gritty. The reshoots were painfully obvious in the editing of this film. The casting is horrible. The four lead actors were all severely miscast in their titular roles. This movie sucks on so many levels.

This really was a diabolical attempt at filmmaking, eschewing the necessary aspects required to form a blockbuster. For whatever @marvel 's failings have been with Disney restraining many of the films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to fit their PG-13 covenant, they cannot be faulted for storytelling, character development, representation of source material, and fun factor. Fantastic Four had none of this. A dismal turn, for the third time, surely @marvel has all the ammunition they need to negotiate the title back to their Marvel/Disney coalition and away from Fox. The film simply attempted to do so many good things and failed at nearly all of them, rounding up as many plot lines as possible in too short a time, whilst leaving others dangling but without the proverbial cliffhanger.

And that would be okay if the stuff before they got their powers was even remotely interesting. Instead, it's just dull. It's as if the people behind this had never paid attention to anything Fantastic Four related, because this was missing everything that made that work.\n\nOverall: I thought there was no way this would be worse than the first two Fantastic Four films.

There's just not enough to engage the viewer and a distinct lack of the kind of over the top peril that a movie such as this requires in order to work. Blame for this lies with the writers who fail to create a storyline or characters that allow the audience to care about what is happening on-screen. The lack of chemistry between the leading characters means that we have little investment or interest in what unfolds and rather than build to an exciting climax, the whole movie splutters and staggers towards a deeply unsatisfying conclusion.",

            "content": "Ripping the latest Fantastic Four reboot seems to be the sport du jour. While the news about the impending negativity this movie would spark has been circling the media for nearly a year, my inherent fandom of comics in general made this a necessary film for me to see. While not a huge fan of the previous two movies (I've never seen the bootleg from the early 90s), generally speaking, Fantastic Four is a difficult story to interestingly bring to the screen. It's very cosmic in nature, has a long history of some very strange villains and story lines, and can be kind of boring. In the 2005 initial outing, the good things included a very good origin story, representation of Ben Grimm as a pilot and a perfect Johnny Storm. However, Dr. Doom was horrible. Not representative of the comic version at all. Jessica Alba's ethnicity came across strangely as a blonde woman. And, while looking like the very early 60's Thing, the orange suit was...just bad. The second movie, centering around Silver Surfer was a much better representation of the comics, in spite of the weird Galactus. The stories overall were very weak and too goofy. When I heard they were going to reboot it, I was ok with it, for the recasting of Dr. Doom alone. Fast forward to the introduction of Josh Trank as the director. Someone who had done ONE film. Yes, it was a decent film, but given that he was handed the keys to the FF reboot AND a Star Wars film, I was confused. So...fast forward again to nearly a year ago when word came out that the movie was in trouble. Josh was acting erratic. He had destroyed the house he was staying in while shooting in Louisiana. Fox secretly told Disney that Josh would be a bad idea to keep on staff for the Star Wars movie. Then suddenly, Josh was off the Star Wars film while rumors were abound that he had abandoned the final steps in FF post-production. The studio had come in and held reshoots and was completely in control of editing. So much bad press that nearly no one was looking forward to this movie coming out. Marvel was grinning like a cheshire cat wanting to get the rights to making FF back in the House of the Mouse. Then word came that an embargo was being put on all screenings and release of critical reviews until 2 days prior to opening day, always the kiss of death to a film. Then...3 days ago, the embargo broke and the messages were loud and clear. This movie was horrendous. I still planned on seeing the movie, but after Sony destroyed anything interesting about Ghost Rider...twice...I wasn't feeling good. Expectations were in the toilet. So, this morning, as I'm making my way through the surprisingly short (one hour, forty minutes) reboot, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, even from the kids at the beginning, was very strong. The characters were coming together well. While the origin was different and the inclusion of Franklin Storm, Sr. and a mixed-race Storm clan was...well, unnecessary, it worked. I was buying it. Then they got their powers. From this point forward, it's like a completely different director and/or editor ran the film. There was essentially only ONE action scene. The end. And it lasted mere minutes. Without spoiling what led up to that one action scene, I will simply say that Doom was introduced. A very good Dr. Doom. Character and actor-wise, I very much like this flavor of Fantastic Four. And the tweaked origin introduces the potential for much more cosmic inclusion. The potential is exciting to this comic fanboy. The problem is, from the point where they go their powers, which was on a planet that required CGI and special effects, I was confused as to where the budget went. The effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. Just awful. So many story points were shortened, sped up and left to the viewers interpretation and assumption. Weird considering how well-paced the story had been until this point and how well-developed the characters had been. For the final 40 minutes, character development evaporated. The effects were horrible. There was no story. Just...scenes. Leading up to a very short and shallow action scene. Then...it just ended. A short, quick wrap-up, not to mention dumb, especially considering how strong the film had been the first hour. I simply couldn't understand why the film shifted tone and pace so quickly. As a result, I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. I believe Fox should give the rights back to Marvel or, at the very least, allow this film to have a sequel with a PROVEN director.",

It does feel refreshing not to suffer from the same juvenile MCU Disney humour recent superheroes have been afflicted with though, with once scene during Doctor Doom's battle having me expect a one-liner, which didn't come to fruition. It is however ironic one of the few comicbook characters that eschew this could have gotten away with using it. \nAs I say, I like the more real world feel of this one, although that's probably my personal taste coming into play there. Fant4stic Is not a terrible film, if nothing else it kept my attention and fairly invested in the movie. This doesn't mean it's outright a great movie though, in my opinion it is merely fairly alright.",

It's stupid, poorly written, and the actors are left hanging, but for me, it had just enough camp value to elevate it guilty pleasure status.

Like what i knew fantastic 4 and X-Men were the only 2 teams i knew when i was younger back when iron man, thor, spider man, cap, hulk etc were all doing their own sole things.  and everything else they have a problem with, and....and its not all bright like the first 2, and the naming of the team was a great ending wish it had a post or mid credit scene but i really loved it, sum it up it may not be the best marvel movie but it is far far from the worst.",

Absolutley Not! \nIt looked like it was shot in the stupidest year in the 90's, when they first released the very first Fantastic 4 film so bad I didn't watch it.\n\nOverall: There's nothing good about this movie, the worst movie of 2015 and the worst I saw since Skyline and The Other Guys in 2010, and yes I suppose that it's even worse than the 2011 to 2012 garbage I watched in theatres, It's that bad! and josh trank refused to direct the sequel because I'm so glad it got cancelled, hopefully they don't re-release it then I would be fucking pissed.\n\nI'm going to give FANT4STICK a fucking F for Frequent Failure.\n\nI hated this movie after 30 minutes, before hand I wasn't as mad I just didn't find it interesting at all, at least Reed Richards as a child told the story, Now...

            "content": "Yikes.\n \nThis is one royal mess of a film.  The problems have been well-documented since its release, with director Josh Trank blaming changes made by the studio.  However, my guess is it runs deeper than that as this one seems to be flawed on a basic story level.  Simply put, \"Fantastic Four\" is one of the least enjoyable comic book movies I've ever seen.  It's not even remotely fun, and I suspect that this was (at least party) by design.\n \nTo me, this comes off as another attempt to add a real-world dose of grit to characters in which this shouldn't be applied.  There's something that's just kind of inherently silly about the Fantastic Four, and I'm just not sure how seriously we're supposed to take a story in which one character becomes a human rubber band.  I haven't seen the previous \"Fantastic Four\" films directed by Tim Story, but from what I understand, for all their flaws, they at least understood that.  There's a goofy sense of comic book-inspired fun underlying the proceedings.\n \nWith this reboot, I'm not even entirely certain the filmmakers set out to make a comic book film at all; it has more of a dark, sci-fi vibe to it, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself.  But if you're going to participate in a bit of genre mashing, you better know what you're doing.  There's not even a perfunctory explanation as to how Reed Richards (Miles Teller), Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), Sue Storm (Kate Mara), and her brother, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) acquired their special powers.  They just briefly travel into a dank, ugly dimension and something comes out of the ground there and that's it.  And I have absolutely no idea what happens in the climax, when the four of them square off against Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbel).\n \nPlease understand, I'm not looking for real-life science accuracy here, or even pseudo-accuracy.  You might recall how I similarly wasn't quite certain as to what was going on during the climax of \"Thor: The Dark World\" either.  But in that movie, it didn't bother me because at least it was crazy and entertaining, and the rest of the movie had been fun leading up to that too.\n \nBut in \"Fantastic Four,\" there's no sense of fun whatsoever.  The four \"heroes\" barely even use their superpowers.  They don't fight bad guys, they don't save innocent civilians, and the only time they even get to work as a unit is in their final confrontation with Doom.  They spend more time under observation in a laboratory than they do out in the world doing superhero stuff.  You can try and explain this away as its an origin story and therefore they had to get expository stuff out of the way first, but I'll still call bullshit as any other origin story will still feature the hero learning to use his/her powers by stopping evildoers.  I didn't turn on a movie entitled \"Fantastic Four\" to watch four super-powered people not do fantastic things.\n \nSo we then roll back around to my earlier thought, which is that this isn't supposed to be a superhero movie.  Fine.  Maybe it's not.  But it's still poorly written, no matter what genre it's supposed to be.  There's the problems I mentioned earlier regarding the movie barely touching on some of its science.  But it goes deeper than that.  After they receive their powers, a rift develops between Richards and Grimm, with the latter holding the former responsible for what happened to them.  This rift is never resolved, and by the end of the movie, suddenly it seems like they're cool again.  What exactly happened there?\n \nRemember how, after the lukewarm reception to \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" Sony decided to essentially share the character with Marvel Studios in the hopes of bringing him back to his former glory?  I think that's something that 20th Century Fox should consider with the Fantastic Four.  One thing I'm confident of: there's no way in hell Marvel would muck up one of their properties in this way.  This \"Fantastic Four\" might as well be a DC film, in both tone and quality.  Very, very non-fantastic.",

The scenes with the actors are cold, and lifeless. Everything has a serious tone and almost feels completely robotic even when the scene seems to call for some semblance of emotion. Possibly the worst transgression made by the films creators is taking what should be one of the films bright spots, it's villain, Dr. Doom and turning him to some sort of extra-dimensional eco-terrorist with a school yard crush.

            "content": "When I first laid eyes on the trailer for the upcoming Fantastic Four movie, I remember loving it, going for a style and tone that is similar to Interstellar. From the initial trailer, it looked like the stakes would be high, and there would be finally a good Fantastic Four film, after three failures. I also remember the dreadful complaints from fanboys about the trailer and their claims that \"the movie is going to suck!\" Most of the complaints were of the casting of Michael B. Jordan, a black man, as Johnny Storm aka Human Torch, and how this is not a movie from Marvel Studios. My reaction was strong disagreement, as we should be used to characters being portrayed by actors of different color (it is not big deal) and Marvel Studios is not the only production studio capable of making a good superhero movie. I sincerely hoped, and thought that Fantastic Four would be good, proving fans wrong. Not being a fan of Fantastic Four, I hoped that the movie would be good enough that it would get me interested in superhero group and show why I should like them. I especially had confidence because it would be directed by Josh Trank, who directed Chronicle, one of my favorite films of all time for its beautiful use of \"found footage\" and an unique character driven story that instead of the usual \"where did the powers come from?\"\n\nWhy am I going into how hyped I was for this movie instead of diving right into the review? I wanted to express my great disappointment on how this movie flopped after the great deal of promise it showed. So, what made Fantastic Four the worst reviewed Marvel film of all time? What did Fantastic Four do to have the claim to fame for being worse than Howard the Duck? To summarize the main issue of this film in one statement is difficult, but it would probably be something like that the movie lacked any attachment and cared little for the characters nor the events happening in the world that its trying to establish.\n\nWhen I describe the lack of attachment and not caring a bit about development, I mean is that film presents itself as this contemporary take on a classic team of superheroes that shows the trials they go through (similar to Christopher Nolan's take in The Dark Knight trilogy), yet there is little stakes shown because all we are shown is secret labs and there is little depth in the relationships between characters. For example, when the five main characters are exposed to the radiation that gave them their powers, Reid runs away from the military base that was holding him and the other Fantastic Four members. In running away, he abandoned his friend, Ben, aka The Thing. There is little to know actual consequences for the abandonment. Ben is angry, but there is nothing the Reid does to redeem himself. At the end, he takes charge when Doom is attacking the planet, but it felt so rushed, so phony. There was no development that led Reid to summoning any kind of courage, nor to prove that he was a loyal team member. Other plot points such as the exaggeration of military that make them look like villains by weaponizing the three super-powered people who remained at the base without any questioning in the story nor consequences or the lack of interaction among the teammates left me feel detached, not really caring for anyone nor anything that is at stake in the story. Yet, with all of the detachment, the film has the nerve to act like that the characters are now a united team that overcame its problems.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of investment in development and chemistry, the film uses empty cliches to cue us when there is a supposed development. For example, in the final battle, Ben tells Reid that \"this is what I do\", referring Ben's battling enemies with his brute strength. The line was supposed to signify his acceptance of his new life and how things will never be the same. The issue is that there is no build up. \"This is what I do\" is said randomly, came off as out-of-place. A scene or two before, Ben is still upset at Reid. The film never explores the implications of his changed body and how he is forced to work for the military. Another example is the mentioned instance of Reid \"taking charge\". It's cliche, or least usually used as an effective trope, to cue the audience that the journey to leadership is complete. Films like Guardians of the Galaxy use this trope effectively as the film shows that Peter Quill does truly care for the galaxy, and that someone needs to take leadership because he witnesses his team not getting along. When Quill, aka Starlord, takes the reins, the scene holds weight. When Reid did it here, it was a worthless cliche.\n\nOther complaints that I have are the one that most reviewers addressed. The effects at times were horrendous. At times, the effects looked like they were from Spy Kids 3-D from 2004, which had effects equivalent to the Nintendo 64, a console made 19 years before the Fantastic Four reboot. Obviously the lack of action is a problem, especially when this is a superhero movie. The other complaint is there is little showing of the world around the Fantastic Four. When Doom is destroying it, I wonder why should we care. We never saw it all. We were confined to the labs the entire time.\n\nThe actors in general were fine. I believe that issues fell with the horrid writing as I just talked about, the lack of good direction. It appears that one or so takes were done, and not enough time was put into perfecting the delivery of each line. As a result, the dialogue is awkward to watch. Many complain about Toby Kebbell's portrayal as Dr. Doom, but again, I liked his voice. Cliches like Dr. Doom randomly saying he's \"doom\" are the problem. Bad writing, once again, is the main issue. The film shows no good reason why he became a villain. In my opinion, Kebbell had little to work with. One other positive aspect of the film I found is the deign for The Thing. I liked the natural look of actual rocks instead of the fake costume of the 2005 movie.\n\nI give the 2015 Fantastic Four movie a not fantastic F. Most say the film failed because it tried to be dark, but it came off as depressing, and I disagree. In a previous article, a good movie does not come from focusing on the tone, but on crafting a cohesive story. Fantastic Four obviously botched at creating any kind of story. I can see a good Fantastic Four movie being dark. I'm interested in seeing a new take, but a successful take should rely on tropes of dark movie. A successful movie should show major stakes, and the heroes taking on those stakes, with a plot that makes us care about the heroes. Like most fans, I hope Marvel Studios gets the rights back and does Fantastic Four justice. I hope I can see a great FF team along with the other great heroes of Marvel. It's a shame to see such potential wasted.",

With logic being thrown out the window in the first 30 min of the film, while it's trying to be a more \"realistic\" version of the fantastic 4, it fails miserably. Honestly the first films were better than this one. The acting is awful. The characters are unlikable one-dimensional idiots, although I do not blame the actors for this as I like them all, but the writing was so awful that I think nobody could've portrayed the characters correctly.  A villain whose motivation makes some sense, in the end he's just another villain who wants to destroy the world. This doesn't even work as a superhero movie, because they're only 2 fight scenes in this movie, one in the middle which lasts 30 seconds, and one at the end between the main characters and the main villain which lasts a minute. This movie proved to me that either A) the fantastic 4 are just shitty characters, that's why their movie sucks or B) Fox is so incompetent that they can't make a single good movie with these characters after trying three times.",

But it was sadly a huge mistake. The saddest part is that when I first saw this film in theaters 2 years ago, I kept trying to force myself to find ways to make Fantasic Four actually a good movie but upon watching it a second time a few weeks later, I came to the conclusion that this film is just completely terrible. So terrible in fact that even the stars of the film don't stand behind it anymore. I never plan to watch this movie again unless it's for the purpose of a \"Bad Movie Day\". Fantastic Four is a disappointment of a film, and I'm actually more relieved than anything that Fox was smart enough to cancel the two or three sequels they had planned. Seeing as it was solely 20th Century Fox's fault that this film became such a disaster, all I have to say is... Look what you did to such a potentially great movie Fox, you turned it into the equivalent of getting kicked in the testicles with a steel toed boot.

However it seems that the studio decided after 90 or 100 % of the way through filming, that they actually wanted to make this film to be like Avengers Assemble and nothing like Chronicle. There are lots of good Josh Trank scenes left behind, they just don't fit together anymore. The film has possibly the worst pacing of any film ever. On top of this the studio decided to literally name the Dr Doom character \"Victor Von Doom\". They also seem to have added in an unnecessary big battle with him after the film has essentially already ended- including large amounts of flying debris and a *very original* apocalypse inducing skybeam.\n\nThe saddest thing is the complete waste of the acting talent, which is incredible. Michael B. Jordan and Toby Kebbell are excellent in everything, while Miles Teller recently had an impressive breakout performance in Whiplash. Kate Mara and Jamie Bell are also very solid and this is really a group of some of the best young talent in hollywood. And while none of them are bad in this movie, none get the chance to shine. It would have been \"fantastic\" to see this cast through several sequels drawing from the beloved comic series, but due to a complete and utter studio fumble, this may now never come to pass.",

            "content": "Ripping the latest Fantastic Four reboot seems to be the sport du jour. While the news about the impending negativity this movie would spark has been circling the media for nearly a year, my inherent fandom of comics in general made this a necessary film for me to see. While not a huge fan of the previous two movies (I've never seen the bootleg from the early 90s), generally speaking, Fantastic Four is a difficult story to interestingly bring to the screen. It's very cosmic in nature, has a long history of some very strange villains and story lines, and can be kind of boring. In the 2005 initial outing, the good things included a very good origin story, representation of Ben Grimm as a pilot and a perfect Johnny Storm. However, Dr. Doom was horrible. Not representative of the comic version at all. Jessica Alba's ethnicity came across strangely as a blonde woman. And, while looking like the very early 60's Thing, the orange suit was...just bad. The second movie, centering around Silver Surfer was a much better representation of the comics, in spite of the weird Galactus. The stories overall were very weak and too goofy. When I heard they were going to reboot it, I was ok with it, for the recasting of Dr. Doom alone. Fast forward to the introduction of Josh Trank as the director. Someone who had done ONE film. Yes, it was a decent film, but given that he was handed the keys to the FF reboot AND a Star Wars film, I was confused. So...fast forward again to nearly a year ago when word came out that the movie was in trouble. Josh was acting erratic. He had destroyed the house he was staying in while shooting in Louisiana. Fox secretly told Disney that Josh would be a bad idea to keep on staff for the Star Wars movie. Then suddenly, Josh was off the Star Wars film while rumors were abound that he had abandoned the final steps in FF post-production. The studio had come in and held reshoots and was completely in control of editing. So much bad press that nearly no one was looking forward to this movie coming out. Marvel was grinning like a cheshire cat wanting to get the rights to making FF back in the House of the Mouse. Then word came that an embargo was being put on all screenings and release of critical reviews until 2 days prior to opening day, always the kiss of death to a film. Then...3 days ago, the embargo broke and the messages were loud and clear. This movie was horrendous. I still planned on seeing the movie, but after Sony destroyed anything interesting about Ghost Rider...twice...I wasn't feeling good. Expectations were in the toilet. So, this morning, as I'm making my way through the surprisingly short (one hour, forty minutes) reboot, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, even from the kids at the beginning, was very strong. The characters were coming together well. While the origin was different and the inclusion of Franklin Storm, Sr. and a mixed-race Storm clan was...well, unnecessary, it worked. I was buying it. Then they got their powers. From this point forward, it's like a completely different director and/or editor ran the film. There was essentially only ONE action scene. The end. And it lasted mere minutes. Without spoiling what led up to that one action scene, I will simply say that Doom was introduced. A very good Dr. Doom. Character and actor-wise, I very much like this flavor of Fantastic Four. And the tweaked origin introduces the potential for much more cosmic inclusion. The potential is exciting to this comic fanboy. The problem is, from the point where they go their powers, which was on a planet that required CGI and special effects, I was confused as to where the budget went. The effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. Just awful. So many story points were shortened, sped up and left to the viewers interpretation and assumption. Weird considering how well-paced the story had been until this point and how well-developed the characters had been. For the final 40 minutes, character development evaporated. The effects were horrible. There was no story. Just...scenes. Leading up to a very short and shallow action scene. Then...it just ended. A short, quick wrap-up, not to mention dumb, especially considering how strong the film had been the first hour. I simply couldn't understand why the film shifted tone and pace so quickly. As a result, I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. I believe Fox should give the rights back to Marvel or, at the very least, allow this film to have a sequel with a PROVEN director.",

Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him.\nComic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X-Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?!\nFour young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.\nThey use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said \"No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect\" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you.\nIn this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is.............\nTHEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            "content": "After watching \"Captain America: Civil War\" I went home as was in the superhero mood. So I decided I would catch up on the superhero movies so I picked \"Fantastic Four.\" And the movie lives up to the negative reception I have been reading. This review should be taken as a warning of what you might see, and you might wanna save your money if you are thinking about renting this. \n  The movie is about Reed Richards (Miles Teller) who is made a  teleporter machine when he is young. His friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) helps him along the way. Eventually, they become teenagers and enter their teleporter in a science fair where they are recognized by Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey). He invites them to work for him making a teleporter to another dimension. There they meet his son Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), Susan Storm (Kate Mara), and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). They make the machine and decide to travel to the other dimension, which is a wasteland with green goo. They get in some trouble and lose Victor Von Doom as they try to escape back to out dimension. When they come back, they find themselves in different rooms with powers.\n  The movie is worse than clich√© when it comes to superhero films. There's so much wrong here for this to even be mediocre. To me, mediocre is \"Man of Steel\" or even \"Fantastic Four\" from 2005. I didn't even really wanna write this but I felt people should know what there getting into. So I will tell you the five things that are wrong with this movie that are not so fantastic.\n1.\tThe movie is way too dark and gritty. This is usually an upgrade when it comes to the superhero genre, but here it's so overly serious it lacks all humor. The fact that Ben (The Thing) got his toughness from his brother who beats him and even gets the phrase \"It's clobbering time!\" from him is just downright depressing.  Although the small amount of humor we do get is from Johnny (The Human Torch) who is played by Michael B. Jordan. Which is the only character with the character if you get what I mean.\n2.\tThe lack of character development and chemistry is horrible. They all feel cardboard, except for Michael B. Jordan, but the real problem is the relationship between each other. Not once did Susan talk to Ben. They all were separated and only appeared together at the end. There was no real communication or emotions between them. Even when Franklin died, his son Johnny didn't even grieve. After he died that was it. As if they didn't care for him. They are the worst team I have seen in any film.\n3.\tThe villain is Victor Von Doom, who is supposed to be Fantastic Four's biggest enemy. We see him as a human who seems selfish and a jerk and when we see him as a villain in the last 30 minutes he is a joke. His costume isn't scary or believable. He looks like a walking mannequin. He just comes to the conclusion that people invaded his world and they want to destroy it, so that makes him wanna eliminate all life on earth! He is the worst villain I have seen in a movie, seriously he is that bad.\n4.\tThe special effects and action are lacking. The Thing and Planet Zero are the only convincing special effects I have seen. The rest seem very cheap. There is a scene where Mister Fantastic is punching soldiers in the forest and his arms are stretching. It looks laughably fake. \n5.\tThe action doesn't happen much. Once when the team goes into another dimension, then extremely briefly when Mister Fantastic is running in the woods, and at the end when they battle Dr. Doom. They are very brief and lack to fun thrills. As if they had to cut down on action to make this 100 minutes. The last battle happened so fast, I said to myself \"Is that it?\". Was Dr. Doom even a threat? Was there even a reason for this movie to be made?\" \n  So in conclusion, Fantastic Four is a crappy film and is a disappointment when it comes to superhero movies or any movie for that matter. It seems that this franchise is just not meant to be. Who knows. I can't blame it all on Director Josh Trank. I know on a small scale he is great like when he made \"Chronicle\". It was probably the large budget and pressure from movie executives. Either way, I suggest you stay away from this one. Almost all other superhero films are better.",

            "content": "This movie was tough to sit through to the end. The first 30 minutes are possibly the most bland, uninteresting 30 minutes of any movie ever made. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the first half hour of this movie. The reason I give this 1 1/2 stars and almost considered giving it 2 stars is that it definitely had potential. I don't think the choice to give Fantastic Four a darker tone was necessarily a bad idea. The problem was that when the movie tried to be funny it was so cringeworthy, people came away forgetting the movie did at least attempt to mix in some light-heartedness. The chemistry between the actors also hinders any attempt this movie makes in making its characters seem human. Seeing as every actor in this film is critically acclaimed in something else, I believe the blame lies with director Josh Trank. I don't think Josh Trank spends a lot of time around other people because he definitely doesn't know how they talk or how a relationship between two or more people works. It is almost eerie how inhuman these characters act throughout the movie. Anyway, although the movie sucked, there were a few good things I took away from it. The CGI was fine (which kind of worries me as the budget for this film couldn't have been extremely low). Also, and this might be my favorite thing (which is not saying much) about this film, I thought the tone from the lab exploding upon their return/new powers to them in government control (half unconscious/half terrified) was right on the mark. I'm sure people will disagree with me but if the first 30 minutes at all had you emotionally invested in the film, I believe that those dark scenes would have had a much bigger impact and I like knowing that there was at least some vision in this movie. Furthermore, although many had problems with the way Dr. Doom looked, I (not being a fan of the comic) thought he looked much better than his comic version and the scene where he is walking down those hallways bursting peoples' heads open with his mind is honestly pretty cool and you're just lying to yourself if you didn't think so too. Unfortunately, the ending of this film takes any promise this film had and completely destroys it with one of the worst endings of any film I've ever seen. It didn't make sense, it felt incredibly forced, and it was so anticlimactic. Why the fuck was Dr Doom randomly limping when they found him? Why the fuck did he want to destroy Earth when he had literally no motivation to do so? Why the fuck does this all-powerful villain get physically outmatched by fucking Reed Richards? While we're at it, who the fuck thought Reed Richards was a good character to begin with? He is in a group of superheroes who are all essentially invincible and his power is that he's stretchy. He's basically fucking Gumby and now I'm just getting angry thinking about how goddamn stupid Reed Richards is. In summation, this movie started off with the worst 30 minutes of any movie ever made, showed moments of promise and intrigue in the middle, and finished with one of the most shoehorned, anticlimactic, illogical endings in film history.",

Ma dopo la seconda parte del film √® un disastro totale. Non avevo mai assistito ad un tale suicidio in campo cinematografico. Sembra che il regista ce l'abbia messa tutta per creare il film pi√π brutto dell'anno, e c'√® andato molto vicino. Il nuovo Dottor Doom √® qualcosa di ridicolo, oserei dire imbarazzante. La storia in generale si conclude nel peggiore dei modi: tutta la preparazione iniziale finisce in un qualcosa che gli inglesi definirebbero \"cheesy\", divertente da quanto √® brutto.

Those begging for the light-hearted, tongue in cheek approach of most other Marvel movies will understandably be disappointed and perhaps rightfully claim it is disloyal to the comics. In my opinion, this serious sci-fi themed reboot works. It fleshes out the origin story and conveys a more humanistic interpretation of the superhero team. Human Torch is no longer an American jock stereotype but remains flawed with naivety while The Thing is developed from simply being the big, dumb comic relief. This 'Fantastic Four' re-imagining also shows that superhero films don't have to be overloaded with action in order to be entertaining. Albeit there is less 'fun' to be had since you do have to wait a while before their powers are used and in the end the conflict with Dr Doom does rely on contrived elements but I can't say I found any particular part dull. I recommend the rest of you ignore the masses, take a break from these standard Marvel/wannabe comedy films and give the new 'Fantastic Four' a chance.",

The characters costumes looked cheap and lazy, no iconic matching jumpsuits with the four logo on, the thing was just naked and dr doom looked like a melted candle. The film takes way too long to get going and the climatic battle with dr doom lasts literally only 5 minutes so we couldn't get a feel of doom's evilness.

Parallel story lines snake through it on multiple continents and planets.  Lord of the Rings had a lot of characters, but they seemed to going in the same direction.  By the time the Peter Jackson's version screened it had already been attempted as a movie.  Even Leonard Nimoy had done a song about it.  Warcraft is exciting and well paced.  They don't spend time on ten minute fight scenes between two characters and spend it advancing the story instead.  And there is plenty of that to cover.  A lot of these reviewers don't get it.

It know it will sound like a broken record at this point, but the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are actually pretty darn good. This movie had a fantastic cast (pun intended), and it's a shame when you see how well some of their early scenes played out. There were even a couple of lines that made me chuckle at the beginning. Oh, and while we're on the subject, I thought Toby Kebbell as Pre-Dr. Doom was great. I even had to IMDB him to figure out who the heck he was. I could imagine him as a GoT character for some reason, don't ask why.\n\nThe latter half of the movie feels very rushed, and this is where the problem lies. It could have been, at the least, on the level of those Andrew Garfield Spider-man movies had they just fleshed the character's out a little more. The last 30 minutes are so rushed, it reminded me of the pilot for another CW superhero TV series. I can't help but feel all the rumors about FOX meddling with the production are true, because you really have to stretch to make some of the scenes make sense. \n\nA couple more of my opinions on the movie. \n\n1. The scene with Doom breaking out of the facility was kick ass. \n2. Final fight was lame city. \n3. I hated The Thing's voice.\n4. They needed to give Mara and Teller better lines. Great talent wasted here. \n5. The pre-fantastic versions of Ben and Victor made me hate the fantastic versions even more. These guys are fantastic actors and I've never even heard of them. \n6. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm felt the most like his comic book counterpart for me. Wish he had more scenes.",

            "content": "This film was atrocious. I can't believe how much they dropped the ball on this one... Let me explain the positives/negatives.\n\nPositives:\n1. The scene with Reed and Ben as kids was handled okay.\n\n2. Victor von Doom killing people in the hallway looked creepy and not that bad.\n\n3. The cast is trying despite given a terrible script.\n\n4. There is potential because of Josh Trank directing, who did direct Chronicle which is my favourite found footage film.\n\nNegatives:\n1. The performances; every character sounds like they are contractually obligated everytime they speak. Nobody feels like a person the acting is very mechanical and dry. Even though the cast is good and I can tell they are trying the things they are saying just don't work and the jokes don't hit!\n\n2. The tone; this film takes itself way too seriously. The jokes (if there are any!) don't hit at all, this film is so uninspired, it makes the previous Fantastic Four movies look good, because at least you kind of laugh at how bad they are but this film takes itself too seriously. Serious tones only work for certain films like The Dark Knight, but it doesn't work here!\n\n3. The villain; what happened!? Victor von Doom is a joke in this film, not only is he weak but he has no motivation. He is just a bad guy and he looks horrible! At least in the 2005 Fantastic Four they atleast got Dr. Doom's costume right, here they attempt to translate him on the big screen but they do it completely wrong! Dr. Doom is one of the most badass villains and they took a complete dump all over him!\n\n4. The final battle is atrocious, this whole film is boring lacking any action. Now we finally get an action scene but it is terrible and forgettable. One punch and Dr. Doom is defeated. No epic showdown, nothing! Good job guys....\n\nOverall:\nThis might actually be my least favourite comic book film. Don't watch this movie, don't even watch it on Netflix like I did. Poor Josh Trank, he was treated like an animal by 20th Century Fox. I'm just waiting until Fox gives Fantastic Four back to Marvel. All of those positives I listed aren't enough to be redeeming qualities. Absolutely disappointing excuse of a film.",

Generally the special effects were good, and there were a few moments after they had gotten their powers where I found myself enjoying it. The first half was a lot better than the second half. The main problems were the horrible, stilted, dialogue, mainly during the second half of the movie, and two very bad casting choices.  Miles Teller was great in Whiplash, but really miscast in this. He simply doesn't have the weight or projected maturity to carry off the role of Reed Richards. Also, Michael B. Jordan just was not suited to his role as the Human Torch...his comedic timing was horrible. Too bad Chris Evans is now Captain America. His Human Torch in the previous Fantastic Four attempts was the best thing about those movies. Kate Mara was fine, and actually Jamie Bell was really good as Ben Grimm. Anyway, if they are going to attempt a sequel, they need to replace Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan, and find a writer who knows how to write dialog for these types of superhero movies. Anyway, if you have an afternoon without anything else to do, this is worth watching, otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way.",

Second of all i hate the characters, inviseble woman or whatever the fuck here name is cant stop complaining about here powers and constantly keeps trying to find s cure for here powers. Human torch is just \nirritating, the Thing and Mr.Fantastic are just okay nothing wrong with them. And then we have Doctor Doom, i think he doesnt realy look like him. Wel i dont want to talk about him but i ques i have to, Hid costume sucks, it takes like 1 hour and 30 minutes for him to appear on screne, I do not know what  his purpose is to destroy the world, he just does with no reason. And the story, its fucking retarded. Basically the young  Reed Richards try's to build a portal with his friend Ben Grimm (The Thing) and succeed doing so, years later they show the portal at their schools science fair and they lose the science fair beqause the teacher thinks its fake then Franklin Storm shows up (for some reason i dont what the fuck he is doing at a school science fair) and says the portal brings them to other dimension and wants to build a bigger portal or humans to go to that other dimension. They build the portal go to that other dimension Victor van Doom stays in the dimension and al of them get superpowers. O yeah and the action sucks in this movie.

Chronicle was a complete re-imagining of the superhero genre, Josh Trank and writer Max Landis created something cool, new and fresh to the genre and so I was very much hoping the rules learnt in Chronicle would be applied here.  Sadly this was not to be, whether this is down to the absence of Landis or studio meddling is debatable but the film was quite a mess.\nThe was a substantial set up before we see the Fantastic Four in action which I don't mind if it is done well but I felt the actors weren't quite right for the roles and the dialogue was very messy.  On a positive point I thought the transformation scenes would done quite well and rested more in the body horror genre than the superhero genre.  Well, this is true with the exception of Victor Doom who looked ridiculous, like a failed idea from Doctor Who :o(\nThe first half of the film was entertaining enough to keep me watching but disappointingly it was once they became the superheroes that I started to lose interest.  The film was leading up to a battle with Doom which took place for 10 mins at the end on another planet and was fairly uneventful, this made the 2nd half of the film even more disappointing and then we have the final line of the movie and the origin of the superhero teams name which was so cringey it made my skin hurt.\nTo be fair, the Fantastic Four is a difficult concept to bring to the big screen.  The Human Torch and Invisible Woman are fairly simple ideas but the Thing often comes across as looking too cartoon like and Mr Fantastic is just a live action version of Stretch Armstrong.  They need to forget trying to adapt the exact visual concepts from the comic book and reinvent The Thing and Fantastic for the big screen.

Jordan did a better job as Human Torch then i expected but this is Fantastic Four, collectivism is as important individual. Seeing the four characters in this film as Fantastic Four was just awkward.

The acting isn't too bad, the effects are nothing special but not horrible, and it does eventually get to the point.

The critics were right.\n\nYet another version of the Fantastic Four, while the early 2000s version wasn't bad, it never really caught on. Let's not talk about the 1990s version. Reed is a high school science wiz who catches the eye of a researcher who brings them in to work for them. The actors are way too old to be roughly high school/college age so that's the first knock. The actor who plays Reed Richards is also miscast as he feels more like a sidekick at best than the eventually leader. Michael B. Jordan is probably the best actor here and is barely used at all. Kate Mara lives up to her moniker as the Invisible Woman since you often forget about her as she is just sitting at computers most of the time. The Thing also just feels like a waste.\n\nIt doesn't help that they whole crew isn't brought together until about 1/3 of the way through, then they spend the next 1/3 wondering why they have super powers, then the next 1/3 battling the bad guy who just gets introduced in the last 20 minutes and they finally become a team with 5 seconds to go. It's horribly paced. It'd needed to combine the first two acts into one and make the third act longer. \n\nThere are elements of this movie that could have been good, it needed a better cast and the editing needed to be better. The villain was excellent, but he is only in the film for a few minutes. The dark tone works in spots, but I feel this franchise more than most is generally very cheery and family friendly and they went the dark and gritty which tonally didn't work like it should. A second installment might fix a lot of the issues, but I'm not sure I'd be interested in seeing it at this point barring another major reboot.",

This is an excellent FF origin story, and over all a much better film the the two previous attempts. Trank, Slater & Kinberg have created a very modern story here that brings four victims of circumstance together with a common goal, even while at odds with one another. The acting & visuals are top-notch. My only concern with the story is the mishandling of Doctor Doom. It's almost as if they used the 2005 film as the basis for Victor instead of diving into the source material. Even with that, though, there is much much worse out there (see BvS).

Perhaps there are people out there who love flavorless pie crust.  I don't.  I sat there watching and wishing there was more to this pie than just the crust.  I was waiting and waiting but.....nothing.  Right off the bat people were freaking out about Johnny Storm being black.  That was such a non-issue as Michael B. Jordan is a fine actor (go watch Creed if you haven't already).  Out of the four he did the best acting.  I really enjoyed the Fantastic Four movie in 2005.  It wasn't perfect by any means and the special effects were poor but that cast was far more likable.  I'm sure all of these young actors are good actors but their direction was terrible, especially Jamie Bell's performance of Ben Grimm.  Michael Chiklis was 100x better.

            "content": "It's highly likely that we'll never understand fully just what happened\nbehind the scenes of Fantastic Four to make it the film it is today.\n\nIt's a film that even the most pessimistic of comic book haters,\npopcorn disliking, nerd despising, anti-movie fiends couldn't have\npredicted the amount of hate thrown its way and the ill will that Josh\nTrank's second feature film received upon release.\n\nBox Office receipts were dire, critics tore shreds of a film they\nlabelled \"boring\" or \"to dark\" and many including audiences were\nbemused at how this supposed comic book film floated by for near on an\nhour of running time to then descend into a chaotic final act of\natrocious CGI and one of modern movie history's most poorly constructed\nand underdeveloped villains.\n\nThe mystery surrounding Fantastic Four's failure flows from studio\ninterference, including the studio butchering a rushed re-edit of the\nfilm before release, director Josh Trank's bizarre on set behaviours\nand mismanagement of actors and all manner of script writers for hire\ncoming in and having a go at trying to make something of Trank's\nclearly going for bleak re-telling of an already previously mismanaged\nfranchise (Silver Surfer anyone?). Considering all the hatred and\nlacklustre talk surrounding this film, upon reflection on home release,\nFantastic Four isn't actually \"that\" bad.\n\nIt's certainly not a good film, actually it's very far from it but in\n2015 there were a lot of seriously bad movies and at least for lack of\na better word, Fantastic Four tried. It's not the usual action set\npiece after action set piece comic book film we've grown to know and\nlove and then grow tired of and Trank and his team clearly had some\ndecent ideas.\n\nBursting onto the scene with his found footage Sci-Fi Chronicle, the\nonce bright career of Trank seems destined to be clouded in controversy\nafter his efforts here but there are moments of genuine cinematic\nquality. The way in which our fantastic team of unsuspecting super\npowered humans discover their abilities is effective and the casting\nseems mainly on point.\n\nWe all know the talents of Whiplash's Miles Teller, Fruitvale Station's\nand Creed's Michael B. Jordan and the likes of Jamie Bell, Kate Mara\nand Toby Kebbell are no slouches but whoever in the end edited,\nconstructed and wrote this film killed Fantastic Four's chances to fly\nwith some of the most poorly designed editing, character development\nand plot advancements in recent memory and not once do we feel any real\nconnection with these people or believe that they share any form of\nchemistry whatsoever and the films aforementioned final act is\nbewilderingly bad, the only excuse it would have would be the studio's\nso called interference.\n\nIt's somewhat of a shame we will never get to know just what ruined\nthis glum and often more dramatically natured Fantastic Four outing\nthat at the end of the day has nothing even remotely memorable about it\nother than the fact it's so downright lacking in energy,\nhumour/lightness and a seemingly lack of effort.\n\nThe cast was there and no doubt willing but due to a raft of seemingly\npowerful situations this film ended up being a real non-event,\ncertainly not as unwatchable in its terribleness that many would've had\nus believe, but certainly a messy, sporadically entertaining attempt at\nfinally making the Fantastic Four a viable big screen staple.\n\n2 gum chewing head honchos out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

The flow feels dull and boring, and takes too long to get into exciting action. It doesn't really need another reimagined origin story, and should have focused more on the dynamic between the characters. Very underwhelming action scenes, with weak CGI. What a waste of Doom, this is the 2nd time FOX can't get the famous supervillain correctly, this time turning him into a lame weird looking alien instead of the ruthless dictator genius he should have been. Such a waste of talents too, considering the actors are rising star with proven acting chops. Many of the plot developments do not get proper conclusion, making this feels like a giant intro/teaser for a sequel that might or might never happen.",

This segment isn't necessarily horrendously written or poorly acted, it's just unnecessarily long and covers ground that could probably be covered in 10-15 minutes of a more efficient and interesting movie. \n\nAnd then...the movie goes off the rails in a major way. After trudging through the intro, the film hits the gas pedal for what ends up being an equal amount of time of sloppy storytelling, cliche action, and laughable dialogue. With the film's villain not really showing up until the final 20ish minutes one can only wonder at the thought process that led to this final piece of work. Or maybe there wasn't any thought at all.

            "content": "Absolutely Abysmal.\n\nThere are few redeeming qualities in a film like this. Everything from the altered plot line, the characterization, and the lack of any emotional quality, makes this possibly the worst Marvel (and cinematic) entry of 2015.\n\nI for one, am really tired of writers trying to modernize or change classic comic stories, to better suit the audience. They assume that we want something updated, with lots of CGI, and twists and turns along the way. Simpler is always better. The original stories are classic, and beautiful to begin with. The genius struggle of Richard trying to prevent humanity from destroying itself, and from outside threats. The depth of love Susan has for him and the family they build together. Ben's emotional state when he knows there is no going back to his original body, and of course the positvity that the Human Torch carries for the team even in the heat of battle. They were full of struggle and strife, sacrifice and obsession, and a willingness to do good. This movie brings none of those feelings to the screen. The plot is so terribly altered from the original that it makes no effort to connect to it's origin. Everything falls flat.\n\nThe actors are so young by comparison to the characters in the comic, that I felt no real empathy towards them. Reed was a genius at birth, but no scene in this film brings about any depth of his intelligence. He's foolish, unintelligent, over-dramatic, and has very little ability to emote (considering Miles Teller's performance in Whiplash). The other characters (2 of which are just CGI monsters) are fairly one dimensional, and lack any real feeling of unity between them as a team. How they managed to do this with one of pop-culture's super families is beyond me.\n\nTruth is, this is what happens when you have poor writing, poor direction, poor editing, poor acting, and a large budget with producers with eyes like dollar signs. Fox ruined this one from the get go.\n\nIf you're a fan of the comics (or of movies in general), then avoid this movie like the plague.\n\n1/5",

Miles Teller, normally full of sass and energy, is just reduced to a soft spoken teenager (...right) who gets somehow disqualified for his science experiment to work at the Baxter organization.   There he meets the equally dull Kate Mara who really is just  as soft spoken and wearing some odd wig half the time.  I could go on and on and spoil the movie, and really I don't mind since nothing happens.  But nothing makes really any sense.  Why would Doom come back?  What does he gain really to come back and ... destroy Earth?  What if the humans never went back?  Why did Reed run away?  I mean the star is really for just a shame of how interesting this movie could have been.

            "content": "Many people if I only managed to keep a hold of comic book collection I had as a kid I would not have to worry about retirement benefits now, or ever. I turned eight years of age just as Marvel Comics began releasing their flagship series 'The Fantastic Four'. That was my introduction to the set of superheroes and villains that would ultimately become The Marvel Cinematic Universe. There's always been a rivalry between Marvel comics and DC comics and as far as movie rights go Marvel is definitely in the lead. They steadily produce films that are not only critically acclaimed but are embraced by the fan base. They routinely can earn in excess of $1 billion. Unfortunately, the latest Fantastic Four film is not in that much lauded group. Marvel fell upon hard times years ago and had to sell the rights to some of the most successful characters. Among them were Spiderman and the Fantastic Four. This latest attempt to bring the Fantastic Four to the screen is universally seen as a dismal failure and is much as I regret it by favorite comic as a kid has yet another flop movie. Like many novel properties to a successful animated series produced for television primarily targeted at younger children. This quartet of the most iconic heroes in the Marvel Pantheon appears to have a curse upon it as soon as it goes into production is a movie. As a fan I have suffered through numerous attempts ranging from the monumental fail represented by the 1974 Roger Corman attempt. For those interested copies are out there; I have one and after watching this 2015 version of he wants to just to see the only rendition worse than it. The 2005 movie released by Sony now actually is beginning to look good.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of a comic book movie to a dedicated fan is continuity with the comic book itself. Although the MCU included many tweaks they fundamentally remain true to the source material. This 2015 movie completely rewrote the story and included a number of rather puzzling changes. As every charter member of the Merry Marvel Marching Society knows the Fantastic Four receive their powers and it took a spaceship beyond the Earth's atmosphere. After getting hit by radiation they crashed and realized they were each changed. Reed Richards gain the ability to stretch his body to now take on elastic composition. Susan Storm could turn invisible and later create invisible force fields at will. Her brother Johnny became the human torch to sustain his body in the living flame. And Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm, was turned into a creature with super strength that appeared to be made out of orange rocks. Although the basic changes were retained here that is just about the only thing that survive between the comic to this movie.\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is first seen as a young boy already a genius. While other kids are making baking soda volcanoes for the great school science fair Reed is already working on a transport device. He crosses paths with Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, who has an innate mastery of anything mechanical and to spend every waking moment perfecting the device. Finally, and another science fair the pair catch the eye of the renowned scientist, Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), and his adopted daughter Susan (Kate Mara). Bracken also has a biological son, a rather wild child, Johnny Karen with a penchant for illegal street racing. Many saw the decision of making Franklin and Johnny African-American as a contrived not to political correctness. Dr. Storm happens to be the director of a he Baxter Foundation, a government-funded research and development Institute. Reed is often intermediate appointment and put to work on the most difficult project, a quantum gate. When this works be a portal to a planet in another dimension. The work had previously been done by Dr. Storm's previous most brilliant student, Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). His family should've changed the surname generations ago. Together Reed and Victor manage to get the device working just as the ready to do an unauthorized test Reed brings Ben in for the initial trip. They talk Susan into working the controls as the three young men, dimensions to Planet Zero. There they discover the strange green substance with energetic yet volatile properties. Given notice of every strange substance is always green? They rush to get back to the transport pod but Victor is trapped in the substance and has to be left behind. Just as a return everything explodes enveloping, Reed, Ben and Susan in a strange radiation.\n\nAt this point most diehard fans of The Fantastic Four or close to reverting to a catatonic state with their loved ones urging, it's going to be a right to stop watching.\" Having been getting a review copy I felt obligated to continue on reluctantly, I did. The each at the powers is supposed to Reed escape from the facility runs off the grid. The remaining three men to control their powers with Johnny making the most of being a human flamethrower and Susan able to fly around in an invisible force field bubble. Ben receives the fate that is similar in all incarnations of the story turning into the Rocky orange creature. He understandably has some anger management issues which may have been exacerbated by the fact that he appears to be a eunuch. Most times the Thing gets to wear a set of trunks but in this film he stomps around au natural, yet another point of contention for within watching this film. The military steps in and recognizes Ben as a weapon of precision destruction. They are just about to do the same with Johnny and eventually Susan. She uses her innate ability for pattern recognition and locates Richards. When he returned to planet zero they find that Victor has had his environment suit merged with his body and he now has the ability to control energy and matter.\n\nOne of the things that bother comic books back from the movies was that the special effects necessary to do justice to the characters had yet to be invented. Finally special-effects has reached the point where Spiderman threads no longer look like silly string and Reed's elastic limbs can retain a realistic look. In many public statements the director, Josh Trank, an original version that he is certain would've gone it rave reviews. Unfortunately the screenplay that was used was written by Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg. The latter had been heavily involved in writing most of the X-Men franchise while the former is only one previous script, 'The Lazarus Effect', a sci-fi thriller that was lackadaisical he received. The director, Mr. Trank has one previous film to his name, 'Chronicle', about teenagers that gain superpowers in a rather done, taut thriller, 'The Kill Point', Featuring Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo. That is out on DVD and is definitely worthwhile purchasing. I have no doubt that this was an honest attempt by all involved create reimagining one of the most classic stories and comic books. It represents an attempt to use recent discoveries in quantum physics and to completely reconfigure the interpersonal dynamics. Johnny seems to resent Susan at the adopted kid becomes daddy's favorite resulting in him acting out. Reed is the prototypical socially inept genius nerd that Susan eventually turns to basically on the rebound from the self-centered and abrasive personality of Victor. All this romantic triangle is present in many incarnations of the story just isn't utilized as well as it could be here. In the third act the special-effects crew takes over the story completely. This is a major departure from what fans of comic book movies have come to expect thanks in large part to the overwhelming success of the MCU. People now expect a fully developed story complete with well integrated character development. We have moved far beyond the point where special-effects in the expected to draw the movie. It should add nuance story not its motivation. Hopefully the rights will revert back to Marvel and finally see it done correctly.",

I followed this movie last year from inception to cast and crew choices all the way up to release and...I really wanted this to succeed and prove the naysayers wrong. I wanted to point my finger into the collective chest of everyone who said this wouldn't work and would fail. Well, I sit a broken man feeling like I've been a part of some great rebuke by FOX studios. Fantastic Four is just a cash grab. A last ditch effort to keep competitor Marvel studios away from the first family of comics. With this I hope they relent and let Marvel have at least this bit of their toys back.\n  The story of Fantastic Four is a drawn out, science based look at the origins of the teams story. Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) master interdimentional travel by their senior year of high school and are recruited by Dr. Storm and his daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and they bring Reed and Ben to the Baxter building so Reed can get his further education and bring this design and dream to fruition. Reed also meets the antisocial personality disorder rebel Victor von Doom (Tobey Kebbel) as well as Sue's brother and master craftsman JaltetaStorm ( Michael B. Jordon).\n  Upon finishing the project and finding out the asshole government is taking it away Reed, Ben, Johnny, and Victor get trashed and decide to go to earth zero as its been labeled. Things obviously go horribly wrong over there and everyone except Victor makes it back to earth with some slight genetic alterations. What follows is the team learning their powers to be possibly used by the government, Reed runs away leaving everyone behind for awhile. Until they return to the other planet and bring back Doom who looks a little rough but instantly (in the last 25 mins that he needs to destroy the earth so \"his world\" can prevail. \n  The story is has a schizophrenic pace to say the least. It starts out slow introducing everyone and the time travel mcguffin, immediately picks up to get us to the other planet and give everyone their powers and set up the team is in turmoil arc (that's 50 mins into a 99 min movie. Then trot along to show powers, find Doom and instantly nose dive into the third act like a falling plane. \n  My positives are that the Thing Ben Grimm himself looks phenomenal, that's ho CG should work and Dooms look and power of exploding people's heads through thought is just awesome. I just wish Kate Mara's obvious wig didn't stick out like a red head at a blonde convention, it's lazy and I haven't seen a wig job that bad since Samurai Cop. \n  I am deeply let down by this film but from all the backstage antics, politics, and hearsay it seemed like a project doomed to fail before release and I can see why. \n  Is Fantastic Four the worst superhero movie ever..!? No, not by a long shot unless we forget Elektra, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Captain America (1990) Superman 3 and 4 among others. This movie is nowhere near the top tier of movies and falls short of the middle tier, but it's just above the bottom tier to offer a slight \"you need to at least watch it\" recommendation. I won't buy it or watch it again that's for sure but I'm glad I saw the movie dubbed.\"Trank-gate\" and made it out in one piece.\nJosh Thanks Fantastic Four gets a somber 2.3 out of 5.",

I did my best to go in with a clean slate, sure the last 2 movies weren't good but they were at least interesting and the cast tried. This was a train wreck from the very beginning. whether that means before the movie even started with casting or taking it from the opening credits.\n\nIt's understandable trying to go for a different feeling than the basic super hero movie since the First Family is not like any other super hero team in that they aren't exactly super heroes, they are scientists and adventurers. But this movie just made them look like whinny little jack offs, the worst of them all was by far Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm who comes off as a bi polar idiot with daddy issues. One moment he is fighting authority by street racing, then he is joining the military and being \"all he can be\" with a touch of daddy didn't love me.\n\nThe effects are bad at best, stupid at worst, they little have Ben Grimm get pummeled with flying rocks just because they like to do that \"And that's why he is a rock man!\" thing.\n\nI want to keep spouting why this is garbage but I can't get it all, so avoid this garbage and watch a better Fox movie like X-men Origins: Wolverine.

It's hard to strip charisma from one of the most charismatic young actors working right now Miles Teller who just seems like a generic actor with the weight loss for the role and the limited range offered from the screenplay. Michael B. Jordan also is stripped of all charisma he has, Jamie Bell is just a block of wood, and Kate Mara just seemed like an after thought when it came to the writing. Toby Kebbell played one of the most menacing villains of 2014 with his stand out performance in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and does a total 180 playing the least menacing villain in the past few years with 0 character motivation and ugly costume designs. Tim Blake Nelson and Reg E. Cathey do the best they can as talented character actors attempting to overcome the thoughtless script. I just don't understand how someone as talented as Josh Trank that made an amazing movie called Chronicle in 2012 with Jordan can make such a lifeless movie like this. The visual effects are awful especially for Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell, the score is just outrageous and seemed like it was recycled from other terrible action movies, and the cinematography does not help making every image as boring as the writing. This movie just feels like a 2 hour series premiere to a TV show for Fantastic Four but even a pilot of a TV show would actually give some decent tries at not writing lazy dialogue and not doing an 11 year time jump that comes out of no where and resorts to just rushed plot to get to the climax of this movie that also has 0 motivation. This movie makes the 2005 Fantastic Four seem like a romp (which it most certainly is not minus Chris Evans who you might as well have given an Oscar to compared to Jordan's performance). BORING",

I totally got fed up with the technical jargon, which took up the first hour of the film and the movie seemed to jump from when they got there powers to them being used as weapons by the US government, so you don't see them exploring with there newly found powers. The \"Thing\" looked like a total mess and Doom just looked like a man in a suit with green eyes. The chemistry between the characters was also pretty bad, until they come together at the end and you don't really get to see any detail, because of its dark look. The storyline lacked wit and I got fed up with the stupid teleporting machine, which took up most of the movies concept. I'm glad that I got that off of my chest! Anyway, best friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have been working on a prototype teleporter since childhood and during a demonstration, they get the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), whose the director of the Bacteria Foundation, a government sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed gets invited to join Storms squad, which includes his adopted daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and his son Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to complete a Quantum Gate, which was originally designed by the wayward Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Victor eventually joins the team, especially when he hears that Sue is on board and after a successful experiment, the facilities supervisor Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a parallel dimension called Planet Zero. As Reed, Sue, Johnny and Victor came up with the initial idea for the machine, they decide to make the first journey to Planet Zero but Sue decides to stay behind to guide them. Reed recruits his best friend, Ben to join them on the journey and when they reach Planet Zero, they see some weird green lava, which Victor attempts to touch and causes it to erupt. Whilst running for there life's from the green lava, Victor is left behind because of the collapsing landscape and the others are brought back to earth by Sue, who overrides the controls. They then realise that they have super human powers, due to the explosion that happened in there ship while they were trying to escape from the lava and they are placed in government custody for further testing. Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate force fields of energy, Johnny can fly and turn into fire and Ben is a giant rock type figure who has amazing strength. Reed escapes from the facility and tries to find a cure for his friends while Johnny Storm is being used as a weapon for the government. After being in hiding for a year, Sue tracks down Reed and Ben is sent to bring him back to the facility. Now, with there new enhanced suits, they head back to Planet Zero to try and find a cure for there powers and they find Victor who has all of there powers along with telekinetic abilities, so they bring him back to facility, only to find out that he wants to destroy earth so he can rebuild Planet Zero in his image. Victor uses his powers to kill scientists and soldiers, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm and he returns to Planet Zero with the four scientists in pursuit. Now under the name of Doom, Victor activates a portal that begins to consume the landscape of earth. He is then confronted by the four and after getting beaten down by Doom, they join forces and Ben punches Doom into the portals energy beam while Johnny closes the portal. When they return to earth, they are awarded for there heroics, with a huge operational base and they decide to call themselves the Fantastic Four. Sounds good on paper but it was complete rubbish. I must admit, the first franchise was a bit childish, with some unrealistic concepts but it was much better than this. At least they had some decent actors! With all of these studios rebooting there comic book franchises, after the success of the darker Batman, I'm not surprised that they wanted to reboot the Fantastic Four but they made a right shambles of it. Due to hype, it made a decent profit at the box office which proves that a movie doesn't have to be good to make money. Anyway, they really need to go back to the drawing board with this one because the whole thing was a right mess. Awful!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Josh Trank, 31, who brought you Chronicle in 2012. For his second project, I think he took on a franchise that really needed someone with some more experience and he over complicated the storyline when he really didn't have to. Everyone is familiar with the history of the Fantastic Four so he didn't have to come up with a technical reason for there powers. If he does come out with a sequel, he really needs to concentrate on the characters more that the technical references, which are really not that interesting.\n\nBudget: $120million\nWorldwide Gross: $168million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Reg E. Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson. 2/10",

Having never been into comics, least of all Fantastic Four, I had no preconceived notions or expectations of the 2004 movie with the same title other than knowledge of it's cheesy premise- but things like that had been grandly overcome before by great writers, directors and actors.  Remember, before Tim Burton did the epic original Batman film, most people associated Batman with... well, Robin and the goofball 1960's Adam West television show.  But then I saw the previews for 2004's Fantastic Four.  And I knew exactly what to expect- a horrible attempt to cash in easy on the rise of comic-based movies and a Taco Bell cross-promo.  Inexplicably, I watched it at some point in the next few years and confirmed my hypothesis.  Years went by, the superhero films got better and smarter and sharper and even ventured into \"all-time greatest films\" territory with a few poor exceptions (cough..Superman, Green Lantern... Green Hornet.. stupid Spiderman reboot).  Right when this genre was becoming almost unbreakable, the most baffling preview: an unwelcome reboot of a dismal movie nobody asked for, f*cking Fantastic Four... Perhaps even more baffling is that I knew exactly what to expect from every inch of the reel this time and AGAIN found myself watching a terrible movie called Fantastic Four all the way through.  Even Taco Bell should be ashamed for banging this promo prostitute again.  I have nothing else to say about Fantastic Four.  Ever.",

            "content": "\"Where'd the rocks come from? From the same place the car went to. Where is that? I don't know yet.\"\n\nDuring my youth I spent many hours next door with the neighbor boy. Not just for having fun or horsing around, but also because in their veranda there was a disused closet with sliding doors where you could always find some old comics lying around. I suppose these were from the older brother who was a real comic fan. Many hours I spent sitting in front of that closet, reading them all. Comics like \"Archie the man of steel\", DC comics and of course Marvel. My favorite was \"The Fantastic Four\". This series I found extremely fascinating and that because it was a collective, consisting of several superheroes with different super powers. They formed a close-knit family and their identity was known to the population so these heroes had a rather family character. Actually, they were a little bit the forerunners of \"The Avengers\" and the figure of \"The Hulk\" resembled that of Ben.\n\nUnfortunately, this film is labeled as an unnecessary and worthless reboot. I partially agree with that. The only thing is that I can't judge whether this is an unnecessary reboot or not. I've never seen the previous films made in 1994 and 2005. Saying this is a failure or total disaster though, is something I don't fully agree with. A big part of the film I enjoyed watching and personally I thought it was interesting enough. The introduction of the various members of the unprecedented four was extremely captivating. The beginning showed a young Reed Richards (Judge Owen). A genius who seemed to come from Mars, according to some of his classmates, and who's building a futuristic machine in the garage. A missing component he finds on a junkyard where he bumps into young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann). The experiment proves to be a success and things can be materialized to an unknown destination and brought back again. Years later Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) attend a science fair, where they attract the attention of Dr. Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara). And before they know it, they are in a sophisticated lab rebuilding their invention on a large scale.\n\nThis introduction was the most successful part for me. It felt like an adventure film in which a boy pursues the realization of a dream. In an amateurish and childish way, the prototype of something big is made out of junk (a bit like in \"Project Almanac\"). Also the introduction to the various members who become part of \"The Fantastic Four\" in the Baxter Foundation, made this film different of other superhero movies. Mostly this part is kept short so they can move on to the action part immediately. The moment things start going wrong with the four noticing something happened to their bodies after they've jumped to the other dimension (while being drunk), it's still interesting enough. You witness how each of them discover their new capacities. But when the action-packed part of the film starts, it's no longer fantastic. It turns into an uninspired, quickly made up heroes-movie. As if they suddenly realized that stuff should be in it too. The visuals of the other dimension are still enjoyable, but the final stage feels rather flat and not very original. And certainly because nowadays as a moviegoer, you're buried under tons of superhero-movies.\n\nUltimately, this film emphasizes the formation of and relationships between the members of \"The Fantastic Four\". The superhero action that you ultimately expect, is fairly limited. A film that takes 90 minutes, with only a demonstration of superpowers and a final clash of fifteen minutes, can hardly be seen as a superhero movie. Perhaps this change was welcome anyway, after all the Marvel releases in recent years. The fatigue comes into play when it's about this genre. Perhaps the final part of the movie wasn't so great, but it wasn't painfully bad either. And now I'll just wait for \"Deadpool\" ....\n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",

            "content": "Fantastic 4: The New Face of Bandwagon Criticism\n\n9% on Rotten Tomatoes is SO WRONG.  (Ps mild spoilers ahead)\n\nYes, this film is clearly butchered and it's a real shame because it has so much going for it. I kept watching thinking to myself, \"so when exactly does this turn terrible?\"-- and it isn't until they go back to the Negative Zone with Doom (I mean, Planet Zero) that the movie really starts to show where it has been cut up like a Beverly Hills Housewife.\n\nFor someone who knows little about about the Fantastic Four comics, I think this movie is largely dare I say it... GOOD! For what it is, that is, which is a visibly tortured script without a second or third act fleshed out, and a villain that had hardly any screen time. Sad.\n\nIt's got a pretty great first act but it just builds to such a rushed ending that it makes the film feel more like an extended series episode than a movie.\n\nPeople are upset with how Dr. Doom was handled, but I thought the design of him looks pretty cool, and all his lines as Doom seem in line with his character. Although they go with the Ultimate Universe where he has powers, and I know that people are dying to see Doom portrayed instead as an evil Batman type approach, you can't deny his level of power is still pretty impressive- and good for the studio for at least allowing him to be portrayed with a Dr. Manhattan level of power. The willingness to show multitudes of head explosions that Marvel hasn't dared let be seen quite before lest it become a film for anyone but kids, is a good move towards having a more varied kind of genre film that caters to the gritty side of the super powered movie.\n\n37 minutes cut out of Fantastic Four. I don't know what the true backstory is for what happened upon the making of this, but clearly there suffered huge problems in how to handle it, and this is an issue that happens far too often.\n\nThat could be 1/4 of the movie taken out which could have filled in the pacing and layout of the story and its characters and their relationships to each other. Could it have really been that superfluous to edit out of the final cut? And will we ever get to see that footage? Who knows. I am certainly aching to though.\n\nThe acting is well done, the dialogue and emotions are realistic, the seeds of the relationships are somewhat present, it is cinematically shot, the special effects are up to snuff, and what actual footage is there is well edited- so is a too rushed ending, a lack of Victor's background information and some artistic liberties in appearances really worth such a ridiculously low score?\n\nThe online mockery of this movie is unfounded and simply untrue- it is certainly not the worst comic book movie ever made. I would give it at least a 50%, at least. I thought it was pretty intense at times, and entertaining as a whole- that all counts for a lot more than 9% in my book. It was just disappointing to be searching for its flaws the entire time and then seeing where it goes wrong. I really do wish the additional footage will be released when it comes out on DVD. I am quite curious to see what was excluded, and how it would affect the quality of the theatrical cut. I would give it a 6.5/10\n\nRead this review & more at www.1931Productions.com",

Even as they did so, we were all shouting at the screen that the parts they just brushed over might have made an interesting movie. But no.\n\nInstead, they drag out the non-super backstory, hurry the middle, then skip to a decidedly NON-climactic climactic conclusion. The only saving grace here is that the special effects are pretty good.\n\nBeyond that, it's a dull story, boring acting, bleak setting, confused plot, and a general waste of time. I can't find much to say about this movie to recommend it. I guess if you're not too picky on movies?\n\nFamily friendly notes: lots of action and angst. A few scary moments. The middle gets a bit \"PG-13\" with people getting kind of exploded and burned. Not sure why they went so grisly right out of nowhere, but considering how down-tempo and dark the movie was, it was only a matter of time. Language throughout and a rude gesture.

            "content": "Occasionally a director comes a long and throws the rule book out of the window, refusing to compromise and making a film purely on his own terms. When it works we are treated to such gems as Pulp Fiction.  When it doesn't work we end up with films like Fantastic Four.\n\nThe thing to bear in mind with directors who refuse to compromise is that the reason they do things their own way is that they have to, in order to get the film made that they want to make.\n\nJosh Trank (Cockney Rhyming slang) however appears to have taken the decision to throw the Fantastic Four rule book out of the window for absolutely no discernible reason other than self-promotion.  Firstly he decided that the blonde haired blue eyed all American Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) would now be African American.  Now, if this decision is necessary to tell the story Trank wants to tell, then that's fine, but it isn't.  There is no need within the narrative of the story for Johnny Storm to have changed race, and it is made even more confusing by the fact that his sister, Sue Storm (The Invisible Girl) remains a blonde Caucasian (well I say blonde, she actually has magic hair which changes colour, but we'll come to that later).  You wouldn't re-boot Shaft and cast a Caucasian actor in the title role, so why do the opposite when it serves no purpose?\n\nSecondly, still on the subject of meaningless changes of colour, we shall mentioned The Thing.  The Thing is orange, he has always been orange, but in this film he is grey.  A rather dull and boring grey that serves perfectly a metaphor for the film itself.  Again, as with Johnny Storm, there is no explanation for this change in colour, nor is the different colour necessary to serve any narrative purpose.  \n\nThrowing the rule book out of the window is fine of course if you are Tarantino, but Trank delivered to 20th Century Fox a two hour and forty minute film.  You have to wonder how bad this film was as Fox decide to do two things.  Firstly they cut the running time down to one hour forty minutes, losing an entire hour. Secondly they replaced a lot of what was left of Trank's footage and decided to order re-shoots without the director's knowledge, permission, or input.  The one hour and forty minutes that Fox released is a dull pointless and uninteresting mess that serve only to fulfill one purpose,  to teach generations of future film makers exactly how not to go about the process of making films.  \n\nThe first fifty minutes is dedicated to giving us the new origin story.  Now in a two hour and forty minute film devoting the first fifty minutes to the origin story would make sense, but when the running time is reduced to one hour and forty minutes, the origin story now takes up 50% of the entire film, leaving little left for storytelling.\n\nAlso, by taking out an entire hour of running time Fox leave no time for either action or superheroing.  It has been reported that Fox cut three action scenes from the original edit.  Quite why you would do this when you are attempting to make a super hero action film is strange, and particularly frustrating as the final result is that, apart for the climatic final scene, there are no other action scenes in the film.  \n\nThe other major problem with the film is the cast:-\n\nMiles Teller (Reed Richards) appears to be the only person in the film who actually seems able to act. This problem is compounded by the fact that once we come to the end of the fifty minute regeneration story Reed disappears for half of the rest of the film, only coming back in the last 25 minutes climax.\n\nMichael B Jorden (Johnny Storm) Trank describes the character of Johnny Storm as \"smart, hilarious and charismatic\" which is strange as Michael B Jorden skill fully manages to portray absolutely none of these qualities.  \n\nKate Mara (Sue Storm)  The blame for this one has to land squarely in the lap of Fox.  Trank wanted to cast someone else, but Fox insisted that Kate Mara play Sue Storm.  Mara commented that she wanted to make Sue Storm \"As real as possible\", she didn't.  Mara's performance is not one dimensional as a one dimensional performance at least has a dimension, Mara's performance has none.  Her portrayal makes Sue Storm one of the blandest, dullest and least interesting characters in the history of cinema.  The only interesting thing about Mara is her hair which switches between a light brown with blonde highlights to bright yellow blonde wig which she wore during the re-shoots.  Not only does this $5 wig look like it is made of straw but it is a full 15cms longer then her actual hair.  Why would spend $120 million on a film, and then ruin it by giving one of the title characters a crap $5 wig is anyone's guess.\n\nJamie Bell (Ben Grimm)  To be fair to Bell it is hard to know if he can actually act, as he isn't actually asked to do any acting. He looks a bit grumpy, says a few lines, and then is replaced CGI version of his superhero persona.\n\nToby Kebbell (Victor Von Doom)  Normally Victor is portrayed as the dictator of a fictitious eastern European country, adding gravitas and foreboding to his menace.  Here Trank gives us a Victor Von Doom who is just a socially dysfunctional greebo who spends his times sat in his room playing computer games and cracking one out off over his unrequited love, and it doesn't take a grates deal of working out to figure out who she is, as there is only one female character in the entire film.\n\nThere are numerous other issues with the film, but if I were to address them all it would take longer for you to read the review than it would to watch the film, so I won't as you have much more important and interesting things to do like alphabetise your DVD collection, iron your towels, or have a quick Trank.\n\nSuffice to say that Fantastic Four, whilst never the most sought after cinematic franchise, is now well and truly soiled goods and Fox should take a leaf out of Atari's book and rather than release the DVD's, they should just bury them in the New Mexico desert.\n\nOh and BTW, that scene in the Trailer where The Thing dive bombs out of a plane, that's not in the film.",

And some of the CGI of A2 was embarrassingly bad. So, relative to Avengers 2 and relative to say, the original FF movies, I liked it.  It definitely was lacking a little life - that would have been easy to add -  a little more humor and chemistry and interaction.  And, for sure, Ben Grimm, please put on some shorts.  That was awkward.  But, I think this was the right direction to go with FF in general.  Good tone, villain was pretty good, overall story was pretty good.  I liked it better than where x-men movies have gone - I am ready for x-men reboot.  \n\nThing to remember about superhero movies - the powers of the characters are almost like characters in their own right and need good screen time and presentation.  They did ok in this movie, but didn't really take advantage of what they COULD have done.  The old FF movies, while painfully campy and poorly cast IMO, did great job at portraying human torch's powers, the silver surfer was amazing and one of the best on screen looking characters in the MU.  Ben Grim's rubber suit was unwatchable though, \n\nI liked this cast better and Thing (with the addition of some Under Armor gear) was good.  But they don't really let their powers shine.  Miles Teller's powers were portrayed in a cool way, not a silly way, which i liked.\n\nI liked it, kind of wish they were doing sequel, but if Marvel gets it, that may end up being best thing in the end.  I don't like Fox making their movies in a MU vacuum.",

No.\nHowever, I hadn't seen a film derail its plot in its final act this badly since Superman IV.\nUp until then, the film had some potential, with a good cast. Apart from several terribly silly leaps in logic, the film had an interesting plot about inter-demtional travel, which felt like it could have been a film on its own. \nHowever, the character development is rushed and underdeveloped and once they arrive at planet zero, the planet is a let down. Like much of the film, it is restricted to in its scope, and we see just one small area. Instantly things happen, so they run back to Earth. We then get a brief run down of the transformation of the characters, then the film runs back to trying to rebuild the way back to planet zero. We already saw that. The film needed to move elsewhere from here. Maybe to the Fantastic Four. That would have been an idea. But no. \nThe plot line of the government using the four as weapons is given little time, with no in depth analysis of the effect of being put into war zones and killing humans on our young superheros. Again, it's just glossed over and not mentioned until the final moment.\nThen, when they return to planet Zero, we encounter Dr Doom. And it's from here that the film feels like the last 15 minutes of Superman IV, where the whole plot of Nuclear Man setting off a nuclear war and Superman having to prevent world destruction and beat a villain who had already had the better of him, was cut out, leaving him to just move the moon, drop Nuclear Man in a reactor, and give a quick speech and then fly past and smile at the camera. The film feels like it's missing so much, and that's what happens here in F4.\nIt's amazing how rushed the ending is. The film hadn't been great to that point, but a proper ending would have left the film as a solid 5/10 sort of film, and at least given hope to the series. Instead, the film is so hacked apart, leading to the critical outcry that occurred across the internet, leading to no hope of a Fantastic Four movie in the near future.\nThe cast are okay, but they have very little time to do anything. Maybe one day, the directors cut will get released and we will see a much better Fantastic Four, but its unlikely. Fox really dropped the ball with this one.",

Any movie has an introduction, a development and a conclusion, but Fantastic Four does not have the last 2 aspects (and that are too important) history develops slowly, giving to know the characters one by one in a way little showy and poor. Development in the characters does not exist, there is no personality in them, not even the villain is interesting, there is no reason and no reason to be villain. Josh Trank and the same FOX not knew handle the start of these super heroes, let us hope that in future, the 4 fantastic or \"Fantastic Four\" have a movie just and decent, let us hope that Disney-Marvel take advantage of this situation.

El desarrollo en los personajes no existe, no hay personalidad en ellos, ni siquiera el villano es interesante, no tiene motivo ni razones para ser villano. Josh Trank y la misma FOX no supieron manejar el inicio de estos super h√©roes, esperemos que en un futuro, los 4 Fant√°sticos o \"Fantastic Four\" tengan una pel√≠cula justa y decente, esperemos que Disney-Marvel aproveche esta situaci√≥n.

Watching the film the problems with its production couldn't be any more obvious - it's like halfway through you begin watching a completely different movie. I honestly would be interested to see what Josh Trank's intended vision was and if it would've fully committed to the subdued and serious tone of the first half since the film's biggest problem is that it tries to be both a serious sci-fi film and a fun comic book action film at the same time. These two styles don't go together - pick one and commit! Honestly it's impossible for me to hate or even dislike this movie - it's absolutely worth watching just for how hilariously confusing a mess it is. This is about as close as you get to watching a director's vision fall apart on screen.\n\n6,5/10",

Having now seen the film I can firmly say and you may argue with me the negative buzz is well warranted. Before the last 20 minutes I was willing to give this a 2/5 but alas I cannot. In this review I will cover 4 issues I had with this film.\n1. Editing- this film is poorly edited and it shows on screen. A movie should flow and transition seamlessly into the next scene. Fantastic four does not, instead it feels like a series of vignettes- stilted, showcasing glimpses of a good film.\n2. Story Progression/Pacing- relates to editing, the story is smack smack smack with not a lot of logic behind anything. Character development and motivation is horrid with nothing happening until the last 20 minutes of the movie. And spoilers they don't get powers until an hour in.\n3. Age- actors who are nearing their 30s playing teens is always a worry- sometimes it's pulled off and sometimes it's not in this case it's the later. Everyone suffers from not making their characters more than one dimensional caricatures bogged down by the un-believability of the ages they are playing.\n4. Setting- a problem with movies when they use limited settings is they have to utilise them without them becoming stagnant and tiresome. Fantastic four once again fails in this department bogging it's movie down in a film that relies too much of its setting in a lab and thus warrants many yawns throughout.\nIn saying that the performances were fine and I really was rooting for this to be a good film despite all the buzz around it but alas it just isn't fantastic.\n1.5/5",

            "content": "Okay, so although it's not the worst film ever made, it still might be one of the worst superhero films ever made. That had to have been one of the worst third acts in the history of cinema, and the only milestone that Fantastic Four achieved was the fact that it managed to join the line of other crappy Fantastic Four movies ever made. \n\nOkay, so in order to keep my sanity, I will keep this review fairly short. To start out, what I actually liked about the movie was the first half. The first half was actually fairly interesting, and the screenplay wasn't so bad. The movie felt like it was building towards something, and at the very least, I was entertained by what I was watching. Also, this movie contains an up and coming cast of stars, such as Miles Teller (Whiplash), Michael B. Jordan (Creed), Kate Mara (The Martian), Jaime Bell (Snowpiercer) and Toby Kebbell (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). All of these actors have shown that they can act, and they do what they can in this movie. With that being said, let's get down to business. \n\nThis movie was very, very messy. Like I said, the first half was entertaining enough, but that's because it felt like we were building towards something. This movie never really builds towards anything and it felt like half of a movie. The movie spends a good hour building up a decent plot, but throws it all away with an awful second half. I didn't believe that a third act could be so bad until I watched this film, and let me tell you, it was truly was awful. \n\nThe screenplay during the first half was passable, but as the story progressed, it just went straight down the toilet. There are so many ridiculous plot holes in this movie that makes you question your sanity, and it honestly becomes an absolute bore. I'll just take one example from the film, and that would be the formation of the \"Fantastic Four\". These five people are brought together to crack inter-dimensional teleportation, but realistically, only three out of the five should've been there in the first place. Reed Richards and Victor Doom are both geniuses, and Sue Storm somewhat helps with the process, but the other two characters are there for no reason. They contribute little, if anything to the process and feel wasted. Let's be real, Dr. Franklin Storm put all of his faith in one unknown teenager, his genius daughter, his not so genius son, the muscle bound friend of Reed, and an erotic inventor. Only a God would've know that these people would've formed a perfect team together, which makes the movie so much less believable. \n\nThe visuals in this movie also struggled, as there were many moments where it looked just flat out awful. Even though the special effects lacked and the CGI was bland, the thing that stood out the most to be was Dr. Doom. He was probably the worst looking villain I've seen in a long time, and again, I had to see it to believe it. With a film with an incredibly high budget, I would've expected more out of it, but sadly, what I saw on screen was vastly disappointing.\n\nThe editing in this film was also a mess. As if the pacing wasn't bad enough, but many scenes cut off too early which made them feel incomplete. There were many chunks of time that was skipped over in the movie, and with a movie with this high of a budget, I expected a lot more. I don't know if that's the editors faults, or the fact that they had little quality film to work with. This movie could've benefited from an extra 30 minutes of screen time, but then again, that only would've been a benefit if this film was good.\n\nOkay, so most of us cinephiles know about the backstory behind this film, but no one is 100% sure. To sum it up, Josh Trank reportedly had a different vision for this film, but his disagreements with Fox led to a disaster in production. There were re-shoots, scenes were cut out, and the overall plot was tampered with so much that this movie felt so confusing. In my opinion, I've seen Josh Trank direct. He has proven to be an excellent director, and during this film, I could see the glimmers of potential throughout. I think he was aiming for a much darker and gritty style of the Fantastic Four, which I think would've worked perfectly. Since I have no knowledge of which side is at fault, I won't take a side. But, I think this movie's failure can be attributed to many production issues and behind the scene issues. It really felt like multiple people were directing this film, multiple people tried to edit this film, and all of them had different visions for the direction of the movie.\n\nOh boy. I still have a lot to say, but I will hold it all back before I go mental. \n\nIn all, Fantastic Four probably isn't as terrible as the reviews are making it out to be, but it certainly isn't a good film. Although the first half was passable, the production issues caused a conflict in tone and messy editing. The fantastic actors that this movie had at the helm were wasted, as they had to act their way around a crappy script. The CGI and visuals were awful, and it the visuals should honestly be ashamed of themselves. The third act is probably one of the most abrupt and awful endings in the history of comic book movies, and this movie is definitely not worth buying or renting. If you see it on Netflix or on demand for free, then maybe consider it. Although I'm trashing this movie a lot, it was still watchable at times, and I could see the glimmers of hope that it possessed. In the end, I will not execute this movie, but instead hand it two stars and try and forget about what I just watched.",

After all of these total flunks at the fantastic four franchise, Marvel just have to get it back. Marvel  has proven that they can make any superhero team movie work so I'm sure that they can fix fantastic four. This movie had some good ideas but horribly pulled it off.",

It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.\n\nObviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.\n\nI agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.\n\n6/10",

        {
            "content": "My views towards superheroes films is similar to that of Disney movies; very complicated, convoluted, and getting tired of their formulas. A main contributor to this is most superheroes films feel the need to tell an origin story, and all feeling the same in outline form. Usually you have a young main character getting into an accident, is a good-doer, and after learning about his new-found abilities becomes a hero for the greater good. Our main character could suffer from blindness, being bullied, or simply being beautiful which limits the type of characters that are created. Superheroes films, at the moment, don't experiment much to the point that female-led superhero films can be counted on a single hand.\n\nFantastic Four was different for me as director, and writer of the film Chronicle, Josh Trank, brought in new ideas to a genre that refuses to experiment. It was a good film that while limited to the found footage format actually managed to be one of the rare times a found footage film worked. So for the first time since Man of Steel in 2013 I had expectations to experience a different kind of superhero film. Allot of what I learned about the film seem promising, and the teaser trailer got my interest. Now the point I started getting worried about the project wasn't the reshoots since one of my favorite movies, Jaws, and one of the best superheroes film ever made, Superman (1978), also endured reshoots. It was with the first official trailer for Fantastic Four that made me lose interest as the trailer was generic.\n\nYou think reviews would have kept me away, except for the fact superheroes films are the least trustworthy for me when it comes to critical, and audience reviews. If \"The Dark Knight\" is held to the highest standards for many of these reviewers so I had little reliable sources to turn to whenever one of these films get release. So out of the hundreds of reviews for this film the two reviewers I actually trusted with this genre both wrote negative reviews for the film. This caused me to be cautious. Then came in the talk of cut content which is where my interest raised again.\n\nFantastic Four follows four young outsiders teleported to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways. The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. The first ten minute of the films seem promising showing a young Reed Richard, and Ben Grimm attempting to send a toy car into another dimension. Unlike the rest of the film, the character are enthusiastic towards this goal, and dedicated to achieving it. What's wrong with these first ten minutes are simple. For starter, Ben Grimm \"It's Clobberin Time\" catch phrase originates from the times his older brother beat him up. Now I, expected this eventually pointless discovering would lead to some sort of repressed memory for Ben Grimm. This film clearly wanted to go in a dark direction so why not repress murder? It wouldn't be pleasant, nor worked well, but would have been different, and explain Ben Grimm lack of social skills or friends in the film.\n\nIn the first ten minutes, Reed Richard succeeds in building a teleportation device in his parents garage. Before that though, Reed Richards tells the entire class he wants to be the first person to teleport himself. His teacher, naturally tells him to pick a real career seemingly wanting to crush a young kid dream. I would argue against the realism of this scene, but school is where dreams go to die. My college professor told me that once when I, and several others, talked about our desired career on the first day in class (no joke). So after succeeding in teleporting a toy car what happens to Reed Richard? Fast forward seven years later. Neglecting what could have been interesting events to follow-up on. Why this timeskip is so damaging is plain simple; it glosses over the possible introduction of Reed Richard to the Baxter Foundation at an early age, and meeting the other major characters. If the film chose to show Reed Richard working within the Baxter Foundation at a such young age, and communicating with the other major characters developing the cast could have been easier. Also, I'm expected to buy within the first ten minutes a young kid developed a teleportation device in his parents garage, but a research institute aiming for the same thing completely missed this story in every possible way. This is the moment I gave up hope for good, sensical writing in the film.\n\nIn a science competition Reed Richards shows his teacher who told him to pick a real career. Demonstrate in front of his teacher eyes, and hands covering his ears a teleportation device. This same teacher who failed to crush Reed Richard dreams disqualified Reed Richard under the basis he believe Reed Richard perform magic. Yes, because Reed Richard who had his hands covering his ears build a machine in order to make an elaborate light show in order to perform magic. I would argue how this teacher got his job, but the US education system is terrible so it's not far fetch when depicting this teacher.\n\nAll of this was meant to develop characters within the first hour. However, that soon evaporate with one major mistake. So in the film Reed Richard, along with other young bright scientists that make up the core cast have to work together to make a teleportation device for the Baxter Corporation within the building. Instead of showing the trial, and error process of making such a machine would be a good excuse to develop characters, and their bond. The film decides to speed up the process by only showing the group talk to each other every now, and then. Not showing any hardship that has to be overcome when building a machine straight out of science fiction. Therefore, the completion of this teleportation device doesn't feel like a group achievement. Feeling more like the writers went through another plot point keep the story rolling.\n\nIt might read like I skipped over a lot of material, but the sad truth is hardly anything in the first hour contributes much to the overall picture. The only thing that needs to be brought up is the group decides to go to Planet Zero because they got drunk, and want to stick it to the man by going to this other dimension first. Something goes awry when the group goes to Planet Zero, and eventually return home with one less member. Now, Sue Storm, not going to Planet Zero would have been fine if she didn't get her powers by getting blasted by a computer. At most, a computer will catch on fire, and burn you. There are other side effects, but none of which include the powers to be invisible. To be clear, I'm not referring to Kate Mara (the actress who plays Sue Storm) career after this movie either.\n\nAnother issue is, like every live action Fantastic 4 film, is it desire to follow trends for of the time for unexplained reasons. For instance, as unsubtle as a villain like Red Skull in Captain America is, that film doesn't undermined the audience intelligent, and actually plays up on that aspect. Here, there's a character named Victor Von Doom. Hm, there's clearly nothing wrong here. I am one-hundred percent positive someone named Doom will not, in any way, be the villain of the film or turn out to be evil. Noticing this I am dealing with yet, another instance of \"Obviously Evil Bad Guy\". Unlike in say something like Mad Max: Fury Road where the \"Obviously Evil Bad Guy\" worked because the aesthetics of the film complemented it. In Fantastic 4 it is attempting to be more realistic (for some reason) where it goes against such a cartoonish name. The film attempts to humanize Dr. Doom by making him difficult to work with, rude to his peers, getting jealous when Reed Richard is talking to his possible crush Sue Storm, and doing stupid things when he is drunk. Wait, some of that is still evil behavior. Well, the writing really sucks for this film.\n\nBy the time the second act finally ends you're given enough reasons to dislike the film. The rush pacing, glossing over obstacles, missed opportunity for character development, and failing in setting up a grand story. One aspect that could have been engaging simply goes away due to a time skip. Ben Grimm returns to Earth as a pile of CGI, walking, talking rocks, and when the film shows Ben Grimm in this form for the first time he is scare. However, this turmoil for Ben doesn't last long as soon as he talks to Dr. Allen minutes later he accepts his new body. Well, that was pointless. There's also another scene where Franklin Storm sees his son, Johnny Storm, confuse in pain burning endlessly. Instead of making a somewhat emotional moment of Franklin Storm talking to his son, and calming him long enough for Johnny to be in human form. Viewers are instead greeted with a scene of Reed Richard escaping from a military base that has little security despite the fact they are holding people with abnormal abilities. Though, the film is not entirely to blame for this lengthy review. I got admit I missed an opportunity to make a racist joke as to why Johnny Storm is black in this movie unlike every other incarnation of Fantastic Four.\n\nOne line of dialogue in the film pissed me off way more than it will the average movie viewer. It was during a scene where supervisor Dr. Allen is showing footage of The Thing working in military combat fields. At the moment the camera shows The Thing ripping off the upper half of a tank Dr. Allen says \"He's been involved in covert operations\". Really? A walking, pile of rock has been involved in several covert operations? Not only that, but apparently none of this footage, nor the enemies footage of The Thing has been seen by any form of media? I'm expected to believe , The Thing, existence is unknown to the world when he is shown ripping apart the upper half of a tank, and throwing it at enemy soldiers? Now the reason this line pissed me off was because in my time off I played a video game called Binary Domain. The entire game was meant to be a covert mission, yet in one level I fought against a Spider Robot the size of tall building. This occurred in one level so try to imagine an entire video game spanning around ten hours with events like that. The game events unfold in the span of a couple of days, and of course it eventually get public attention. Yet, I'm expected to believe for an entire year The Thing has been a part of military operations, and none of the enemy soldier that saw him told anyone? Dr. Allen says The Thing saves people while The Thing is hurting people on footage. So if this claim is true, HOW COME THERE ISN'T A SINGLE NEWS REPORT OF SEVERAL SOLDIERS REPORTING THEY SAW A GIANT PILE OF ROCK IN COMBAT! I'm willing to accept any leap of logic, but not, when it is very clear, that the film itself is attempting to be realistic, and wants to be taken seriously to the degree of Fantastic Four.\n\nThe final act is entirely ripped from another movie. A generic superhero movie without giving its main villain a motive for destruction, or has heroes that care that a military facility is filled with dead people. Seriously, there's no emotional reaction from the Fantastic Four when ordinary people die. When the Fantastic Four have no chemistry with each other, than showing them be concerned with the fate of planet Earth in the climax there's no sense of weariness from them. At this point in the film, the team isn't even referred to as the Fantastic Four, nor is the name ever uttered in the film. It's ashame of it for some inexplicable reason. What this final act also contains is a force \"Save the World\" climax, and a weak final fight for some action. When the film actually ends, it becomes evidently clear the film amounted to nothing. From the first hour that set everything to the last act that goes in an entirely different direction. Losing faith along the way before becoming a film that satisfies no one.\n\nThe cast of Fantastic Four includes the talented cast of Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell. Performances they aren't bad when showing the inner struggle of their characters alone, but together the cast don't have any chemistry together. Jamie Bell, and Kate Mara for instance, never make eye contact with each other in the entire movie. When the Fantastic Four are all together on-screen they don't come across as good friends or a family. One issue being Jamie Bell is absent for a good portion of the film while the other cast member play characters who built a teleportation device. Toby Kebbell who plays Doctor Doom provides a stale performance. As soon as he appears on-screen there's no question he's a villain. He's gets the worst part to play since his costume for Doctor Doom is expressionless, and his mask seems like a crash test dummy head painted black with neon green lights implanted on it. It's look terrible on-screen.\n\nMiles Teller gets a few scenes where his acting chops adds to a scene. For example, there's a scene that requires Miles Teller to crawl to a pile of rubber after an incidents. His display of concern is convincing, but when he turns around to see his body stretched out his mortification sells this moment. It's a good moment in the movie, but this is only of one of about three scene where the characters come across as people. The other two scenes being Jamie Bell voicing his distraught in being The Thing for the first time, and the other being Michael B. Jordan screaming as he is engulfed by flames. These snippets make the character seem real since they are afraid of they new-found abilities they don't understand to use. However, there's where their most human moments end. Unlike other films in the genre, we don't see the Fantastic Four gradually accepting their abilities.\n\nThe supporting casts are entirely one note for the film. Reg E. Cathey who plays Franklin Storm maintains a similar facial expression of disapproval for every scene he's in. He's can't do anything in the role. Tim Blake Nelson who plays Dr. Allen has to look smug, and pretend to be chewing gum for every scene he's in. He makes little no lasting impression. That's about it for the supporting cast. Most of the actors in the film appear briefly in a scene or two then never appear again. One of them being Ben Grimm mother, and his brother who disappear after a single scene.\n\nThis film contains a few practical effects, and they are convincing looking. Like the mentioned moment when Reed Richard is crawling, and legs stretches out for a couple of meters. CGI on the other hand never blends into with the live action portion. It's rubbery whenever Reed Richards stretches his body in the few moments near the end when powers are used. However, the CGI isn't used for action scenes, nor in moments of showing off the heroes good sides. At most, you'll see briefly clips of The Thing military operations, one brief fight with Reed Richards attempting to fight off military gunman, and towards the end when the Fantastic Four team up to fight Doctor Doom. So very powers usage throughout the world. The Thing looks convincing depending on the lighting, but when he's fully visible isn't convincing. Kate Mara wig changes throughout the film, and so does her style. It's distracting, but the least of the film problems. Planet Zero itself is simply an empty planet with nothing living on it. The music is just forgettable.\n\nFantastic 4 is a bad film that had potential, but was squandered. It's a shame to be what it originally wanted to be opting to be a film that pleases everyone, and in the end becoming a film no one wants. Some ideas it had could have led to a good movie, and certain moments in the film are inspired, but the whole thing is a big mess. Good talent is wasted, special effects quality are uneven, and the script is weak on all front. In the end, the biggest let down of seeing this film is the only thing that makes it stand out in the genre is how bad it turned out.\n\nA Silly Afterthought:\n\nI had no idea where to include this piece of thought in my review so I just place it here in the end. One thing I noticed about all the Fantastic Four films, and some of the comic books is The Thing always wears pants, but in this film he's always walking naked. So, I find it funny the MPAA considers this PG-13 material, yet something like Steve Jobs has probably like small uses of the F word is rated R. If I understand this correctly, I could display nudity in a movie so long the character is entirely CG, yet simple foul language will get me an R rating. Every movie watcher probably knows this by now, but the MPAA really needs to update their regulations for movie ratings. Oh yeah, there's also the costumes which I didn't comment on. To be honest, I prefer the costumes in this film over the comic books which basically are blue tight suits with a number four on it.\n\nLetterboxd: http://letterboxd.com/cinema_maniac/\n\nWordpress: https://personafication.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "And here we go again, round...errr...whatever, for yet another reboot of yet another comicbook franchise, I hope its a winner. Yeah so after the light-hearted antics of the earlier movies failed to set the box alight way back in 2005 and 2007 (even though they weren't actually that bad), someone decided to give them another whirl. The Four are Marvels first team/family of superheroes and thusly they needed a big budget extravaganza to fit into their new successful universe.\n\nThis time things would be different, the jokey, slapstick shenanigans of the earlier movies was gone, long gone, in its place would be a much darker, grittier approach that would breathe new realistic life into the Four. The fact that the Fantastic Four were well known for being a more colourful, light-hearted set of heroes (mainly down to their rather silly super powers), seemed to make no difference to how director Trank wanted to go. This would be the Nolan-esque version of the Fantastic Four that incorporated many of the Fantastic Four comic incarnations, like it or lump it. \n\nSo the idea of trying to cover all comicbook visions for the movie was brave and reasonably sound, instead of just relying on hammy childish humour and action, they would balance that out with a much broodier tone. The characters would be younger, the technology would be more believable, costumes would be more sensible, super powers would be more grounded or shocking like an affliction, and the overall vibe of the movie would be more serious. The plot remains pretty similar to what we already know of the Four with minor changes. Instead of going into space they jump into a parallel dimension and are exposed to dangerous otherworldly energies or substances that cause the super power mutations at a molecular level. What follows is the team slowly coming to terms with their new powers whilst being confined to a secret military base and being abused by the government for special ops. Eventually, of course, they need to come up against the much stronger Dr Doom who was presumed missing in action in the parallel dimension.\n\nNow the start of this movie is actually fine (first half hour or so), it all moves along perfectly well. We get a nice small flashback to a young Ben Grimm and Reed getting to know each other and seeing their interest in science and technology flourish. Moving on from there we jump to a much older Reed and Grimm as they now prepare to jump into another dimension with the machine they helped build along with Doom, Sue Storm, and to a degree Johnny Storm (Johnny Storm is not really required for this, or anything, in any way). Everything I saw in these early sequences was pretty engaging I thought, it all looked good, sounded good and the cast fit their roles well. As we progressed further into the parallel dimension I still found myself enjoying the film. I really liked the visuals, the spacesuit design was cool, the Quantum Gate machine looked both intimidating and functional and planet Zero (parallel dimension planet) was eerie and foreboding. \n\nOnce reaching the real crux of the movie, their super powers, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see a very hard edged approach. Now when I say hard edged, I mean its clearly been crafted in a Cronenberg fashion (as widely reported) with a big body shock element infused into the proceedings. I actually really liked how Trank and co (or whoever) did this, having Sue fluctuate between transparency without control, Grimm being a painful mass of solid rock material with no real shape, just a pile of rubble on the floor. Then you have Johnny also appearing in pain as he writhes around on a table engulfed in flames, and finally Reed strapped to a table, his limbs elongated, muscles pulsing, he doesn't appear to be in pain but unable to control his limbs properly. This angle was pretty daring for a supposed young persons comicbook flick, but it deserves kudos, I think the team behind the film really managed the impossible with such corny super powers, they made them actually believable and emotional, we could feel their fear.\n\nWhat I also liked, and what also shocked me, was the inclusion of actual minor horror elements in the film. When Doom gets back from planet Zero and starts killing people for no real reason, he does it in a nasty way. He appears to fry them until their bodies pop, or their internal organs explode outward, which ever, but you do see blood! As Doom escapes from the military facility he appears to make peoples heads burst with blood splatterings galore! I did not expect this at all. Unfortunately even though Doom is a badass in the film, his visage does look very rushed as does his attire. He merely seems to be wearing a dark metallic bodysuit and mask with lots of neon green glowing through in places. Apparently his spacesuit had fused with his body but that doesn't really explain why he looks the way he does, how he got his green cloak and hood, nor does it explain his mask and weird mouthpiece (the glowing green was the energy substance found on planet Zero). He basically looks like some kind of metallic, mummified, mannequin, gimp.\n\nDespite the half decent start to the movie things do take a nosedive quite rapidly. The timeline clearly jumps around, different edits, wigs, things aren't really explained too well etc...such as Reed running off and living in Panama for some reason. What the hell was he trying to do? what was the point in that entire sequence?? Characters talk about how Reed has been off the grid for so long and how he's hard to find...yet they just manage to find him really quickly when they decide to hunt him down. And why is it the Four agree to remain in this secret base and carry out special ops? Surely they must know these military government types are just using them and they probably won't find a cure, they all seem pretty naive to me. Then you have this whole other dimension notion, visually effective at least, but none of it is even remotely thought out properly. They reach another planet in another dimension, but it just doesn't come across as that bigger deal. Surely this would open up so many questions about that parallel dimension and that universe, that whole plot angle just seemed way too big for this movie. An entire alternative universe in a parallel dimension! that's some heavy shit! but they use it like some kind of throwaway plot device. Did I mention the wigs aspect?\n\nI still don't really get why Doom wanted to stay in the parallel dimension on planet Zero. OK I understand that the natural raw energy somehow powers him and seems to keep him alive or healthy, but there's nothing there! What the hell is he gonna do on this barren wasteland of a planet forever?? Why does he wanna wipe out Earth all of a sudden? especially if he doesn't even intend to remain on Earth, in our dimension. Oh and how did he know when the team had come back to rescue him? how did he know where they would reappear? maybe it was the same location? Did anyone else also notice that the despite the weather appearing to be really bad and really harsh on planet Zero, it was always very calm with no wind or anything, where ever the characters were.\n\nAt the end of the day there just doesn't feel like there's anything at stake here, the finale is set in this desolate wasteland in another dimension, so who cares. The Four never really seem to fully utilise their powers for anything, or anywhere, they just get them...and mope around. Even when they must battle Doom, they still don't seem to be that effective with their powers, but I guess you could say they are still learning (for the sequel eh). Even though I quite liked the start of the movie and I did like the initial body shock reactions of the characters, the entire film is essentially just exposition for the obviously pre-planned sequel which may now never happen. As such, this movie is like a highway to nowhere, exposition that leads to nowhere, Hollywood is so comfortable with this cheeky method/formula now, and its very worrying. You don't get proper movies anymore, you get promises and setups for the following bigger movie, if you're lucky, because as we all know, films always come in trilogies these days.",

I would definitely give a 6.5 in the old one as well! The old one did have Jessica Alba and Chris Evans, so comparison falls short on the cast side!\n\nAnyways, bottom line is that if you liked the old one, you will like this one as well, maybe a bit more. This one is closer to my taste, although the Fantastic Four seem younger than their actual age in the comics. I did like the fact that it was kind of darker than the previous one and that it pointed out the emotional roller-coaster and distress of acquiring their powers, whereas in the previous one it was more like \"yeah, we have powers, let's be cool and kick ass\". \n\nI really don't get all these people that sit down and compare what was in the comic and what was in the movie, etc, failing to understand that it's not the director's job to transfer the entire comic in the movie, or to attempt to understand what they pictured in their minds when they read the comic and then make a movie with it! For God's sake! \n\nIt's a fair movie, with nice action and interesting storyline and that's it. It's a marvel movie, it's promising that a sequel will come and that's all I need! It's not X-Men and it will never be, cause it's a different type of movie. On the same topic, it's not spider man, it's not superman, etc. It was an improvement (makes sense) to the poor special effects of 2005, and yes, I liked all the actors! \n\nCan't wait to see the next one, I hope not in 2025!",

I saw this film to discover why all the criticism the considers a disgust and my final surprise was very similar to the one in the entire world. Fantastic Four is a film disappointing and boring, without surprises, What is the error? Are Not the actors, each one of them made a decent work, the problem here was the script, the plot and the story. This film is an introduction of 1 hour with 46 minutes, which is a total error. Any movie has an introduction, a development and a conclusion, but Fantastic Four does not have the last 2 aspects (and that are too important) history develops slowly, giving to know the characters one by one in a way little showy and poor. Development in the characters does not exist, there is no personality in them, not even the villain is interesting, there is no reason and no reason to be villain. Josh Trank and the same FOX not knew handle the start of these super heroes, let us hope that in future, the 4 fantastic or \"Fantastic Four\" have a movie just and decent, let us hope that Disney-Marvel take advantage of this situation. Disappointing and boring, with a introduction eternal without a development and final.\n\nReview en Espa√±ol:\nProbablemente, Fantastic Four sea la candidata ideal para \"la peor pel√≠cula del 2015\" al menos Sandler puede presumir que \"Pixels\" ya no es considerada la peor del a√±o. Vi esta pel√≠cula para descubrir el motivo por el cual toda la critica la considera un asco y mi sorpresa final fue muy parecida a la de todo el mundo. Fantastic Four es una pel√≠cula decepcionante, aburrida y sin sorpresas, ¬øCual es el error? No son los actores, cada uno de ellos hizo un trabajo decente, el problema aqu√≠ fue el guion, la trama y la historia. Esta pel√≠cula es una introducci√≥n de 1 hora con 46 minutos, lo cual es un error total. Toda pel√≠cula tiene una introducci√≥n, un desarrollo y una conclusi√≥n, pero Fantastic Four no cuenta con los 2 √∫ltimos aspectos (y que son demasiado importantes) la historia se desarrolla de una manera lenta, dando a conocer a los personajes uno por uno de una manera poco llamativa y pobre. El desarrollo en los personajes no existe, no hay personalidad en ellos, ni siquiera el villano es interesante, no tiene motivo ni razones para ser villano. Josh Trank y la misma FOX no supieron manejar el inicio de estos super h√©roes, esperemos que en un futuro, los 4 Fant√°sticos o \"Fantastic Four\" tengan una pel√≠cula justa y decente, esperemos que Disney-Marvel aproveche esta situaci√≥n.

I'd say the best thing I could possibly say about this movie is:\nIf you ever wanted to see a movie with fairly done graphics, sort of fair acting, and a story-line that is scripted well enough to suite a He-Man Cartoon then this is it. This film from the graphic work has a ton of money put into the wrong things, the script was very rushed and extremely cheesy. They moved the character opening in way too fast with a ton of skips, then the story sets in so quick it was like watching old G.I. Joe cartoons from the late 80's when you knew the ending would be soon. Simply put this film just didn't have it's stop and starts into play in the story which killed the movie from the moment it started.\nThe acting was fairly good for what script that it had anyone could've done it, though some of the actors just seemed to not do well in front of a full time green screen situation.

The first part of the film feels like an Amblin film from back in the 80's and 90's but even so the Fantastic Four have had moments of seriousness, but always have been lighthearted and fun. The campiness of the 2005 film and the constant fun gibing between Chris Evans' and Michael Chiklis' Human Torch and the Thing is now gone and replaced by a dour, humorless and gritty reboot that in someway made me miss the Tim Story films. Sure, they weren't spectacular but Dr. Doom and the characters actually looked like their comic book counterparts and they had an actual plot. This... it's almost like the editor, director, or whoever went out for a walk. \n\nWhile Tony Kebbell's Dr. Doom is more menacing than Julian McMahon's and the new powers given to him are actually kind of cool, his motivations for his villainy are never really given enough time to manifest and overall the film is a waste of talented young, rising actors' time and the audience as well. \n\nSkip it and pray to God Marvel Studios gets the rights back.

Why? Why does everything have to be sandwiched between glib humor and punchlines? Are we really so incapable of being entertained without a laugh? \n\nWhy can't we appreciate a grounded, dark, charmless hard fiction about a bunch of kids who had their lives fucked up?\n\nIronically what I love about this iteration of Fantastic Four is that the tone of the film is just downright misery. That having cool super powers isn't \"fantastic\" at all but actually a dreary affair.\n\nThat all being said, great ideas don't flourish without the proper execution and F4 just doesn't make a good film. The pacing is all wrong, it's 80% setup, 20% conflict with an abrupt ending. The resolution itself has no build up, none of the characters had time to resonate or interact, cheapening the whole \"we're better together\" motif. Reed's brilliant master plan to beat Doom was \"Make Ben Invisible so he can punch him\"? Really? The ending poses a problem too, 4 kids strong arming the US government to give them whatever they want? What? The Franklin kids don't mourn their fathers death, but in fact joke about it when naming the building? What?\n\nF4 felt like a long pilot for a possibly great TV show, one that I would love to watch.

If felt like I'd watched the first two (long) acts of a bigger movie, and then stopped before betting to the resolution.\n\nMaybe my biggest complaint is the  lack superpowers you see from the team.  And when Johnny wants to go use his powers in the field, it becomes a big moral debate about \"Oh no, the military just wants to use you to do their dirty work.  We have to use these powers for good!\"  I disagree.  If The Human Torch wants to go set the Taliban on fire, let him.  At least that would be entertaining.\n\nI think the biggest way the film derails is with the development of Dr. Doom.  Although he's quite powerful, his motivations and transformation are questionably confusing.  Dr Doom is supposed to be highly intelligent, and trying to save the human race, not destroy it.  And a film is really only as good as it's villain.\n\nSay what you want about the original Fantastic Four (2005) movie, but at least that one was fun.  In the end, this isn't really an awful movie.

There are some interesting ideas in this movie, and somewhere deep down there is a good movie.  The problem however is twofold: studio meddling, and the fact that the movie it's trying to be just isn't a Fantastic Four movie.  The idea of people with powers suffering and being exploited is actually pretty damn intriguing, but it just doesn't fit the tone of who the Fantastic Four are.  They're a family who have grand adventures, and I never felt that with these guys.  They bicker constantly, not like a family, but like people who genuinely hate each other.  They have no adventures really, with the 90% of the movie taking place in one dull location.  If you took away the Fantastic Four brand and went all out with this vision, you could have an intriguing Cronenberg-esque sci-fi trip, something that could go down as a cult hit.  Even with the Fantastic Four name though, if you went all out with this vision you may at least have something kind of interesting, and that's where the second problem comes in: studio meddling.  It's obvious the studio didn't have faith in the director's vision, and while I don't necessarily blame them, their adjustments just make it worse.  They clearly tried to make it a more standard superhero film at the last minute, but the result is just an embarrassingly sloppy climax with cringe-worthy dialogue and ugly CGI.\nThe biggest shame of this movie is that it could have been good.  Everyone involved from the director to the actors to the studio, they've all produced good products in the past, and they clearly all have a vision for this thing.  The problem is their visions clashed and just didn't fit the property they were working with.  It's not a fun bad movie, it's just a depressingly bad movie.

Boy, was I wrong. Not only is this the worst Fantastic Four movie, this also might be the worst superhero movie I have ever seen. This film is an absolute embarrassment. With a director like Josh Trank(Chronicle) attached, this film could have been great. There were SEVERAL writers collaborating to make this film. Not one of them stopped and said, \"Guys, this movie just isn't working.\"\nUnfortunately, no one did so. THIS WHOLE FILM IS EXPOSITION. The whole movie is a setup for a sequel. Not only that, but the CGI is laughably bad. Fantastic Four had a huge budget, but still managed to create CGI effects in comparison to the original straight-to-DVD film in the 90's. \n\n    Also, the actors in this film are all considerably talented. But, for some reason, they just couldn't pull it off. Some of the acting in this film is cringe-worthy, especially from Toby Kebbell. Miles Teller is normally great in films like The Spectacular Now or Whiplash. Michael B. Jordan was awesome in Fruitvale Station. Jamie Bell and Kate mara are fantastic actors. Speaking of Jamie Bell, I have no clue what the f**k he was trying to do in this movie. His performance was just not working at all.\n\n   Fantastic Four is a ludicrous film. I would not wish this film on anyone, and I think it's time to stop trying to make Fantastic Four films. I am beginning to think that it is impossible to make a Fantastic Four film. You would be much better off going to see another film such as The Gift.\n\nRating: F",

The one memorable part of the movie for me is when Ben head butts Reed Richards I didn't hear any noise and to me it looked Fake. I said that looks fake and busted up laughing.

Thing at least looked great in this movie (although seeing his rocky butt-cheeks was something I could have done without) unlike the thing from the original movie that looked like an action figure sculpted out butterfinger candy bar poop.   Johnny Storm was fun but barely in the movie.   Reed Richards was passable at best and Kate Mara who is a great actress is the invisible woman.  they never use her even close to her whole potential though.   Im convinced that at one time this was going to be a good movie but when Disney/Marvel heard that a franchise that technically belonged to them was going to make money they couldn't get at they secretly went about sabotaging it either out of spite or to protect their holdings.   skip this one stick to the comics.",

First of all, the only job for the filmmakers was to make this movie better than the previous instalments, which shouldn't have been difficult. I mean, Trank maybe had a better ideo to end the movie, but in the end we dont know who to blame, and we have to judge the end result; which is really bad. I guess they were overthinking this one, or maybe not, maye they did just what they came up with and translated it into something called Fantastic Four. The actors did a good job (which I really didn't expect them to do), but there was not a slight bit of chemistry, which the revious movies did a way better job. Focusing more on the struggle of the Thing is also something previous movies tried, and didn't work out. Trying to make Van Doom more than just a man with a mask and gadgets is cool, I liked it, but you can't call that persona Van Doom (just call him metal gear man with head exploding powers ore something). What really hurts in this movie are the painfully obvious reshoots. The worst part is, they dont even make this movie better, they just unnecessarily steal playtime. The climax of the movie took like 17 minutes. Seriously? C'mon, if you struggle to show the audience everything you want, then make this a 2 1/2h movie (even though I highly doubt that would have helped this movie). I think they could make it better (and by THEY I do mean FOX), but I dont really know how to get people to pay for a Fantastic Four movie anymore, and I think this franchise is buried for the next 10 to 15 years. I hope the F4 come back, and we can do them justice (sometime). I will give this movie a better ranking than some other 'better' movies (like Iron Man 4) because the movie at least didn't make me mad. It was disappointing, and it was boring, but it didn't make me jump on a bandwagon and hate on it everywhere I go (LIKE IRON MAN 3, fuck that movie).",

They travel to an alternate universe and become mutated by the elements of this new planet.  I really don't know why this specific group of superheroes is so hard to get right; so far to date, the only time where it has truly excelled is when it was a different title: The Incredibles.  I can't say that I've seen the Roger Corman production, and I don't have a personal connection with the comic books, but I've seen both of the Tim Story movies, and they ranged from okay to mediocre.  I think those two movies catch an unfair amount of flack, but they're still not good films.  With this reboot, they have made something that is far more lacking than either one of the previous movies.  The best thing I can say about the 2005 movie is that it shows that not every superhero movie had to be brooding and dark, and you can have one be more lighthearted; from my understanding this isn't the darkest of superhero stories anyways.  With this reboot, it is back to basics, and there are dark elements all over the place.  Honestly, this really makes me feel bad for critiquing something like Ant-Man for not being perfect, because with this, there really is nothing to recommend about this, and I will happily watch the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe before I will ever pick this up again.  So where to begin with everything that is wrong with this.  For one thing, there are no surprises to be had here.  It's another origins story for a group that everybody is already well aware of; nobody wants to see another Spider-Man origins, Superman origins or Batman origins, and nobody wants to see this, either.  It's just like a bad cover song at karaoke of a song that wasn't all that great to begin with, and you just want the drunken man to get off the stage.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it takes a full 45 minutes before something new happens.  I have heard differing stories on how much this was studio intervention and how much was director Josh Trank, and it doesn't really matter, because everybody is to blame and we all lose.  These aren't terrible actors; I've seen Miles Teller knock it out of the park in Whiplash, Michael B. Jordan bring it in Fruitvale Station, and Toby Kebbell deliver a gut punch in Dead Man's Shoes.  That said, I feel that every single person here is miscast, and nobody shares any chemistry with one another, they are just going through the motions and reading the lines on the page.  The dialogue is as clunky and boring as the rock planet that they go to, which brings me to the next point: the effects look cheap.  I don't know if somebody pocketed the majority of the $120 million budget, but the special effects look like they could have been rendered another few times over, and to have not one but two of your most climactic scenes take place on a barren rock planet is not an exciting choice to make for your adventure movie.  The villain motivation is weak and questionable, and the more I think about this, the less I like it, and I don't have anything good to say about this overly dull action film, which, in itself, is saying something.",

            "content": "We all know the story: Mr Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch and The Thing take on Victor Von Doom, a villain once their own, and infected with the same energy source they have all been affected by, wants to eradicate Earth and only the four can stop him. And in 2015, the Fantastic Four have contracted another chance on the big screen, but this version is a very different interpretation of Marvel√¢??s main superhero family to the Tim Story versions of a decade ago. There has been much hype about this reboot that looked intriguing when the trailer came out, but as it has now been released, it seemingly should have followed the recipe for superhero films Marvel Studios have perfected. Unfortunately, this new Fantastic Four capitulates under the numerous mistakes it conceives, much to our surprise, for it has all the elements to be fantastic.\n \nSeeing as this version starts off with all the characters separately, they have to bond lots to become tightknit, and unfortunately they never really feel like a group once. We can√¢??t ever understand their close bond as friends, siblings, lovers or enemies because we don√¢??t get to see them bond, and this is a major problem because to us the characters don√¢??t mesh as a unit, and so we see an empty group of heroes who still seem by the end strangers. The characters are thoroughly underused, for only when they talk scientifically do we feel like the film is getting somewhere, but when they try to make small talk for the purpose of character building and relationship bonding, they fail miserably because this script does not make time for it, in fact it fails to make time for any of the moments that make the recent crop of superhero films as successful as they are. Each character cannot be distinguished from one another until their powers ever so poorly cling onto them. They are all brainy scientists with poor upbringings, yet their ambition to do great makes them unique people who struggle to get along with other humans, therefore, all five characters are effectively carbon copies of each other, minus the radical beliefs. So, how can we embrace the characters if the only diversity comes with the usurping of their powers? And to make matters worse, the powers aren√¢??t made to look entertaining at all, and like all its problems, we don√¢??t see much of it, and when we do, the bits chosen don√¢??t tickle our fancy.\n \nMiles Teller is our protagonist Reed Richards AKA Mr Fantastic, a genius with the ability to stretch like rubber. Teller falls into his character better than Ioan Gruffudd ever did, but the thinness of his character means shallowness to a lot of things because he is our protagonist. Kate Mara√¢??s Susan Storm is far worse than Jessica Alba√¢??s creation; all we feel is her cold exterior we can never penetrate. We can√¢??t even begin to hope for a romance between her and Richards because her lacklustre performance prevents the idea from even popping into our heads. Michael B. Jordan, despite being black is the sister of Susan, who is white, making her his adopted sister, and to be honest to confuse their lineage doesn√¢??t add complexity to anything, it merely makes them feel more like strangers. Because his father is the group√¢??s guide, Jordan√¢??s Johnny Storm has depth to his character, unlike his partners, but he isn√¢??t even the second or third protagonist! Ben Grimm is the most neglected of the lot, lacking brains and brawn, and screen time! We don√¢??t even get to see Jamie Bell that much, but all of a sudden after a mishap is made out of rock, and becomes the heart of the group. This confusion isn√¢??t helped by The Thing√¢??s poor appearance that blocks emotion. And Victor Von Doom, the villain with a hell-bent vision that Earth needs to be destroyed because humans have driven it to deterioration is a weak enemy. Every feeling of his is under-emphasised, from his hatred of other humans, humanity√¢??s treatment of Earth and his love for Susan; therefore he becomes quite a one-dimensional character with the inability to express his emotions. Toby Kebbell does what he can with Victor, but in the end what we have is an undercooked villain with radical beliefs that have come out of nowhere due to his embittered personality that has dealt with constant rejection.\n \nThe development of the story is interesting at the start, playing upon the inter-dimensional travel ploy that is a big feature for the film, and one we can potentially understand in our technology-heavy society. When teleportation is achieved, the planet they teleport to, named Zero, is the most interesting this film can hope for. It is fascinating that the protagonists go there and actually investigate their surroundings, something which the 2005 Fantastic Four embarrassingly attempts to do, and even though the most we know about this planet is its man-made name and green lava-like substance, there isn√¢??t much to remember about it, and that is Fantastic Four√¢??s major problem. It suffers from the inability to delve into the interesting details of its story, which although there are plenty, it doesn√¢??t realise which ones are which and suffers. To see a film unable to control its own story, and provide life into memorable superheroes is sad viewing, because Fantastic Four is a mess that has potential, but the filmmakers here haven√¢??t understood what constitutes into making a story develop and flow.\n \nFantastic Four cannot flow properly therefore the narrative is unbalanced throughout. The opening is given plenty of time to develop, but the shortness of the running time makes the film miss large sections, which feels like it jumps ahead from scene to scene, and the scenes that are chosen lack importance or clarity. Upon the return of Victor 80 minutes in, the film is suddenly at a climax, allowing the audience to turn to one another and give a stare of √¢??did I fall asleep or is that it?√¢?? because the bridging scenes are absent, making this film feel rushed because it fails to dedicate its time equally around the film. About half-way in, the induction of a montage that tries to forward the story in terms of character bonding and the building of the teleportation device shows just how clearly the filmmakers didn√¢??t know what they were doing. If the montage were converted into actual scenes, all of the criticism I√¢??ve levelled at the film would be deemed obsolete, because Fantastic Four would then become layered, both in terms of the characters and story.\n \nFor some reason, the film maintains an obscure tone that suits the film on occasions but cannot be understood why it is so dark. To allow for the characters to bond and for us to create a connection to the film, there has to be far more of a lighter quality to the proceedings, maybe not as much as Chris Evans brought as The Human Torch, but definitely some kind of comic relief that could take the seriousness down a notch or two. I actually don√¢??t understand why there needs to be a dark tone because the characters are all young, ambitious and on the verge of ground-breaking discovery, and not once is there the threat of evil until the last 10 minutes, so as you can see the imbalance is rife. Reg E. Cathey√¢??s addition as Dr Franklin Storm, parent of Johnny and Sue, whom you may know as the guy who makes tasty-ass ribs in House of Cards, is the guy that brings this gloomy fa√É¬ßade over the film, despite being a strong character who you can actually feel is acting. His addition gives the characters an anchor they can rebel against and return to, but most importantly his level-headedness stops the characters from relaxing before and after they gain their abilities. Without Franklin as a guide to the group, the gloominess would not have potentially been achieved, and the characters would have had to guide themselves, making for a more reckless film with the capacity to amaze.\n \nThe short running time means the ending is so lacklustre and insanely quick, it will definitely leave you underwhelmed by the whole experience that didn√¢??t develop, intrigue or satisfy such an interesting beginning. The location of the climax is boring, the fighting is tedious and the visuals are so monotonous it would not even take a film buff to notice it. Director Josh Trank has said the final package wasn√¢??t his version because 20th Century Fox made cuts to the script without his supervision, and so with his dissatisfaction sky-high, it doesn√¢??t change a thing because Fantastic Four was a mess nonetheless. These superheroes need to be left in their comic books fighting evil without critics embarrassing them for a fourth time!\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nFantastic Four has glimmers of the great superhero film it could have become, but in the end, this reboot has torn apart the characters√¢?? dignity and the world√¢??s love for this family of heroes.\n \n√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??        2/10",

I loved the trailer. I was enthralled unbeknownst to me that the film advertised was in fact a FF reboot.\n\nAnd that's what still sells it to me now despite all the flack it's getting. This is a reboot. It's a stand-alone film with inspiration from famous comics and the characters within them. I guess it's easy for me to say as I don't have any attachment to the comics or their beloved characters.\n\nI adore the fresh, grounded approach to known stories, in this case the younger characters are more modern and seem to deal with 21st century issues. The superpowers are explained by science much like other superhero films but in a way that seems like it could quite possibly happen in the news today. It sounds silly to say that it doesn't feel far-fetched by the atmosphere that engaged me leading me into a reality that made it seem possible.\n\nUsing a body horror angle to introduce the characters' powers was a breath of fresh, cool air. To show these characters as real people would behave was something new that I felt needed to be done to refresh the superhero genre. Some effects seemed a little gimmicky but only after a friend pointed it out to me. I think they could've actually taken the whole story in this direction (as the horror was only hinted at and quickly brushed aside) however they chose to skip ahead and get to the action.\n\nNot a lot of people enjoyed the pace of the film, they complained about the lack of action and the slow-burning build that seemed to drag. I however, loved the detail that went into the set-up for these characters as I'm not easily engaged by constant action. And as a reboot, it seemed important and such a good opportunity to flesh out a completely new origin. I think people wanted to see more of the superheroes and didn't care much for the people behind them. Despite this, the characters personalities' were quite one-dimensional which explains why the first 2 acts fell short for a lot of people.\n\nThis leads to an issue with the third act, which for the length of the film, seems like an after-thought. In my mind, they could've gone two ways. First, they could've given more running time to allow for a better built-up, fleshed out and authentic action sequence that threaded better into the story rather than choosing a dark and brooding character to suddenly just go, 'you know what? Fuck Earth.' Or, they should've made the final act about what their new bodies would mean for their place in society i.e. make the antagonist the military/government that tries to take their freedom (crudely described; apologies). THEN we could introduce Doctor Doom in the sequel. Get where I'm going?\n\nBut alas, this was not the case and therefore this was far from a perfect film. However, I still enjoyed it as a whole based on the sum of it's good parts.",

The 1st half of the film truly felt complete. It's the other half that was a total mess and where it all falls apart. That was also the major problem the film can be dissected by its two acts and quite apparent missing a middle act. Rumors of studio meddling points to this disjointed mess of movie that  could have been otherwise a good picture. Cutting the budget, taking away three major action sequences and took over final cut of the film. Josh Trank is a talented director anyone who has seen Chronicle would know this to be true.

            "content": "Lleg√≥ la hora de hablar del elefante en la habitaci√≥n. La cuarta vez es la vencida, pens√≥ 20th Century Fox. Ser√° divertido, dijeron...\n\nEn 1994 se realiz√≥ una versi√≥n de los 4 Fant√°sticos con el s√≥lo prop√≥sito de mantener los derechos. Con un presupuesto de $1.5 millones, el film se convirti√≥ en una olvidada pel√≠cula de culto, una mala pel√≠cula de culto. Luego de que Fox adquiriera los derechos, en 2005 se estren√≥ el film con Ioan Gruffud, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis y el ahora Capit√°n Am√©rica Chris Evans. Si bien el film familiar no fue bien recibido por la cr√≠tica, s√≠ fue rentable en la taquilla, y origin√≥ una secuela. La segunda parte de 2007 confirm√≥ la mediocridad de la franquicia de ese entonces y la saga se detuvo ah√≠. Hasta que a√±os m√°s tarde 20th Century Fox reclut√≥ a Josh Trank, quien ven√≠a saliendo de la aclamada Poder sin L√≠mites, para realizar una nueva versi√≥n para estrenarse en 2015. La producci√≥n tuvo algunos nombres reconocibles de la franquicia X-Men, lo que revelaba la intenci√≥n de unir las dos propiedades en el futuro cercano. Muy distinta ser√≠a la realidad.\n\nEl asunto aqu√≠ es que la producci√≥n de este film estuvo plagada de controversia, la cual se tradujo en una tonelada de prensa negativa antes del estreno. El resumen de lo que supuestamente pas√≥ va as√≠. Se rumorea que el comportamiento del director Josh Trank fue err√°tico y conflictivo con el resto del equipo durante la pre-producci√≥n, comportamiento social del que ya se sab√≠a desde antes. De hecho, se dice que √©sta es la raz√≥n por la cual fue \"despedido\" del proyecto de Star Wars al que estaba unido. Luego, el estudio decidi√≥ retirar del film 3 escenas de acci√≥n importantes antes de comenzar la fotograf√≠a principal. Esto ya caus√≥ que el trabajo del talentoso pero complicado realizador se viera restringido por el estudio. Despu√©s de que el director terminara su trabajo con la filmaci√≥n del film, los cuatro actores principales fueron llamados por el estudio para volver a filmar escenas, algunas de estas agregadas apresuradamente en el gui√≥n, ocasionando problemas de calendarizaci√≥n con otros proyectos. Luego de eso, Trank fue pr√°cticamente echado de la sala de post-producci√≥n y edici√≥n, dejando a otros realizadores (incluyendo al supervisor de efectos especiales) designados por Fox para terminar el film. Esta versi√≥n final del largometraje no qued√≥ para nada bien hecha, por lo que el estudio tom√≥ la decisi√≥n de \"esconder\" el film del p√∫blico. No se realizaron pases de prensa ni proyecciones para cr√≠ticos hasta 24 horas antes del estreno y el embargo de cr√≠ticas se levant√≥ 12 horas antes, ambas grandes advertencias de que algo no andaba bien. Finalmente, la guinda de la torta la puso el mismo Trank al twittear unas horas antes del estreno que \"esa no era su pel√≠cula y que hac√≠a un a√±o el ten√≠a una versi√≥n muy diferente que lamentablemente nunca podr√≠amos ver\". Se estima que el tweet le cost√≥ a la pel√≠cula unos $15 a $20 millones en su fin de semana de estreno. \n\nComo era de esperarse, la pel√≠cula se estren√≥ y lamentablemente su recepci√≥n en la cr√≠tica y en la taquilla fue un desastre. Toda la pol√©mica alrededor del film se traslad√≥ a la audiencia de una forma incre√≠blemente negativa. Ir√© un poco m√°s lejos y dir√© que se exager√≥ un poco, incluso. La explicaci√≥n de mi opini√≥n la dar√© ahora en la cr√≠tica.\n\nEl film inicia mostr√°ndonos el nacimiento de la amistad entre Reed Richards (Teller) y Ben Grimm (Bell) cuando eran ni√±os. Ambos pasan a√±os desarrollando el viaje interdimensional hasta que llegan a la secundaria y son reclutados por el Doctor Franklin Storm (Cathey) y su hija Sue (Mara). Cuando el trabajo comienza a ser prometedor, Storm incluye tambi√©n a Victor Von Doom (Kebbell) y a su hijo Johnny (Jordan) en el proyecto. Una vez que la m√°quina est√° lista, los chicos deciden ir por su cuenta a la otra dimensi√≥n, y cuando algo sale mal, todos son heridos de gravedad con distintas propiedades del mundo desconocido.\n\nLos dos primeros actos del film son realmente... ¬°buenos! Desde el inicio la pel√≠cula establece una base s√≥lida, con direcci√≥n y un tono y ritmo consistente. \"Lo que cuenta es la intenci√≥n\", dice el dicho y la intenci√≥n de Trank es muy buena al llevar a la familia de superh√©roes a sus ra√≠ces: la ciencia ficci√≥n. El enfoque inicial del film era muy asertivo en esencia, toma a los personajes principales y los envuelve en el g√©nero con ligeros tintes de terror y misterio en el campo del viaje a trav√©s de dimensiones.\nLos personajes son presentados y la qu√≠mica est√° ah√≠, el talento est√° ah√≠. De alguna forma funciona como piezas de un puzzle. La narrativa fluye con naturalidad y las relaciones de los personajes tienen sentido y sirven al desarrollo de la trama. El film se siente como la preparaci√≥n para algo m√°s grande que sigue adelante.\n\nLamentablemente, el film es s√≥lo preparaci√≥n para algo que nunca llega. Desde el momento en que la pantalla se oscurece y aparecen las palabras \"un a√±o despu√©s\", el film se empieza a derrumbar lentamente. Saltamos r√°pidamente desde el momento en que los protagonistas reciben violentamente sus \"poderes\", caracter√≠sticas que los presentan como fen√≥menos inicialmente, a un ambiente en que ya los manejan con maestr√≠a y los utilizan para distintos prop√≥sitos. Reed est√° fugitivo buscando soluciones por cuenta propia, Ben realiza misiones para el ej√©rcito, Johnny est√° en preparaci√≥n para seguir el camino de Ben y Sue se niega a formar parte de ning√∫n proyecto. Victor, por otra parte, qued√≥ atrapado en la otra dimensi√≥n.\nLa segunda vez que exploramos dicha dimensi√≥n, Victor es rescatado del lugar y llevado de vuelta a la tierra, donde es puesto bajo observaci√≥n. El look del villano funciona de forma efectiva y con geniales efectos visuales, aunque sus poderes no tengan tanto sentido. Naturalmente, el ahora denominado Doom escapa y s√≥lo los 4 fant√°sticos pueden detenerlo. Su plan es que su dimensi√≥n, \"su mundo\" como lo llama Doom, consuma a la tierra, y en lo que es la √öNICA escena de acci√≥n del film los h√©roes toman la tarea de evitarlo.\nInconsistencia, desorden, mala edici√≥n y desiguales efectos especiales es lo que domina el cl√≠max en la culminaci√≥n de un plano y decepcionante tercer acto.\n\nTomando en cuenta la pel√≠cula como un todo, el resultado no es tan malo. S√≠, no es nivel Caballero de la Noche, pero tampoco es nivel Linterna Verde. La pel√≠cula es s√≥lida pero baja su calidad dram√°ticamente en el final. Eso no es el fin del mundo. Estamos frente a un proyecto que puede ser mejorado f√°cilmente con una secuela. Lamentablemente, debido al ambiente que rode√≥ al film, es probable que no suceda y no volvamos a escuchar de la familia superher√≥ica por mucho tiempo...",

            "content": "This film was very poor from the beginning. It was trying so hard to get the younger crowd more interested in seeing the film by hiring young and popular actors. The plot had holes as well, I mean it just pulled in a nerdy kid who has little experience working in a professional filed, to build  giant teleprter. Then they pretend they need him after he finishes the job, succeeds in getting to the new planet, and then leaves his friends to escape the governments control. All his research was probably closely documented, not to mention his 3 partners who helped in the teleporter's success and are there to help build it! Then the actors were so young that I really hated the affliction given when delivering lines. Like the world is about to end, everyone you love is going to die, and your partner Victor is the cause; and you're telling me your going to SPEAK NOT YELL \"Victor don't.\" Really? I don't feel like you could even act calm in that type of situation. Then the line \"I'm a adult, dad!\"  This line was delivered very oddly.I would expect either a low and cool delivery or a very loud angry, almost teen way, of delivery. Instead the delivery was a combination of both like the actor could not make up his mind on how to deliver the line. Both the characters Ben and Johnny felt very neglected in the movie as well. The enemy was too over powered and could not have been beat. The fantastic 4 suddenly stop breathing oxygen for the boss fight. Not enough energy after the death of Johnny and  Sue's dad's death. I mean he helped all but Ben through the movie and I feel like a lot of anger and energy would have been released at such a time.  (Johnny did at least show a bit of anger seconds after his father was struck). Reed was just awful. Never really liked the character any way, but with the poor delivery of lines and the character being portrayed in a very fake and, at times, as the actor himself way I just could not believe that reeve was a three dimensional person like we all are. I mean where was the inner thoughts and depth. Sue did have depth but she also got neglected in some parts and just could not carry the other actors with her.The older actors in this move were well seasoned and just very unfortunate enough to be in this film. At times I felt that the actors forced the young actors to actually feel and be in the scenes.The ending sucked not only because of the plot holes and overpowered villain, but because the young actors had to actually carry a scene out by themselves. I admit that being on set with a green screen, no props, and looking up at a, probably, really nice coworker while tying to be in character is hard, but its your job! Like you get paid to act, so do it right! Use your imagination and touch on feelings. Don't be afraid to show your emotions. There was just too much \"trying to be cool\" going on. The fact that your still young in the movie means you should be showing even more emotion. You haven't had the years to learn how to completely control your emotions and keep cool. In fact I don't think a single person could be in such control at the end of the world. Where is the director! You couldn't tell the actors this?!? Did you not care that they totally forgot how to act? Did you even try to re-film the acting? The only thing that got this in theaters was the fact it marvel, has action, and the graphics were professional. Besides that it sucked.",

You people must stop deciding whether the film is bad based on its look even before seeing it or not completely seeing it at all. The reason probably again for this failure is its marketing and the lack of story and creativity. It doesn't feel very much a superhero film instead it's more of a sci-fi film. The running time is only 100 minutes but it deserves 200 or even 300 minutes to be exact, there's no payoff or setup to get here. The characters are younger this time and to be sure this time, they were accidentally given powers, kinda like the 2005 film right only to be set not in space but in a Mars look a like place? There's no tension or a villain wants to rule the world storyline here rather than these characters want to reverse their powers back to normal. And what's this, they don't feel being heroes at all? Come on you guys have to serious on this one. So again, I think it's watchable but really upsetting when it ends not because we want more but we wasted spending time on nothing that matters so much on this film or any other superhero film at all.",

I'm even aware of how Trank bailed at the last moment and I am definitely aware that the last 20 minutes of the movie needed more work.

Sure. But its a good movie. Bear in mind, I'm not implying that its the best that Fox Studios has to offer but its still better than all the crap I have suffered through this year that made more money. I understand how you'd think that this thought has no basis of merit but I disagree. Hear me out. Lets assume you enjoyed a movie that everyone else hated on but you kept your silence as you are aware that every movie is subjective, but then suddenly, using the mass consensus as a weapon, everyone dog piles on a movie that you didn't really mind, and you end up getting a bit underwhelmed with the overall response as you liked a movie that everyone else didn't enjoy. And It all just seems like an immature joke that you had a great time with but the others around you didn't really understand or may be even unimpressed by it, which leaves you poking everyone with your elbow saying \"huh, huh?\"\n\nWell I'm stuck in that category. I am one of those 3 guys that liked that bomb of a bollywood movie called Gunday and faced a similar heat when everyone criticized it based on what they heard rather than what the movie made you experience (despite the flaws), and I'd like to keep F4 on the same platform - As an underrated and severely hated on movie that hopefully, in the future, be considered as, at best, an average movie that we are strong armed to concede with as an \"OK movie that history remembered, when it could've easily be forgotten\"\n\nP.S.

The first 90 minutes of the film was basically a more CGI and unrealistic version of the first 15 minutes of the Fantastic Four from the early 2000s. The plot was non-existent since you had to wait 90 minutes to get to what the plot should have been: Dr. Doom vs. Fantastic Four and it only lasted 5 minutes. Then add in the awful casting. At least in the previous Fantastic Four films it was more believable that Mr. Fantastic would be one of the smartest people in the world.

            "content": "Fantastic Four is a very dark movie. I mean, really dark. I mean dark, as in, somebody please flip some lights on. That's not a joke; every scene in this movie is so under-lit that you feel like your wearing sunglasses indoors. Every outdoor scene feel you're attending a vampire funeral. It is a funerary tone is unfortunately appropriate because this is a joyless, dead serious movie that rings all of the energy out of something that should be bouncy and fun.\n\nThis is the fourth failed movie rendition of this property and the fourth time that Hollywood has shown that it doesn't have a clue how to do it right. Roger Corman's legendary 1994 action-comedy was so infamous that it never got released. The 2005 Fantastic Four movie and its sequel Rise of the Silver Surfer, were colorful but featherbrained and forgettable. Yet, they were modern masterpieces compared to director Josh Trank's current modernization, a movie so joyless that makes the last hour of Revenge of the Sith feel like Christmas morning.\n\nAt the beginning of the new Fantastic Four - or as the poster calls it, 'Fant-4-stic' - we meet 10 year-old Reed Richards (Owen Judge) who is working on a matter transfer machine.  He becomes friends with young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann) whose family owns a junkyard and has the parts that Reed needs. They become friends and grow up working together on the project, but years later at their high school science fair, their teacher (Dan Castelanetta) dismisses their amazing discovery as \"a magic show.\"\n\nThe government is more interested in their discovery and gives them access to work on it - along with Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and a broody drop-out named Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) who is said to be from Latvaria, but has an accent that is true-blue America. The team is given access to The Least Secure Government Research Facility on the Face of the Earth. Seriously, they can go anywhere, do anything, and send out photos of themselves to their buddies without any restrictions what-so-ever.\n\nThe first test of the matter-transfer machine with a chimp is successful, but Reed (played as an adult by Miles Teller) thinks that he and his team would be perfect for the first human test. The project overseer (Tim Blake Nelson) wants to bring in astronauts, but Reed is undaunted and wants to try it out himself. After hours, he gathers the team for an unauthorized test, but things go wrong and they, of course, find themselves with magical powers. Reed can stretch. Johnny becomes a human torch. Ben turns into a walking, talking chunk of rocks. And, for no reason at all, Sue gets the power to turn invisible, which is a head-scratcher because she didn't go on the mission at all - she was at the lab computer, so okay.\n\nThe introduction of these elements make up the movie's first hour. We are laboriously introduced to every single character. Then after the accident, we are laboriously introduced to all of their superpowers. By the time the introductions are over, we have time for a ten minute action scene before the movie abruptly ends. The worse section of the movie are the discovery of the powers. What should be a moment of joy and discovery is a long, sad series of 'what-have-you-done-to-me' scenes that have the same tone as if someone's dog just died.\n\nThe idea here should yield a movie that is as joyful and fun as last year's Guardians of the Galaxy. Quite the opposite. This is a grim, mean-spirited and broody movie. Instead of a fantasy, we get the approximation of how these events might play out in real life. That's exactly the wrong approach. The characters spend much of the time getting to know each other that you feel like you're watching the pilot to a TV series.\n\nThe comic books, as I remember them, were colorful and fun. The team felt like a cohesive family unit whose chief quirk is that their differing personalities meant that they were always playfully squabbling with one another - like a family. Here they seem to have been pulled together from central casting. The actors do what they can, but never at any time are they required to give us any sense of joy or wonderment. What was the thinking here? Why make a summer action movie this gloomy and oppressive? Why spend 90% of the movie on introductions? Why set the entire movie in a lab? Why give it such a mean-spirited tone? Fans of the movie won't recognize the characters.  Non-fans will be repelled by the movie's repellant atmosphere.  Who was this movie made for?\n\nNOTE: There are no credit cookies, midway or at the end.  Which is okay, because the less time spent with this mess, the better.",

The movies first and second acts are relatively unoffensive. While not exactly exciting or even fun to watch, it would have been just average enough to make this movie OK. I started to get worried when, 45 minutes into the movie, it seemed that nothing relevant  had happened in the plot yet. The heroes still hadn't gotten their powers, there had been no big action set-pieces we come to expect at this point, and none of the characters had developed in a way to make me feel any emotional connection towards them. Then the film begins to fall apart at a baffling pace, as the words \"ONE YEAR LATER\" appear on the screen right in the middle of the second act. What follows is a few poorly edited, short and boring action sequences that look like they were ripped directly out of a sci-fi channel original movie. Then the bad guy shows up and decides to destroy the world for absolutely no reason at all, the boring heroes fight him in one of the worst third acts I've ever seen in a movie, and then it just ends with some of the most painful to listen to dialogue I've ever heard in a movie my entire life.

Marvel has done a wonderful job and set the bar high.  I'm sure that hurt the reaction here some. I enjoyed the story. It was good enough for a reboot. I thought the acting was fine. SFX was good as well. I liked how the relationship between Reed & Ben was fleshed out.  It did seem that 3/4 of the film was devoted to the origin.  That seems like a lot more than the other superhero films that deal with origins.  I suspect that hurt reviews too. After the 4 find themselves capable of using their powers, it seems like the film has less superhero action than other films and the climatic battle is rather straight forward and relatively short.

The special effect are pretty good and the acting is as good as any other movie in this genre. And it's fun to see familiar actors from a bunch of other recent movies.

Yes, Trank was a good choice at first, but the more reports came in of Trank's behaviour on set, and after Kate Mara (Susan Storm/The Invisible Woman) was told not to read the comics, and Trank was allegedly turning up to set drunk, and shutting himself off from society, the movie was immediatley doomed.\n\nThe Second thing they screwed up with the film was the characters. None of these characters projected the original wit and fun of the comic book heroes. Even though the actors (Mostly Teller as Reed Richards, Mara as Sue Storm, Bell as Ben Grimm and B. Jordan as Johnny Storm though) tried to save the film, no-one could really help the fact that the script was witless, and the characters were pointless. The main disappointment in this aspect of the film however is the plain lazyness and downright insulting way the villian - Viktor Von Doom/Doctor Doom was written. Instead of being an evil egomaniac bent on revenge towards his former friends, he becomes a stupid, video game playing nerd, who has a slight crush on Sue, and is angry cause he got... um... burnt a bit? \n\nThe Last and most important part of this film that they screwed up, was the pacing. I timed the film, and 45 minutes into the film, and it's an hour and a half long film, 45 minutes in, they return from Planet Zero, with their powers. Then the credits are about 7 minutes long, so you minus 7 from around 45 minutes, brings you to around 38 minutes. They have their powers in this film for 38 minutes, minus the time it takes them to do the most expositioney piece of writing of all time to explain their power which is about 5 minutes, so that brings us to 33 minutes of them having their powers. And to make matters worse Doctor Doom returns as the villian for the final fight, 15 minutes before the film ends. And 5 of those minutes, is the final fight, Doctor Doom is expositioned for 10 minutes, and in those minutes: He kills about 30 people by exploding their heads, with... his mind? I guess. Reed and Ben talk. Johnny accidentally attacks Sue. Doctor Doom kills Sue and Johnny's father. The World starts to get sucked up into a black hole. \nHang on while we're on the subject of the final fight and that god damn wormhole piece of crap, lets focus souley on that. So Doctor Doom was trapped on Planet Zero for a year now, and somehow found a hoodie cloak (no seriously where'd he get that?) and when he comes back, hes already figured out how to blow up people's heads or suck the life out of them or something, and create a freaking Black Hole? Yeah sure, it looked cool. But it was a piece of shit. I mean come on, Doom created a freaking Black Hole with his mind, and then, um, what was his plan after that? What was he supposed to try and do? What was his goal in life? WHY DID DOCTOR DOOM EXIST!!!\n\nIf this was a film about a group of kids getting superpowers, and trying to learn how to deal with them, and then one (Viktor) goes rogue and they team up to stop him. It would've been great, it may have even been one of the best superhero films of all time. It had potential, but FANT4STIC is a clear defintion that Superhero films can still suck balls",

            "content": "Once excited about the notion of a new big-budget Fantastic Four movie that featured the presence of Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan, I ended up watching it when I heard neverending critical scorn and so I had to learn precisely what rendered it to terrible.\n \nFaster than Johnny Storm can fly, audiences will realize that The Fantastic Four is anything but fantastic. Before the story can actively allow audiences to get a sense of the situation, it already hurls its characters into an overdriven pace. A good superhero movie knows how to pace itself appropriately. If it is going to be commercial and blockbuster-oriented, then it needs to be fast and action packed. If it is intending to be a really atmospheric piece, it has to sensibly moderate character building with spectacle. With Fantastic Four, there is no sensibility in the pacing.  \nThe fact that the story gives no time before it throws viewers into a point in Reed Richards' life where he is a child who speaks of exceeding interest in scientific discovery before being shot down by his teacher is not just cliche, but it makes no sense whatsoever. To characterize him as a child prodigy is one thing, but to turn him into a paper-thin cartoon character building a teleporter in his garage after failing to \"build a flying car\" is a new level of juvenile. The film has not even given audiences two minutes before it is already doing this. One of the first lines in the film is \"When I grow up, I want to be the first person in human history to teleport himself\". That should tell you how instantly the film just throws plot dynamics at viewers. And the decision to make the line \"It's clobberin' time!\" a line used by Ben Grimm's older brother upon attacking him is just a massive slap in the face for fans of the comic book series and people with any sense of intellect anywhere in the world watching this film. \nBefore the film reaches ten minutes, Reed Richards and Ben Grimm have created an advanced teleporter as teenagers, been disqualified from the Science Fair by the voice of Homer Simpson and then given a scholarship. It all goes by in a senseless rush, and yet this is misleading because straight after than the pace takes a sudden drop. From there, there is more than half an hour of characters just building a teleporter and discussing unappealing scientific jargon and tedious character subplots which have a real lack of practical drama. The characters don't actually gain their powers until halfway through, and by that point many viewers will have stopped caring anyway. Alas, I decided that despite my pessimism I would soldier on.\nAfter they get their powers, there is suddenly a massive ellipsis which jumps significantly ahead in time, and we see the characters have learned to use their powers through very brief clips of footage. The story points out that they are being utilized as tools of the military, and this brief segment shows impressive visual effects to boot. For a $120 million film I would expect nothing but the finest visual effects, and the film does boast some top notch CGI, particularly in the design of The Thing whose detailed stone shell, stature and movements are all very effective. The Thing gains special props for being so much more convincing than the cheesy prosthetic worn by Michael Chiklis in the Tim Story films. And yet, the quality of the visual effects just makes the experience of the film so much more disappointing when Josh Trank can't find anything to do with them. Despite the production values of the film, the $120 million production that is Fantastic Four would rather rush through a story plagued by too much talking and too little action. The action scenes are the best moments in the film because the combat the characters engage in proves entertaining, but there is never slightly close to enough of it. The film reverts back to talking very fast, and even though the titular team are now working with the military, they are put to no use. After an extremely brief moment where audiences see that Mr. Fantastic can be put to use with an effective use of his powers in the action, the film reverts back to its meandering path of tedious character conflict. The action is kind of thing audiences are going to actually want to see, and the fact that nobody bothers to acknowledge that really weighs down on the experience even further. The best scene in the film is its final action climax, though this has nothing to do with the narrative. The action climax is extremely brief, bereft of any genuine feeling and just an example of wasted funds values on a film which could have donated its funds to far superior material trying to enter production as we speak. And in the blink of an eye, it's over, as is the entire film. The feeling I was left with was worse than when I experienced Gavin Hood's adaptation of Ender's Game. Ender's Game used a misleading narrative to leave the viewer feeling like they were waiting for an action climax only to be told they had already experienced it. That pissed me off. And yet, Fantastic Four offered a different way to achieve the same result. The film is a mere 100 minutes long and spends the time dashing through many plot points while dragging on for others, rendering the already-thin narrative one which just collapses in on itself. And as a result, the story goes nowhere. So when the film reaches its sudden climax, it feels like the story is simply at a midpoint where it is suddenly turning everything around with a conventional burst of action. In actual fact, this is the end point in the movie, meaning that Fantastic Four ends just before the point in time that most films would call their halfway point. It's incomprehensible to the point that it's hard to describe, but it's the kind of feeling I've never really had before. It's one I never wanted to have, so I would advise you not to watch the film to experience it.\nFrankly, what's ridiculous is just how Fantastic Four manages to be both similar and different to the 2005 rendition and still mess up both parts. The lack of action is the same mistake made by Tim Story with his first Fantastic For movie, and I just don't get how a film with a $120 million budget ends up so lifeless and short on action. I mean, where else is there for the money to go? It's certainly not into the screenplay because the writing is pathetic. The saying \"talk is cheap\" applies here because the dialogue has no dramatic heft to it, nor does it put any interesting characterisation into those being depicted. As it is, the film's intro gives a cheesy characterisation to Reed Richards and Ben Grimm before audiences are left with subpar glimpses into the lives of Sue and Johnny Storm. The former is especially strange as it conflicts with the grim and serious tone of the rest of the film. Unlike the 2005 film, Fantastic Four really takes itself seriously as a legitimate character piece even though it clearly has no idea what the concept of \"character\" actually is. This doesn't help the cast because they are forced to play figures that are too young to maintain fidelity to the source material. Even though they are clearly talented actors, it is clear that with everything else in the film working against it. There is no saving Fantastic Four or even the cast, but they do prove to take a stand for their own credibility.\nMiles Teller delivers a somewhat charismatic performance as Reed Richards. He is instinctively able to capture the appropriate mindset for the character because his tone of voice ensures that the way he delivers the scientific-related dialogue in the film feels really natural to the character. Miles Teller is easily able to convey the intelligent nature of the character, but he also makes a decent impression during the action. What little action he is assigned proves to be something he works with as he picks a convincing punch in the face of either the military or Doctor Doom. He does it during a short period of screen time which is an effective boost for his credibility. And though there is no room for development or genuine emotion in the part, Miles Teller does what he can within such boundaries and delivers a solid effort.\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about Kate Mara. Condemned to having the most melodramatic character in the story, Kate Mara is doomed from the start because she is constrained by blatant repetition. There is little appeal in her, and her chemistry with Miles Teller has no flair. While Jessica Alba was a terrible Sue Storm, at least she was sexualised to a point where she had some sense of value. With Kate Mara, the writers respect her enough not to condemn her to playing a one-dimensional sex object but not enough to give her a genuine character to work with. Kata Mara's legitimate talents as an actress are not valued enough in Fantastic Four and she has little to offer in terms of gimmicks so she is simply a boring presence.\nMichael B. Jordan also delivers a decent effort, though the character he is served with is pathetic. I have little concern with the race of Michael B. Jordan in casting, but it is unfaithfulness to the source material and changes Johnny Storm from being Sue Storm's biological brother. Now, she is his adopted sister and so the relationship changes. There is not even an attempt to characterize any kind of familial bond between them. And at the same time, the sense of comic energy that made Johnny Storm the one good thing about the 2005 Fantastic Four film is diverted into mild elements of African-American stereotyping for the sake of humour. It is too restrained to lay down any effect and too wrong for the character to do anything but cause viewers to question the film even more. But still, what's obvious is that Michael B. Jordan is a strong actor because he makes the attitude of Johnny Storm feel genuine while making a naturally likeable character out of the part. Also, when the visual effects set him ablaze, he really embraces the nature of his superpowers and flies with determination to throw fire in the face of adversity. Michael B. Jordan's natural charisma transcends the blank slate he is thrust upon in his portrayal, and so he has mild appeal despite being far from a true Johnny Storm.\nAnd Jamie Bell follows the same meandering path as he bears little resemblance to either Ben Grimm or especially The Thing. The man is the actor from Billy Elliot playing an overtly masculine figure of stone, failing to capture any sense of brute physical strength in the part. And also, his voice is clearly mismatched for taking on The Thing because it lacks the dank level of booming brute strength to be capable of delivering the iconic line \"It's Clobberin' Time\" with any sense of actual power behind it. Jamie Bell hides behind visual effects for most of the film, but whether he is on screen or merely voicing a CGI creation, he makes no such impact.\nToby Kebbell also proves to deliver a lifeless and shallow effort.\n\nSo though Fantastic Four has some of the right cast and visual effects, they are used exceedingly minimally while playing second fiddle to a pathetically written and incompetently paced excuse for a story.",

First off, the origin is not canon along with the PC BS regarding a (black?) Johnny Storm. I found out that the film had several reshot scenes and a bunch of deleted footage. As a result, some of what you see in the trailer is not in the film. The result is a disjointed mess with no perceivable cohesion, no developable sympathy for the characters and when you add (once more) a lightweight Thing with no shorts (haha... no that isn't laughter...it is head shaking sarcasm), it is a waste of money.

Josh Trank was on his way to a promising career after his sleeper hit, Chronicle shocked the world, but after many issues on-set, the film undergoing massive re-shoots, and the studio intervening and eventually taking over production, I'm quickly reminded of what happened to David Fincher on Alien3. The cast were all capable and I was very excited about Miles Teller as Reed Richards, but none of them seem to want to be there, they have no chemistry, and there's hardly any scenes with all four of them in it working together. There are some good moments in here like the body-horror angle they took to introduce their powers, the special effects are updated (most notably on The Human Torch), and Doctor Doom's rampage near the end played out more like a slasher film with a level of violence unsuitable for a PG superhero film! That is all I enjoyed however and there are too many problems to list but I will detail the major ones: the script is terrible and was re-written so many times it is an absolute mess, there is almost no action scenes with the climactic battle lasting about five minutes, nearly the entire film takes place in three settings and was pretty much shot on a sound-stage, the movie spends no time showing us how the heroes adapt to their powers and instead makes the critical error of jumping forward a year in advance to where they're already being militarized, and there is laughable continuity issues between the re-shoots with Sue Storm's hair changing style and colour *face-palm*. It is astonishing that a film this bad can still be made in 2015, especially one part of the 100% profitable superhero craze, but the evidence of inexperience, studio meddling, and lack of inspiration is all over this \"film\" that's only reason for existence was to hold onto the film rights....because that worked SO WELL with The Amazing Spider-Man.",

Then it turns to buisness as usual, stop the bad guy/save the world, you know the whole spiel. But this is a refreshing superhero movie and unlike so many misguided post Dask Knight comic book movies this one attempts to not simply make everything more dark and broody than it should be, it dose what these films should now be trying, to make a proper genre movie out of a superhero concept, and it dose it so very well for a long time, sure it falls apart a bit and has some truly terrible effects here and there, but i think this is one of the most interesting films of it's kind in quite a while.

Fantastic Four was never a dark gritty comic. Where is the funny banter from Johnny Storm? ( also semi spoilers ahead but does it really matter ? haha ) √É,√Ç¬†This movie is just dark and stupid. Slow paced, dark tones , boring characters , not like the comics at all. Its like someone briefly told the director what Fantastic Four is and he was like √É¬¢ alright cool like me go dark and do what i want. √É¬¢ Also the fact that Johnnys suit lets him √É¬¢ flame on √É¬¢ like really? Nah he can control his own flames not some suit letting him turn it on and off like dah heck is that? Also after Sue gets his powers BOOM her hair is more blonde? lol really? so stupid. Then after they get out or √É¬¢ working with the military √É¬¢ they go on a witch hunt for Reed. And this is at 1 hour mark. Yes it took them 50 mins just for them to get their powers aka get back from the other planet and then roughly 12 mins to be like √É¬¢ oh hey we can use them for the military and oh reed is running around dodging us √É¬¢. Let me remind you that this movie is 1 hour and 32 mins long. So you waste 50 mins just for them to get their powers. You know how long the 2005 version took them to get their powers ? like 24 mins give or take. Also we get one √É¬¢ fight scene √É¬¢ with Reed that lasts like maybe 30 secs? Around this time Im very bored and just wanna turn it off. After this its abunch of boring nothingness for like 15 mins. In those 15 mins like 2 mins is getting Doom back. Then we have an interesting Doom blowing some guys head up. And then we just have Doom doing it to abunch of people lol. Like I said before this movie is really dark. like Idk if im actually watching a Fantastic Four movie. Mostly everything in the trailer is at the end of the movie. Then the last 10 mins is Doom trying to get √É¬¢ revenge √É¬¢ and trying to blow up the earth. Doom looks stupid. They go to √É¬¢ Planet zero √É¬¢ To stop him. Not one funny or whitty line from Johnny. Boringest √É¬¢ fight scene √É¬¢ ever. Like did they really think this was a good movie? One of the worst Comic book movies I have seen in a really long time.

            "content": "Neither Fantastic nor Four-star, the latest comic book movie reboot to hit cinema screens sometimes makes for interesting viewing, but ultimately lacks the X-factor or Avengers initiative necessary to make it out-and-out Marvel-ous. Like Batman Begins, this re-do tries anchoring the particulars of the Fantastic Four's origin tale in reality. The problem is: The particulars of this specific comic book title simply prove too fantastical to present as believable. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight saga involves a rich, psychologically-scarred vigilante with no super powers, but this much different hero property involves a human Stretch Armstrong, a man made of rock, a racer who spontaneously bursts into flame and an invisible woman. No amount of taking a naturalistic approach is going to convince popcorn-munching moviegoers that a computer programmer gets sub-atomic powers from the fourth dimension or that somebody actually names their kid \"Victor Von Doom.\" Worse, an inordinate amount of time gets spent laying this groundwork to make the mechanics behind the titular foursome seem plausible. Unfortunately, this doesn't amount to a great deal of entertainment value in the long run ... and it definitely feels like a long run. For a movie so interested in plausibility, however, the last act reeks of blockbuster schlock. From predictable deaths to shoehorning in superhero catchphrases to the big bad confrontation, it follows some familiar gamma rays down a rote rabbit hole. Worse, it nearly negates the interesting build-up that precedes it. Why flirt with realism at the outset if you're just going to turn cornball near the end? Marvel Studios exhibits a genius knack for straddling the comic-al and true blue spectrums in their projects, tongue always in cheek. Fantastic Four just goes from one extreme to the other in what's more of a flame-out than flame-on. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated adaptation of the classic Marvel comic book, four young scientists (Teller, Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell) achieve superhuman abilities through a teleportation experiment gone haywire and return to a world in need of their new-found abilities. \n\nThough the director usually goes down with the ship, Josh Trank (who already made a believable, albeit dark, superhero tale with Chronicle) at least takes a interesting approach. He spends ample time with these characters and high falutin' ideas, which makes the third act's descent into cheese seem more like studio tinkering than his own temporary lapse of reason. Moviegoers deserve to see his complete vision, especially considering the spot-on performances that result from his ace casting. Considering the believability factor of the first act, it won't be superb but it will doubtlessly not silver surf into complete oblivion like this fantastic mess.\n\nBottom line: It's Blubbering Time",

I constantly kept checking my watch even though the movie is less than 2 hours. The sets are boring only being a concrete military base and a desolate rocky planet, but this can be forgiven if the film had interesting characters, but sadly it does not. The Fantastic Four are suppose to be not only a team but a family as well; they joke with one another, discus things, and work as a team, the don't do any of that in the film, well except maybe for the last part but that was only because they have to. There's not even a brother/sister dynamic in the film and that would've been interesting but they barley even bring it up. Our \"heroes\" aren't the only one this movie messed up either, they make Doctor Doom such a waste of potential. You finally have the chance to give us, at least, a decant Doom, but his character just feels rush and isn't at all an interesting character, and it's a shame, since Toby Kebbell gave us an incredible movie villain last year as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Doom is also one of the worst looking character I've seen in a superhero film, right up their with bat nipples, and Halle Berry Catwoman. Fantastic Four might be one of the worst superhero films I've ever seen, and it pains me to think that now the 2005 movie will now be known as the good Fantastic Four; Fox should just give up, and hand the rights over to Marvel.",

Fox's decision to re-write his script caused a $10,000 hotel room temper tantrum and created a very poor work environment for everyone involved with the film.  The end result isn't as horrible as everyone says it is, but it still deviates from the expected stellar quality Marvel norm.  It begins very promising, but keeps the viewer locked inside a interesting introduction right up until the last twenty minutes.  Kind of like if SPIDERMAN spent half the movie turning into Spiderman then learned about his powers (off-screen) in containment.  It's not very much fun when the government has control before the superheroes have a chance to play with their abilities on their own.  Instead of it actually being about The Fantastic Four, it's mostly about the pros and cons of creating a portal to another dimension.  One villain is predictably fought at the end of the movie with humdrum spacey special effects.  Actions scenes need to be within public locations and have must normal people being subjected to all the chaos.  Watching characters fight on another planet surrounded by empty space and rocks creates more of a cartoon experience rather than something relatable.  Overall, this one rides the line that separates a great Straight-To-DVD movie from a bad theatrical release.",

It's also worthy to note that this is the worst attempt yet. This movie is boring, stale, depressing, unfunny, and to sum it up: Awful. This movie probably has the most horrible pacing I have ever seen in a movie ever. The movie spends FIFTY FREAKING MINUTES setting up the characters, then DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM AFTER THEY HAVE POWERS. The first half is mildly enjoyable while watching it, but after watching the full movie, it makes you realize how much of your valuable time the first half of this movie wasted. The second half may as well go down as one of the worst acts of a superhero film ever, alongside X-Men Origins: Wolverine's third act and the entirety of Superman IV. The butchering of one of Marvel's best villains cannot go unpunished either, as it is worse than SM3's Venom, Origins Wolverine's Deadpool, and IM3's Mandarin. The finale is as rushed as the film itself, and the last lines of dialogue are literally like the movie is sticking a middle finger in your face. This is one of those movies that you hate while watching, and it gets worse the more you think about it. The acting is boring, the writing is cringe-worthy, the CGI and greenscreen is atrocious, the chemistry is nonexistant, the pacing is unbelievable, the third act is hilariously laughable, and the movie itself is a disgrace to your eyeballs. This movie makes the Tim Story Fantastic Four movies look like Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man movies and the Dark Knight Trilogy combined in comparison.

Dialog was terrible in this movie. Reed & Sue had zero chemistry. It was just a silly attempt at reimagining something that was not broken in the first place. Sadly, by not sticking with the Origin story of the original comics, you also lost the audience who has read hundreds of these comics, alienating fans of Stan Lee & Jack Kirby.

It seems that rather than hearing the initial internet critiques (before the film was finished) and trying to ensure the finished product put everyone in their place...the film, instead, took the fears of the audience to heart and did their best to make a forgettable comic book film that is better suited to act as cannon fodder.

This film is nowhere near being GOOD, but it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be.  Sure there's a few cringe worthy moments and sequences that leave you scratching your head, but nothing as bad as watching Mr. Fantastic disco dance with two babes in a nightclub set to a top 40 summer track.  \nThis movie is just THERE.  A giant empty shell of a movie shrouded with special effects.  It's boring, dull, and doesn't have an ounce of luster to it's name.  But is that grounds for calling it 'worse than it's predecessor'?  I mean sure, a movie can be boring from time to time.  But i rather watch a boring movie over a cliche summer blockbuster that makes me laugh at how poorly it's made.\nYou can blame what you will for this feature.  You can blame a indie director facing the hardships of a big bad studio.  You can blame the studio for wanting too much control.  You can blame the writer and director for not putting forth an effort to make something memorable.  But the truth of the matter is FANTASTIC FOUR IS A SHITTY COMIC BOOK.  It's tacky, it's cheesy, it's downright stupid and I've never liked it.  \nYou can see that the writer and director KNEW this fact, and tried to change it's structure to make it shine.  But try as they did, it still failed miserably.  \nSo is this the worst movie of the summer?  I wouldn't stretch it that far, but it certainly is worthy of being in the category.

I thought this was going to be a perfect cast for the movie but when you see the film they were horrible but I don't blame them I would blame the writing. One thing I would like to point out is Kate Mara's hair in one scene it's blonde then it's back to brown and they would do this in every other scene a couple times and I really don't know why they would do that. Also the final fight scene only last like 3 minutes. Some scenes in the trailer don't appear the film so I don't understand why they would cut some scenes in the film. When the film gets released on DVD and Blu-ray I'm pretty sure they'll release a directors cut of the film.

Now they go and do another one? Whose genius idea was this? There are so many great ideas out there, comics and story concepts that have gone unnoticed or yet to be given their due, and they go and try to reboot Fantastic Four??? So what did they create? Well first of all they switch out a main character to a black guy, the sort of thing that offends devotees to a series like this, who are for the most part the only ones wanting to see this. It is political correctness run amok, or in the case of the movie Annie, was actually an anti-white racist attack meant to slight whites by changing a cultural icon-- something that blacks would never allow if the roles were reversed. I run off topic though. To change up a character to appeal to political correctness is ridiculous. People do not like it. Will we see a white Fat Albert in the future? Never. Point made. Moving along the movie is just horrible for all the reasons that so many other CGI monstrosities are horrible. They lack a good story, the acting is poor, and the structure is terrible. I was never interested in any of these characters and certainly was not made to care what happened to them or why. To Hollywood I say this, pick up one of those sensational new comic ideas out there and make it gold instead. People want to see fantastic things, but they want a good story.",

While technically being introduced relatively early in the film, the main antagonist wasn't brought to the front of the action until towards the end of the film in what was probably meant to be a plot twist, an assumption based on earlier events of the film, however this would only be surprising to those who fall into the unfortunate category of having neither read the comics, seen the cartoon series, heard of the characters before, didn't pay attention to the character's name, have never seen a film before, or are dense enough to not suspect what was going to happen.  While some parts of the film were exciting these were far and few between, with the final fight scene making up a pitifully small amount of screen time and being rather anticlimactic, leaving a distinct feel of disappointment.  Although a far better adaptation than the prevision films, there is little else of merit;  the pace was slow, the script was mediocre at best, the dialogue was clunky, and the characters were almost as thin as the plot.  It truly is a pity as the main cast showed a lot of potential to make a good film, but were let down by the script and execution.  It felt more like a cheap backstory subplot than a film in it's own right, feeling as though it was simply an attempt to establish a franchise for monetization rather than produce a good film.  The only thing that can be hoped for is that if, after such a disappointing film, the sequel isn't dropped that it will be all action, since this film did all the exposition and backstory that a franchise will ever need.",

No. Far from it.\nThe script was EXTREMELY poorly written. The cast - Micheal B Jordon, Kate Mara, Miles Teller, Jamie Bell - If you know Hollywood, you KNOW these are some of the BIGGEST young actor talents that will surely rise to Oscar level one day (Miles' film already did!) and it is disappointing to see how they underperformed here. The relationship between Reed and Ben was developed nicely then abandoned. Sue and Reed lines were so weak there could be no chemistry. And well Johnny just lacked the energy that character is supposed to have. He was mostly angry the whole time. I think Victor Von Doom was the only one who was convincing for me, why he hated people and how he felt about things, which again got completely wasted due to such a pathetic ending for one of the BIGGEST villains in the Marvel universe, with 20th Century fox was SO LUCKY to have since Disney's Marvel cant ever use it till Fox gives rights back... and it got wasted. \nThen those special effects... SO POOR. Was i watching the last Fantastic Four movie? The Thing looked awesome though, yet we never saw enough of our heroes fight enough and see their powers in full action . \n\nFantasic Four is one of Marvel's BIGGEST and BEST comic titles in history! It sits up right there next to Spider-man. It was Marvel's answer to Justice League (no, the Avengers weren't). THATS what made me sad. They kind of wasted the property with such weak script, directing and acting. And I dont care if the studio super meddled with Josh Trank's work! He should have just left the film like Edgar Wright did with Ant-Man.\n\nHOWEVER, all this being said, F4 is NOT a horrible movie. Not even remotely. The first hour is very watchable! They have this sci-fi horror theme going on, a completely new take. They build a nice mystery about the unknown universe. Dr. Doom walking through the halls blowing people's head was slick! And Mr. Fantastic's power use was so much more creative than the last movie! The problem is, instead of building up, the film just goes down, and the final act doesn't redeem it, rather makes the most sloppy bit. BUT, I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS FILM. I does NOT feel like a waste of my money! \n\nSo if you like superhero movies or sci-fi films, I would ask you to consider this. Go on a late weekday for lesser cost. But watch it once before you judge it form other's reviews.\n\nPs.- I am NOT really forgiving about movies (unless it has spider man :P) nor do i give a good rating easily. I know this was a poorly made film. BUT it didnt feel a waste of time n money and i liked it. It is still NOT a \"Batman & Robin\" or \"Green Lantern\" bad",

Dr. Doom doesn't show up until literally the last 16 minutes! There is NO action until that point! No sense of any danger. The characters are so boring and their chemistry is non-existent. There is close to zero interaction between the characters! I couldn't care less about the characters and the plot. The ending battle, if you can call it that, is about 2 minutes long and Whoo hoo! The Earth is safe! But, you just DON'T CARE! Because this movie's pacing and Dr. Doom's reasons to destroy Earth are so shitty that you can't even make yourself enjoy it. Speaking of Dr. Doom, he looks like Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz. The CGI is truly awful. I think the original Fantastic Four from 2005 had better effects! The cast is good, although. But, their characters are so SHIT that it even makes them look bad! I have nothing good to say about this movie except that it's watchable and I didn't really feel bored by it.

Our big bad guy, Dr. Victor won Doom (played by Tony Kebbell) does not have any real reason to be evil or threaten our heroes in the movie except for the fact that the script tells him to do so! The resolution to the plot feels so unearned and is so dumb that you can only laugh at how lame it is. For me, while it is not the jarring disaster or waste of time everyone was predicting, the only worthwhile parts of the movie that save it from being completely missed opportunity are the beginning section of the story and the visual effects bringing the Thing (portrayed by Jaime Bell) to life.

I can't believe this movie was worse than the previous two 2000s' ones. There is actually no character development. The \"progression\" of the characters is so rushed. I guess that's what happens when your movie's story skips a year in time. The beginning of the movie wasn't awful and I was somewhat getting into it  But people were totally right about what they said about this movie. It's all setup and then a shitty final act. There is actually no second act; no middle. We jump from the origins of their powers to the final conflict. At least the earlier two movies had some sense of fun and personality to them, as stupid as they were. This movie is the definition of mundane. Dr. Doom looked horrible and was an awful character. I don't know what they were thinking with his costume design. Not to say everyone else wasn't awful too, cause they were. There was no one to attach yourself to throughout the movie, not even Reed RIchards. There was no weight to Doom's actions (or anyone's for that matter) or to the final battle. It's all brief, rushed and meaningless. I have to admit I liked the look of the Thing though. But overall, the special effects in this movie were pretty weak. The one thing you could expect to be decent in this day and age, and they still messed it up. I really wanted to like this movie and hoped it would be good. I loved Josh Trank's first film Chronicle, one of the best found-footage movies I've seen. Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller are two of my favorite young actors. I can't believe how much they fucked it up. I hear Fox reshot and changed the final part of the movie completely. That would make sense why this movie feels so disjointed. It's a total waste of time and I got nothing out of it. I feel bad for Josh Trank's vision getting totally destroyed.",

Fine.  \nOne of my biggest problems with the movie is Reg Cathey as Mr. Storm.  His acting was not great, his voice is distracting and I did not see him as a smart convincing character.  Since they took so long to develop Reed story, they did not have time (i guess) to show you how they developed their new acquired powers, so instead they give you a glimpse of a few training exercises.  There was a 1 year gap, which they filled it with useless scenes instead of giving us some idea of what happened to Victor (Doom) and how he developed his powers.  So, to make it worse, they decided to have a fight full of Hollywood clich√©s (like standing superman-like) and annoying sequences.  The fight, instead was poorly orchestrated and very very short.  I am so disappointed that I am afraid to even consider watching any other Fantastic 4 movies in the future.  Terrible!!!",

            "content": "For the first 45 minutes or so of the rebooted Fantastic Four I was having a hard time seeing why there was so much negativity surrounding the movie. I admired the slowly paced set up to the characters obtaining their powers as it allowed us to get a good enough glimpse of who they are when they are just regular people. I liked that the movie aimed for a more realistic tone than the Marvel Studios movies and portrayed obtaining powers as something freaky and scary instead of \"cool\".\n\nBut once the four obtain their powers the movie jumps ahead a year and my emotional investment in the movie completely died. I was really looking forward to seeing how the four main characters would cope with their abilities. I wanted to see their initial horror and their slow struggle to accept who they are and to learn how to control their abilities. The movie took a cheap shortcut by fast forwarding to a point where the four had already mastered their abilities and since we missed such a vital segment of their character development I had a hard time caring about them.\n\nThe 2nd half of the movie is incredibly rushed - a stark contrast to the slow burn of the first half. \"Dr. Doom\" enters the scene, threatens to destroy the world and is defeated all within a timespan of 20-25 minutes at most. When the four unite against him, there is all of this talk about how they will have to put aside their differences and work as a team. Unfortunately, the movie completely failed to develop the characters and their relationships with one another. The Fantastic Four are known for being Marvel's first superhero \"family\", but these characters feel like acquaintances at best by the end of the film.\n\nSpeaking of the film's ending, I left the movie feeling like I had watched a 2 hour TV pilot rather than an actual movie. I just felt so unsatisfied when I left the theater, as if I had only seen a teaser for the REAL story that was bound to happen later on. We will never get that story though, as this movie is destined to bomb at the box-office and never get a sequel.\n\nDirector Josh Trank said there was a lot of studio meddling with this movie and I can believe it. It feels like a good 30 minutes were cut from the film. Maybe if the film were longer it could have addressed my complaints. But as is, the movie fails to develop the relationships between the four main characters and as a result it completely lacks heart.",

Yes it's no masterpiece but dam the cast was really appealing and the whole film just sucked me in and kept me entertained for the whole two hours. It reminded me a lot of these heroic fantasy films from the 80's and I really enjoyed that.

They cut out the dwelling and characters' introspective, emotional crisis' and just give you four very different young people that are brought together by a conflict. Albeit, the conflict has been done to death: Dark Knight Rises, The Flash season finale, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Green Lantern, Avengers). The effects were good, the movie's pacing was well done and the origin Reed Richards was brief and informative enough to show you how far his dream took him.\n\nHis unwavering best friend lost everything in his blind allegiance to him. Johnny was a misguided youth crying out for his father's attention, while trying not to live in the shadow of his over-achieving adoptive sister, and Victor Von Doom was a man who was just rejected by the world. The woman he loved, the creation he fronted, the people he worked with and the world itself cast him aside as a social outlier. \n\nThe sub-text is all there, and it's very well done if you're astute enough to catch it, without a director dedicating 15 minutes per character for you to establish an emotional connection. A lot of this films' context hinges on the intelligence of the one watching it, and being able to empathize while picking up details, without having a plot watered down with pointless meandering to flaunt ultimately insignificant sub-plots.\n\nVerdict: People who are hating on the movie either don't know the characters and are starved for context, or they're just hypocrites who bitch and moan whenever they get want they asked for, because it wasn't designed just for them.\n\nRemember, comic book movies are NOT made for comic book readers. They're adapted for casual viewers with the hopes that they do the books justice. If you read between the lines, everybody in this film was done right, arguably except for the Storm siblings, but this wasn't an emotional rollercoaster - it was a sci fi action flick. \n\nIf you're open-minded, I'd recommend this movie.",

There was absolutely no chemistry between the 4, Reed and Ben didn't have any sort of brotherly bond and instead it felt more like Reed just kept Ben around because he was useful, while there was zero chemistry between Reed and Sue, The family dynamic was one of the few good points about Story's Fantastic Four films. Even with script problems, you got the sense that these people really cared for each other. Another problem is that the movie is WAY too serious & dark, there is no fun at all, Fantastic 4 are not super-serious, dark and gritty, yes, they have some very serious moments but it's mostly fun, i think a combination of humorous and serious tone(serious not in high levels, only a bit) fits perfectly to F4. Inevitably i'm gonna mention how ridiculous Doom is. I'm still trying to figure out why he wanted to destroy the Fantastic 4 ? anyone know ? anyone ?...crap he was part of the group, he worked with them, why he wanted to kill them ? his motives are unclear, well his look is terrible, it looks like an unfinished look of Doom which happens in pre production, we barely saw him in the film only for 5 minutes, It's as if they were putting this movie together and then at the last minute, someone went, \"Oh crap! We forgot that the Four need to fight Doom! ahh screw it, let's just bring him back right now and toss him in at the end.\" it's a mess...i expected the movie to be bad BUT not THAT bad, F4 just earned a place between the worst comic book movies of all time !!!!",

Meant to be darker, gloomier and more thought-provoking, Fantastic 4 could have been a different summer super-hero flick. Unfortunately, something awfully goes wrong with the whole movie and the pacing, the suspense, the villain, the character - nothing meets the initial expectation and potential of the story. It is very difficult to point out what has exactly gone wrong, but the most important element is the lack of entertainment resulting from the slow pace. Basically everything that is told in 100 minutes could have been told in 50 and then a second part would have taken place (with possibly higher stakes).  \nIn conclusion it is only a shame that such a concept is wasted a talented young actor such as Miles Teller does not get the chance to show what he is capable of.

Having such low expectations did make the film more enjoyable, but it was not without its problems.\n\nLet's start with the good. The movie is very well-acted. Teller, Mara, Jordan, and Bell all did a great job as the four heroes. Each had a very different take on their character, and this really separated them from the 2005 incarnations of the characters. The relationships were done reasonably well, particularly between Reed-Ben and Sue-Johnny. I also felt that the movie didn't drag on, it got through its plot points at a non-exhausting pace.\n\nNow for the bad. The characters seemed to do things against type. Reed separates himself from the rest of the group for some reason. Dr. Doom was underdeveloped, though memorable. The Reed-Sue dynamic was underwhelming. The editing made the film feel like it was jumping around too much.\n\nIf you were not interested in the movie to begin with, then it's a safe bet you can continue to ignore it. It is certainly a different take on a superhero film, for which I am glad. If you are curious, it's worth checking out.",

A gifted young cast (Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell) are tasked with giving  this golden goose a fresh sheen. It's not happening.\n\nDirector Josh Trank (Chronicle), who co-wrote the mess of a script with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, take their sweet as time to get anything going. Reed Richards (Teller, slumming hard) is a science genius recruited by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathy) to join his rogue group of scientists. Storm's adopted daughter Sue (Mara) is a willing participant, not so much his car-crazy son Johnny (Jordan). Mara and Jordan have so little to act with they pretty much give up on it as soon as the movie starts. Toby Kebbell is Victor Von Doom, Dr. Storm's hot-headed pupil, who overdoes it like crazy. You can tell he's the villain because he gives giving shit to Reed's BFF, Ben Grimm (Bell). Everyone is supposed to be excited by Reed's invention, a teleportation process that can transport a live monkey to another diminesion. How I wish I had been that monkey.\n\nSo of course the quartet get into the teleporter and voila, they're the Fantastic Four. There's nothing resembling fantastic in this trashheap. Blatant franchise building has seldom looked so cynical. That includes the lazy effects that turn Reed into the elastic Mr. Fantastic, Sue into the Invisible Woman, Johnny into the Human Torch and Ben into the pile of rocks known as The Thing.

Although slow, the movie was interesting and funny. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The fight at the end was not one of the better superhero battles that I've seen, but it felt truer and more believable than your typical superhero battle. The four had never fought as a team before, and I feel this was smartly depicted. Everyone was attacking from their own angle, with their own strengths, rather than combining each other's. With this in mind, I am extremely excited for a second because the first is foundational. The relationship dynamics between the characters felt realistic, poignant, and well-developed. Moreover this review would be incomplete without me mentioning how happy I am to see not only a black leading male, but also a black superhero. I'm not going to lie, it seems to me that enough of these negative reviews come from people who were/are upset that a black male replaced a role traditionally for a white male, BUT many of these extremely popular superhero comic books were written during a period when racism was at an even higher level than it is today. Personally I feel it was an AMAZING decision. Tensions between different groups in America are increasing, as people find outlets to voice their frustrations. Seeing a minority as a superhero in a high budget movie, I do feel like the ball is moving in the right direction! \nOverall I'd encourage people to watch it, but be prepared that the action is limited as the focus seems to be on realistic development.",

However this movie's final act is what really puts the nails straight into the coffin. Poor setup, weird and ultimately stupid action, and a villain that has no motives and looks like a pile of aluminum foil. One of the movie's other fatal flaws (one of about 50) is its tone. While it tries to be more realistic and gritty, it comes across cheesy and ... Lame. The characters have no real bond between them which is one of the main selling points of the fantastic 4. You know the \"team\" of the fantastic 4. This group hardly even feels like a group of friends by the end. They don't resolve the problems they have with one another, they don't have any real \"bonding moments\", and most of the time they are disagreeing with one another! I don't know why we're supposed to be rooting for these guys, they don't even like one another.\n\nOverall this movies strong cast can't save it from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I am quite convinced that even if Fantastic Four 2015 wasn't pretty terrible, most fanboys would have condemned it for even existing.  And that, honestly, pisses me off.  I firmly believe that every movie deserves its day in court, regardless of background or any questionable business decisions involved in making it.  But after having thoroughly examined the accused, I have no choice but to pass a guilty sentence on most counts.  \n\nThe first half is surprisingly good, being mostly well-intentioned soft science-fiction, resembling something between Interstellar and Tomorrowland.  It's actually commendable that a modern superhero film take a deliberate pace and reserve action for the final reel.  It also features an effectively creepy series of scenes where our heroes are struggling to adjust to their newfound powers/afflictions while being prodded and observed by indifferent scientists.  It's chilling PG-13 body horror, and clearly influenced by David Cronenberg.  The cinematography is impressive and the visual aesthetic and effects are a giant improvement over the cheap and campy looking two previous installments.  It's clear that director Josh Trank (an indy director who made Chronicle) wanted a complete film with these elements and wanted to avoid typical superhero tropes.  However, the second half is absolutely terrible and resembles something that was tacked on last minute.  The plot becomes forgettable and rushed.  The main villain gets shoved in 20 minutes toward the end.  The final confrontation lasts less than 3 to 5 minutes, if that.  The action is awkward and schlocky.  And worst of all - it's boring.  It also strays too far from the source material and barely resembles what a Fantastic Four movie should look like.  (There fanboys.  I threw you a bone.)  Dr. Doom has a brief, cool scene in which he murders a dozen scientists by exploding their heads, but it's fleeting.  The cast (which has received immense criticism) tried earnestly to make the most of a questionable script.  Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Reg E. Cathey deserve citations of valor for courage under terrible circumstances.  The rest failed to make an impression.  \n\nThis is largely the result of 20th Century Fox hijacking the project and forcing the second half to more closely resemble the superhero movies they want to compete with.  But it was rushed and half-assed.  The strain shows and I wonder what Josh Trank's uncompromised sci-fi vision of a Fantastic Four movie would look like.  We will probably never know, and what we have here is a disaster on all fronts.  But to be fair, the reason for Fantastic Four's box office woes probably has more to do with the lack of action than its merits as a cohesive film.  Remember, audiences pay to see tons of stupid movies, as long as jokes, tits, or explosions are in order.  But Marvel Fans can rejoice, as Fox will undoubtedly sell this franchise to Marvel/Disney with only X-Men and Deadpool stubbornly resisting acquisition into the MCU.  If you have to see this, rent or stream it.  Enjoy the first half and cry yourself to sleep after watching the second.",

If so, they will be sorely disappointed as this was more the \"Mediocre Bunch,\" but the blame for this goes far beyond the four principal cast members although they have to take some heat as well. \nThe story is about as interesting as a nine-year-old telling an original ghost story at summer camp. Or a committee of Hollywood studio suits-which is where I think much of the blame belongs. Choose whatever trite label you wish: formulaic, predictable, cookie cutter-they all fit. There didn't seem to be an original thought in any of the narrative except for the scene showing where Ben Grimm gets his \"clobberin' time\" phrase.\nWatching this reminded me of two other \"major\" dsiappointments of the past, namely Dark Man in the 90s and the 1980's enviro-feminist mess that Dino DeLaurentis made of King Kong. However, what gave those two any sort of \"watchability\" were the up-and-comers in lead roles: Liam Neeson in the first and Jessica Lang in the other. Even though the viewer knew the scripts were \"gawdawful,\" the brilliance of those two actors was on display, which ironically is very evident in one piece demonstrating the \"acting chops\" of both at their absolute best, Rob Roy. However, I am not discussing a great movie here; I'm pointing out a weak one.\nAs mentioned, the cast is not fully responsible for this mess, but they are hardly blameless. In fact, other than Michael B. Jordon's performance as Johnny Storm, none of the others made any real impression other than the gum-snapping \"evil corporatist,\" and it's pretty easy to guess what reaction the audience would have toward him. As I said: formulaic, predictable, and cookie cutter. \nDr. Doom was Mr. Goth Gloom missing only eyeliner, clove cigarettes, or a penchant for listening to The Cure; Sue Storm was blonde-apparently her sole qualification for the part; Reed Richards, while not bad, doesn't really shine (I'll avoid the obvious pun concerning any acting abilities here).\nIn fact, the only thing worth sitting through during this mess was the music, so it was no surprise to see Phillip Glass's name attached to the music. However, even that is a bit depressing since he is known for being  involved in cutting edge and non-commercial work. Still, were it not for that, the single star here wouldn't even have made it.\nThere are two items worth mentioning: the first is that I never saw Stan Lee show up in this film (although I may have missed that), and the second is that this is the first Marvel production in a long time that had no \"bonus\" tease after the credits. So, perhaps the \"minds\" behind this knew better than to even try and pretend that this was on par with the other work coming from this studio.",

The first half hour makes you believe the film has plenty of potential and starts off intriguing, but once the team gets their powers, it just leads to more build up. I swear, this entire film is just setting up for another movie and makes it feel more like a pilot episode for a TV show. However, though it is mostly build up of the characters, the chemistry between the actors is pretty strong. Once Dr. Doom does come though, the film throws a complete curveball with a random and pretty forgettable third act. Also, Doom's motivations were just ridiculous considering you never saw anything like it when he was Victor. So apart from strong chemistry and a good opening, the film just feels like a scene after scene lead up and is beat down with a pretty generic third act. I give props to all the actors, but overall it can't save the film. I definitely wouldn't recommend it but don't think it's the Batman and Robin of this decade. D+.",

It feels like there was a second director. Doctor Doom is introduced late as the villain and we're left with a movie that's feels like a waif. The groundwork is great actually to possibly make a great sequel that is on par with Fox's other comic book heroes, X-Men. The origin story was just a little too crammed yet a little too thin. It was defiantly battling visions as there were 3 screenwriters and rumors of editing room battles. Josh Trank can't be blamed for this movie alone. I say this was a product of battling, divorcing parents who emotionally abused their child till there was no emotion left in it.

            "content": "So the one-massively criticized superhero flick is here, and it's been called one of the worst movies ever made, a crappy Batman & Robin, and even \"Craptastic Bore\", but is it really that bad? The not so Fantastic Four is defently an origin story that takes well too long to tell, and that forgets important plot details and that's well too short to be a superhero-flick and that never really pays off. \n\nThe first act is definitely the greater aspect, with its interesting plot and somewhat exciting events. But there are also some inlogical things, especially when it comes to the editing. That lack of greatness really escalated later in the second and third act. The characters are always the major detail of every movie that needs to be well written and presented, but I'm wondering if the writers were drunk or just stupid while they were writing it, because it's just so badly done. It took the half part of the movie just to get the characters going, so it took well too long to introduce them. The second thing is that we never got to see how our heroes developed and got control over their powers. The major reason is that the editing is so terrible. They skipped everything from how they got to learn to control their powers to how their friendships and chemistry developed! They therefor missed important plot and character details. That's a serious mistake for one that just were a part of the development of the X-Men franchise, well good luck on getting back there!\n\nThat's just one small aspect with all the big mistakes in this reboot, and another one is definitely the many and serious plot-holes throughout the whole movie. The storytelling is also very messy and just weird from time to time. But the real mistake is the lack of a greater third act. We didn't get to see the wrath of the villain until like 20 minutes before the movie ended...what the hell?! Another thing is that Dr Doom is extremely vaguely presented and there are very little relatable aspects with him. He's ugly too, and you can't really feel that understanding of him, why he's the villan. The only great thing about him is that he's defently scary. So yeah, it's not a flawless movie, not by a long shot.\n\nBut it doesn't end there; The crappy Fantastic Four also got some predictable moments, and dialogs here and there, and the movie is extremely short. The major BAD thing is that there are so much plot and character story missing, but why is the movie so short then? There are even shots in the trailers that looked promising, and some of them wasn't in the movie! Im stunned by how this movie even became to be this bad. Even the climax is just too short and well too rushed for its own good. Sure it got some cool moments, but ohh myy it tries to be serious, but it totally fails due to terrible editing and storytelling; not to mention some of the vague CGI and forced humor. \n\nIt's understandable why many out there hates it; it's full of enormous flaws. One of the most flaw-filled movie I've ever seen with its lack of plot and character details, character development, massive amount of plot-holes, messy editing, vague and non-relatable villain and of course the forced humor, rushed third act and the dry chemistry between the characters after they got their not so fantastic powers. But it got some bright aspects too; like great actors, good soundtrack and somewhat okay dialogs, but that's sometimes forced to the audience (fact-based dialogs).\n\nSure it got some okay aspects and you can still watch it, but the flaws are just so big and impossible to hide from. It's indeed a bad movie with it's terrible editing and lack of a Marvel-entertainment that steals the show nowadays. Give the rights back to Marvel or try again Fox!\n\nThe reboot that failed.\n\nCritical rating: 2/10\nPersonal rating: 5.5/10",

The movie started out out ok but took a nose dive and stayed slowly eventful and very boring. The thing (which would have been a GREAT hook for kids) didn't get nearly enough screen time was over shadowed by Johnny storm doing the same flyby and invisible women floating around in a invisible cocoon over and over again.

This movie is not good, do not misunderstand me, however if Doom was given more screen time to be fleshed out, and the big finale at the end stayed under the science-fiction/horror vibe of the first two acts, this film really could have been fantastic. There are a few silly lines in the first half of the film but besides that, it holds up very well and is a solid introduction to the movie. It does not feel like a superhero movie and funny enough, when it begins to feel that way is when it turns to shit. Watching these characters post returning to Earth and while becoming aware of their abilities, you could really see the fear and discomfort in their eyes. I really took a liking to these moments because it felt different from every other superhero origin movie we've seen. \n\nThen, we reach the \"1 Year Later\" mark. I didn't mind this idea because in many ways it worked and skipped over a lot of what we are sick of seeing from origin films. The only problem is it came too early. The audience just needed maybe another ten minutes of these frightening reveal scenes to then be satisfied with that jump in time but instead became a missed opportunity. This would have been easy to cope with if it were the only mistake. The action scenes were lackluster, also with potential to fun. When the Thing confronts Mr. Fantastic in the woods, it astounds me that there was not a big fight between these two former friends. This could have been a huge scene and instead ends within seconds of starting when the Thing head-butts Reed. It's almost like they wanted fans to get excited over the first big fight in the movie, only to realize it never comes. Then, to make matters worse, once Doom is back in the picture, the movie decides to abandon all of its originality and become an under-parred superhero movie which under this new tone loses all of its foundation. Dooms motives were interesting if only they were explained more. I liked the direction however eventually it hit a dead road. If we were able to see Doom on Planet Zero and shown him growing fond of this world and understanding why he needed to destroy Earth to be happy with it, then he would have made a fine villain. Instead, he's practically worthless and simply a villain just to be a villain. This movie is extremely frustrating because while watching, I saw so many paths it could have taken that would have benefitted the entirety of the film and instead, each time steered further and further away from where it should have been heading. This is the saddest movie flop of all time because of the never ending potential it had. I'm in love with the cast, the director, the writers, and obviously because of the X-Men have faith in the studio of Fox, so the fact that this film is hated instead of praised like its big brother franchise (X-Men) is truly heartbreaking. \nIf you want to see a good Fantastic Four movie, watch this one up until they find Doom and then turn it off as quickly as possible.",

Please don't make a sequel just give it back to marvel already. I'm too scared to watch X men Apocalypse after seeing this....",

The movie started out on a dull note and kept on pushing towards the origins with what a modern movie buff would say, a nolanistic approach detailing every unnecesseray bit and trying out a different perspective on the origins and by the time each character is properly introduced, there is little time left for a proper full on hero on villain action sequence and basically you have a story that is forced to end with what would make anyone stand up and shout WTF? Also probably the worst depiction of an iconic marvel villain. The performances were pretty disappointing even though it had a pretty impressive cast, their expressions were unrealistic and kind of mechanical. The Thing doesn't wear an underwear and Sue is adopted, don't understand what kind of creative differences these changes bring to the movie. On a positive note, there are little crumbs of interesting changes which still doesn't do much for a movie that has went in the completely wrong direction.\n\nIn short, the movie is a long horrible trailer that gives away the ending.",

            "content": "Few movies have had such a prominent stink of negativity attached to them as Fox's Fantastic Four reboot, a movie that is already being considered amongst the worst superhero movies of all time. Director Josh Trank (Chronicle) was given the freedom to go darker, emphasize more science fiction, and select a cast of respected actors rather than bankable names. Then came rumors of aloof and secluded behavior on set from Trank. Then came rumors that Fox and producer/co-writer Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past) effectively shuttered Trank from his own movie, reshooting 40-minutes of a 90-minute film to salvage the wayward production (get ready for plenty of stuff in trailers not to be in the finished film). Not quite the room-clearing disaster of rampant speculation, the new Fantastic Four is a superhero movie that never really gets started and has constant battles with tone, characterization, and plot. It seems like the real villains of the movie are the Fox executives who signed off on the \"gritty, gloomy\" rendition and then interfered when they got too scared, managing to undercut the original vision, muddy an already messy film, and make things even worse. The behind-the-scenes drama is easily more interesting than anything that happens in this movie. \n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a science genius recruited by Dr. Storm (Reg E. Cathey). Reed invented a makeshift teleporting device as a young child with the help of his friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). At Dr. Storm's lab, Reed works with Storm's children, Sue (Kate Mara) and Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and a morose computer programmer, Victor Von Doom (Tony Kebbell). The group transports to another dimension but is attacked by a strange green energy cloud. Victor is left behind. The surviving foursome exhibits unique abilities. Reed can stretch his body. Sue can turn invisible and create force fields. Johnny can fly and set his body on fire. Poor Ben is a hulking rock monster. Reed promises to find a way to reverse what happened to them, but the re-emergence of Dr. Doom puts the fate of the entire world at risk. \n\nIt should be of little surprise that Fantastic Four feels like two different movies awkwardly and inarticulately smashed together. For the first hour, the movie follows the path of our heroes and their contraction of their powers. Rather than the gee-whiz fun of getting superpowers, the characters view themselves as freaks, their bodies turned against them, and their colleagues deeply afraid of them. It's a far moodier antidote to the vicarious thrills of gaining special abilities. There are some effective sequences that channel David Cronenberg's The Fly and Scanners, and it's these brief moments where you feel Trank's vision connect the most. Doom walking down a hallway and making heads explode, in a PG-13 way, is horrifying and cool. The problem for Trank, and the movie as a whole, is that this first hour still isn't a very good movie. It takes far too long for these characters to get blasted by green space goo and become supers. The setup is so protracted and needless. Did we need to see how these characters came together? Did we need to see their childhoods? It's not essential to see the team come together when we can already start from that point. In a sense, it reminded me of how needless I felt Pixar's Monsters University was; did we need to see how these colleagues became friends? Despite this action-free opening half, the screenplay could have fleshed out the four main characters to justify the added time, but it's hard for the movie to justify much. \n\nThese are some of the most boring and underdeveloped characters in recent comic book lore. If these versions of the Fantastic Four existed in the 1960s, they wouldn't have made it to issue number two. Reed is smart. Sue is smart too but also standoffish (and adopted). Johnny likes fast cars. Ben is tough and loyal. Victor is a pessimist who called dibs on flirting with Sue. That is really about it, folks. Ben disappears for most of the film, called in to make the trans-dimensional jump because Reed feels like Ben deserves to be there since he helped create an early prototype with Reed. Actually, let's talk about that scene. It's a high school science fair yet the only other displays we see are clearly for much younger children, and yet Dr. Storm is visiting an all-ages school science fair to groom talent? That seems weird. Why does Dr. Storm offer the same offer to Ben, who helped Reed design and build his early teleporting machine? Regardless, Reed leaves his childhood pal behind with Ben's abusive family. That's because he's a good friend. Then, once the horrible transformations occur and Ben gets the worst of it, Reed runs out on him again. Sure it's in the pursuit of finding a cure, but who's to say he couldn't do that in the already constructed government super science lab? Sue doesn't even go on the first trans-dimensional voyage; it's just a boy's club. Sue spends more time in this movie staring at computer screens and looking intently than any action. It's probably for the best, though, because the scenes of her flying around in a bubble made me think of Glinda the Good Witch. I'm not a Kate Mara fan. I've found the majority of her performances to be stilted, but even I can admit she's given nothing to do here but move her eyes from the left to eh right and inform Miles Teller about Portishead, a band that's only 20-plus years old. It's sad but the most interesting part of Johnny is that a black actor, a point that caused certain more irritable fans to foam at the mouth at the adaptation, is playing him. If these super heroes aren't going to be super until halfway through the movie, they better be interesting characters. They are not even close. \n\nIt's with the return of Dr. Doom that the movie makes its inept transition into the second movie, the one reshot by the producers and the studio. In an implausibly fast amount of time we're given our villain of the movie and he sets off to open a black hole to destroy Earth because... we're self-destructive? So humanity is self-destructive so Doom is going to destroy humanity? I would also like to know exactly how Doom survived for over a year in the alternate dimension when it clearly looks like there is nothing of substance for miles, unless green goop is edible. Did he just lose the need to go to the bathroom? Doom's powers are rather nebulous, which makes it even less interesting when the Fantastic Four decides to, get this, work together to beat the bad guy. For a movie that hasn't had one action sequence until its final act, now our characters must band together to stop Doom and his giant flashing blue light black hole thingy. The special effects are pretty undistinguished and hard to read at times. I'd also like to remark how hideously this other dimension looks. It's all rocky crags and dark clouds; it's like a less successful timeshare for the residents of Mordor. It doesn't quite look like the paradise that Doom describes it as (the brochure lied to us!). This jumbled conclusion feels so ham-fisted and rushed, a villain and a typical world-destroying fate that must be thwarted at the last minute. Things just sort of happen rather than storylines finding payoffs, and then it's all sort of over and the resolution echoes the very end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, even with the credits cutting off the vocal iteration of the title heroes. It's so transparently different in tone, sloppy in development and execution, and so quickly introduced and resolved, that the whole conclusion comes across as forcibly laughable.\n\nAt the end of watching the dire Fantastic Four reboot, I felt more sympathy for Josh Trank. He still deserves blame for helping to conceive and develop such a misshapen story and squander his actors. After three duds and whatever you want to call the 1994 Roger Corman adaptation, it feels like maybe this franchise is just cursed. Maybe these characters are too dated and their powers are too silly. Then again we know that these characters can work in the format of a movie because a good Fantastic four movie already exists, and it's called The Incredibles. It doesn't seem like anyone is going to come away completely clean from this misfire and financial flop, especially now that Trank and executives are engaging in a P.R. blame game. Fox was hoping for a rekindled franchise. Now they may be hoping to work out a deal for Marvel to buy back the rights to the characters. I would have been interested to see the full vision of what Trank was going for, especially since the one scene that feels most adamant is the best sequence in an admittedly mediocre super hero film. At least the movie would feel cohesive. It probably wouldn't be good but at least it would be committed to trying something different. Instead, the movie tries to be different from the super hero blockbusters populating the landscape and then, at the last minute, tries to follow their lead and become one of them, becoming its own misshapen and poorly developed blob. It's not the worst super hero movie in history (that honor still has to belong to the atomic bomb of taste, Batman & Robin), but even achieving sustained mediocrity is too much to expect. \n\nNate's Grade: C-",

So -- I believe that a majority of the reason this film received such poor reviews is because everyone is comparing it to all other marvel films, as well as the original fantastic four. If you don't compare it to anything, and just address it as a film on its own - it was slow, nothing really happened, didn't bring anything new to the genre, and had very little substance. On its own, i would give it a 57%. However, if you compare it to the other marvel movies which have set the ball as being some of the most action-packed, epic films of all time, that 57 drops to a 47% and then when you compare it with the original fantastic four, which people everywhere communally agreed never exsited, this film is actually WORSE than that one, so that drops it to a 37%. So I would give this a 37% for lack of everything. That being said -- its not as though you would watch this and cringe. There is nothing inherently bad about it. It's not a terrible film. Its just sort of pointless. One thing to keep in mind about this film is that it was really created so that Sony could keep the right to the fantastic four franchise to prevent it from reverting back to marvel and offering a competitor studio a chance at another potentially fruitful series. After having released a statement saying they plan on going ahead with a second Fantastic Four film set in this universe that will be more epic and have more action - I feel, based on this film and the characters and world they established, it has a shot at being a 70%, but I can't expect anything more than that based on the sheer lack of originality and delivery. The only thing I really liked about this film was Mr.Stretches stretchyness. They did a good job with that. Thats about it. Also; Kate Mara looks the best she ever has, but they don't really show her much.",

            "content": "The Fantastic Four returns to theaters in this dark and gritty reboot and the result in anything but fantastic, more in the ways of pathetic and horrendous. The Fantastic Four has had a troubled history on screen. Roger Corman produced in a film in 1994 which was never released into theaters, with the characters finding their first official on screen adventure in 2005's Fantastic Four, directed by Tim Story. Despite mixed reviews, the film was still a success at the box office and warranted a sequel entitled Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, released in 2007. While that film received mixed reviews, slightly better than the 2005 film, it wasn't considered a box office success, causing Twentieth Century Fox to abort a third film and reboot the franchise all together. This new version arrives eight years after Rise of the Silver Surfer and ten years after the first, and the result is absolutely terrible.\n\nThis film has been known for its behind the scenes production problems, which have been highly talked about and appeared on the internet. Director Josh Trank and the studio, Fox, had a difficult relationship, while even Trank was known for being difficult to work with and erratic on set, causing various problems, including damages worth around $100,000 involving a house rented out to him.\n\nThe film focuses on Reed Richards, a high school student, who is working on a teleportation device, with help from his friend Ben Grimm. Their work attracts the attention of Professor Franklin Storm, director of the Baxter Foundation, which is funded by the government. Storm recruits Reed, who joins his adopted daughter Susan Storm to help complete a Quantum Gate, with aid from Johnny Storm, Franklin's biological son and Victor Von Doom, the creator of the Gate. After successfully testing the Gate by sending a monkey to an alternate dimension, the government decides to coordinate with Nasa by sending their own people through the Gate, forcing Reed, Johnny, Victor and a reluctant Ben to decide to carry out their own expedition. Arriving to the dimension, the group is suddenly threatened and attempts to escape, leaving Victor behind after he supposedly dies. Upon returning, the three survivors, as well as Susan, suddenly develop strange powers, prompting the government to test them. This is where the whole film goes down hill.\n\nThe film doesn't really have any real structure, who no exact pacing, while it appears like a badly put-together jigsaw puzzle with all the wrong pieces and none of the right pieces. The result is a film with no real pacing. Almost every scene seems rushed, while there is no real resolution.\n\nThe cast, sadly, doesn't do well in this film, which is a shame, since they are good actors. Miles Teller doesn't seem fit for the role of Reed and doesn't seem like a scientist. In much of the film, while he attempts to put forth scientific equations and tests, he at times feels more like an outcast. After the team develops their powers, Reed disappears, going into hiding, which doesn't really support the film or have any real merit to the plot. It just feels like it's thrown in there. Going along with Teller, Trank fought for him to be in the role, but after casting and before production, there's news that Trank and Teller developed a bad relationship, which could have effected the character and Teller's performance. Kate Mara, as Susan, is terrible, which is sad, since I have found her best performance to be in House of Cards. There is news that Fox insisted on her casting and that Trank treated her coldly as a result, possibly resulting in what we have screen. That there is really disappointing, since Mara probably could have given much more to the role and the film. Jamie Bell isn't convincing as Ben Grimm, though he handles the performance of the Thing perfectly. The same goes with Michael B. Jordan who isn't convincing as Johnny Storm and isn't given much to do with. Both Jordan and Bell are fine actors and like with Teller and Mara, it's a shame to see them not have much to do. Toby Kebbell isn't menacing or convincing as Victor Von Doom, while he doesn't prove to be a scientific genius, more like an anti-social outsider, which greatly ruins and effects the character. Tim Blake Nelson chews the scenery as government stooge Dr. Allen and Reg E. Cathey isn't interesting as mentor Franklin Storm.\n\nA big problem with this film is the pacing. Like I said before, the film feels like a badly put-together jigsaw puzzle. There's no real structure, while it seems that the film skips the second act and goes straight to the third act, which instantly makes no sense to the viewer and to the film's story. After the team gains their powers and Reed goes into hiding, the film instantly cuts to a year later, which effects the film. Johnny, Susan and Ben have learned how to handle and use their powers, though we never see them learning how to use them. I would have liked to see them training to learn their powers, since this would have made for sense as to how later in the film they know how to control them. In Iron Man and Batman Begins, you had an origin as to Tony Stark creating the Iron Man uniform and Bruce Wayne developing the Bat-Suit, here though there is no real origin. It seems forced. Another major problem is that the team never has a real threat to face. There are reports that before production began Fox cut three key action scenes from the film, which probably one of the main reasons as to why after gaining their powers, developing them and using them, they don't face a real threat. In Iron Man, you have Tony facing off against his terrorist captors in Gulmira after he masters the Iron Man suit. In Batman Begins, Bruce takes down Carmine Falcone and starts to slowly liberate Gotham City. Here, no real threat.\n\nWhich also brings us to Dr. Doom. In the comics, Dr. Doom is a well-known villain and one of the chief adversaries of the Fantastic Four. Here, he doesn't seem like a real villain. After escaping the dimension and leaving Victor behind, since they believe him to be dead, I kept wondering where the villain was, how was he plotting his return. When Nelson's character sends a small group back to the dimension after Reed fixes the Gate, they find Doom and the film is almost over, a major problem I also had with Hugh Laurie's so-called villainous character in Tomorrowland. Here, sadly, Doom isn't a real threat, he's underused. Even Tim Blake Nelson isn't a real threat, he's more like a scenery chewing villain. Sure he wants to use the Fantastic Four as government weapons and take over the alternate dimension, but still there's no real motivation. The same with Dr. Doom, which is a problem. In The Dark Knight, the Joker's motivation is clear: he wants to cause chaos, destroy Gotham and bend Batman to his will. Even if Skyfall, Javier Bardem's Silva wants to kill M and gain revenge. Here, Doom has no real motivation. Doom isn't even a danger to the team.\n\nThe team also doesn't seem like a real team. They don't seem like the Fantastic Four. All of a sudden, after Doom's appearance and threat, do they manage to work together and trust each other. Up until than, not so much. Once again, it would have seemed better for the team to get know each other, their powers and how to work together. Here, it seems forced.\n\nWhile the special effects in the film are fine, especially with the Thing, Reed, Johnny and Susan, the ones for Doom are not. It seems that toward the end, the studio came to the point where they felt they developed good effects for the other characters, but didn't need to for Doom. Here it's a shame. Doom doesn't look interesting. He seems more like a crash-test dummy thrown into acid, more like a joke.\n\nThe other problem with the film is that it is also too dark. This is a problem, since every comic book movie doesn't need to be dark, gritty and grounded. While it worked with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and even several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it didn't really work with the Spider-Man reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It's almost as if some filmmakers have started to think that if Nolan could darken Batman and ground him and make him gritty, other comic book films can do the same. Not so much. The gritty and bleak feel ruins Fantastic Four. It would have worked better if this film was lighter and more colorful, more like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.\n\nMarco Beltrami and Philip Glass try their best with the score, but seem to be underused at times, which is also a shame, considering that they are great composers.\n\nThe end result is a film that seems to be made by committee, by a bunch of board members sitting in a room and throwing out ideas. While we can blame Fox for interfering with the director, we should also probably blame Trank. While he claims that his version would have been better had Fox not interfered, the big question is: How would had it been better? \n\nWhat Fox needs to do is give this property back to Marvel, who will probably make a way better film, or else choose a director that they can trust and work well on this kind of film. The film isn't fantastic, it's pathetic. Terrible. Horrendous.\n\nThe only good thing is that it's 100 minutes long and when the credits appear, you are pleased that it's over, despite wasting 100 minutes of your life on a real clunker. This one is a real mess and will probably stand as the worst comic book film, worst than Batman and Robin, while it also makes 2005's Fantastic Four appears much better and a lot like art. Which isn't saying much honestly. Pass on this film and see a better comic book film.",

            "content": "Marvel is going be one of the best studios to transform their comics into films, that is actually perfected well. Their recent slew of movies based on their properties has been well received amongst both critics and audiences alike. Until now. With the release of \"Fantastic Four\", the studio has stumbled upon a major dud, and might set the company back for a little while. The film itself is bad film, but it is definitely not the worst movie Marvel has released. There is potential here, we're just not seeing it. \"Fantastic Four\" is a perfect example of letting a studio take over the production, and supplying the needs and wants of the fans. And ultimately, it just comes out as one big mess.\n\nThe plot involves four young minds working on a way to teleport towards another dimension. Unfortunately, a freak accident causes the quartet to gain supernatural powers. These include Reed Richards (Miles Teller) developing elasticity throughout his entire body. Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) setting his entire body on fire. Sue Storm (Kate Mara) can turn invisible and create forcefields. And Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) whose whole body has been transformed into a piece of solid rock. Can the four of them work together, or will their personal issues get in the way?\n\nOh, boy. \"Fantastic Four\" is a bad movie. To begin with, the special effects look nice, but it feels like everything is fake, especially with Bell's Thing; whenever the character is on screen, all the audience sees is just a computer generated image walking around. It defeats the illusion of what we're seeing isn't always there. The sets, again, look nice, but everything is done in the computer, it makes the audience wonder why the filmmakers didn't bother with building actual sets that looked real enough to make the audience think it is believable. It just feels cheap and unnecessary. The editing is another big issue as everything (except for the first third), feels absolutely rushed, and makes the whole production feel predictable.\n\nBut the biggest issue that the movie has going for it is the writing. There are various plot threads that feel left out, and could have been explored a bit further. The team gets their powers way too easily; we get the traditional training montage of the team using their powers, and we've seen it done before. Along with the terrible editing, the writing plays a role in this traditional formula by expanding the timeline of events happening in the movie with no regards with what is going on. This happens, and this happens; it's just formulaic.\n\nNow, with that being said, is there anything good about the movie? Well, the cast does a good job in their roles, and their direction by Josh Trank isn't bad. Plus, the orchestrated score does a nice job setting the tone of the film. But other than that, the film just suffers from the aforementioned problems.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Fantastic Four\" could have easily been given another chance, had the production actually spent some time in the editing room and doing what they want, instead of what we got in its place. Overall, this is is just a fantastic mess.",

            "content": "As an avid comic book reader, I was never fond of the Fantastic Four (established 1961), sure they have some compelling space story lines, but I always felt they worked better in a larger spectrum with other Marvel characters (in the comics). Whether it is Reed geeking out with his other science bros like Tony Stark (Iron Man), Dr Hank Pym (Ant Man) & Peter Parker (Spider-Man) or when the Thing takes (or at least tries) on the Hulk or Invisible Woman/ Sue Storm aka Sue Richards having an undeniable chemistry with Namor (Marvels version of Aquaman) or Logan (Wolverine), this four characters (including Johny Storm aka Human Torch) just together living as a family never really interested me much. Well except for the exception of their main antagonist Dr Doom (IGN ranked him as #4 on best villains of all time). But yet as a huge fan of the super hero genre, it is disappointing to see how despite millions of fans (& story lines),  the Fantastic Four have never seen a good Big screen adaptation. There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies), which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's terrible (Update: the movie has found its way online). Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the 'Barbershop' movies director Tim Story was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was pretty enjoyable yet, Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at least the most talked about. Nevertheless, the film was a box office success enough to guarantee a 2007 sequel 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)' which was pretty awful.  'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise. That brings us up to date with 2015's reboot directed by Josh Trank. Trank's only other credit was the awesome \"found footage\" superhero film 'Chronicle', but supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like it's one long set up for something yet to come. Right from the production & the casting (controversial casting of Michael B Jordan, an African American actor in an essential white role), the film has been making news for all the wrong reasons. I think the first major clue for me that this movie was doomed (no pun intended) was, the 1st trailer itself! A super hero film trailer which was not exciting! Even duds like Elektra & Ghost Rider had better looking trailers. Another major clue for me that this movie was doomed was its running time of 100 minutes. Why? Because when you have a film like this - a reboot, where it has to introduce various new characters, set them up and a new premise/universe, the movie isn't going to be an hour and a half long. It's going to be two hours. Those extra twenty- thirty minutes can make a difference. For the record, the first two Fantastic Four movies had around the same running time. The original film was only six minutes longer. But that movie wasn't the best one, either. I reminded myself of X-Men. X-Men was a great movie. It had a similar running time, but not the same task, as it wasn't a reboot, well kinda. Yet as the first installment in a franchise, it did a fantastic job at setting things up. Yet, with Josh Trank at the helm & a talented cast of Miles Teller (who was awesome in Whiplash last year), Kate Mara (exceptional in Netflix' House of Cards), Michael B Jordan (brilliant in Fruitvale Station) & Jamie Bell (excellent in TURN: Washington's Spies), I wanted to give this film a chance despite the wide spread negative reviews pounding the internet. In my opinion, its not as bad as the reviews are pointing it out to be, in the sense its not 'the worst superhero film', like common did everyone forget Batman & Robin, Elektra, Hulk, Iron Man 2 & Catwoman? This is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.  The film's plot really potential & it does manage to have some great moments, but it just takes too much time to become interesting, long enough to make us not care. The story follows young genius, Reed Richards, who at the beginning of the film, working on an experiment that attempts to construct a teleportation device. It was hardly a success as the object they've sent to who-knows-where, never returned. Seven years later, now teenage Reed (Miles Teller) is again trying his luck on the same experiment. The attempt yields a better result but is still dismissed as a magic trick by his high school teacher, but not by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who at that moment, is drawn with utter interest to Richard's experiments. The meeting brings Richard's feet to Baxter Institute where he is joined by Storm's adopted daughter, Sue (Kate Mara), his son, Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and his ex protegee Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), to work in completing a larger and more advanced version of Richard's device. The success of their effort prompts their team to send all of them four to their target alternate universe, but the consequence is far worse than they could imagine. It's easy to dismiss Trank's Fantastic Four as an unfortunate victim of superhero fatigue that emerges in the wake of the continuous influx of superhero movies inundating the big screen, but you can't shrug off its fatal narrative flaws that include unfocused pace and bland character developments. The latter may have been completely covered by the actors playing the two-dimensional characters, but ex-positional defects keep sending them to becoming something the audience might find hard to care about. Perhaps its the ill-contrived rationales behind how all the often-sense-deprived proceedings work, that keeps the film constructing a form, worth-of- attention, or the forced CGI-gimmicks that strip the sense off the moment's supposedly strong sentiments, that hampers its spectators' ability to absorb its message, and thus, feel that the dangers these characters are about to face, is real. Either way, it's difficult to care, much less find reasons why we still should. The running time really is a problem. This film is rushed beyond belief and its plot is nonsensical. The characters' introductions are decent enough, particularly the Fantastic Four, but their roles throughout the rest of the film are disconcerted. Exposition can be tiring, but after the exposition ended and the action was supposed to pick up - it didn't. Second, the plot. As I said above, the film's plot seemed interesting. It had potential and it looked like it could go somewhere, especially considering how superhero movies nowadays have managed to flesh out their stories and make them very enjoyable. There are even hints at awesome things to come at certain points. But the film's in shambles. You hope and feel it will go somewhere, but in its hour and a half running time, it feels so empty. One of the reasons for that is the third thing, the writing. The writing isn't good - the film's climactic conflict feels backed up into the end of the movie, because there wasn't enough time to set it up. The writing caused the pacing to be terrible - transitions between scenes weren't good and some scenes either went on for too long or were far too short. Speaking of \"things\", The Thing is entirely CGI. No make-up, costume or anything - just a giant, naked rock monster. Yes, he's naked, too. Not even any shorts. Huh. But yet, in his shortest screen time, he will probably be the only thing you remember. Did I talk about Doom? I don't get it why cant FOX just stick to his comic book origins? It may sound a bit flashy, but its anything better than what they have been providing us with. Sure the Doom here is way more efficient & creepy than the previous films, but what is with him being this dis grunted blogger, & shouldn't they have mentioned he is going to appear on screen for only five minutes or so. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. There's probably some salvageable remnants left in Fox's previous attempts to bring one of Marvel's most popular superhero team to the big screen. That's maybe what Fox thinks in pushing this new adaptation, given how franchises keep being rebooted and resurrected these days, assuming either lighter or darker takes, to pull away themselves from the shadows of their previous (most often, forgettable) forms. The latter is more evident with this film, as Director Josh Trank, puts a darker spin to it, employing a grittier feel to its plot. While that is true and recognizable, there's no denying of its desperate efforts to emulate its Marvel predecessors. Trank's intention of emphasizing the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. The way the characters get their powers is more interesting and more realistic, and the team is assembled, but they skip any kind of training montage to a single display of their abilities which are not yet honed, we skip all that to introduce the main villain. He is majorly overpowered for reasons unknown, but the action finally begins, only for the movie to end after the first and only super showdown. On the whole, 'Fantastic Four' is a not so fantastic effort to build a franchise! Despite a likeable cast, a weak story,  a cringe worthy script & average special effects, the film turns out to be one of the most disappointing films I have seen all year. To be honest I was really enjoying the movie until the end and it straight up didn't deliver after making us get to know these characters, and making us wait to see the good stuff! I don't think this 'franchise' needs to crossover into any other universe, be it preferably Marvel and not X-Men, as it's got enough potential to hold it's own, and I'd give a sequel a chance because it's a step in the right direction, which is still scheduled for a release on June 2017.",

In this day in age, I thought graphics would be immense, but what we were lift with as an ending product was barely professional CGI effects, and this was partly why this movie was such a fail (don't get me started on the whole Trank and Fox situation). A successful film for me is seeing development in your on screen characters, and again this is where another amount of disappointment originated from. there was just hardly any chemistry, which is so annoying because I loved the casting!!!! Enough of the negativity! this film did also contain some really good scenes, such as when they all got their powers! *Spoiler Alert* although wasn't a fan of Sue not going to Planet Zero, but it was still good! I would watch it again, but I hope for sake of the Blu Ray it comes with an alternate version or extended cut!",

Let's start with the controversies/geek problems: Johnny Storm is African-American? Irrelevant, Michael B. Jordan is a good actor. It is not a faithful adaptation of the source material? As far as I understand this closely follows the Ultimate Version. Josh Trank is a problematic director? Bryan Singer had those problems in the first \"X-Men\" film and everyone loves that. They disrespect these \"iconic\" characters? Honestly this super team is extremely silly and dated due to their 60s origins, and even Marvel killed the F4 comic books as they are so focused in their CU (that is truly a disrespectful move to fans). This looks like the worst super hero film of recent years? Have you seen \"Daredevil\", \"Elektra\", \"Thor\", \"Thor: The Dark World\", \"X-Men Origins Wolverine\", and \"The Incredible Hulk\"?! A comic book film is supposed to be comedic and colorful? The best super hero trilogy - \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\"- is dark and sophisticated; it is not a bad thing to go to this direction, just because it isn't made by Marvel Studios that doesn't mean is awful, but of course it depends on the execution. Is this the worst super hero film of all time? It isn't worse than \"Superman IV\", \"Batman & Robin\", or the examples named earlier. It is the worst Fantastic Four film? Have you seen those last three films?! There is nothing lower than that. \nWith all that being said, \"Fantastic Four\" is a mess. It is horribly edited, the CGI is horrible (I haven't seen CGI this bad in a summer blockbuster since \"X-Men Origins\"), the characters are underdeveloped, the villain is laughable, the second half is dreadful, a rushed and laughably incoherent ending, and it is incredibly short for a comic book film. But even if it suffers from those colossal problems due to the creative issues and the problematic production, this isn't the abomination people claim it is (a lower score than \"Quest for Peace\", \"Pixels\", \"Jupiter Ascending\", and \"Howard the Duck\"? You got to be kidding me). The first half of this film had potential as it has character development, the cast deliver the best performances they could (with the exception being the not so well utilized Kate Mara), some of the imagery is good, the \"Chronicle\" style works perfectly with this characters, and there is even a scene that tries to emulate Cronenberg¬¥s body horror. \n\"Fantastic Four\" is a bad movie, no doubt about it, but it isn't an abomination. It had some potential in the first half but then it all disappeared. Don't pay attention to the RT score or most of the audience reviews, as they are Marvel fan boys who hate every non Marvel comic book film. A bad film that had potential of being a solid film but the result was this mess of film.",

Indeed, the body horror element and the gritty level of realness that Trank brought to this film made it something special... right up until the second half kicks in and then suddenly you have no idea what direction it wants to go. Not to delve too much into the backstage drama that this film went through, but you can't help but wonder who's to blame for squandering such a fresh spin on a superhero property - a meddling studio, or an indecisive director? There were definitely pieces of a good (and probably great) movie in here. It's just that you can see all the glue that is loosely pinning the bad bits onto the good bits. Not only was the movie rewritten and reshot DURING filming, but entire scenes and set pieces that were already shot were dumped in favour of the studio's vision for a better movie. Which is a real shame! The first half was sooooo decent, I thought. It's not the worst movie of all time (as some blind haters will have you believe), but I just can't tell anyone to go see this for themselves if they're paying for it.

It has a different vibe. It's not The Avengers and that is good. It has its own character. It has humor, subtle humor, youthful humor. It doesn't have to be in your face, it just has to be there and it is. The team as a team was not expected to be fully functioning -it's an origin story. The main actors were exceptional, especially Miles Teller and Kate Mara. The story was compartmentalized; the first part worked just as it should have; the different tone and set, gave it character. The second part also hit its mark: the science, the depiction of powers. All these were very well done. The third part of the movie, though, felt rushed. Victor's motives were not questionable; the stage had been set for what he wanted since the beginning. I did not mind his depiction as a mad/creepy genius, essentially, but there was something rushed about its conclusion. The visual effects were sometimes satisfying, others, a bit disappointing, that much is true. But other than a hurried ending, and slightly unsure pacing, the movie did not suffer at all. As an origin story, it served the characters well. Not everything has to be an over-the-top colorful firework of a superhero movie. If it was up to me, I would not give up on these characters. If the creators learn from their mistakes, I expect the sequel to be a lovely experience.",

            "content": "\"It's clobberin' time,\" said someone to the prospects of this being a successful movie franchise.\n\nI've never been particularly close to the FF. I have only a couple trades (because my favorite writer was involved), and I generally think higher of the previous two movies than others. What '05's FF and it's sequel got right, I think, was the sense of family amongst the characters. Whether or not related by some biological or legal technicality, they still cared about each other; their rapports and relationships were very apparent. When Johnny made fun of Ben, sure the Thing would get angry, but we understood that Johnny still loved Ben like a brother/cousin/what-have-you. We did not get this in the latest installment.\n\nWhat we get is a Reed Richards whose more of a thoughtless jerk, a Sue Richards that needs to abandon emotions to show how smart she must be (which has been done with female characters in other movies), and a Ben Grimm who we come close to feeling for, but is otherwise unmolded as a character. Johnny Storm cracks a little wise, but he doesn't seem to know or get along with Ben as well as he should. His first scene with his sister, and they don't even make eye contact! What's that about?! (Side note: With an adopted Storm child, that could've only *emphasized* the themes of family...but again, they weren't really played strongly in this venture.)\n\nVictor Von Doom may not've been the blogger I kept hearing he was, but he seemed to jump to \"destroy the world\" style villain with little back up. I get that he didn't want \"the evil government\" to pollute the alternate world, but destroying Earth is too big a jump for the first in what (they'd hoped) would be multiple movies. In this character's case, it'd be a refreshing twist if they'd made him a dictator.\n\nNow, there were a few moments that weren't absolutely horrible. Reed not knowing what a fist-bump is, Johnny ripping on Victor, and even some elements of the final battle were decent. But then you have heads exploding, in a movie that's supposed to be about Marvel's First Family, and it just reeks of over-effort for \"edginess\". Seriously people, watch it before letting your kids see it. You shouldn't have to for an FF movie, but this time, you absolutely do.\n\nIf nothing else, let this be a cautionary tale to all future comic book movies: Grey, sterile environments, darkened or jet-black costumes, heaps of cynicism and moral ambiguity, hyper-/extreme/graphic violence and people looking more depressed or angry while hardly ever smiling, doesn't work in every property. The reason people have enjoyed the Fantastic Four for as long as they have, is because of their family bonds, the light-heartedness and, yes, even silly aspects of comics. The same is true of the likes of Shazam/Captain Marvel, Superman, and numerous others. Making things, \"dark\", \"gritty\", \"edgy\" and \"more real\" doesn't always work for escapist entertainment, or at least not in every facet of the plot and characters. A bad story will be apparent no matter how \"hip\" you try to mask it.\n\nBleakness of visual, characteristic and narrative tones is not \"realism\". It's just depressing. Hint hint, Warner Bros./DC!",

            "content": "Fantastic Four is the newest superhero film to be released and stars Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell. It is the third live action Fantastic Four movie and is a reboot of the Fantastic Four series. I have never been a fan of Fantastic Four. I never read the comics and I didn't like the previous two movies. We have all heard the bad buzz surrounding this film. From the film's director, Josh Trank, showing up drunk on set to studio interference, most of the buzz surrounding the film has been bad. I also was not impressed by the trailers and so I walked into the film with very low expectations. With all that said, Fantastic Four is one of the worst superhero films ever made. The film is nothing but exposition and attempting to set up a movie universe like the Avengers. Everything about this film is terrible.\n\nThe characters themselves are terrible. They are all boring and suffer under this terrible script. They don't have any chemistry with each other. Even though they are supposed to be a team, nobody really seems to like each other and you never really get that team feeling from them. The cast however is very talented and they do the best they can with what they have which isn't much. The cast's decent performances are the only somewhat redeemable thing in this movie.\n\nThe villain of the movie is Dr. Doom who is one of the worst super villains to ever appear on the big screen. From the very first time we meet Dr. Doom he is a rude and boring jerk with no villain motivation. A good villain should be likable despite the fact that he's the villain but Dr. Doom is so bland and boring. He also looks terrible, his suit basically melds into his body so he looks like he's covered in green plastic and doesn't even have a moveable mouth. He is about as far away as they possibly could have made him from being the Dr. Doom from the comics. Basically how he becomes Dr. Doom is (and trust me I'm not spoiling anything) is that he touches some green liquid which causes a huge eruption and makes the team run to their spaceship and he gets left behind. He's gone for the entire middle act and then a year later, they go back to the planet, and find him, and bring him back to earth. He immediately starts killing everyone and says he feels at home on the other planet and wants to basically rebuild Earth on the other planet. But why? There isn't any set up for any of this at all. Yes, he was always a jerk, but he wasn't homicidal and there is no reason whatsoever for him to want to kill people and destroy earth, it's so rushed. \n\nThe film has terrible dialogue as well. At one point, Reed Richards is trying to convince the team to steal the machine they can use to go to the other dimension. The problem is that they have been forbidden from doing this and Ben Grimm says \"Hey man, we can't do that because they will find out we left\". and Reed's response is \"Hey man, don't worry about it because by the time they realize were gone, we will already be back\"! The way he said that made it sound like they were about to sneak out to go to some party down the street but I'm like dude your going to a different dimension, that's a little bit different. Another horrible example is when they need something from the government and the government agent says \"What if we say no\"? and the Thing growls like he's a dog and Human Torch says \"Say yes\". Shut up Human Torch, just get out of here.\n\nThe film visually is terrible. The CGI is some of the worst effects to put to film. The character designs of the Human Torch and the Thing were the worst. It looks so fake, there is nothing convincing about it. The lighting is terrible as well, most of the movie is so dark, and there is a blue lens over the camera for a good portion of the runtime making the whole film look dreary and depressing. The film had a budget of one hundred and twenty two million dollars. Ant Man had a budget of only eight million more dollars and that film visually is excellent. You would think that with this money behind it they could make the CGI just a little bit better.\n\nThe script for the film is of course the main problem. The movie itself is so short for a superhero film being barely ninety minutes. The film is just so boring. There really is nothing but talking the whole time and there is next to no action. The only real action is at the end when the Fantastic Four has to fight Dr. Doom but it's not really a fight it's more of a dance. They just dance around with Dr. Doom for thirty seconds and then SPOILERS! Dr. Doom dies because the Thing punches him into an energy beam. It's just so stupid and lazy. The film is so serious as well, there isn't anything fun or lighthearted at all about it and it makes the movie so unenjoyable. The characters aren't' even referred to by their superhero names or even the Fantastic Four until the very end where they don't even say the full name, they just hint at it because they're so embarrassed they're just trying to finish the movie.\n\nOverall, Fantastic Four was god awful and it has nothing to offer anyone. There is a sequel for this film planned in 2017. Don't expect to see the sequel to film in 2017 but instead expect to see a reboot in 2023.\n\nFinal Rating: 1/5 Terrible.",

We have seen all these elements before and done better. It's not that it's horrible or anything it's just damn mediocre and could have been so much more. It ends up being just a bit more stale than the adaptions with Evans and Alba which I never thought I would say here. And the character development has absolutely no heart. It's hard to feel anything for these characters when they are so cookie cutter. I love the actors at hand here, but this is something one does not need to see if you have seen their story before. The slightly positive here, i will say is that it did make want to see the next chapter in this story that felt like 1/3 of a decent film.",

Josh Trank (Chronicle, a far better movie) is out of his element here, crafting a dull, nonsensical, morose reboot of, in hindsight, an immensely better saga.\n\nMiles Teller is Reed Richards, a teenage scientist with an invention: a teleportation device, created with the aid of pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, who seems out of place here). Together, they catch the eye of Dr. Franklin Storm (The Wire's Reg E. Cathey) and adopted daughter Susan (Kate Mara, in a noticeable wig) at a science fair and are shipped off to the \"Baxter Institute\". There, they meet Franklin's biological son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan, also of Chronicle) and hilariously-named Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell, who makes the previous movies' Julian McMahon look like Olivier). Together, these young scientists create a machine, which transports matter to \"Planet Zero\", said to be a home to great energy. \n\nOf course, they go. Reed, Johnny, Ben, and Victor all travel to the other world, where everything goes wrong: Victor is presumed dead, and the other three (and Susan, who was impacted by energy that they brought back) receive powers. Reed can bend, twist, and elongate his body. Johnny has the ability to burst into flames. Susan can shift in and out of visibility, and can also create force fields, and Ben is entirely composed of rock, and is, as a result, very strong. They're all fine - their \"biochemistry is off the charts\", whatever that means - and are sent into combat by the government, including a shady, gum-chewing Tim Blake Nelson.\n\nHang on, did you really think von Doom was dead? Of course not, and he looks like a metallic red skull - in other words, ridiculous. His eyes glow green. It's laughable.\n\nI'm not joking when I say that some of the lines in this movie are atrocious. \"There is no Victor. There is only doom!\" \"All this power, and he's the source!\" Yuck. The screenplay is credited to three, including Simon Kinberg, and he should know better - he's written smarter, better films than this, including last year's terrific X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nDon't see this movie. The CG is spotty, the characters weak, the acting extremely poor, and the writing and direction reeking of Uwe Boll. It's a step back for the team in film, and it makes Tim Story's installments with Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba look like The Avengers in comparison.\n\nRATING: 1 out of 10",

I found the movie's plot (if there was even one to begin with) to be choke full of plot holes and inconsistencies; the actors' performances looked really bland and so devoid of emotion at times, that I Just couldn't make any kind of emotional investment or connection with any of the characters. The movie as a whole (save for maybe the ending climax) was so lacking in soul, I almost fell asleep halfway through the viewing. And the fact that most of the scenes in the film just takes place in a giant lab didn't help either. Just about the only saving grace from this film was the splendid soundtrack, composed by the duo Marco Beltrami/Philip Glass. Looking back at this film, it really makes me wish they had just continued with the original Fantastic Four cast from before. Hiro's Score: 1/5",

The cast is incredible, they might not have been the ones I would have pictures in these roles, but they are still talented and interesting actors. The way they approached the characters and their relationships was also interesting and it sort of made sense to me. The fact that they were all outsiders in their own way, them being wickedly smart and kind of awkward was an idea that I could have lived with. There's also the \"scaryish\" elements in the movie that I liked. It felt like they were monsters, they were strange, and all of these ideas were potentially good ones but the execution was botched.\n\nThe pace was so F-ing slow for two third of the movie, and once there's a little bit of action it ends. At times it was obvious that some scenes were cut short, some bits of dialogues annoyed the hell out me. Fox had all of the right ingredients to make an awesome movie but they sorely missed.

These heroes are ridiculous, have fun with it. But it tried to be the Dark Knight of the series and failed miserably. The script is pretty laughable, the relationships between characters feel awkward and forced. This doesn't feel like a team, they feel like some strange people forced to work together. The first hour is tedious, it takes forever for anything to happen and when something does happen (getting their powers) it's hilariously bad. So then the movie flashes forward a year instead of being smart and letting us see how this team learned to control these unique abilities and work together. The final act of this movie was the final nail in the coffin for the movie, Dr. Doom (who looks awful) wants to destroy the world for rushed and unexplained reasons. He now has a full suit and wants to be called \"Doom\" (HOW SCARY!). So the final fight lasts no more than 2 minutes with the team beating him up, then it ends with some cringeworthy dialogue. So it sets up a sequel so much it doesn't even try to be good. It's dull, uninteresting, and feels like it was written and directed by a 5 year old. Fantastic Four ts .5/5 stars (F).",

I can also understand that it is always best to be absolutely fair no matter how much shit the press, critics, and even Rotten Tomatoes tell you how bad a movie is before its release. If you are a true fan of comics that you like, it is only fair to go see it in theaters at least once. I am an open minded person when it comes to these sorts of negative reviews, but this is something where I have to agree with the 98% of the overall critic's out there. I mean GAWD DAMN what in the blue freaking hell did I just watch an over hour ago? So the premise for this one is that FOX decided to change up the origin story a bit by giving these four their powers not from outer space, but in another dimension. Alright, that's fine and dandy because it is a nice change of pace and takes a chapter from the Ultimate Fantastic Four storyline. But everything after that, well.... FOX should just sell the rights back to Marvel already so they can clean up after their filthy ass mess.\n\nThis film had me going for a little bit with Reed and Ben's origin to showing off how smart he is. But after they get to the Baxter building scenes it is drawn out for so long with a montage of them just working together for a long time and it takes the movie almost AN HOUR for them to get their powers. After that it's just like they spend a year of their lives working for the government doing black ops missions, to one of them being on the run because he escaped, and even their base of operations is a military base itself that the US government just hands over it to them. That is NOT how you write a Fantastic Four story! Not to mention altering almost every single main character in here from Dr. Doom looking like a greasy hacker with authority issues, to Sue Storm being ADOPTED from Kosovo, to Tim Blake Nelson who should have been the Mole Man but wasn't. I had no problem with Michael B. Jordan as the Human Torch, but I kind of wished he would have done more with that character like make out with a random hot chick or prank the Thing behind his back. The only thing the I like about this where the their super powers which were good, especially from Sue Storm which I thought was a lot better than Jessica Alba's powers. But overall, there were so many changes to these characters and so many alterations that I would actually much rather prefer to watch any of the other three previous Fantastic Four films than watch this abomination of a comic book movie. Which is why I give this one sad lonely little star.",

These characters deserve to have a great movie made about them, and I thought that, perhaps, the reviewers were being too critical.

Honestly, my rating would be a lot higher if that was intentional instead of unsatisfyingly unfinished. Still, Johnny's character was the most disappointing. He's always been a hunk and the strongest reason my friend and I went to see the film. He starts off as a rebellious grumpy race car driver, and shifts almost abruptly to the nicest member of the team. The short montage of the members working together isn't enough for the character shift. It was almost whiplash. Doom is an appropriate skeez the entire time. No complaints there. Ben was perfect.

Soon, I'm certain, you'll achieve a certain cult status, and be seen and judged more objectively. My advice for the future: develop your characters (it'll be nice to know who they are and what their motivations are); mold a steadier plot (you were a little erratic in that area); get out and see the sun (too dark); also have some fun (the world isn't as bleak as you believe, besides, you have a family that loves you).

The first was Super Friends, and the other was Fantastic Four. \n\nI can't stress enough how ridiculous the backlash has been for this film. I made the mistake of accidentally catching the review consensus this time before watching it--something I absolutely hate doing. But I did, and therefore spent the entirety of the film expecting it to be terrible. It's no Godfather, but it's not The Last Airbender either. This movie is entertaining, riveting, visually stunning, and far more inventive with its origin than the previous series.\n\nWith a much darker take on the classic comic book series, director Josh Trank has us immersed in a world that's already somewhat dystopian. High school genius, Reed Richards (Miles Teller), gets recruited to a team who is developing a machine that can teleport organic matter to an alternate world. He, along with Sue (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), gets super powers from the energy contrived by this mysterious world. \n\nAs filmgoers, we tend to take each adaptation of a film as the definitive version. This doesn't happen in literature. While Frank Miller did catch some flak for darkening Batman in his Dark Knight Returns graphic novels, overall the feedback was positive and today he is credited by many for revamping the series.\n\nThis new Fantastic Four isn't perfect by any means. The dialogue is shoddy, the setup takes up 2/3 of the film, and there isn't enough action to satisfy a room full of Comic-Con attendees, but I couldn't stop watching. The first 45 minutes or so feature some of the best cinema I've seen all year--full of mystery and intrigue. While I grew up with the cartoon version of the Fantastic Four, I have an appreciation for the dismal tone of this film. It's something new and edgy. \n\nI did feel, however, that the direction is a little sloppy. As much as I love Miles Teller, I feel like I'm watching some of his bad takes rather than a final cut. Also, there is no purpose for using a CGI monkey over a real one.\n\nBut overall, I would watch this film again. It has one of the best Marvel movie villains to date. And although most of this film is a setup, it takes one for the team and provides a solid foundation for future films in this series.\n\nTwizard Rating: 81",

What the f*ck were they thinking. There was no back story to this, zero, and I'm not exaggerating, literally zero explanation as to why Reed richards is a super genius child and why for some reason there is advanced scientific parts in a junk yard in America, why johnny has a car that he loves so much and that he apparently wants badly so he'll work for a scientific organisation rather than doing something else and why susan has about as much facial expression as Bella from twilight. I cannot believe how much this movie infuriated me. Doctor Doom, no explanation as to why he hates the earth so much, he's just some hipster loner douchebag who is a dick and hates the earth for some bizarre unknown reason. And the thing, another loner with an abusive background (at least SOME background my god) and not one redeemable quality too him makes him seem relevant or cool. Oh and by the way, this movie is 90% having awkward conversations and 10% actually doing fights. What a steaming pile of dogwank.",

However is it as bad as critics and fans say alike? No, not even close. I'll admit, I didn't hate the movie. I was deeply disappointed, but I didnt' hate it. The whole film for one is way too short and for two a whole lot of nothing happens. The movie as a whole feels just like one big set up for something bigger and throughout the whole venture you expect just that; something more. It's the epic Blue balls of Comic book film history. A terrific cast squandered on a soul less origin story. You are never invested in any of these characters. Nobody's personality pops out as particularly special or interesting. Then ending, which comes out of left field is tacked on and pointless. It's one of those oh yeah we forgot this a comic book movie and we have to put a villain in here to fight and defeat, but it's all just bandage dressing. The wound had already been bleed out by this time and they were just putting a bandaid on a tourniquet. I'll say this however, if this film was a pilot for a series on Sci fi channel or Fox, it would have worked. And mostly thats where the problem lies. It doesnt feel cinematic. In a comic book world of Captain America and even fox's own X men it just doesnt feel big enough. Who knows? Maybe Fantastic Four might be better served as a weekly television series or even a event series on Netflix. That would give the creators more time to flesh out it's ideas, themes and even it's characters. Because as it stands this film is unsatisfactory. Again, not good, but it isnt the worst Comic book film every made. I'm tempted to say it's at least better than the other two efforts. But saying this film is better than those two films is like saying being shot in the head is better then dying by lighting yourself on fire.",

I loved this movie by the way coz it has all the things I love on a movie (I admit it doesn't have enough humor in it but that's even better to me, since I admire drama films more somehow). Yes, sometimes the rhythm of the movie (the pace) is slow but I feel is not the cast's fault (maybe is more of the director in this case that did not told them to move on and go a bit quickly on the lines OR the one who wrote the script...let's face it, there were 3 fade outs that were not ment to be, not well edited maybe, but I forgive that). The music score...now that's another story. That was brilliant and well done. I need this soundtrack for real. I loved it ;D Oh, and the cast did wonderfully (with what they had at hand). They took each of their roles seriously even if the script has a few flaws. That was very pro of them. Anyway, if they do another one, I would watch it, why not? Coz it doesn't have the cast with the one we grew up in? Coz is not Disney/Marvel? I will watch it coz I love 7th art and coz if it has the themes I enjoy and love the most, count me in.

The Fantastic Four are left to fight Dr. Doom before he destroys Earth by sucking all matter into the alternate dimension. As a reboot, I thought this film was flat and hollow. The character development is not near what it should be, and the underdeveloped characters make for underdeveloped action sequences. The final confrontation is not nearly satisfying enough, and it feels like the film goes by in a blur. This is watered down version of more competent Fantastic Four films. Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan (That Awkward Moment) are out of place in this film and look older than the teenagers they play. We didn't need a Fantastic Four reboot but got one anyway.

I had a feeling while watching that the film was a straightforward sci-fi flick instead of a superhero movie, and I liked it based on that. In a way the film would have been better if I had never heard of the Fantastic Four. Summing up, it's a character driven sci-fi movie that turns into a generic superhero climax. I was hoping for some philosophical resolutions instead violence, but that's just what I wanted and that may not be a fair expectation from me.",

I wanted to see the Fantastic Four together as a team but it really felt force at the end when they got together. Dr. Doom was the most stupidest character ever.! and looked nothing like the character in the comic, some of the stuff that was in the preview wasn't even put into the final cut of the film it was just complete disaster and the story was very weak and felt rushed but stretched out, honest truth about 90% of the film was just drama and the rest 10% was action but either way the action wasn't great and especially that final battle sequence with Dr. Doom with bad Computer Graphics and Green Screen it was just a movie that came out on a cheap Television network. I wanted more from this movie and it didn't deliver and i understand the hate this film is getting with False Advertisement. As much i love Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell, and Kate Mara who isn't all that bad but I felt that each actor was miscast for their characters. 1/5. Don't rush to go see this movie, don't even pay to watch it on discount day, this is a movie that you should watch on TV if it comes on.",

But I will dissect this character by character first off Miles Teller as Mr. Fantastic he was excellent in Whiplash and good in this film, Next is Kate Mara as The Invisible Woman great performance by her but whats up with the hair could the hair stylist decide what type of hair she had good lord! Michael B Jordan as Human Torch was kinda like human torch I guess, Next is Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm/The Thing he was great as Grimm but when it came to The Thing it seemed like he enjoyed being a giant rock monster!

Yes, Marvel manage to keep the genre sparky and fun most of the time, but the X Men films and the recent Spider-Man films have been a bit of a chore. \nIt doesn't seem that long ago that we had Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans fail to set the screen alight with a competent but very dull pair of films. This time the cast are younger - yes, it's that unoriginal idea 'The Origin Story'. *sigh*\nIn an unnecessarily long opening sequence we meet Reed Ricards and Ben Grimm meeting as kids, when Reed tries to build a teleporter. Skip forwards a few years and they are recruited by Professor Storm to assist his daughter Sue and maverick student Victor Von Doom to build a transport device to visit a different dimension. The lads decide to be the first to make the trip once the device is finished - but leave sweet little Sue at home. Unfortunately, the trip goes wrong, Victor is lost and the other three end up with weird powers. Sue has reached the lab at this point and gets hit with a blast too. Stretchy man Reed escapes but the others become government guinea pigs. Time to revisit the alternate dimension - but an old friend is waiting for them...\n\nThis film is not quite a bad as I thought it might be from the bad press. The problem is it has no humour and not much real excitement. The end battle is predictably crash bang but amazingly naff. Sue's floating bubbles look really stupid. The stretchy arms SFX is barely better than a cartoon and Jamie Bell's Thing is...well, just a lump of rock!  The pacing of the film is all wrong as we spend far too long with the build up to the kids getting their powers but hardly any decent USE of their superpowers. One nice gun battle with Miles Teller bending his way round bullets, but that is about it. Poor Kate Mara is mis-used about the worst, the script making her a very boring character - yet of course the young men must fall for her as she is the traditional comic-book token girl. Mara looks half asleep most of the time and barely cracks a smile. Miles Teller shows even he has him limitations. I've never been a big Jamie Bell fan. To me he's always been a one trick pony - a career made from one great role as a kid - Billy Eliot - and never been particularly good in anything else. Here he is barely onscreen as himself although if he is inside the motion capture suit for Ben I guess it gave him a job! \n\nIf there is one good thing to come out of the huge flop of this film, will it be for Hollywood to PLEASE try to see beyond comic books and action. There is a line of thought that the more creative and interesting work is being done on TV these days, and when you compare films like this uninspiring, turgid mess to Orange is the New Black, Transparent or Sens8 on Netflix and Amazon or Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones or even the much more interesting TV superhero shows like Arrow, The Flash, Agent Carter or Daredevil on Netflix, it is hard to see the relevance of Hollywood films like this if you are not a straight, young, white male.\n\nUninspired and uneven. Please don't bother with the sequel. PLEASE!",

This  movie had great promise starting off. For the first hour off the movie they slowly show you the characters and you get a sense of where they come from which is nice since this is supposed to be an origins story. Unfortunately they don't give you enough back story on them or give you a reason to care about them. After the first hour they introduce Doom and that's where the movie drops off. It just doesn't feel like it was where the movie was going. I hope Fox learns that what they did to this movie ruined it, and will hopefully either do better in Fantastic 4 2 or sell the rights back to Marvel.

Nothing really happens for the first hour, stuff kinda randomly happens for the second half hour, and then it's over.

It had a good story going for it with the idea of inter-dimensional travel, and some decent cautionary undertones about how the government can have skewed priorities. Then they had the accident, and it all went downhill form there. The story was suddenly rushed, the undertones became painful overtones, the character choices suddenly made no sense, and they stuck the final peg in destroying what little semblance the characters had to their comic book counterparts.\n\nReed's character in the second half was inconsistent, Sue's bland as hell, Johnny's a selfish and rebellious ass, and Victor Von Doom is miles away from who his character is in the comics. The only one remotely true to the comics is Ben, but that's one out of five, which isn't good. Add to it that there's nothing that makes Sue and Johnny seem anything like they're siblings, the fact that there's absolutely no real feeling of them being a team until that five minute climax, and said climax and ending being so rushed it's like a case of whiplash, and you get a Fantastic Four movie that's even worse than the first one.\n\nIf they had taken the first half of the movie and extended it into something of its own design (along with some tweaking to the writing and characters), this would have been a great film about the discovery of another dimension. But no, Fox decided to grip onto the Fantastic Four copyrights like an eight year old refusing to let go of a toy and yelling \"MINE!\" They got greedy with wanting another comic book movie franchise and now they're paying the price with hilariously under-performing box office numbers and well-earned bad reviews, as they deserved.",

Fox have somehow managed to miss the mark with this franchise yet again.\n\nThe first feature length cinematic release of the Fantastic Four I thought was solid. I am in the small minority who actually liked the Tim Story Fantastic Four. Was it great? No. It wasn't even good, it was just solid, it gave a faithful origin story to Marvel's first fully formed Superhero family. Jessica Alba's casting aside I thought it ticked the right boxes for a Fantastic Four origin story even if it lost it's way towards the end, with lots of logic issues cropping up.\n\nNow fast forward 10 years, we get this piece of nonsense. This film is just meh!, that's what it is. The film is too dark for a Fantastic Four film with exploding heads definitely pushing the 12A rating's boundaries. The characters have very little personality. Yes it's more serious compared to the cartoonishness of the original, but still did they need to be so bland. \n\nIn the 2005 version Chris Evan's was a saving grace he captured the essence of his character, the prankster, the ladies man, the hot headed, the care free lifestyle in essence he made you believe in his relationships with those around him. In this film Michael B. Jordan's Johnny Storm is a hot head not much more, he's angsty with daddy issues and has no chemistry with Mara whatsoever.\nKate Mara, Miles Teller and Toby Kebbel are all solid with their roles unfortunately the story gives them very little to work with. Jamie Bell should have been the stand out, but unfortunately he is very lifeless in his stop-motion work, and his character reflects the darkness of the film. \n\nThe original film took a lot of flak for Michael Chiklis' character and the prostethics used, I personally thought he did well with his character and could be related to. This film sees him start off (ahem) grim and continue all the way through until the last five minutes. In general the film lacked the humour which was frowned upon in the original film.\n\nOverall an unengaging film too dark for it's own good, with serviceable action and characters, the actors and the audience really did deserve better.",

Jordan, Miles teller, Jamie Bell and Kate Mara\n\n\tPlot Summary\n\tReed Richards is a really good scientist - even at an early age.  During his school years, he creates a portal to another dimension.  But it doesn't work very well and it causes a black out.\n\tYears later, he's given a second chance.  Now an adult, he is able to perfect his portal to another dimension.  While the military and other big pocket companies watching, he successfully tests the machine, sending a monkey to the other dimension and back.\n\tBut Reed isn't happy when his work is going to be used by others - and not by him and his friends.  So he gathers up the other guys in the group - Johnny, Ben, and Victor - to be the first humans to visit the other dimension.\n\tWhen they get there, they start looking about at some strange goings on (a really bad idea).  And when they poke around at the energetic phenomenon going in front of them, things go wrong.  \n\tThere's lot of explosions and a whole lot of strange energy being tossed about.  Reed and company have to bail out.\n\tHowever, Victor doesn't make it back with the rest of the group - and when they do make it back, the trip fundamentally changes them (along with Sue who was remote piloting the device back from the other dimension)\n\tThis is how they become the Fantastic Four - and they are put in lockdown by the military (except that Reed escapes and is now a fugitive.)\n\tAnd things take a turn for the worse when Victor makes a re-appearance as Doom.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tThere's not much going on between these four.  I get that Reed and Ben are best friends.  But outside of that, there's not much chemistry between the four of them - most notably between Reed and Susan.  SCORE: 4\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tDoom is supposed to be one of the most iconic villains in the Marvel universe.  But even though he has a great look, he comes across as your typical bad guy out destroying the world.  And the rest of the cast isn't much better than that.  SCORE: 2\n\nPlot\n\tThe first act of the story is great - when Reed and Company go into the other dimension.  However, the rest of the film feels like a Cliff's Notes version of a much longer story.  Main details are left out, and the main plot felt rushed. \n\tWhat's even worse is the final battle is a major letdown.  SCORE: 2\n\nOriginality\n\tThis feels like a second rate Marvel film - and there are a lot of them that's out now on demand or streaming or whatever.  SCORE: 3\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThere's a lot of scenes where the Thing and the Human Torch battle tanks and planes - but it feels like they should be fighting something more meaningful.  Besides the last fight is resolved via a bunch of mumbo jumbo rules that don't make any sense (to me).  SCORE: 2\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis is supposed to be about how a group of friends and family form a unique fighting force for the good guys.  But they spend so little time together after getting their powers that the message is lost.  SCORE: 3\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 16\t\t% Score: 26.67%\n\tThis is a Marvel Film?  Really?

I think my expectations are what's killing this, and let's be fair. Technically being a 3rd (if you count the mid-90's mess as the original) reboot for the franchise isn't helping at all.\n\nWhat it got right: I liked how they presented the powers. Compared to the last outing for FF where everything felt \"cartoony\", they did a good job presenting their abilities in the film. From Sue's ability to control things to Grimm actually looking more hardcore and beefy...I think they did the groups power sets justice. Also, the plot was ok...but read my next section for the downside of this. The characters were good and the acting was fine except for the occasional forced cheesy-ness.\n\nWhat it go wrong, sort of: They spent too much time in the beginning of the film trying to ground and flesh out characters without actually doing so. By the time you get to the meat of what you really came to see, it's way too rushed. The conflict is done in 20 minutes, leaving you with roughly an hour and 20 minutes of attempts to make the film overly serious. They could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and their relationships...and they honestly should have been able to do it faster. But even if not faster, they could've extended the movie easily by another 20-30 minutes and really fleshed out the conflict and ending, giving movie goers more to bite down into. The story wasn't bad, it was just far too rushed after the slow start.\n\nHowever, to say it was abysmal...that's a stretch. When I watched Elektra, I couldn't even finish it the first time. The second and final time I watched it, I regretted finishing it and wanted my wasted time back. Did I enjoy Fantastic Four? Sure. Could it have been better? Absolutely. However, I'm kind of upset because I didn't think it was \"that\" bad, and now that it's on a road to failure (critically), I'll likely never see this franchise again...which is kind of sad since it's one of my favorite Marvel groups.\n\nIf you like comic movies, and are just looking for a good time without oscar performances and the highest caliber story...then you'll probably enjoy this about as much as I did. If I had to give a reason \"not\" to see it, it's mostly because this input into the Marvel catalog of movies will unfortunately be forgotten and left for dead...so don't expect to see #2 in 2017 like it was originally slated.",

Needless to say my expectations were at an all time low, especially after the films director tweeted that it wasn't his film we would be watching but a studio hack job that had been hijacked mid way through the filming and editing process.\n\nThe first hour of the film, I was thinking the critics were being too hard on this movie. The set up of the characters was actually well done, with the exception of doom and Johnny storm, the concept and tone Trank was working with did have a cool sci-fi horror thriller feel to it, but after the climatic trip to the \"other universe\" (not a spoiler it's in the trailer people) the film completely unravels and goes from the cool sci-fi horror flick and reverts back to the shitty campy movies from the early 2000's.\n\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that everything about this movie screams B-list SyFy movie of the week. For the most part the movie is boring, the soundtrack is dull, the action is almost non existent,  and whoever edited and worked on costume design on this piece of shit movie shouldn't be aloud to work on a super hero film ever again.\n\nThe outfits of the \"fantastic four\" weren't bad per say but they were very basic and forgettable; Doom's look on the other hand was horrible. He looked like a combination of the robot from Metropolis and Imhotep from the Mummy remake got a hold of some kryptonite.\n\nThe Thing didn't impress me like he seemed to everyone else, his look was just passible in my eyes and the sound of him matched with his mouth movement was god awful.\n\nI keep reading in reviews that this is by far the best Fantastic 4 movie and there I'm going to have to disagree. As bad the last two films were there was at least fluidity, humor,  and accessibility. Yes the movies weren't good but at least young kids, who watch shitty movies and TV shows anyway, could still watch it and have fun with them or at least it was a campy movie that the family can go pick up from redbox when the cable goes out, this film just sucks for everybody.\n\nI know what your thinking,  but the trailers looked pretty good, and I agree with you. I would say about half the things you see in the trailer are NOT in this film so if your basing your decision on seeing this movie on that, I wouldn't. This movie isn't Superman Returns type of bad but I put it is right on par with Ang Lee's Hulk, and by far is 20th century Fox's worst Marvel film to date.\n\nIt's too bad we will probably never see the film Josh Trank was making, and if the first half of this film is any indication of the route he was going, I'm sure he would of given us an interesting film like his 1st on Chronicle.\n\nI would pass on this one, unless it's to check out how much of an epic fail this movie is or just watch the first part of the film and leave, becuase trust me whatever you come up with in your imagination will be better than what happens in the second half.",

I think the reason it has scored so low is either because  the critics are five year old children who prefer the god awful, cheesy as hell Tim Story version which had an overweight middle aged short bloke in a halloween costume instead of The Thing, or they just wanted to be hammered with over the top cgi action scenes. What I think is that the critics haven't realised that It isn't supposed to be the same sort of film as the Avengers or Iron Man, which I do think are great films by the way, its just that this is a different type of film which although it does have good (if not many) action scenes it's more focused on introducing the characters and the origin story as a whole, which would then lead to an amazing sequel (if they make one). It's not cheesy, like the previous incarnation and it does have some amazing scenes. Yes it could have been better, maybe if it had extended the final battle, or kicked in a bit earlier on, but all in all the film worked for me, it was so much better than I expected it to be after reading the reviews. The acting was good, the film looked good and moved at a good pace. It is not really a children's film though, not that it's not suitable it just doesn't try too hard to be funny and it isn 't ridiculously over stuffed with action. I must also add that I read the Fantastic Four comics as a child and I am a big fan so I was aware of the fact that they did stray from the source material some what, but it didn't matter as I was already over this before I even saw the film, and it still worked.\nTo summarise I would say that it's definitely worth watching, and much much better that the previous version.

I think the reason it bombed at the movie is because no one new the stars of this film because they're up and comers, not to mention the original 2 fantastic four movies weren't that big of a success. I think the first half of the movie they did a good job introducing the characters and I thought it was good throughout the end. My only complaint was that they could have done better with the big climatic ending/fight scene. It just seemed rushed but I guess that's to be expected because the first movie in any franchise doesn't have that much action because it introduces you to the characters. I honesty hope the make another one because I think it would be better and more action packed since they won't have the intro of characters. It was good for a marvel movie. If you like the super hero movies you should give it a shot with an open mind.",

Talk about being tacked on. \n\nSince casting was announced, reactions were largely negative despite the actors all being talented in their own right.  Miles Teller portrayed the iconic if not younger Reed Richards quite admirably I must admit though, as was Toby Kebbell's menacing performance as Doctor (Victor Von) Doom.  you can easily tell that the pacing of the film was all jumbled as the first act of the film was in fact the best part of the movie. \n\nDon't think I'll be sitting through this again, unless Director Josh Trank gives us a Directors Cut of the movie, as it looked obvious that outside interference had tampered with Trank's vision of the film.  Mind you, it could have been more serious than it already was.  Ugh, Fox - will you let go of the rights and sell them back to Disney/Marvel if need be.",

It is not that bad as people and critics (whose opinion should not be taken) make it out to be. I say watch it for yourselves and make your own judgment. There are plenty of other very bad movies out there besides this one and this movie did not deserve to be trashed. \n\nNow that that is out of the way, the movie does have some story elements that do not make sense. I do not think it is feasable for a kid to teleport something using a science experiment to another dimension and that some one professional would come to a high  school science fair looking to recruit a genius when he could vet students at MIT or other schools to do so. This is where the movie starts to come into trouble is with the writing. Reed and his friend get recruited and help finish a project started by a former student named Victor Von Doom. In a short summary the team wants to be first to travel to another dimension and as a result, gain powers and are taken in government custody. The movie tends to use this to drive the movie forward and in the end, Victor wants to destroy this planet and start another one. The way in which Victor does so is not clearly explained and this is where many people thought the movie floundered is the final confrontation. It seemed that something was missing and the stakes were not that high. The plot hole of how the four heroes survive on the other dimension is not explained and so is many other things in this movie. \n\nTo say the least, the movie as it is, it is not that bad. I thought it was entertaining to an extent, but I was not overwhelmed or had that sensation of enjoyable emotion from other superhero movies like Man of Steel or the Avengers. I will recommend this movies to fans of superhero movies to rent to see and judge for themselves instead of listening to other people's opinion. It is worth a rental if not, wait for it to debut on cable.",

Even Johnny's \"sass\" seems muted and diluted.

For example, in my opinion, almost everything about Victor von Doom was better, save for the aforementioned motivation problem.

The team name and the nicknames of the team members are never uttered. It takes an hour before they all get their powers and when they do, nothing happens. The main villain doesn't appear until the 75 minute mark and then the climax is rushed into the last ten minutes and then it's over. There is no action or excitement. The cast, who are all talented individually, have no chemistry together and they are too young to be playing these types of characters. The dialogue is laughable and the films takes itself too seriously. A film like Batman can be dark, because it is Batman. Fantastic Four is hardly Shakespeare. Even the Jessica Alba/Chris Evans Fantastic Four knew it was cheesy and went with it. This reboot makes those films look like Citizen Kane. The entire experience was dull, boring, and uneventful. There is no sense of fun, excitement, wonder, and entertainment. You can't have a title with the word Fantastic in it and do the total opposite. I can't believe it was possible, but we have a comic book film that has little to no action or anything comic book related. This is not only the worst comic book film I have ever seen, but it is one of the worst films of the year. \n\nGrade: D-",

If I wanted gray tones, \"realistic\" showcases of superheroes, and an upbeat franchise grit it up, I'd just re-watch \"Man of Steel.\" Marvel films are often light-hearted fair, films like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and the more recent \"Ant-Man\" seem to be aware how ridiculous the very concept of live-action superheroes is, they have fun with their premises and it reflects in the success of the films. \n\nThe Fantastic Four comics and cartoons have always been some of the silliest and light-hearted of Marvel franchises, and this film completely abandons that aspect. The film tries to be \"modern\" but really just goes for gritty and existential, showing how frightening the sudden changes the four go through would be in the real world. That is all well and good if you're watching a Cronenburg or Lynch film, but this is a comic book movie about four friends who get blasted by rays until they can punch through walls, and melt a tank with a flick of the wrist. The director, Trank, claimed on Twitter that a year ago he had a version of the film that was much better, but that we sadly \"will never get to see that version.\" The only response to Trank's whine about the film not doing so great critically is that he should've made that film instead. \n\nWhen news first broke of the re-boot, it was said that it would be a \"modern\" and more \"realistic\" or \"grounded\" retelling of the superhero group. However when it comes to superheroes, most people simply want to have fun. I don't want to look at the Human Torch and feel bad about how his powers have irrevocably changed his life and how he is a military tool, I cant feel sorry for a man who can fly and shoot fireballs (no matter the version, The Thing gets a pass on this). I want to see these all of a sudden powerful people take the gifts they've been given and use them to stand up for a world rendered powerless by the villain (of course Dr. Doom in this one).\n\nThe effects definitely look better than the first two FF films, though that's to be expected ten years later. Plot-wise this film was angsty and the characters rather dull, a disappointment especially when compared to the string of successes Marvel Studios has gone through in the past few years. The film is sure to get a sequel though, and we can only hope the next movie will make up for the problems that plagued this one.",

Most of the cool scenes you see in the commercials like the Thing dropping from a plane... are not in the movie.  the director has disavowed the movie as the studio as a don't blame me, but yet the studio yanked it from him because he was making this a horrible film. there is almost no action in the movie until the near end of exposition and back story. The studio spent movie re-shooting scenes since the movie they were getting was crap, so they put a little polish on this turd hoping to make some money back. Hopefully this director that had little care for the movie never gets handed a big budget film ever again, his handling was so bad, that Disney removed him as a scheduled director a new star wars film.  Don't see this movie where you'd have to pay for it. There is no comradeship among the Four, they barely ahve scenes together and Sue Storm  is hardly a strong female character like she should have been, instead she is a token woman cast member and even to get her powers she doesn't even get to go and teleport, they give her suit to one of the guys instead and she gets her powers by being infected by the team. She's an also ran.  Sad so sad this movie should have been so much better.  A lot of people say the 2005/2007 movies were bad, but I think they were pretty good, sure tehy could have been improved, but they got the characters right, the interplay of Johhny and Ben, and Sue over the boys.

This reboot makes the 2005 version look like an Oscar. In a way, I liked the 2005 version but I had just huge expectations for this one since 2005 was very flawed but Fox managed to make it worse. \n\nThe casting is all wrong. There is literally no chemistry between the actors and there is so many awkward moments that made me shake my head. The actors literally winged the whole movie and hoped for the best out of their acting. Also, the dialogue is so childish and horrible that I literally had to rub my head. \n\nAlso, we are in the freaking 21st century and somehow Fox manages to even make the CGI look like crap. As for the story, this movie shouldn't even be called Fantastic Four. The team doesn't even form till the last 10 minutes of the movie. Also, it takes like more than half the movie to get to the freaking point. Speaking of the end, the last 10 minutes is literally the only action you will get and even then the ending was just terrible. Also, this movie is cliche, boring and predictable.\n\nI can't even believe that I have to say that 2005 Fantastic Four is god. At least the 2005 version has a plot (weak and predictable but there) and actually had some enjoyment to the film with some humor. Also, there was way more action in the older one than this piece of crap. Also, Evans was made to be the Human Torch.\n\nDidn't think for second that I would find a Marvel movie as horrible as Wolverine Origins or Last Stand but this reboot just proved me wrong. Such a huge disappointment from a movie that I didn't have high expectations on but had some faith in. Way to blow it Fox. Hope MCU gets FF back and actually make a quality movie. If you want to see what the hubbub is about wait when it goes on HBO and watch it for free when you literally have nothing in life to do and want to pass about 2 hours of your time doing nothing.

First act is a slow boring drama followed by act two which I could only guess was trying to be a sci-fi horror film, which was the small part that i did find some level of enjoyment. Then we come to the third act...I have no idea what the heck this part of the movie was trying to be but whatever it was, was just an abortion. How act three ended up the way it did is beyond me because even though the tone of acts one and two differ they go together in a way that does make sense. None of the characters feel real, everyone was phoning it in. I saw better acting from the high school drama class. The only special effects that look decent is maybe Thing. Doom looks like a trash bag wearing a trash bag...just dreadful. The final confrontation with Doom is bland and uneventful. This movie was overall a terrible disappointment and is on a level just under straight to DVD, I give this movie an F.",

When you ask someone :\"Name a vilain.\" Do you think \"Von Doom\" is in the Top 10? \nProbably not and the hero is as good as the hero is bad. Get a real vilain, nobody cares about Von Doom\n\nSecondly, travelling through space and seeing it (the flashy tube and all the clouds) is always boring in a movie. \nNobody took notes when they released Green Lantern in 2011.\nEven in the Stargate TV series they cut that part out and all they did was travelling through space\nIn the movie, they called it \"Interdimensional Teleportation\". They should revised the dictionnary a little bit. Teleportation involves desintegration.\nAnybody saw Star Trek ?\nIf the characters stay has a whole inside a force field and move inside a flashy tube. It is not \"Teleporting\", it is \"Travelling\".\n\nThird, we don't care how the characters get their powers. They should already have them at the beggining of the film so we can see some action\nThen you put a five minutes flashback scene that explain how it happened. Also keep it simple: Hulk = Radiation, Spiderman = Got bitten, Superman = Alien\nF4 = They build a thing to go somewhere and while trying the thing, something went wrong and bla bla bla... See my point?\n\nFour, for a superhero movie you must respect the basic plot: Fight the vilain and loose, enhance the superhero, fight again and win\nIn F4, they got Von Doom on the first try.  So Boring! I told you at point 1 that Von Doom was not up to the task. He's not a real badass\n\nBonus, Never use the plot: \"military trying to use the hero as a weapon\". It always failed in a movie, because miliary have to failed. \nYou cannot have a super hero turned into a weapon, it failed in the first two Hulk's movies, it is the boring scene in Jurassic world.\nDon't do that..ever\n\nThanks",

            "content": "I found the film watchable, there's some cringe-worthy bits but on the whole, I found it a huge step up from the last series.\n\nKate Mara will never be a good actress to me. She is statuesque, robotic, and has no charisma whatsoever. Any scenes she has with Miles Teller (who I happen to think is a good actor) are just the most awkward thing I've ever seen. She gives him nothing to work with.\n\nI like the actor for Doom. He did really well, but Doom's motivation and (villain) design had some major problems. Villain Doom looked like something you'd see in a puppet shop in Germany. The frozen face looked doll-ish and didn't allow the actor to emote whatsoever. Also, just how the hell did he manage to survive not only the fall, but for a year on a foreign planet with no oxygen or food or even the ability to eat/drink?\n\nThere are just some references and lines of dialogue that don't help the movie at all. \"Dr. Doom over here.\" was a completely unnecessary line. We get it, he's the bad guy, you don't have to bludgen us in the face. They should've downplayed that and made him more friendly initially towards the group, it would've made his transformation better.\n\n\"It's clobberin' time\" needs to go or at least underplayed. Even if Grimm's bully of an older brother had said that to him as a kid, that would've been fine. But it's ridiculous for a super hero to have a battle cry in this day and age.\n\nThings I did like: Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm. He did a good performance. I know this is a can of worms but I'm not sure why the change in ethnicity. You ask any professional writer, if you're going to make changes to source material, it needs to make the story better, you can't just change things in order to be showy. However, I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan as Johnny, so maybe the decision to make Johnny Storm African American was made after Michael B. Jordan killed it in the audition room. Maybe he did so well, they made the change after casting him.\n\nI liked none of the heroes aside from The Thing having hero aliases. The tone of the movie was too dark and dreary to include something as campy as \"Mr. Fantastic\" or \"Human Torch\".\n\nI liked the design on Ben Grimm as The Thing. It's certainly much better than the orange, rubber suit version we got in the last iteration.\n\nI liked how the team came together at the climax of the film. It wasn't over the top, or cheesy.\n\nOn the whole, like I said, it was watchable. Not anywhere near as good as it could've been, and that's not the fault of the cast (with the exception of Kate Mara) or Josh Trank. You could see the parts of the movie that were well written and then every once in a while you notice where good ol' FOX manages to shoe-horn in their own \"Hey remember these jokes\" moments and their dated and formulaic money-making strategies. It's simply a case of what happens when bad producers and executives get their hands on a good script.\n\nThis script could've been really well at a different company.",

            "content": "Ripping the latest Fantastic Four reboot seems to be the sport du jour. While the news about the impending negativity this movie would spark has been circling the media for nearly a year, my inherent fandom of comics in general made this a necessary film for me to see. While not a huge fan of the previous two movies (I've never seen the bootleg from the early 90s), generally speaking, Fantastic Four is a difficult story to interestingly bring to the screen. It's very cosmic in nature, has a long history of some very strange villains and story lines, and can be kind of boring. In the 2005 initial outing, the good things included a very good origin story, representation of Ben Grimm as a pilot and a perfect Johnny Storm. However, Dr. Doom was horrible. Not representative of the comic version at all. Jessica Alba's ethnicity came across strangely as a blonde woman. And, while looking like the very early 60's Thing, the orange suit was...just bad. The second movie, centering around Silver Surfer was a much better representation of the comics, in spite of the weird Galactus. The stories overall were very weak and too goofy. When I heard they were going to reboot it, I was ok with it, for the recasting of Dr. Doom alone.\nFast forward to the introduction of Josh Trank as the director. Someone who had done ONE film. Yes, it was a decent film, but given that he was handed the keys to the FF reboot AND a Star Wars film, I was confused. So...fast forward again to nearly a year ago when word came out that the movie was in trouble. Josh was acting erratic. He had destroyed the house he was staying in while shooting in Louisiana. Fox secretly told Disney that Josh would be a bad idea to keep on staff for the Star Wars movie. Then suddenly, Josh was off the Star Wars film while rumors were abound that he had abandoned the final steps in FF post-production. The studio had come in and held reshoots and was completely in control of editing. So much bad press that nearly no one was looking forward to this movie coming out. Marvel was grinning like a cheshire cat wanting to get the rights to making FF back in the House of the Mouse. Then word came that an embargo was being put on all screenings and release of critical reviews until 2 days prior to opening day, always the kiss of death to a film. Then...3 days ago, the embargo broke and the messages were loud and clear. This movie was horrendous.\nI still planned on seeing the movie, but after Sony destroyed anything interesting about Ghost Rider...twice...I wasn't feeling good. Expectations were in the toilet.\nSo, this morning, as I'm making my way through the surprisingly short (one hour, forty minutes) reboot, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, even from the kids at the beginning, was very strong. The characters were coming together well. While the origin was different and the inclusion of Franklin Storm, Sr. and a mixed-race Storm clan was...well, unnecessary, it worked. I was buying it.\nThen they got their powers. From this point forward, it's like a completely different director and/or editor ran the film. There was essentially only ONE action scene. The end. And it lasted mere minutes. Without spoiling what led up to that one action scene, I will simply say that Doom was introduced. A very good Dr. Doom. Character and actor-wise, I very much like this flavor of Fantastic Four. And the tweaked origin introduces the potential for much more cosmic inclusion. The potential is exciting to this comic fanboy.\nThe problem is, from the point where they go their powers, which was on a planet that required CGI and special effects, I was confused as to where the budget went. The effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. Just awful. So many story points were shortened, sped up and left to the viewers interpretation and assumption. Weird considering how well-paced the story had been until this point and how well-developed the characters had been. For the final 40 minutes, character development evaporated. The effects were horrible. There was no story. Just...scenes. Leading up to a very short and shallow action scene. Then...it just ended. A short, quick wrap-up, not to mention dumb, especially considering how strong the film had been the first hour. I simply couldn't understand why the film shifted tone and pace so quickly.\nAs a result, I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. I believe Fox should give the rights back to Marvel or, at the very least, allow this film to have a sequel with a PROVEN director.",

While aesthetically the film is mostly pleasing, everything from the well performing cast to the great visuals should make this an enjoyable film. But it's the story's underwhelming and heartless feel that causes a big problem for this movie.  While the cool, youngsters feel coupled with it's mostly strong supernatural element do work, it is hard to back purely by the lack of interest in the characters. The cast is relatively small making for little variety, little cheer yet strangely little time developing who we do get. Johnny Storm is pretty passive, while Ben Grimm is massively sidelined with only Reed getting a decent slice of the pie. The lack of interaction between the characters is even more concerning, especially for a team film, where certain members don't even seem to utter two words to each other. The biggest flaw however is with the film's villain whose motives are pretty weak, but also looks silly and whose powers don't make sense. His enterance leads to a rushed and out of nowhere finale that has little to no build up, feeling the film doesn't even have a proper middle or end act. While the actors should be proud of how they helped this film, Fox can probably feel this franchise slipping from their fingers as Marvel rubs it's hands together for another score.",

I think it says it all when you can't win over a 7 year old with this type of movie.   VERY SAD because this was one of my favorite comics growing up. The only positive thing I have is the CGI Ben Grimm was a big improvement over the 2005 version but in visuals only, The character itself was horrible,  he had none of the rough neck, blue collar charm that Ben Grimm is known for.       FOX sell it back to Marvel so it can be done right",

            "content": "Fantasic Four, is an attempt on a darker, edgier, more realistic/sci-fi look on this series. The first half was pretty solid, Ben and Reed had great chemistry, and the bulid-up to them getting powers was okay... but that's the problem. The rest of the movie from that point on was all just build up to a movie that doesn't exist (unless you count the planned sequel). The effects were okay except for some certain parts where it just looked weird (the face-changing scene). And honestly Ben and Reed had better chemistry than Reed and Sue. But I think the most disappointing part was Dr. Doom, his powers were pretty menacing, however his looks was just awful (glowy goo + melted metal pieces + test dummy?). I guess overall it's just a dull-but-trying-to-be-serious movie with a lot of potential.",
