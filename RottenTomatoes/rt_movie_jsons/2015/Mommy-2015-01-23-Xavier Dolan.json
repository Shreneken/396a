Its a hard watch at times, certainly and there aren't any real answers given as such - its a sobering watch, a gritty, sobering watch and so it won't appeal to all. I'm not sure how much we're meant to learn by what we see but it is somewhat thought provoking at times and the cast give pretty good performances, so it's not bad. Also, the part where Oasis' Wonderwall is played is certainly somewhat chilling. Its not really a film I'm likely to think about too much as I've seen other films with similar plots but its certainly not bad either, its just a film you really need to be in the right kind of mood for, I'd say. I think the thing I find most sad about it is the name of the film itself (which is referenced in the plotline).\n\nIf I had to compare it to any other film, I'd say its like a French version of 'We Need to Talk about Kevin', if that helps. Would I recommend it? yes, I suppose I would.",

People grapple for solutions and society challenges the solutions. I am captivated by this director's masterstrokes. When brilliant actors have room to breathe they flourish. Perhaps this is a lesson for life. As with Dolan's other films, there are deeper layers of meaning at work here. The social trap is a challenge to the viewers. Dolan takes hope to the highest level and reveals the excruciating depths of despair caused when hope is hope frustrated. There are no easy answers but here we have art staked on the existential 'who are we' and 'why?' What is society? Dolan gives us plenty to digest. My hope is that a better society might be shaped by the arguments presented in this fine work of art.",

Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), a troubled teen suffering from an extreme case of ADHD, is expelled from a health institute for bad behavior and left in the hands of his mother (Anne Dorval), a woman who strives to be a loving parent but lacks the tools to manage her volatile son.  It is difficult to watch the peaks and valleys of their explosive relationship that totter wildly between love, hate and tolerance.  Dolan's direction, despite his penchant for close-ups, makes you feel like you're a part of the dysfunctional family \u2013 it's not a place that you want to be, but you are compelled to watch.",

Dolan took so much care about photography bringing us some shots acompained with some slow motions and famous songs that deserves to save in cinema memories. The story try to reflect how tough could be taking care of a son with conductual problems by her widow mother. The relationship stablished by mother, son and her neightboard was vibrant filled of emotions, up and downs and overcoming. Many people agree that this film has unnecessary time of footage whilst personally I consider that the problem does not come from length of footage rather than how Dolan took advantage on dialogs. On this point is where film fails awkwardly due to the fact sometimes dialogs are fulled of bad words but does not tell how inner frustration characters have.",

            "content": "From the very first shot this movie screams \"I'm not like them other films.\" The 1:1 aspect ratio and use of artsy lenses is evident of that. But I really liked the dream sequence. Editing was mostly mediocre though. I don't really like how all men are coded in an exclusively negative way. The lawyer just wants sex from Die, Kyla's husband's job is more important than what Kyla wants and she has just to follow him, Steve is just destroying everyone's lives. It seems like in this film men are only holding back and negatively affecting women. Like that's all they do. And Steve is portrayed just as a straight up menace. His depiction is very shallow, we don't see any of his inner world and I don't think his character is based on realistic psychology of a human being. But mom/son relationship dynamics do seem realistic. I noticed how everyone is telling the truth when they are drunk. Rather a simplistic take on alcohol from the director. Why can't everyone stop being fake and face the truth when they're sober? Ultimately that's what killed Steve when Die chose to believe in some fake \u2018hope'. Or maybe that's just how she justified her actions. Either way the outcome is the same. I think the director didn't have a clear vision of what type of movie he was making. It looks very formal with a huge accent on aesthetics and a huge amount of beautiful cheesy scenes and shots that are very technical (like slow-mo, tracking shots). But the narrative is realistic. It's the opposite of the visual. Last note, hearing Dido and Lana Del Rey (Born To Die. I shit you not) made me cringe a bit. It was like a cherry on top of those cheesy clich\u00e9 scenes. 2/5 that's about it.",

But when it's a hit, I'd say it hits the target of representing the characters' complexity, which he did achieve with this marvellous film. Everyone's talking about the aspect ratio but I don't mind a bit about it. It even gave me the perspective of the main character. Oh by the way, really really loved how he managed to pick uncanny yet perfect soundtracks for each emotional scene.",

The movie is in fluent French and I know from experience that a lot of meaning is lost in translation via subtitles. Second was the cultural barrier. Being a middle-class conservative Indian, I usually find it difficult to connect with many foreign thematic films. But to my sheer surprise, 'Mommy' was a complete riot - far better and stimulating than 'Batman vs Superman' crap which I crawled through the previous day.\n\n'Mommy' is one of those movies where screenplay moves fast yet the story unfolds slowly. This ingenuity shifts the film from art-house to entertaining realm. 2-3 months of characters' lives take around 130 minutes of screen time which give ample time for all details to unfold. Despite the subject matter being serious, the film never appears to be dry. Thorough importance is given to character development. I must add that I haven't seen such marvelous character development in my recent history of film-watching. We get to know and empathize with all idiosyncrasies of the characters. We laugh and cringe with the on-screen characters.\n\nThe plot of the film is not predictable at all. Just when you think you figured out what is happening the story throws up a new dimension. At places hidden emotional feelings of Patrick are insinuated which compel the viewer to churn his mind. Die's dream sequence towards the end of the film showing Patrick's life successful and happy was truly surreal and well placed - a mother's dream for his son.\n\nOverall, 'Mommy' is the finest Canadian film I saw in a long time. The film is truly a riot - an excellent piece of cinema.",

It was the first time I saw such approach in films, to be honest. Then, there is the actors performance, which is brilliant trough the whole movie, mainly the main actress' performance, but the performance of the main male actor is a standout to point too. This plot addresses some interesting points, such as a dysfunctional mom-son relationship ala Nornam Bates and his mother, a maladaptive behavior of a person with ADHD and its percussions to the people around him, simple themes as love, friendship. The whole movie is just filled with emotions. Not to mention the soundtrack of this film, it is indeed proper for the scenes, well chosen and great.

I find it beautiful yet traumatising to watch as it is a rather unconventional movie, mainly because of the unusual relationship between Die and Steve and the unconventional screen size (1:1), which adds a sense of perversion as we watch these characters unfold in our eyes and the feeling of claustrophobia because of the dimensions and the close shots. \n\nAs for this movie, I thought this movie was well-acted and shot. I find Die and Steve's relationship as a mother and son was a little frightening and very complex. Steve's actor really did shine through with this film and the struggle was convincing and did find this child to be scary enough to be close to. \n\nI thought Kyla's actress was great and was a joy to watch her interact with Steve as she helps the struggling family despite having problems of her own and nearly almost neglecting her own family. \n\nThis movie was just full of compassion and kindness added with the chaos of Steve's ADHD, a little uncomfortable to watch but an eye opener to the potential and talent that the actors and Dolan have.",

            "content": "In a fictional Canada, the so-called S-18 Bill has been passed which is designed to amend policies of the Canadian health services. Within it is the S-14 law which confers the parent of a child with behavioral problems, \"in a situation of financial distress, physical and/or psychological danger, the moral and legal right to commit his child to a state psychiatric hospital without further legal review.\" The story focuses on Diane (Anne Dorval) after her son, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), is kicked out of a detention center for having set fire to the cafeteria and gravely injuring a boy.\n\nWritten and directed by Xavier Dolan, \"Mommy\" hearkens back to the challenging European dramatic features of the '70s and '80s and it makes for a compelling watch. It is for audiences who crave to understand why people are the way they are and the actions eventually triggered by the difficult hand that life has given. It is easy to judge Diane's trailer trash sort of lifestyle but the material is not interested in judgment. It aims to excavate hidden depths and yet avoiding to spell out answers every step of the way.\n\nPilon's performance is shocking in the best way possible. Throughout the picture, I was convinced that he was picked off the street-perhaps an actual detention center-and asked to just be himself in front of the camera. The sheer anger displayed on screen is so raw that at times I felt very uncomfortable.\n\nHis mere presence, even though he is not particularly tall, commands an intensity so high that I was reminded of ace performers like Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio during certain scenes. I hope he continues to choose challenging characters as seen here because I think he has the potential to become not just any celebrity who appears in movies but a character actor who is respected for his craft.\n\nDorval and Pilon share a convincing mother-son chemistry. It is important that we believe they are a family first before being convinced that they really are dysfunctional. There is an excellent, tension-filled scene that involves Diane suspecting that Steve has stolen groceries. A verbal confrontation inevitably turns into a threat of physical violence. We wonder if the writer-director will allow his material to go there. Dolan is an envelope-pusher, as he had been in his prior work, and he does not disappoint here.\n\nDolan is, as usual, playful with his images and choice of soundtrack. Bright colors pop out on purpose and the music often has a sense of irony compared the images we are seeing. But it is in the use of the 1:1 aspect ratio that surprised me this time around. This is a most effective technique because I found myself focusing on the characters, especially their faces, instead of the objects and other distractions around them. And although we see the story unfold in a square, the lives within it are far from perfect.\n\n\"Mommy\" is dramatic, histrionic, and bold-but it works. Offering impressive performances by Pilon, Dorval and Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment, who plays a mysterious neighbor with a stutter, it may not be easy to sit through, especially with a running time of one hundred thirty minutes, but it does present a story worth telling.\n\nOne can argue that it is about how to not parent. Some may claim it is about a critique of our society's inability to deal with people with behavioral problems. But I say the picture is about empathy: toward parents, neighbors, children, to people who are only doing their jobs. It is a rich film and for that it is very much worth seeing.\n\nFilm-Review.org",

            "content": "Last September, I had the amazing opportunity to volunteer at the Toronto International Film Festival, or better known as, TIFF. With this amazing opportunity also came amazing perks such as free movie vouchers for each shift we completed. I knew going into this festival that Mommy was my number one choice on my list of movies I needed to see before the festival ended. I have seen 3 of the 4 other films by director Xavier Dolan and he has since become my favourite director, so seeing this film was a must.\n\nBefore I get into the review, I have a bit of a story to tell. Now, you may think that as a volunteer you had a 100% chance of seeing the films you wanted. That is definitely not the case. You have to remember TIFF is one of the only film festivals that is also open to the public. Almost as soon as the tickets went on sale, Mommy was sold out. If you get to the box office as soon as it opens on the day the film is being screened there may be a chance that tickets are still on sale. Of course, for Mommy they were completely sold out. One of the perks of TIFF is that they have last minute entry on a RUSH line basis which means in the off chance there are any seats left they give them out to whoever is at the front of the RUSH line. The movie wasn't being shown until 12:00 in the afternoon and I got in line at 7:30 AM, because that is how badly I wanted to see this movie, and of course I was first in line. At around 9:00 AM a man came up to the front of the line and asked if by any chance anyone was here in line to see Mommy. I raised my hand and said that I was thinking that he was just checking to see if people had already started lining up for the film but, to my very lucky surprise he had an extra ticket and gave it to me free of charge. I was of course ecstatic! \n\nNow let's get on to that review. Out of all the films I have seen by Xavier Dolan, his first film (I Killed My Mother) has always been my favourite...until now. This film was emotional and heartbreaking and just such a pleasure to watch. The acting was incredible by all three leads. Anne Dorval and Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment have been in a few of Dolan's other films and were miraculous in each role so it didn't surprise me when they were just as amazing in Mommy. The real surprise came from Antoine-Olivier Pilon whom I have never seen in any film before. I wasn't sure what to expect, but he was perfect for this role.\n\nThe special thing about this movie is the way that it is shot, in a perfect square. I was lucky enough to attend a Q&A with Xavier Dolan after the film had finished playing and someone in the crowd asked him what the hardest part about making this film was and his answer was the way it was shot and trying to fit everyone into the frame. I can honestly say that I did not see any evidence of that struggle. Everything looked perfectly framed to me which just proves how much time and effort Dolan spends on making things perfect.\n\nThe soundtrack was what I was most worried about. I saw a trailer for the movie before TIFF started and it used very commercialized, popular songs that have been on the top charts on the radio recently. In previous films, Dolan was more artistic with his music choices so going into this film I was a little worried about what the music choices might be. Although they were common songs that majority of people have heard, the way they were used and what they meant made up for any doubt I had. The songs worked perfectly, and in some strange case, made me feel new emotions while listening to them which was also another topic that Dolan addressed during the Q&A.\n\nI was also lucky enough to meet Xavier after the Q&A session and he was beyond kind and spoke to everyone that stayed behind to meet him. He answered more questions, signed autographs and took photos with all of us even after people told him he had to leave.\n\nAll in all, I would have been happy just to attend this one film and have all the experiences that I did, but TIFF is a 10 day long festival and I was able to see two other films in between volunteer shifts, so keep an eye out for those reviews coming soon.\n\nI highly recommend checking out all of Xavier Dolan's films, but especially Mommy if you ever have the pleasure of getting your hands on this film in the near future!",

            "content": "You know what sucks? I already did my top movies of 2014 list, now if I only watched this movie before making the list this would have made the list easily. Well I got something to learn next time.\n\nThe story is about a single mom's drama about raising her son, who's behavior deteriorates into violence, due to a mild mental illness.\n\nI first took interest in the film Mommy just because of the hype and the positive praise it got from the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the amount of awards it won from the Jutra Awards and Canadian Screen Awards for best Foreign Language film, but not a Academy Award for Foreign Film at the Oscars. Since I am watching more Foreign Language films and searching the ones that got high ratings or just the ones that may interest me, because I'm taking a break from some movies today as they normally not very good or just too Hollywood for me, I mean movies today are getting pretty stale and cliche as nothing feels originally anymore. When Hollywood tries to make a original movie that's down to earth it's laughable. These something about Foreign Language films that always feel real and sometimes so tight with it's story and ending that most movie studios will shy away from and I love it. So I checked out the 2014 Award Wining Mommy and it was absolutely brilliant, I mean how could I even dear overlook this I mean this is a great movie right here and true film making at it's best.\n\nNot only did the Oscar screw up for not awarding this for Best Foreign Language film, they also didn't nominate Anne Dorval for Best Actress, because she did one of the best, the most heart felt and the most real piece of performance I've seen in 2014. I felt her struggle and the mix relationship between her and the missed behaved son. There was many scenes in the movie were the son and her have this argument over each over and it never felt like I was just watching actors reading out the script and pretending that they related, no they back and forward arguments always felt real and I bough it. Oh and I found out most of the awards that this movie won are not just for the Foreign Language Award but most of the awards went to her and she deserves it and a Oscar too for god shake. At the Cannes Film Festival Julianne Moore won for Best Actress for Maps to the Stars and I haven't seen Maps to the Stars yet so I can't really judge on her performance in that movie since I haven't seen it, but Anne Dorval was nominated in that category so it was disappointing that she didn't take the award, but I have seen Still Alice and she won a Oscar for that role, but Anne Dorval should have took that Oscar home as she did a much better than Moore as I connected to Anne Dorval more and how her performance made me feel different emotions that I never felt before while watching the movie.\n\nAntoine-Olivier Pilon is a unknown star to me as I haven't seen him in any other movies before so this is basically the first ever performance I get to see him in and man god can this kid act, I mean he was so good in the movie. Just like I said about Anne Dorval and that is all the time it never felt like acting to me, it felt real. Antoine plays the misbehaved son perfectly that he actually catches the trouble child very well since I have seen young people like him in real life and how they act is just like him. I also love how they never force the message of \"He's got a mental illness oh feel sorry for him\". The movie never puts that in your face like most movies do when they try to be realistic or make you feel something for the character. He's performance showed both angry, goofy, troubled and damaged but all that is in he's performance and it never feels force and that was so well done that movie didn't slip into that cliche that happens in most movies and that's due to Antoine-Olivier Pilon excellent performance.\n\nThe director of the movie Xavier Dolan which I haven't really seen any of his last work so this is my first movie directed by him and a great start. This is film making at it's best, I mean the cinematography is beautiful, the tone of the movie can switch to serious drama but quickly change to happy and many other tones and it didn't ruin the movie like most do. Xavier Dolan did both a excellent job on directing the movie and making this as down to earth as possible showing characters and they problems that most people can relate to. Awesome work Xavier Dolan.\n\nFor problems with the movie I haven't really got any to be honest, but I'm not going to give this the perfect rating as I think this isn't on the level of 5/5 rating it can ever get it, but the rating I'm giving it is really outstanding and it's the highest rating I give this week.\n\nOverall I say that Mommy is worth checking it if you haven't seen it yet. It's worth your time and don't do the same mistake as I did and not watch this fantastic movie.",

Troubled neighbours\n.\nIt's superbly acted. The three leads are magnificent, but Antoine-Olivier Pilon as the boy and Anne Dorval as the mother really impress. If Pilon does not have some sort of ADHD-dignose he better get himself checked. Magnificent!\n\nThis is very affecting stuff and the way it is presented is flawless. The narrow screen makes put's you more directly into the situations. You are in the house with the struggling family. It's a bit demanding, but very rewarding. Some genious editing are topping the appearance of the film - a very clever and original touch.\n\nIt's not the easiest of films to watch. It's rugged, it's heartbreaking, it's very real. It got an incredible character build-up - one of the very finest I have seen. It's intelligent and a bit of fresh air I must say. The music also blend so nicely with the dull colors, the brilliant cinematography, and there are superb dialogue here.

            "content": "One of the most jaw-dropping movies in recent years, this blackly comical drama is the most audacious work yet from Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan. As challenging as it is rewarding, Mommy finds writer-director Xavier Dolan taking another impressive step forward. Dolan is a director who thinks hard about the possibilities of cinema and explores them with verve and ingenuity, but it is in his latest film that everything has come together. There are ups and downs and soapish highs and lows, but what stops this from ever becoming a telenovela is the riveting wonder of the performances and the sheer brio of the filmmaking. Mommy is first and foremost a mother-and-son story, but it's also a surprisingly delicate exploration of lonely lives, and the temporary islands of companionship that make them bearable. It's uncanny how much Dolan's style and overall solipsism have evolved in five years' time, resulting in a funny, heartbreaking and, above all, original work - right down to its unusual 1:1 aspect ratio - that feels derivative of no one, not even himself. Anne Dorval, Antoine Olivier Pilon and Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment give scary-good performances.This is easily Dolan's best film, and it's exciting to think how many times we might have to revise that statement over the years to come. Mommy is going to linger. The love, the laughter, the anger and the sorrow--it sticks. This film earned a place in the top three of my favourite films of all time.\n\nVERDICT: \"Instant Classic\" - [Positively Acclaimed Reaction] Usually I give this rating to a movie that I believe is absolutely outstanding and has little to no flaws in it. Audiences, who haven't seen this film, must see it right now! (Films that are rated 4.5 or 5 stars)",

            "content": "\"We still love each other, right?\"\n\nMommy is Xavier Dolan's fifth feature film (but the first time I was exposed to his work) and it deserves all the recognition it received from Cannes, including its Jury Prize win, because it's a unique and powerful movie with all around outstanding performances from the cast. Experiencing Mommy without knowing anything prior about the Canadian director was fresh and rewarding. Mommy isn't an easy watch and at 138 minutes some might have doubts about wanting to watch this raw family drama, but it is well worth your time. The film centers on a widowed mother, Diane (Anne Dorval), who is trying to make ends meet as she tries to raise her troubled teenager, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon). He has recently been expelled from the institution he was studying at for setting the cafeteria on fire. The directors of the institution realize they can't do anything for Steve and they give Diane (who goes by Die) two options: educate him herself or let the government raise him. Die is infuriated with the proposition because she loves her son, so despite not having the time it takes to look after him she takes him home. Steve suffers from ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) so at one moment he can be cheerfully dancing along to his music, and all of a sudden a trigger sets him off into a violent behavior. He's also very attached to his mother (the Oedipus complex is present), but their relationship is a love-hate one. When their reclusive neighbor, Kyla (Suzanne Clement), befriends them she offers to help Steve with his education since she is on her sabbatical year from teaching. Kyla has trouble communicating and has been deeply affected by something from her past so she has issues of her own. Mommy builds on the relationship between these three characters and the explosive dynamics between them. \n\nMommy is a raw family drama about characters that we don't usually see on film because they are hard to engage with. Steve has ADHD so he is constantly swearing and saying all kinds of hurtful things to the people around him, but at the same time he can be sweet and loving. His mother, Die, has no clue how to deal with him. She loses his patience with him, but she doesn't accept when others try to correct him and will do anything to defend Steve. She doesn't qualify as your standard parent of the year candidate, so typically she isn't someone the audience could relate to. Kyla perhaps would be the likable character here, but Dolan manages to direct this film with such grace and elegance that all three characters end up being people we care about and sympathize with despite their flaws. At first I was thinking there was no way I would end up caring for this kid and her mother, but after carefully setting the stage Dolan manages to give each one of these characters depth. There is a scene at a karaoke bar in which you connect with the kid and the more time you spend with this family the more you understand the mother as well. It is a very raw and explosive film with several emotionally engaging scenes. There was one specific dream sequence that touched me, and it is rare for a film like this to have such an enduring impact on me. Mommy makes me want to go and watch Dolan's previous four films now because this was one of the best dramas of 2014.\n\nThe film was shot on a 1:1 aspect ratio which gives the movie a sense of claustrophobia and enables us to focus on the characters faces and emotions. It is like watching a film through a square box, but it definitely works. The performances enhance this powerful film even more. Suzanne Clement, Anne Dorval, and Antoine-Olivier Pilon are frequent collaborators with Dolan. I was surprised by Pilon's emotional performance. He was an explosive force of nature and delivers one the most memorable performances of the year. Anne Dorval is also a standout here and depicts the different emotions the mother goes through with her troubled son in a very authentic way. Even the way she walks through the streets of her neighborhood says a lot about her character. Clement has the most restrained performance of the three, but she also delivers in a much more quiet way.

            "content": "\"We still love each other, right?\"\n\nMommy is Xavier Dolan's fifth feature film (but the first time I was exposed to his work) and it deserves all the recognition it received from Cannes, including its Jury Prize win, because it's a unique and powerful movie with all around outstanding performances from the cast. Experiencing Mommy without knowing anything prior about the Canadian director was fresh and rewarding. Mommy isn't an easy watch and at 138 minutes some might have doubts about wanting to watch this raw family drama, but it is well worth your time. The film centers on a widowed mother, Diane (Anne Dorval), who is trying to make ends meet as she tries to raise her troubled teenager, Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon). He has recently been expelled from the institution he was studying at for setting the cafeteria on fire. The directors of the institution realize they can't do anything for Steve and they give Diane (who goes by Die) two options: educate him herself or let the government raise him. Die is infuriated with the proposition because she loves her son, so despite not having the time it takes to look after him she takes him home. Steve suffers from ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) so at one moment he can be cheerfully dancing along to his music, and all of a sudden a trigger sets him off into a violent behavior. He's also very attached to his mother (the Oedipus complex is present), but their relationship is a love-hate one. When their reclusive neighbor, Kyla (Suzanne Clement), befriends them she offers to help Steve with his education since she is on her sabbatical year from teaching. Kyla has trouble communicating and has been deeply affected by something from her past so she has issues of her own. Mommy builds on the relationship between these three characters and the explosive dynamics between them. \n\nMommy is a raw family drama about characters that we don't usually see on film because they are hard to engage with. Steve has ADHD so he is constantly swearing and saying all kinds of hurtful things to the people around him, but at the same time he can be sweet and loving. His mother, Die, has no clue how to deal with him. She loses his patience with him, but she doesn't accept when others try to correct him and will do anything to defend Steve. She doesn't qualify as your standard parent of the year candidate, so typically she isn't someone the audience could relate to. Kyla perhaps would be the likable character here, but Dolan manages to direct this film with such grace and elegance that all three characters end up being people we care about and sympathize with despite their flaws. At first I was thinking there was no way I would end up caring for this kid and her mother, but after carefully setting the stage Dolan manages to give each one of these characters depth. There is a scene at a karaoke bar in which you connect with the kid and the more time you spend with this family the more you understand the mother as well. It is a very raw and explosive film with several emotionally engaging scenes. There was one specific dream sequence that touched me, and it is rare for a film like this to have such an enduring impact on me. Mommy makes me want to go and watch Dolan's previous four films now because this was one of the best dramas of 2014.\n\nThe film was shot on a 1:1 aspect ratio which gives the movie a sense of claustrophobia and enables us to focus on the characters faces and emotions. It is like watching a film through a square box, but it definitely works. The performances enhance this powerful film even more. Suzanne Clement, Anne Dorval, and Antoine-Olivier Pilon are frequent collaborators with Dolan. I was surprised by Pilon's emotional performance. He was an explosive force of nature and delivers one the most memorable performances of the year. Anne Dorval is also a standout here and depicts the different emotions the mother goes through with her troubled son in a very authentic way. Even the way she walks through the streets of her neighborhood says a lot about her character. Clement has the most restrained performance of the three, but she also delivers in a much more quiet way. These characters aren't easy to relate to at times, but the cast humanizes each one of them in such a way that we sympathize with them. The performances along with Dolan's solid screenplay turn this family drama into a stunning work of art. It is a film that will stick with you long after the credits role.     \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Writer-director Xavier Dolan debuted six years ago with I Killed My Mother and Oedipal issues are still on the menu in Mommy, in which a 15-year-old, omnisexual, possible bi-polar boy named Steve (Antoine Olivier Pilon) is more than his widowed mother, Diana 'Die' Despres (Anne Dorval) can handle.\n\nA new law taking effect in Quebec will allow for a parent to institutionalize a child without a court procedure, which gets Die to thinking. She's only about 50, and her tight pants and tall heels suggest she's not ready for retiring from life anytime soon. The trouble is that blond, blue-eyed Steve is very charming when not setting things on fire or threatening people with violence. Die seeks help from her neighbor (Suzanne Clement) a delicate looking teacher who only thinks she can contain Steve.\n\nOne thing about Mommy: Even when Dolan hits you over the head with his themes, he puts on a show that burns in the memory with images that are unforgettable. Pilon is firing on all cylinders, but it's the tour de force from Dorval that transcends language and cultural barriers. Hers is a performance that dares you not to watch.",

            "content": "+Nothing annoys me more than walking out of a movie annoyed at the director and screenwriter and here I am, three hours later, still annoyed at the director and screenwriter of \"Mommy\", both being Xavier Dolan who also edited it.\n\nThe basic story is interesting in that it deals with a mother whose son has been kicked out of a juvenile facility after causing a fire burning 75% of another boy's skin. The mother, Diane, nicknames Die and played by Anne Dorval, has been a  widow for 3 years and the son, Steve, played by Antoine Olivier Pilon, hasn't accepted his father's death and had been previously diagnosed with ADD and/or possibly also being bi-polar. They are both capable of moods swinging form high highs to low lows. One moment he can be choking her and the next moment kissing her on the lips while she can be as tender with him as any mother can be and in the next moment bashing him over the head with a framed picture.\n\nBoth the mother and son lean on their neighbor across the street who lives there with her boyfriend? Husband? And their young daughter. She, Kyla, played by Suzanne Clement, had been a high school teacher but due to something--a nervous breakdown?--has stopped teaching and she can barely talk in full sentences and stutters horribly except around the mother and son.\n\nBoth mother and son are foul mouth speakers along with being flirtatious whenever the opportunity arises or, sometimes, instigating sexual innuendos. The language, in some instances, is definitely R rated.\n\nIt is a good straight told story of a subject that isn't often a theme for movies, mainly in the first half but then the director/screenwriter/editor enters the picture. I want to excuse him because he is 25 years old but this is his fifth picture so he should know better. The film is mostly in a 1 to 1 ratio so most of the time you feel as if you are looking at it on a large cell phone. The screen is widen a few times but only effective and noticeable the first time. There are one too many blurry collages not too mention choppy editing that I guess is suppose to be 'artistic'. Also the screenwriter leaves way too many questions unanswered that are an important part of the story.\n\nAnne Dorval, Suzanne Clement and Antoine Olivier Pilon give excellent performances, especially the latter who has to handle showing all sides of a teenager with mental illness that changes him constantly.\n\nAside from running far too long--two hours and 20 minutes--I felt frustration at how Dolan was taking a good story line and getting excessive with the camera. I found myself going from being interested to being bored and back and forth all during the movie and, finally, leaving annoyed.",

For being a 138 minutes, it's pretty well paced and its use of a never-used square 1:1 aspect ratio is shockingly never distracting, and the little things that they do with it are just terrific in their simplicities. That's just one of the ways that Mommy is unique without ever being jarring. There are some shades of We Need to Talk About Kevin earlier on, but let me be clear, this is not We Need to Talk About Kevin (despite how incredible that movie is). It's still challenging, but oddly inviting a way, namely due to its late-'90s/early-2000s music choices and uses of colors. Anne Dorval and Antoine-Oliver Pilon work amazingly as mother and son; observing their similarities is great and the blurring of their simultaneous friendship and antagonistic interactions does a great job of deepening their characters without seeming contradictory. The fulfill their roles as a struggling mother and a needy, ADHD-inflicted son without being charactertures. The same goes for the film itself, given that it occasionally has a sense of humor that never undermines the drama. I'm both surprised and disappointed that Mommy didn't get nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the Oscars (more the latter than the former, because as I've said before, the nominations this year were horrible). If this plays by you, go and see it. Even if it isn't quite perfect, don't be that person that says, \"I don't want to have to read a movie,\" just because it's in French. It's thoroughly engaging and that never detracts from its technical achievements. 8.5/10, great, one thumb up, definitely above average, etc.",

The movie can often encroach on maudlin in it's more indulgent scenes (the soundtrack of 90's songs is admittedly quite bad) and Mommy's tone can be erratic,  but it works overall, and houses some fairly innovative filmmaking.

            "content": "For the fifth time in five years, now 25 year old wunderkind Xavier Dolan delivers another cinematic masterpiece. \"Mommy\" is in many ways a companion piece to Dolan's directorial debut \"J'ai tu\u00e9 ma m\u00e8re,\" the semiautobiographical tale of the then teenaged actor-turned-director's difficult relationship with his mother. The mother is still played by Anne Dorval. Whereas \"J'ai tu\u00e9 ma m\u00e8re\" had a note of immature vengeance in it, \"Mommy\" is much more compassionate, nuanced and open to a point that makes it a bit difficult but ultimately rewarding to penetrate. The point of view is the mother's this time around.\n\nThe film is set in a fictional Canada where parents are allowed to hand their children directly and completely over to state care citing financial reasons or threats of violence. Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s (Dorval, explosively alive), a middle aged widower has to contemplate the possibility when her teenaged son Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon) is thrown out of a facility for troubled youth. Die is broke, doesn't feel confident in her ability to raise her erratic, often dangerously violent son. She drinks and is volatile herself. Now she has to assume direct responsibility of Steve's actions again.\n\nFor me, Dolan is the most interesting director working today. I'm so glad he's been so prolific, because I anticipate every one of his films more than any others. In the beginning of this, his so-far greatest film festival success, I began to worry. The realistically shot scenes of Die and Steve building a life together were good, but they didn't completely enchant me the way I've come to expect from Dolan. Also, this is the director's most direct attempt at comedy, a difficult genre for me and again a good but not phenomenal effort during the first act. Was Dolan letting me down, or just my overgrown expectations of apotheosis?\n\nThroughout most the film I was unsure if \"Mommy\" was Dolan-phenomenal, just normal-phenomenal or just good. The director excels in depicting conflict and melodrama in ways that most filmmakers would turn off-putting or annoying. This film is at times off-putting and very annoying. Both Die and especially Steve are very difficult to like. The script is so daringly unpredictable it begins to border on incongruous. But it all grows, and after contemplating the film as a whole I was completely sold. The characters feel completely flesh-and-blood real, the melodrama turns effectively allegoric and the tonal confusion rewards the viewer after being processed.\n\nThe key ingredient in making \"Mommy\" a true masterpiece is Kyla, a woman who lives across the street from Die with her family. Kyla is a teacher who is recovering from a heavy stutter brought on by an unspecified breakdown and resurfaced shyness. Kyla is injected into the story just as the relationship between the protagonist mother and her son turns dangerously violent. She befriends the disastrous duo and balances the dynamic.\n\nKyla is played by Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment who portrayed a similar teacher in \"J'ai tu\u00e9 ma m\u00e8re\" and a vastly different character in Dolan's 2012 tour de force \"Laurence Anyways\". She shows her amazing range again in a role that defines the drama, offering a reflective surface to the otherwise numbingly fierce exchanges between Die and Steve. In the end Steve and Die may be the main characters, but Kyla is our companion as viewers, the silent focus point that brings the emotional cacophony together into something tangible.\n\nAs always, cinematography and music are Xavier Dolan's allies even more than they are in an average film. This time, the soundtrack is actually quite bad for my taste; emotional pop from the 90's mainly, but the director makes it work. In a Dolan scene, even Celine Dion has an impact. Trust me. The cinematography gets more experimental as the film progresses, forming yet again a unique, exceptionally beautiful language that takes us within the characters. Some frames are so tenderly beautiful they make you want to cry.\n\nWhat \"Mommy\" is most notably successful in is the melancholy, deeply felt presentation of youth, mostly from a parent's perspective. Pilon's Steve is dangerously volatile and dangerously fragile, explosive, infuriating, but so very real. I remember being told as a kid by some relatives that teen years were hazardous, that people often messed up everything during that period of flux. I was dead afraid of my own back then. I thankfully never got or wanted into any trouble, but now I'm glad this film didn't exist when I was that timid child afraid of growing up. If I had seen \"Mommy\" then, I wouldn't have been just afraid, I would have been in panic.",

It has a weird style of cinematography being shot in a very tight frame like you are looking through a crack of a door the whole time but when it does extend into full screen, it's like you can feel the tension break in the movie. Xavier Dolan is a very interesting director that I want to look into more of his work and excited for his future work.

Dolan has failed to structure a solid film which could've been a potential masterpiece, it's time for him to consider polishing his storytelling technique to render his creative capacity into a more compelling talent. A few touch ups in the script would've also boosted up the quality, however the use of visual techniques and musical montages resinates very adequately and raises the mood thoroughly of the movie. I, however, always fill sufficed when analyzing Dolan's movies, as they possess a very personal bond with their director. Ultimately I would recommend the film, but a better experience is assured if costumers wait until it's released on demand and they can enjoy it home where they can take rests and wear off the tediousness that is sometimes build up.",

A fitting companion piece to his debut \"J'ai tu\u00e9 ma mere,\" Dolan continues his exploration of combustible mother-son relationships. While Dolan mainly holds an attitude of angst toward the maternal figure in \"J'ai tu\u00e9 ma mere,\" he views the mother with a far more compassionate gaze in \"Mommy.\"\n \nThe eponymous matriarch is Diane 'Die' Depr\u00e9s (Anne Dorval), a widow struggling to look after her son Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), who suffers from ADHD and other undiagnosed mood disorders. While Die looks for work, Steve is home-schooled by their reticent neighbour Kyla (Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment).   \n\nThe three central performers are outstanding. In Dorval and Cl\u00e9ment, Dolan has secured himself two complex and fascinating female leads. Both are expressive actresses who can communicate tremendous emotion and subtext even in the absence of dialogue. Newcomer Pilon offers contrast to their subtlety with his exuberant yet sincere performance. Steve is a heartbreaking character, who possesses this pure and unconditional love, but is often unable to express it appropriately. His frustration quickly gets distorted and fuelled into fits of rage and aggression.    \n\nDolan writes from a personal place, which often makes his work painfully honest and real. He makes these private, intimate moments not only cinematically compelling, but also emotionally resonant and relatable. There's a hand-sewn originality to Dolan's work that captivates and sets him apart as an artist.",

Ferocious, funny, over-indulgent, messy, and claustrophobic, Mommy soars thanks to Dolan's technical prowess and the monumental performances from the three leads. As much as the film talked about hope and redemption, I'm not quite sure anyone achieved any by the end. While most would see this film as three people coming together to form an odd family unit, I'd say it's more about three people whom society has deemed unusual and wants nothing to do with. Die is unorthodox and a little shameless, Steve is fiery and problematic but mostly misunderstood, and Kyla can't seem to find the right words while no one seems willing to want to help or understand her. A film just as much about emotions brought to the surface as it is about the things that go unsaid. The film is also incredibly gorgeous and the unusually aspect ratio plays as a gimmick at first but slowly starts to bring you into the confined, restricted world of these characters. These people's lives are messy, contradictory, and a little bit sad. Mommy makes the case that these are people to be understood not to be pitied or cast aside.",

Every moment is full of tension because of the 15-year-old Steve (played with charm to spare by Antoine-Olivier Pilon) who has ADHD and perhaps other behavioral issues. It is never certain when he is going to lash out in violence or some other inappropriate action. HIs mom \"Die\" (the always fantastic Anne Dorval) is forced to take him back in after he is kicked out of a youth detention center after he causes a fire that badly burns another child. Adding to the stress, she loses her job and her car is totaled. She puts on a brave and hopeful and vivacious face, but she might have some behavioral issues at well, though she is much more high functioning. After Steve nearly strangles her and she escapes to hide in a closet, the woman from across the street, Kyla (the also always fantastic Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment), intervenes and seems to have a way with him that calms him down. She soon becomes a part of their routine, providing home-schooling for Steve and another adult to engage with for Die. With Steve, though, his next behavioral outburst might be just a scene away.\n\nDolan films the movie in a claustrophobic square frame, with huge black bars on the sides on a widescreen TV. Once in a great while, when there seems to be hope that things are turning around for the better, the frame suddenly widens to fill the full rectangle. When it tightens again...\n\nBy the end of the film, it was unclear to me what other options were available for this woman and her son. It was also unclear to me exactly what was going on with Kyla, a woman of quirks that suggest a difficult recent occurrence that is never explicitly stated. \n\nDespite the difficult material and the horrifying situation, the movie is full of warmth and humor and sharp dialogue. Dolan dials back his signature artistic flourishes, but only a little, and it is always wonderful to see what he can do with his camera, filters, shots, and editing. After four of his five movies to date as writer/director/editor and sometimes actor (he does not appear in this film) he has become one of my most favorite artists. I'm looking forward to watching Tom at the Farm which comes out in the United States soon, and he is busy working on his next films, including It's Only the End of the World and his English-language debut as director, The Death and Life of John F.

Well, Mommy is a near masterpiece that proves to be one of the greatest foreign language films I've ever seen.\n\nThe story follows a single mother who must raise her very troubled teenage son, who finds hope when their neighbour comes into her life. The story in this movie is detailed and terrific. It begins fairly slowly, but it speeds up and never fails to interest. The characters are amazing, too. Each character is relatable and perfectly realized. There are only about three important characters, but that makes allows the movie to expand on their personalities. Even with a massive runtime of 2 and a half hours, the movie never gets too slow and you barely feel the length.\n\nThe acting in this movie is some of the best of the year. Anne Dorval gives an amazing and Oscar worthy performance. Antoine-Olivier Pilon gives a brilliant performance as a teenager with severe ADHD. Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment also gives an excellent performance as a wonderful neighbour. I would love to see all three of these actors in more movies, because they were all fantastic!\n\nThe directing in this film is just...wow. Xavier Dolan proves to be one of the most unique and brilliant directors working today, and this is only his second film! The way frames were used to effect the audience was just brilliant, and some scenes were visually gorgeous. I was constantly interested in the story and the characters throughout. The writing in this movie is also brilliant, with great uses of extreme profanity and some very touching moments. There is also a bit of comedy that hits pretty hard and balances out the heart-wrenching moments. \n\nMy only small problem with the movie is that it feels like a bunch of short films bound together. Some plot elements were dropped and completely forgotten at some points. Other than that, though, this movie was nearly perfect.\n\nOverall, Mommy is a must-see for all film lovers alike! It has brilliant performances, a wonderful story and terrific direction! Please, run out and see this ASAP!\n\nRATING: 9.75/10",

Not french! \nDeeply moving, touching disturbing without any sense of judgement or labelling.\nIt is set in the near future where our Canadian gov't makes parents completely liable for a child's acts; reasonable enough you say...., however if a parent is unable to financially cover thus liabilities and or the defence of their child in legal matters the state offers a way out. The gov't will cover the costs, but you lose all parental rights to your child. In short, the child belongs to the gov't. \nThis story is about a young man who pulls a prank that leads to serious injuries of a school mate; overzealous and hyperactive and violent this young man's behaviour pushes the limits of his mother and the circumstances they find themselves in.\nEvery actor in this piece is brilliant a definite gem of Quebec cinema! 9/10",

It had a great story and direction by Xavier Dolan, and some spell-binding performances by Anne Dorval as the mom, who was terrific and surely one of the best performance of the year. While also representing a very strong and fabulous woman, that are rarely portrayed and written the way her character is in the film. Also, a true revelation, Antoine-Olivier Pilon, who is great in his character as a troublesome teenager with ADHD, and very violent behavior, while also making him be more vulnerable and even likeable. And lastly, Suzanne Cl\u00c3 (C)ment was also excellent as an also damaged person who undoubtedly helps as much as she needs it. They were all incredibly raw and full of emotion and wittiness, that eventually made them incredibly memorable characters that you can't get enough of them. Moreover, Xavier Dolan truly outdid himself playing with an extremely interesting and effective aspect ratio 1:1 that amplified the movie in many ways, while also doing a very fine job with its screenplay. Overall, it was a pretty amazing experience of a movie that delves around a very odd threesome and how they bonded through love, that is rarely told on-screen through some very excellent example of strong imperfect women. \n~March 15, 2015~",

            "content": "An emotional experience that I haven't had at the movies in quite a while. This is a film of intense beauty and incredibly dimensional characters. Mommy envelops you in the world of its characters and depicts the power of human connection like no other film I can remember.\n\nXavier Dolan films Mommy in a 1:1 aspect ratio, which you've likely never seen before. It seems that this would be jarring, but not as much as you'd think, and works extremely well, in fact. Cutting off the wideness allows the characters to accompany larger portions of the frame, their bodies and heads are unobstructed by their surroundings. This is a film about deep human connection between a mother and her ADHD son, and they later welcome a neighbor into this world. It really is a whole other world that these characters occupy. One that's sometimes like a fantasy, or an escape, but one that's full of love. The square frame boxes us into their world.\n\nWatching these characters thrive in their world is a wonderful thing to see. The acting in this film is astonishing. The connection between the mother and son would not be so affective without the performances of Anne Dorval and Steve O'Connor Despr\u00e9s. These actors create strange, four-dimensional characters whose remarkable chemistry makes you feel like they've experienced the world together. Their connection is its own language. From far away they might look unstable and strange, but from up close we can see that no relationship is more loving or beautiful. Also great is Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment as the neighbor who finds herself becoming an unexpected part of this family. \n\nDolan uses music in a unique way, with pop songs representing these characters lives. This is not Dolan putting in his iPod, as it might first seem, but is instead what the characters would play. Other noticeable stylistic choices are his use of slow motion and montage. These are used to capture the moments, or the essence of the moments of the characters, which is what Dolan is all about.\n\nThe relationship between mother and son is important for the plot, and the film certainly tributes it, but the emotional power of the bond can be applied to any relationship. Dolan's film is like an homage to isolated human connection and spirit, but it's also tragic how this connection struggles to work with the real world.\n\nAlthough the aspect ratio and artistic style might lead some to think that this movie is not accessible, the storytelling is plenty decipherable. Anybody can enjoy this movie. It doesn't matter what films you like, or what you think you like, this film is driven emotionally, and everyone has emotions, so everyone can enjoy, and I think everyone will. I can't recommend this movie enough. You'd be doing yourself a tremendous favor to see it wherever you can, I guarantee you. It's the most exhilarating, unforgettable, filmgoing experience to surface from 2014.",
