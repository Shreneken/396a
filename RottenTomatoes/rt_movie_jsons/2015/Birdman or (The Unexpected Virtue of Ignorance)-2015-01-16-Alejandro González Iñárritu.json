    "summary": "Former cinema superhero Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It's risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he's a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a castmate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor (Edward Norton) who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife.",

I think preciosity and arrogance put him among the best, as I saw some doing. Some open points in this plot lead more to confusion than to creative freedom for the viewer.\nThe camera effect popularized in the mainstream with Black Swan is noticed and gains space, making cinema a great theater. Although in this film the sequential rhythm is very fast, overlapping scenes and sometimes shortening the perception and assimilation time of the content.\nThe film makes use of surrealism to create a fantasy environment, which is immediately observed at the beginning with the main character floating. Perhaps this dreamlike universe could be better exploited, what we saw presented was a weak scene of the character flying to and fro.\nIt has some interesting dialogues, like the one from the newspaper critic.\nThe film tries to be cult but lacks depth. It's not a total waste of time but you'll end up with a little bit of that feeling. That's if you get to the end.",

Anchored by a transcendent Michael Keaton, protagonist Riggan Thompson is a fool questing through the mists, certain something must lie beyond, despite a cacophony of doubt as voiced by his ex-wife, daughter, and his arch-nemesis: the preeminent theater critic Tabitha Dickinson. \n\nBirdman is as finely crafted as a Swiss watch but with the improvisation of jazz only made possible by a cast of masterful actors.",

Michael and Amy's work in bringing life to the most sweetest couple when everything was said and done was beautiful. Zach's enactment of manning the ship is excellent. Andrea's and Naomi's characters could be reflections of two different timelines of sane story. The essential sorrows of life preoccupied with on stage personas , clinging onto the tiniest of hopes. It's not just a kiss that's been shared but a longing to go back in time and a longing to step forward and feel what it brings. Birdman is a cleverly prepared collage of bits and pieces of all sorts of life stories, definitely worth a second watch.",

It's one of those films that doesn't fit into any one genre (or any two for that matter) and its wide array of interesting characters can't be easily summed up. But, that may be the reason why the film is so absorbing. It has so many original qualities that certainly don't fit into the standard mold of what a star-studded movie should be, instead putting a strange (but fascinating) spin on your typical drama. Set in the heart of New York City, it focuses on Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a washed-up actor who gained fame for his role as the iconic superhero Birdman. Trying to overcome his ego 12 years later, he adapts and stars in his own Broadway play hoping to reclaim his spot as an important actor. We see the ups and downs of this production along with the odd way his psyche works, his inner voice being the Birdman character. There's also many other facets, including the quarrels between Keaton and Edward Norton's character (one of the main stars of the play), all equally entertaining. The writing is top-notch, serving up witty and funny moments throughout, and each member of the cast delivers a fantastic performance (my favorite being Norton). It also includes a brilliant musical score, entirely done with drums. And despite its flaws, mostly in a few goofy moments, it isn't one to miss.",

            "content": "Quondam superhero movie star, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), puts on his own adaptation of a Carver novel to prove his own self-worth as an actor. The film is filled with stereotypes — the semi-goth, attractive daughter with issues (Emma Stone), the talented, but annoyingly-method stage-actor (Edward Norton), the worrisome producer (Galifiniakis), the cold-hearted, miserable critic (Lindsay Duncan), et al. — but it never really takes a break or leaves you reaching for your phone. The lauded style is shot as if it was done in 1–2 takes (I've heard both), over several rehearsals, previews, and a premier of the aforementioned Carver-inspired play, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. What is Riggan's purpose? To part of him, he's high-art, the real deal, a stage actor on Broadway. To the other part of him, \"Birdman,\" the character he played in the 80s and 90s that launched him into superstardom, he's the opiate of the masses. \"Give them what they want,\" \"Birdman\" (Benjamin Kanes) says as he floats above Riggan's shoulder, speaking directly into his ear. Given the proliferation of Marvel, DC, Star Wars properties that are available at the click of a button, the film's meta narrative feels even more relevant in 2022 than it was in 2014. Dickinson (Duncan), the critic whose voice only will determine the success or failure of Riggan's play, gives a searing polemic on the former superstar's telos — \"Let's get one thing straight, you are a celebrity, you are no actor.\" (para) — and it kinda rules. The Macbeth scene with Bill Camp hanging from a ubiquitous NYC sidewalk beam is one of my most frequently YouTube'd scenes to watch — the others being the \"milkshake\" scene from There Will Be Blood and when God speaks in Silence. I could go on. I didn't take to the ending the first couple of times I saw this one, but I liked it more on this watch. I love this movie.",

            "content": "Despite the near-universal acclaim from critics, 'Birdman' very much divided audiences to a quite extreme degree. This division is very much understandable, 'Birdman' has a great many merits but not everything will work for everybody.\n\nTo me 'Birdman' was an excellent film. Maybe not quite as good as the hype suggests, but nowhere near deserving of the many 1/10 votes when its merits are a great many that some people seem to have not acknowledged. Although, from personal opinion, a little over-hyped, 'Birdman' ('Gone Girl', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Whiplash' were also personal favourites, and 'Boyhood' was also better than given credit for considering the amount of hate it's garnered) was a 2014 highlight and a worthy Best Picture winner.\n\nNot everything in 'Birdman' works. Some of the pace is a touch frenetic in parts of the second half and not everything feels quite as tied up as ought with things left a little loose.\n\nHowever, 'Birdman' is an exceptionally well made film, with some of the best and cleverest cinematography of the year, some of the cinematography and editing is so dazzling it's enough to take the breath away. The special effects are also tremendous. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (in the first of his deserved director wins, the best being 2015's 'The Revenant), 'Birdman' is one of the best directed films of 2014 too and shows Iñárritu's immense talent as a director, with breath-taking vision, sense of mood and the ability to make the story as gripping as possible.\n\nThe script is fun, thought-provoking and at times touchingly profound. The story mostly, while sometimes thin, is gripping and the characters engage.\n\nMichael Keaton gives his best performance in years, an outstanding performance and perhaps a career-best. Edward Norton is similarly superb, his performance also ranking among his best. Emma Stones charms and delights too.\n\nOverall, very much divisive, with some people adoring or admiring it and others hating it, personally was one of the people who loved it while acknowledging its imperfections. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

There's no difference between a big blockbuster film and a theatrical play. They are both made by artists trying to make the best art they can.

I bet the people that made \"Birdman\" can say they are proud of what they made.

            "content": "I happened to catch BIRDMAN just a bit ago, for those of you who don't know about it or even for those who just saw the trailer and were still a little confused, Birdman is an arthouse flick written and directed by one of the new heavies of Hollywood Alejandro González Iñárritu, of 21 Grams, Babble and Biutiful fame. The movie stars Michael Keaton as an aging actor living in the shadow of his past glories and his attempts to reignite his career with a Broadway play that he believes will help him prove to himself and the world that he's not just another flash in the pan Hollywood star.\n\nIt's kind of hard to know where to start with this movie because there is a lot going on in it and all of it is noteworthy. For starters, the story is really interesting as it seems to be written SPECIFICALLY for Michael Keaton about his experience since playing the famous caped crusader from Gotham City. The movie plays in a very arthouse cinema sort of way incorporating sharp dialog with surreal visual elements that keep your mind working to figure out how the show is going to play out. This experience is fueled by performances by Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts (all of which have been in comic book movies... Yes, even Naomi Watts, remember Tank Girl? You don't? Well I guess it's just the same because it wasn't very good anyway) as well as a startlingly good performance by Zach Galifinakis! It's really interesting following Keaton and the cast throughout this film and the semi-surreal nature of it really keeps you glued to your seat and wondering what is going to happen next. Will Keaton grow wings or will he buy a pack of gum? Who knows?! And that's really the appeal of this film. It's a kind of original film making that hasn't been seen on a big screen since the late 1970s which is really refreshing.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie and it is sure to garner a few golden statue nominations including Best Original Screenplay and maybe a Best Actor nomination for Keaton and honestly, it would be well deserved. If you do see this movie, here is a tip, don't let the trailer trick you into thinking it's a artsy superhero movie, IT TOTALLY ISN'T but don't let that dissuade you from going to check it out because It's in my top 10 this year. Birdman gets a 4.5...out of 5.",

I'm concerned that David Cross is not in the movie. It seems like some territory that would have been ripe for exploration by such a post-structuralist as Mr. Cross. I guess I am understanding why this was available for $4.99 on Amazon. Perhaps it felt more relevant in 2014. I wish that the guy from Fight Club was NOT in this film. (Yes, I wish it was David Cross instead.) It seems Hollywood has to come out with something like this every so often as an ironic commentary on the superficiality of Hollywood. It reminds me a bit of The Player in that regards but the Player is a more entertaining film to watch. Have we finally left irony in the rear view mirror? Yes, I don't understand what that even means. This movie feels too ‘deep' and ‘shallow' at the same time is what I'm getting at. The only real reason I've bothered with a review is so I would get a chance to continue my tradition of mentioning David Cross in all my reviews and this seems somehow relevant to such a ‘self-reflective' movie.",

It really makes you feel sad for the main character, you really believe him becoming crazy and schizophrenic and you understand how much the movie industry means to him. \"Birdman\" is all about dialogues and characters, as all of them are outstanding. The scenes in the play inside the movie nearly always express the mood of the characters. The reference to Robert Downey Jr in \"Iron Man\" in the beginning is amazing, as it sets the tone for this envy and grief the main character feels. Besides all that, it is an amazing and empathizing thriller, that sometimes gets psychological, which is why you will compassionate with every character, even Emma Stone, who in my opinion, should have had a bigger role in this movie. The ending is amazing, could be compared to \"Whiplash\" even to how good he is. I strongly recommend this movie to literally EVERYONE, not just specific genre lovers, an absolute masterpiece.",

The screenplay is warm, witty and intelligent allowing each actor to perform to their highest caliber. It's a fast paced film with the amount of dialogue and the camera following characters and there is a lot going on. We see Keaton's character looking to become more than a blockbuster star and the voices of birdman still lingering inside. Will people take him seriously and how far will he go for real art. I loved the music. The jazz drumming sets the scene perfectly alongside the classical music. It's a stunning technical movie. Every shot perfectly staged and you can see how much care and attention has been put here. The scene when Keatons character is locked out of the theatre in just his pants is very memorable as are the scenes with Keaton and Norton. They play off each other so well. There is much going on from Keaton's relationship with his daughter and his girlfriend. We see the strain the play causes. One great scene is Keaton flying through the streets before reaching the theatre. Beautiful shot, brilliantly acted a well deserving Oscar winner.",

Where should I begin? The non stop flowing camera work, the metaphysical concept of Riggan, the metronome percussion orchestra, how about the theme of reality embodying fiction? In the heyday of his career, Riggan has exploited his fictional Hollywood comfort zone so much that it nearly cost him his job. As for Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), he heavily embroiders reality into fiction and has a continuing successful career, despite being less popular than Riggan. During the course of Birdman, Mike tries to help Riggan engage in reality by pulling the red curtain out of his eyes via his method acting techniques. Meanwhile, Samantha (Emma Stone) dwells in the neutral side, fulfilling her father's fantasy while also gazing at the current world. During which, Riggan's alter ego and voice in his head resembles his weakness and he tries to overcome it with his soon-to-be-successful play. To wrap up the analysis, A.G. Inarritu's satire takes flight and soars above the dark side of prestige and it's slutty cousin popularity. \n\n(4 ½ Dead Jellyfish out of 5)",

Earlier in the evening he had won statues for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.  The picture that garnered him all these awards was Birdman (or, The Unexpected Virtue of Innocence).\n\nThe movie stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a Hollywood actor idolized for his portrayal of a superhero named Birdman in a trilogy of films.  Riggan is now seeking to prove something to himself, his fans, and the acting community by adapting, starring in, and producing a Broadway play.  The role is a pinnacle for Keaton and he is matched toe to toe by Edward Norton as onstage co-star Mike Shiner.  Both men were deservedly nominated for Oscar Acting nods.  Other notable performers include Emma Stone, Zac Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Amy Ryan.  If you enjoy top notch acting, the performances contained within the film's two hours will excite the heck out of you.  For me, there is something extremely special about watching an actor playing an actor acting… if it's done well.  And it is done superbly here.\n\nActing aside, the story itself is very much out there, told perhaps for the sole sake of art and expressing ideas.  From this vantage point the film won't be to everyone's taste.  The entire movie is filmed in single take where there are no cuts between scenes and the camera flows continually.  Most of the story occurs within the theater's stage and back-stage, so this style of filming is extremely tight and congested.  For me this was an apt metaphor for all that is swirling around in Riggan's mind.  From the opening scene through its unconventional conclusion, there is always a mystical wonder of what is really going on and what isn't.  The storytelling reminded me of when I have a frantic dream that I want out of, but it seems to continually rewind to a point of discomfort and play out again and again, just slightly differently each time.    \n\nHow far will one go for fame and adoration, and how much does one lose while seeking it?  That is the trade wind of this film, while underneath that it is tempered with gusts of laugh-out-loud hilarity.   The musical score is fantastic and the way the music is often used to break the fourth wall all on its own was spectacular.  Given its uniqueness I could certainly understand how the film might tailspin for some, but for me it flew high and magnificently!",

I finished watching this feeling inspired towards my own art, simply saying to anyone that would listen: \"Now that is a movie!\"\n\nEver since the phenomenon that is the Daredevil one-take hallway fight scene I've been fascinated by the art of the one-take. It demands a level of attention from the audience at all time whilst appearing natural, granting the audience presence. The camera work executed here by Emmanuel Lubezki made me feel as if I was constantly in the scene, alike found-footage movies such as Paranormal Activity; working alongside Riggan's questionable sanity and the overarching themes of the surreal, it makes you wonder who you are to these characters - if anyone at all. With a total of 28 well-hidden cuts, that means an average of over 4 minute cuts that flow seamlessly. Wow.\n\nI feel that this wouldn't work without the casting. Michael Keaton is the standout here, commanding space with his characters confidence, unstable emotion and stress. The moments where you see Riggan switch from the real world to the fantasy he is living in his own head are so powerful, and without his performance there would likely be half as many theories over what is real and what is fake within this movie. I feel as if the underrated performance was that of Lindsay Duncan, who bore significant threat in her scenes against huge characters played by Keaton and Norton.\n\nWith this being said, my favourite scene was between Edward Norton and Emma Stone when they are on the roof for the first time. Both actors displaying their wants so well through body language that I challenge you could remove all dialogue from the scene and still understand the interaction. Stone's boldness against Norton's restraint makes for an interesting scene with palpable tension. We are shown earlier that there is a large disparity between the two, thwarting any romantic relation, yet the chemistry is so strong that this idea is heavily questioned.\n\nIf I were to suggest an improvement, I would remove the sub-plots of Tabitha the critic or Jake the producer. They both pressure Riggan's play to have success, applying pressure in sometimes different, sometimes exactly the same ways. Instead, it would be nice to have more time with Sylvia the ex-wife; if Riggan was given more time with her character, he would likely form a stronger bond with his daughter based on symbolic meanings rather than any real connection. The important thing to remember is that in a film that is this well populated, it would be distasteful to just add another element.\n\nAs a story, this is well worth the watch. Expertly crafted with outstanding camera work, scoring, acting and focus on themes that truly take this movie to incredible heights.",

It doesn't add anything to the story and the film would've been better off without the manifestation of his character. \nIñarritu hits us with the superhero stunt which was blended into the story line with a hammer.

There's no doubt the film is a technical triumph and is another stunning showcase of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, fresh from his Oscar win for the visually extraordinary Gravity. The camera weaves in and out of rooms, spinning away to follow Keaton as he struts comically down corridors before seamlessly breaking through the ceiling and taking flight among the rooftops of New York City. There is a particularly funny sequence that follows Keaton in his underwear and socks striding uncomfortably down the street as paparazzi flood him with camera flashes. In a film where one moment Keaton is levitating in his underpants and taking flight as a bird the next, it is his constipated expression here that truly shines.\n\nThe plot is about a washed-up actor struggling with ego and identity as he battles to mount a comeback performance for the opening night of his new play, which just so happens to be directed, written, and starring himself. This alone says something about the nature and dangers of ego, and the film goes on to explore this in its two-hour run-time that occasionally feels sluggish and meandering due to its constant stream of motion. While an impressive feeling of improvisation lingers in every scene, the film can't shake of its own self-importance, which even sees its own jazz-infused score shoe-horned into a dining room, with the drummer inexplicably playing there among the characters. However, it is all executed with artistry and confidence. There is no doubt the film will likely be considered pretentious, and to an extent it clearly is, but showmanship is exactly what the film is about, the fact that it achieves this with both its technical filmmaking and satirical story of fame is applaudable.",

The story is pretty weird, though, and there's a lot of sexual dialogue and situations that don't actually add anything to the film. Also the ending undercuts itself.

            "content": "Movies about the â~industry', particularly actors, tend to get rewarded by the Academy and therefore it's no surprise that this film earned the Academy Award for Best Picture. Going into the film I was slightly worried because I am not a fan of director Alejandro Gonzalez IÃ±Ã¡rritu's other films because they can often slip into pretension and unbelievable contrivances. The cast list looked great with the exception of the always terrible Emma Stone and I expected to see a fantastic Michael Keaton considering all of the praise he received. I was mostly satisfied as I felt the film made some interesting comments on the artistic process and featured beautiful cinematography but I hated Stone's performance and the score which completely didn't fit the tone of the film.\n\nRiggan Thomspon, Michael Keaton, is a washed-up actor most famous for his role as the superhero Birdman in a series of early-1990s films. He is attempting to revitalize his career by adapting, directing and starring in an adaption of Raymond Carver's â~What We Talk About When We Talk About Love' on the stage. New drama is introduced to his life when tempestuous method actor Mike Shiner, Edward Norton, is brought on to act in the play and begins a relationship with Thompson's distant junkie daughter Sam, Emma Stone, and questions Thompson's artistic process. As he loses his grip on reality he begins to have delusions of Birdman encouraging him to take up his mantle as a superhero again and take down his enemies, namely theatre critic Tabitha, Lindsay Duncan, as he makes increasingly irrational decisions.\n\nEmmanuel Lubezki won his second of three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography for his work on this film and he is deserving as the film uses innovative techniques to appear as though the entire film is one long shot. Thinking about how difficult it must have been to give this appearance allows you to appreciate even more how much effort was put into the film. The film is never beautiful like Gravity (2013) or The Tree of Life (2011) but the drama and emotion in certain scenes is captured perfectly as the lens is focused on the theatrical expressions of each character and the wildness of Thompson's delusions.\n\nThe performances that I most enjoyed were those of Andrea Riseborough, as Thompson's girlfriend, and Naomi Watts, as the play's lead actress and Shiner's ex-girlfriend. They managed to make the theatrical, stagey style of acting employed by all in this film work and feel natural in a way that it doesn't coming out of Keaton and Norton. Watts' performance had obvious echoes of Betty/Diane from Mulholland Drive (2001), a significantly better and more interesting film, but she still feels fresh and exciting as the touch of melancholy she brings to the role is fitting. Riseborough is believable as the shallow and needy girlfriend whose intentions are often unclear and she brings some of the best acting moments out of Keaton when she talks about wanting to be a mother. Stone is awful as always as the film is near unwatchable when she appears on screen, all of the affectation and fakeness that she is unable to cut out of her performances comes to the forefront.\n\nEasily the worst part of the film was the musical score as Lubezki chose to include the music of Antonio Sanchez whose compositions would fit better in a Martin Scorsese movie than this dark comedy. I was frustrated each time the drums kicked in giving a whimsical touch to scenes that were meant to be serious and emotionally moving, it managed to ruin parts of the film for me and that's unfortunate.\n\nThis would not have been my choice for Best Picture but it's definitely one of the more interesting winners of the 2010s especially when considering the wins of The Artist (2011) and The King's Speech (2010). My Best Picture of 2014 would have been Boyhood (2014) because although I have significant issues with it I still think it's an incredible achievement with some moments that feel so true to life that you can't help but be emotionally moved. I never felt moved by Birdman despite the technically marvelous cinematography and the performances of Watts and Riseborough, it deserves praise but it suffers under the weight of a bad score and some contrived moments.",

Iñárritu ha diretto un film spettacolare, utilizzando la tecnica del piano sequenza con grande maestria per quasi l'intera durata della pellicola. Ovviamente il montaggio è presente ma grazie a degli accorgimenti il film sembra un continuo flusso di avvenimenti. Michael Keaton è stato semplicemente monumentale, interpretando il ruolo di un personaggio tormentato dal supereroe che lo ha reso famoso e che allo stesso tempo lo ha intrappolato all'interno della sua figura. Una sorta di ritratto della stessa carriera di Keaton, famoso per il ruolo di Batman a cavallo tra gli anni 80' e 90'; in poche parole meritava l'Oscar. Emma Stone bravissima, così come gli altri attori del cast, ma uno su tutti ci ha regalato una performance quasi a livello di quella di Keaton, ovvero Edward Norton, brillantissimo e calato alla perfezione nella parte; peccato che anche lui non abbia vinto agli Oscar. La fotografia mi è piaciuta, soprattutto quando Reegan entra nel negozio di alcolici ed è circondato da lucine di tutti i colori. Inoltre, come se non fosse abbastanza, Inárritu ci infila anche una critica più che efficace ai blockbuster e a tutti quei film che mirano al solo guadagno, rischiando di compromettere la carriera di attori e attrici, come nel caso di Reegan e dello stesso Keaton. Stupendo!",

Its like the band Kraftwerk had made their music with acoustic instruments, its still artsy and cool music but its not cutting edge its not Game Changing like James Cameron did with cutting edge technology in Titanic.

It is a roller-coaster of a film, and I mean that halfway to literally. There are virtually to no cuts in the cinematography, and I can see how much that can turn someone off as hard as a grandmother's vacation slides. I think what I saw in this film was something that required a more analytical approach. The film mainly follows Thomson consistently, because the film wants us to see his stages of depression and fall from grace. Something that cuts, jumping the audience through time and space, may fail to do and have can leave out critical information.

            "content": "A well-written movie, with superb acting and phenomenal directing will usually get 4 and a half stars from me. To get 5, it needs to be that one element more special than just a fantastic movie. It has to be unique or a different perspective on a previously tackled subject. \"Birdman\" (or \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\") fits that description and gets 5 stars only because it cannot get more. Every movie starts with a story. The story portrayed here is flawless. It is a brilliant story written in such a dark, nonsensical way, yet anchored with so much dialogue that 2 hours zooms by as the viewer tries hard to absorb it. It's the kind of story that leaves you talking about it, reading more about it and wanting to watch it again just to be sure you got it all. In that sense, it was perfect. To execute all of that dialogue, the casting and acting had to be perfect, and I see no way it could have been done more perfectly. The attraction to the initial construct of the story centers around a seemingly washed-up actor who, 20 years removed from his heyday, is seeking to be both respected as an actor and appreciated by the fans who left him long ago. However, as all good stories will include, the irony is, the meat of the story is not truly about that at all. Sure, it is peripherally, but the point of the film is about so much more than that. So, on the surface, getting Michael Keaton to play a role that is meant to lure audiences in thinking that the comparison to Michael's character, Riggin, and Michael himself is what the movie is about, but instead the audiences will be fed so much more. And to do that not only takes excellent writing, but also solid casting and acting. \"Birdman\" also perfectly does this. Since the majority of the film is about the pretension of acting as a whole, both in celebrity-driven Hollywood as well as the self-importance of the Broadway theater scene, it was vital to cast actors who have done both and can seriously, yet ironically, play those kinds of characters. Emma Stone and the brilliant Edward Norton solidify the execution of this story in a way that makes it so fun to absorb the deluge of dialogue in this 2-hour film. That brings us to directing. The gasoline in this machine, which relies heavily on how the acting carries out the dialogue and story, is rooted strongly in how the camera and direction guide the audience cinematically through it. The dizzying, sometimes frantic, pace of the camera work and the perception of a 2-hour single-shot film, is the main reason the acting and script is able to be absorbed by the audience. The chemistry of all of these elements are done so perfectly, that 4.5 stars was an easy award. What put \"Birdman\" over the top, however, is the sheer absurdity of its subject matter. The film is so schizophrenic, yet has to be in order to be coherent. It's a dark comedy. It's a drama. It's an exquisite study into the minds of the type of people who become actors, why they get sucked into the field, what tortures them throughout their careers and, in the end, how they wrestle with the drama that has to be created in their own lives to even continue on such a seemingly-futile balance of integrity and popularity. The definition of success as an actor is almost completely blurred. Then to attempt to blend any success in that craft with success in real life is just impossible. \"Birdman\" is such a farce, yet brilliantly constructed as an almost educational analysis of the industry that one walks out of the film simply amazed and nearly breathless trying to comprehend what had just been witnessed. \"Birdman\" is what filmmaking is all about and what is so rarely seen. It will be taught in universities for years. It deserves Oscar recognition for directing, best acting, best supporting acting and screenplay. It's just that good.",

            "content": "\"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" - or \"Birdman\" in short - has definitely become one of my all-time favourite movies, due to its overall excellence and uniqueness. \n\nCinematographically, Iñárritu and Lubezki have created an outright gem. To start off, the fairly eye-catching intent of making it seem like the film was all shot in one take works beautifully with the whole story (i.e. the functioning of a theater house and the people within) since it makes the story fluent and dynamic - though we'll come back to that later. Visually, this cinematography is accompanied surprisingly nicely by both props, set design and colour composition, given that a big part of the story takes place in a rather dark environment.\nIn addition to this - further building onto my previous point - the use of light in this movie is fascinating; I'd say that around about every setting could be analyzed to reveal meticulous eye for lighting and positioning of actors. Coloured lights are used every now and again, but not overdone, perfectly cohering with the story. With that, I'd also like to point out the remarkable ease of use of nearly 180 degrees of mirror every time one enters the frame - so fluently executed, one might not even notice it at first.\n\nApart from \"Birdman\" being nice to look at, it's also nice to listen to. The soundtrack boils down to a single percussion band accompanying the entire film, with the film dictating its pace as it goes, and the other way around. A handful of times, the music is used to induce a subtle fourth-wall break, which is a nice touch illustrating the fine balance between irony and - albeit depressing - realism in the plot.\nSpeaking of which: the story is, like I might or might not have suggested already, considerably fast-paced. It takes some time to get used to at first, but after that, it's hard to imagine the story working with a slower cadence (something the lack of cuts attributes to as well). What struck me most, is how quickly the characters get over certain conflicts, making the fairly intense emotions way more bearable to sit through: it's a unique kind of volatility, giving the story a level of freedom which helps it about so much better. Don't get me wrong though, this doesn't make the development of the different characters any less significant; dialogue is still very thought-out, and makes the viewer go through a rollercoaster of emotion and opinion.\n\nAll that said, this movie succeeds in every one of its aspects to not only convey its story and the idea behind it, but also to let the viewer enjoy nice cinematography. I think it's fair to say \"Birdman\" must've taken legendary crew efforts and posed great challenges for everyone involved, though the result is an incredibly marvelous film.",

E' una critica profonda e cinica verso il mondo di Hollywood che si prende gioco anche dell'ignoranza e la superficialità che troppo spesso accompagna il pubblico cinematografico internazionale. Il messaggio traspare perfettamente fin dall'inizio e accompagna una pellicola che mantiene un ritmo costante che coinvolge e diverte con intelligenza.

From director Alejandro González Iñárritu, comes the story of Riggan Thomson, a once popular movie star for his role as a crime fighting superhero named Birdman, who struggles with trying to get his play off its feet for the previews. Riggan, who is played by Michael Keaton, is an alcoholic loser who is afraid that society has forgotten about him. He is constantly in a state of euphoria due to his mental break downs in which he is able to talk to his imaginary Birdman character. Birdman is a physical representation of Riggan's conscience. Riggan is constantly losing grip of reality which causes him to hallucinate himself floating and flying throughout the city. His loss of reality also causes him to have terrible relationships, including his own daughter Sam, who is played by Emma Stone. Hoping to keep the play alive, Riggan hires a skilled, egotistical actor named Mike, who is played by Edward Norton. Mike causes all sorts of problems for Riggan, including trying to have sex on stage with another cast member and having a relationship with his daughter Sam. Through stunning visuals and wonderful performing, watch as Riggan's play starts to fall apart. Keaton's interpretation of Riggan creates many memorably awkward scenes that make you keep coming back to re-watch. Director Iñárritu constructs these wonderful scenes through amazing cinematography and fantastic camera editing that really sets the tone for story. During the film, he uses the chaotic sound of a solo drummer, performing a routine, to simulate problems and escalating situations. When the drumming begins, the audience is aware that something important is about to take place. Witness Riggan slowly start to understand his faults that he made during his life. He put all of his fame and faith on Birdman and is realizing that all good things eventually come to an end. The only person excited to be in the cast happens to be Lesley. Lesley, who is played by Naomi Watts, is a small-time actress finally excited to get her big break. Riggan interacts with others throughout the film including Zach Galifianakis playing his manager Jake, Amy Ryan as his ex-wife Sylvia, and Lindsey Duncan as a rotten critic Tabitha Dickinson. Birdman is full of surprises and funny moments while also being sad and dramatic to watch. From Mike getting drunk on stage and messing up an entire performance, to Riggan walking through Times Square almost naked, audiences will always be shocked and entertained by what they see. With such an interesting and complex ending, Birdman leaves a lot to the minds of the audience members by not showing or telling exactly what happens to conclude the film. This also creates a whole level of mystery that allows the audience to create their own vision and view for how the movie ended. I highly recommend that everyone should give Birdman a try. The story line is action packed while also being sophisticated and kept moving along. I was never bored nor tired while watching Keaton make a fool of himself on the big screen. Birdman is a terrific and beautiful story filled with twists and turns that captivate movie-goers all around the world.",

You will either think you get it or you just wont get it at all. \n\nThroughout the film Birdman is physicslly seen as a physical manifestation of the protagonist, Riggan Thomas(Michael Keaton) Birdman taunts and challenges Riggan to do better in his career and his performance and sometimes serves as an advocate for his strife. At times Riggan seemingly becomes Birdman and is able to use certain special abilities of Birdman behind closed doors. The film keeps you in the impression that its all in his head but then sometimes the film makes you think it's not.\n\nThere's a lot of little nuances and jabs at the  Hollywood grinder and the struggles of acting as a profession, they serve to round out the overall tone of the film.

I reviewed it in one sentence.\nEvery once in a particularly blue moon comes a film that grabs you by the gut and refuses to let go, a film so dazzlingly original that you remain bewitched by its sheer audaciousness for days on end, and this is exactly what Birdman is - one of the wittiest, most well thought-out, and, might I add, trippiest films in recent memory, but that is hardly a surprise, given the fact that it was directed by acclaimed Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, until now famous for helming the direction of devastating, emotionally-wrecking films like Love's a Bitch, Babel and Biutiful, who takes a complete detour here and delivers a complete rollercoaster of a ride, a film so ridiculously smart and funny, it will leave you feeling satiated the way few films have ever managed to, and this is largely due to its absolute cracker of a script, the basic gist of which is as follows - Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton in a killer comeback performance) is a complete washout of an actor, a man famous for playing the eponymous role in the Birdman trilogy of films that came out in the early 90s, a period when he experienced much appreciation, power and fame, and now two decades later, having refused a lucrative offer of starring in the fourth installment of the franchise, he is eager to make a comeback, writing, directing and starring in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story titled \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" for Broadway at the prestigious St. James Theatre in New York, but Riggan has his task cut out big time, for there are a number of people who throw a spanner in his works - an egotistical star Mike Shiner (played by an excellent Edward Norton) who wrecks a preview of the play just because the gin he received on stage was water and not gin (and one who believes in getting an erection on stage to get into the skin of his character to boot), an ex-drug addict of a daughter, Sam (played by the gorgeous, gorgeous Emma Stone) who constantly berates him for his lack of recognition of the vitality of social media in an age of selfies and Twitter, a batty old theatre critic called Tabitha Dickenson (Lindsay Duncan), his primary nemesis, who is hell-bent upon trashing his film in the New York Times and completely destroying his play, a girlfriend named Laura (played by Andrea Risenborough) who might be pregnant, an ex-wife who constantly visits him (Amy Ryan in a stellar role) who, in one of the film's most hilarious scenes, reminds Riggan how he had thrown a kitchen-knife at her and minutes later declared his love for her, and, most of all, his alter-ego Birdman, a voice in his head that constantly criticizes his choice of Broadway as a medium for staging a comeback when all someone in his position really has to do is go back to playing those superhero roles he is so well-known for, and one that drives him to imagine the craziest of visions (not least of all the film's very opening scene in which we see him levitating three feet above the ground and which  pretty much sets us up for the outrageousness that is set to follow) - and needless to say, Riggan encounters one hurdle after another, even leaving him at a point where he believes all is lost and there is no hope of redemption, and whether or not he manages to overcome this lies at the very crux of this incredible film, one that is made even more incredible by its genius, genius cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, better known in film-circles as Chivo (Spanish for goat), but what he manages to accomplish here is hardly the work of one, for he manages to make our jaws drop in collective wonder and remain there for the entirety of the film's duration, admittedly something that was expected, given the fact that this is a man who had earlier delivered a sucker punch with his thrilling camerawork in Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity (and much deservedly won Oscar acclaim for it as well), but what Lubezki manages to achieve here is unprecedented and something that has only been seen earlier in master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's Rope - he gives us the impression that the entire film, barring the last few minutes, has been shot in a single take, for the camera just keeps moving from stage to the terrace of St. James Theatre to the streets of New York in a fluid, breathtaking manner - and this is all the more admirable, given the fact that Innaritu took all of 30 days to complete shooting for this film, which, needless to say, would have involved an unbelievable, unbelievable amount of preparation and rehearsals from everyone involved in this outrageous project, from the actors themselves to the technicians and cameramen, for even the tiniest of mistakes, a tiny slip here, a mispronounced syllable there, would render the efforts of everyone else in that same take worthless and of no use, and as a result, let the entire crew down, which just goes to show how admirable it is that the entire film was shot in such an incredibly short span of time, but Lubezki and Innaritu have never been ordinary mortals, and here, in the best work of their respective filmographies, they amply demonstrate how filmmaking can be elevated by gifted craftsmen like them from a simple art to a work of awe-inspiring beauty, but let us digress from that for a moment and dwell upon the many nuances that the film has to offer, and nuances there are aplenty, for this a film with many layers, a film with subtext beneath its glossy, shining veneer, a film that manages to cunningly sneak home a point or two about celebrity culture, mankind's eternal need for recognition, and egotism even as it constantly bedazzles us with its sheer visual glory, which are pretty much running themes that serve as the backbone of this enterprise for the entirety of its running time, and this is perhaps best demonstrated in one of the film's most powerful scenes that Emma Stone pretty much knocks out of the park, featuring a devastating monologue she delivers in sheer frustration at her father's almost self-debilitating desire for fame and power, and his complete (thus far) ineptitude in achieving the same, and another one in which the play's producer and Riggan's best friend (played by an amiable Zach Galifianakis, in a complete U-turn from his The Hangover days) insists that Mike continue to remain on the play's cast for the massive star power he enjoys, which alone was responsible for most of the preview audience coming in in the first place, this despite him having publicly humiliated Riggan and nearly wrecked the entire play itself - it's a scene that speaks volumes about our obsession with stars and how production values and pretty much anything else in theatre will always take a back seat, one that hauntingly reminds us of ourselves even, and therein lies the power of this audacious film, a film laced with dialogue so rich it packs the power of dynamite - for instance, in response to Riggan reprimanding him for his outrageous actions a few minutes ago, Mike nonchalantly replies, \"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige, my friend\", and \"That's a nice bird, man!\" as he eats fried chicken in the wreck that the stage is, even while a horrified Riggan looks on in utter disbelief, a disbelief that we as an audience share incidentally, for I can't remember the last time that a film managed to enthrall so much, a film that grabs one by the balls and delivers a shot of adrenaline so acute it will leave one giddy with pleasure, and it is the wittiness of the writing and the laudable originality of the script that help elevate this sensation of awe-inspired wonder to an entirely new level, besides an absolute cracker of a soundtrack by Antonio Sanchez that is mostly jazz-based, the constant and feverish beating of the drums pretty much making me want to leave everything else and headbang for as long as my neck can hold, and that, ladies and gentleman, is the power of a good background score - it unfolds in a joyous, all-pervasive narrative of its own, and considering all this, one can't help but acknowledge that Birdman is one of the most technically proficient films to have come out of Hollywood in recent memory, and this is a welcome, joyous landmark for an industry that is otherwise much dreaded as an assembly-line of brain-dead big-budget crap that it somehow manages to churn out week upon week, year after year (are you listening, Michael Bay?), and this is why we should appreciate this little gem all the more and give it all the recognition it so rightfully deserves, besides sparing a thought for the magnificent Michael Keaton, who, like the character he plays, pretty much faded away from public memory and cinema after starring as Batman in two of Tim Keaton's films, an actor who deserved so much more with the sheer wealth of talent he has on offer but ended up getting sidelined in favour of the Adam Sandlers and Zac Efrons of a film industry that is barely capable of recognizing genuine, once-in-a-generation talent for what it is worth, and for that, we must doff our hats to Innaritu, a master filmmaker in complete control of his craft, indeed something that very few of his contemporaries, Wes Anderson for instance, can claim to be, and a man who has managed to pull off one of the greatest, most awe-inspiring miracles in the history of modern cinema: that glorious, glorious single take (it did contain a negligible number of cuts, but Lubezki knows his cinematography better than anyone else) is something that will be discussed and scrutinized closely in film circles for as long as movies are around, but in a film like this, almost anything (and everything) can't help but appear to be a tiny miracle in itself, given the sheer quality of filmmaking that is on display here, and Innaritu does appear to be a modern-day version of Midas, a master who changes anything he touches on the film set to gold - needless to say, this is a glorious, much-needed moment for indie filmmakers and connoisseurs of quality cinema alike, and I can't help but feel that is a film that SHOULD sweep a majority of the Oscars that it has been nominated for but will not, given the Academy's propensity for feel-good dramas and coming of age films, films that mostly come with a baggage of self-importance attached to them (Twelve Years A Slave...really???), but groundbreaking achievements like these don't really need a golden statuette to confirm their merit, for this is a film that any true lover of films and what they stand for will appreciate, a film that packs a punch and yet manages to remain frighteningly intelligent at the same time, and now that I have raved on and on for nearly two thousand words about how good this masterpiece is, throw aside anything else that you are doing, visit the nearest multiplex and soak in the glory of Innaritu's creation for all its worth, for it is an experience that is best enjoyed on the biggest of big screens that you can ever find, and watching it will be tantamount to watching your perception of what cinema can be change before your very eyes - for this is a film that belongs to the biggest of big leagues, one that you will be very unlikely to ever forget in the near future - so go ahead, experience an incredible journey that is as much a life-altering experience as it is a film about life itself, and on this rather fanboyish note, let me conclude with a quote by our winged hero himself: \"Let's go back one more time and show them what we are capable of!\"",

The colour palette and soundscape of this film work in perfect harmony with the long, lilting sequences, evoking a dreamy quality that, far from becoming tiresome, wraps you up in it's quiet grandeur.

            "content": "A well-written movie, with superb acting and phenomenal directing will usually get 4 and a half stars from me. To get 5, it needs to be that one element more special than just a fantastic movie. It has to be unique or a different perspective on a previously tackled subject. \"Birdman\" (or \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\") fits that description and gets 5 stars only because it cannot get more. Every movie starts with a story. The story portrayed here is flawless. It is a brilliant story written in such a dark, nonsensical way, yet anchored with so much dialogue that 2 hours zooms by as the viewer tries hard to absorb it. It's the kind of story that leaves you talking about it, reading more about it and wanting to watch it again just to be sure you got it all. In that sense, it was perfect. To execute all of that dialogue, the casting and acting had to be perfect, and I see no way it could have been done more perfectly. The attraction to the initial construct of the story centers around a seemingly washed-up actor who, 20 years removed from his heyday, is seeking to be both respected as an actor and appreciated by the fans who left him long ago. However, as all good stories will include, the irony is, the meat of the story is not truly about that at all. Sure, it is peripherally, but the point of the film is about so much more than that. So, on the surface, getting Michael Keaton to play a role that is meant to lure audiences in thinking that the comparison to Michael's character, Riggin, and Michael himself is what the movie is about, but instead the audiences will be fed so much more. And to do that not only takes excellent writing, but also solid casting and acting. \"Birdman\" also perfectly does this. Since the majority of the film is about the pretension of acting as a whole, both in celebrity-driven Hollywood as well as the self-importance of the Broadway theater scene, it was vital to cast actors who have done both and can seriously, yet ironically, play those kinds of characters. Emma Stone and the brilliant Edward Norton solidify the execution of this story in a way that makes it so fun to absorb the deluge of dialogue in this 2-hour film. That brings us to directing. The gasoline in this machine, which relies heavily on how the acting carries out the dialogue and story, is rooted strongly in how the camera and direction guide the audience cinematically through it. The dizzying, sometimes frantic, pace of the camera work and the perception of a 2-hour single-shot film, is the main reason the acting and script is able to be absorbed by the audience. The chemistry of all of these elements are done so perfectly, that 4.5 stars was an easy award. What put \"Birdman\" over the top, however, is the sheer absurdity of its subject matter. The film is so schizophrenic, yet has to be in order to be coherent. It's a dark comedy. It's a drama. It's an exquisite study into the minds of the type of people who become actors, why they get sucked into the field, what tortures them throughout their careers and, in the end, how they wrestle with the drama that has to be created in their own lives to even continue on such a seemingly-futile balance of integrity and popularity. The definition of success as an actor is almost completely blurred. Then to attempt to blend any success in that craft with success in real life is just impossible. \"Birdman\" is such a farce, yet brilliantly constructed as an almost educational analysis of the industry that one walks out of the film simply amazed and nearly breathless trying to comprehend what had just been witnessed. \"Birdman\" is what filmmaking is all about and what is so rarely seen. It will be taught in universities for years. It deserves Oscar recognition for directing, best acting, best supporting acting and screenplay. It's just that good.",

In the scene, without spoiling it's memorable conclusion, Emma Stone's character looks down at the ground, and as she turns her focus to the sky, she starts to smile. A cut to black and you hear her laughing.\n\tThere are some key differences between Stone's character and I. The main one at that moment - she smiled for a brief second at the end, whilst I was smiling the whole time.\n\tThe film, usually referred to as simply BIRDMAN, was directed by Iñárritu and written by him and three others (but you wouldn't be able to tell). The 2014 Oscar winner stars Michael Keaton as the titular character, Edward Norton as a method actor, Stone as Keaton's daughter, Zach Galifianakis as the assistant, Amy Ryan as Stone's mother and ex-wife to Keaton, Andrea Riseborough as a newcomer to Broadway, and Naomi Watts as Norton's girlfriend. The film received major critical praise when it was released on October 17, 2014, and ended up grossing in the 9 digits. The film went on to be nominated for 9 Oscars, winning 4, including Best Picture.\nEveryone in the cast, specifically Keaton, are immaculate in their roles. Keaton and Norton seem to literally embody their roles because of how meta their characters are - Keaton plays an actor who used to play a superhero but rejected an offer for a sequel and became obscure, while Norton has been known to be tough to get along with. Emma Stone gives her best performance as an addict just out of rehab and her relationship with her father makes for an interesting dynamic.\nThe star of the film, however, is none of the characters, or it's Oscar winning direction from Iñárritu, for that matter. No, the real showstopper is the cinematography, from fellow Mexican and 3 time Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki. The film is designed to look as if it was done in a single take - as either a way to show the inability to escape the path of emotion, like the director has claimed, or to mirror a Broadway play (the film centers around a play).\nThere isn't a single flaw noticeable throughout the entire film. I strongly urge anybody with a brain and a heart to watch this modern masterpiece.",

No one gave a better performance last year then Michael Keaton as a once famous actor who tries to stage a comeback by writing,directing and starring in a his own play on Broadway. Keaton has not been this great in years, I loved tthe whole element where Birdman is in his head talking to him and that scene where he hears him and makes a mess in his room. That is worth buying this movie on Bluray(when it comes out) alone. Just hearing Michael Keaton do his batman voice again. It was awesome, when you talk about Michael Keaton you immediately think Batman much like how in this film when people talk about Riggan Thomas they think Birdman.\nIt's about an actor desperately trying to step out of his former shadow and into a new light. Just in the hopes of being taken more seriously. It's an incredibly unique and moving film and while it's not all done in one consistent shot it's made to look like it is. This film is directed like its one continuous tracking shot and it's gorgeous. It's amazing. There is not a single actor who gave a bad performance in this. The standouts for me other then Keaton where Emma Stone and Edward Norton I just loved seeing them on screen playing their characters and getting invested. Zach Galafanakis holy crap he was great in this I mean Galafanakis can do drama who knew.\nThis movie was captivating, original, funny, their is not enough a person could say about Birdman.

            "content": "Alejandro gonzalez spearheads the 2014 Drama/film comedy \"Birdman\" into a thought provoking narrative that explores the differences between power,popularity,and prestige.\nThe story revolves around Riggan thomson (Michael keaton) who is the former superhero character \"birdman\",(Which is no secret that the superhero is a literal euphemism for \"Batman\") as he is at the helm of an ambitious broadway production that he desperately hopes to breath life into his irrelevant status and career.Throughout the hectic theatrical production there are many characters who aid riggan and who play roles in their theatrical roles that cause a slight paradoxical confusion.During the plodding progression of the film we start see from the perception of riggan that his theatrical play personifies his biggest hopes and fears.This feeling riggan experiences is constant,always impelling him to lose hope and fear while sometimes regaining hope and losing fear.There are many pivotal characters that act as this fickle stimulus for riggan,such as,once riggan acquires renowned talent in cinema Mike shiner (Edward norton),he advertently ruins the first screening due to his grievance with the lack of alcohol on stage.This action coincides with a more forthright response from riggan's daughter Sam(Emma stone),who gives a disgruntled and impassioned eulogy on why his theatrical play is a futile attempt to stay relevant.The neglect of feeling for riggan and botched rehearsals is prevalent throughout the film's timeline.We see early on in the film the plight riggan has to carry which leads him to find a positive incentive through his conflicting internal psyche \"birdman\",who embodies an affinity for \"The devil on the shoulder\".The \"Birdman\" is a literal figment of riggan's imagination that's emphatically telling riggan to ignore criticism and embrace his superheroic persona,this proposition drives riggan into a drunken stupor and sometimes near suicide,which is evident by the end of the film when riggan shoots himself as a display of devotion through realism,which unexpectedly warranted his film to be a triumphant success.\n\nIllustrious seasoned actress Emma Stone displays her character in a disgruntled and sometimes troubled nature quite well,but on the contrary there seems to be a lack of screen time for her character \"Sam\" but she still manages cultivate her skill though expression rather than dialogue by most notably conveying anger and indignation in her wild impassioned rage.A skew from seasoned actors is \"Edward norton\" who never ceases to impress by giving a praisable,effortless performance as his similar contemporary Mike shiner who will make you blissfully grin in amuse through his charming and conceited demeanor.Lastly The prime actor \"Michael Keaton\" convincible plays the part of Riggan thomson:a man nearly beaten into submission by life's adversities,while also arresting his audiences with his pensive non verbal gazes.\n\nAlejandro gonzález introduces an unconventional style of cinematography that will garner many shockful eyes which will unmistakable appeal to modern audiences.Gonzalez manipulates the camera into seeming like it's filmed into one prolonged tracking shot with such fluidity that you won't be able to spot errors in editing,because it's simply devoid of any.This type of indigenous cinematography has been applied to his other film projects such as \"The Revenant\".He chose this unorthodox style for the sole purpose of creating and giving the illusion that the camera is you and the director wants you to stay congruous with the frantic and informal progression of the behind the scenes atmosphere of a broadway show.\n\nUnfortunately alejandro's theme is so obvious and forceful it feels patronizing towards its audiences.In the title \"Birdman\" there is a clear subtitle that reads \"The unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\",this is explicitly shown by the end of the film,by a broadway film critic,Tabitha.Her headline clearly translates to a \"unexpected talent throught a lack of knowledge\".Its theme from riggan's experience is those who have talent can affort to be ambitious for the likelyhood of success is in your favor.In conclusion \"Birdman\" is a work of sublime craftsmanship,thankfully due to its strong commentary on riggan thomson's viseral fears and hopes that identically mirors and reasonates with keaton's own career.",

It's inevitable that this nonstop anxiety, this constant moving for weeks at a time, is all going to lead to demise.  And when we finally do get a break, a cut in the film, it's to assure us that this man has reached the peak of his insanity and now we're about to settle down.  No, that's just the calm before the storm, the perfect effect for what is about to happen next.  We are trapped in a grand delusion, what success has done to entrap our very subject. Birdman is a more proactive Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard, and as an aging male in the business he has an advantage over her, not to mention having worked in an era of sequels and inflated box office.  His fall from stardom is something he's trying to run from, but it chases him and gets clearer as we move into the second half of the film.  That the one shot illusion is used represents that this one major beat of insanity is attached to a long string of anxiety-building events - they all equate to this one moment, and one cannot possibly be disconnected from the other.  There's so much meaning in that kind of staging, it's not just there to demonstrate it can be done, not a mere technical marvel, but a total view of life in the mind of a suicidal.",

            "content": "Alejandro González Iñárritu , the first Mexican film director to be nominated for Oscars has created movies that have resulted in hit after hit with critics everywhere and his newest project is certainly capable of continuing that thread. His newest offering is Birdman, a film which proves that technical aspects can make just as big an impact on audiences as plot and characters can.\n\nBirdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance) follows faded film star Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is directing and acting in an adaptation of \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" on Broadway in New York. Despite his high position in the play however, Riggan's profession is anything but enjoyable; he often argues with his colleagues, and his relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is fragile at best. Riggan dreams of returning to Birdman, an eighties superhero series that made him famous and as we see, this dream has become an obsession, creeping into his mind at several moments to feed his ego for acting. The film mostly follows Riggan as he interacts with the other characters and makes preparations and rehearsals for the play's opening night. The pacing is as tight as it gets for a drama; there are no slow scenes where little happens or any moments that take place a day or two later. The film stays on task with the plot it sets out to convey and as such, never loses the audience's attention; you just can't take your eyes off the film because there's always something going on. The film's only real problem is that towards the end, many of the characters who played sizeable roles and had strong interactions with Riggan don't really receive any kind of payoff. Does Mike Shiner (Ed Norton) overcome his arrogant ways? Does Lesley (Naomi Watts) go on to something bigger on Broadway? None of these questions are answered as the film focuses its entire attention on concluding Riggan's story. Whilst Birdman's ending does leave a lot to be desired, the journey there is more than worth it, laced with a wide array of humorous and memorable moments.\n\nDespite not getting the closure they deserve, Birdman's characters are all very well rounded and interesting. Keaton is very intriguing and charismatic as Riggan Thomson, arguably one of the best roles he has had in years. Playing off both his obsession with Birdman and his management of the play, it makes for a highly unpredictable character arc; will he return to the series that made him famous or will he step back into the spotlight some other way? I found Riggan to be slightly similar to the character of Willy Loman from Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman in that he finds himself absorbed in his visions of Birdman; these scenes do a great job of emphasising just how much the Birdman character means to the protagonist. The other side characters played by Ed Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts may not have as much focus as Keaton but they all bring their own talents to the film; Norton as the arrogant, full-of-himself Mike Shiner and Stone as Riggan's recovering addict daughter in particular have some great chemistry on screen. All told, it's clear the cast members of Birdman are working at their best to make the character's presence felt throughout the film.\n\nBirdman's cinematography is simply a stroke of genius; outside of three other takes, the film is shot without any kind of normal transitions. The camera continuously and constantly follows the characters, transferring seamlessly between scenes as they move about the different rooms and areas of the theatre environment and when the action is confined to a static location, such as when the characters are rehearsing the play, the camera will rotate, giving a varied view of the proceedings. The film's use of a single take means that we never leave the perspective of the characters and the film's pacing is always moving forward, keeping the audience engaged. The interesting techniques don't end here; there's also an extensive use of mirrors during character conversations which places greater emphasis on the emotive side of the cast's performances. Drums and other instruments enter the film to signify the more intense moments and a minimal use of computer generated imagery is present to put across Riggan's wild imagination and desire to return to the titular superhero he was once renowned for. Overall Birdman's presentation compliments the plot incredibly well, tying in with the hectic nature of putting on a play at the theatre.\n\nAside from a lack of closure in its ending, Birdman is nevertheless a very well-crafted movie; the cast all turn in brilliant performances, drawing you into the story and the film's fascinating editing style is something that has to be seen to be believed.",

Er wirkt friedlich, doch in seinem Inneren - eine knurrende grummelige Stimme, die auf ihn einredet... Dann sehen wir Birdman wieder, wie er wie ein Wahnsinniger über den Times Square rast. Er hat sich aus seinem Theater ausgeschlossen. Das sind die Extreme, durch die Regisseur Alejandro G. Inarritu mit Birdman steuert - voller kühner Ambitionen und spektakulärem handwerklichen Geschick! Es scheint auch so, dass der früher so schicksalsträchtige Inarritu zum ersten Mal Spass gehabt hätte! Birdman jedenfalls ist von Anfang bis zum Ende eine einzige Wucht! Ein zweieinhalb stündiger Film, gefilmt von Emmanuel Lubezki in einem Take. Ein Bühnendarsteller fiel aus, weil ihm eine Lampe auf den Kopf fiel. Riggan (Michael Keaton), Hauptdarsteller und Regisseur des Broadway Stücks, welches in zwei Wochen Premiere haben soll, fragt nach einem möglichen Ersatz, der gerade kein Spandex trägt. Riggan selbst hat früher auch mal einen Superhelden gespielt - das und sein Erfolg als Schauspieler liegen allerdings weit zurück. Michael Keaton selbst spielte seit den 90ern nur noch Nebenrollen und konnte so mit seiner Figur verschmilzen. Mit seinem Broadway Stück aber will Riggan beweisen, dass er auch noch ein seriöser Schauspieler ist (obwohl alle ihn nur nach der alten Super Hero Rolle fragen). Wann wird er endlich Birdman IV drehen? Birdman sitzt ihm zusätzlich im Nacken als Alter Ego, der ihm auch noch den Tipp gibt, lieber Action zu machen als diesen deprimierenden philosophischen Mist. Die Handlung folgt einem klassischen \"Hinter den Kulissen\" - Stück, in dem die Tage vor der Premiere von Katastrophen geprägt sind. Seine jämmerliche Geliebte (Andrea Riseborough) glaubt schwanger zu sein, seine Bühnen-Partnerin (Naomi Watts) schleppt ihren Freund, das Schwein (Edward Norton), an, der mit Riggans Tochter (Emma Stone) flirtet (dabei hatte die gerade einen Entzug). Schliesslich taucht auch noch die Exfrau (Amy Ryan) auf, um alte Wunden aufzureissen, während der Agent (Zach Galifianakis) verzweifelt versucht, alles irgendwie zusammen zu halten... Jeder braucht jeden in Birdman. Zach Galifianakis als Manager spielt an gegen Keaton inmitten des ganzen Wahnsinns (und doch auch mit ihm!). Emma Stone ist wundervoll als Riggans schwache und klugscheisserische Tochter, die aber auch noch so etwas wie seine Assistentin darstellt. Amy Ryan als Exfrau sieht beides in ihm: Sowohl das Hassenswerte als auch das Gute. Naomi Watts wiederum spielt ebenfalls beides: Die harten, aber auch die lichten Momente einer Neurotikerin. Das Ergebnis: Ein Film, der so viel Spass macht wie kaum einer dieses Jahr! Dazu gibts die witzigsten phantastischen Komödien in unserer Film List auf cinegeek.de",

There are a lot of social media around there, such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. In Birdman, there were several plots showed that how can these media impact a show or a person. Moreover, how can a voice in your head influence you? That's what this movie was talking about. This movie happened on New York Broadway, which talked about a washed out former star. He always heard a voice from a character he used to play, which was Birdman. The movie is based on this to tell a story of this guy's life.\n\tRiggan (Michael Keaton) was a quite famous actor who used to play Birdman. He started his new career at Broadway, and these days he started rehearsal his first show, but there was an extremely creditable movie reviewer whom would write a bad review whether she watched the show or not. And then there was the first emergency that they needed find a new guy to substitute another guy that accidently got hit. The actress from the show, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), said she knew Mike (Edward Norton) who was quite famous at that time can substitute the gap. Mike's acting was quite awesome, but his behavior was not that pleasant. Along the time, Riggan always can hear a voice from 'Birdman', which he hated, talks to him and wanted to convince him he is Birdman. Throughout the whole movie, there were several points always remind Riggan that he is the Birdman. For example, when he was in a bar on Broadway there were few fans wanted to take photo with Riggan as a Birdman player, and then when he naked walk through the Time Square there were some people wanted his signature and photo. These parts made Riggan think he might be the birdman in some ways. When Riggan was struggling with his first show, his daughter said a lot of stuff to him. Such as, ' it's not for the sake of art. It's because you want to feel relevant again. Well, there's a whole world out there where people fight to be relevant every day'. Due to this talk he started thinking what he really wants. When they were rehearsal, Mike told Riggan he could easily find out he was using a fake gun, and then during the real show he pulled outa real gun and shot himself. That made everyone know him mostly from social media, but in the movie Riggan doesn't like social media, but the fact was the social media helped he a lot in his first show. It also showed that nowadays people are addicted to their online social life.\n\tUsing drumbeats as the background music were quite impressive, because the beats lead the tempo of the movie and would make audiences and movie have a strong connection. With the drum, audiences would get more into the movie. Furthermore, the whole movie was a continuous one shoot, therefore, all actors had to be extremely related. It's quite hard for all actors, because they all had so many lines to remember and they all needed a good acting. Moreover, the only one take style might make audiences thinking during the whole movie instead of just watching a movie not even thinking.\nI think this movie is more like adult movie, which the parents better not bring their children to watch it. In the movie there were some clips about drugs, smoking and sexual related. Maybe parents can go watch it as a date night movie.",

This is an actor who you could argue had barely attained relevancy in twenty years, and here it really works for him, pushing character Riggan to the actual brink of insanity. \nYou can also believe that after the whole Incredible Hulk debacle that Edward Norton really is that kind of ridiculously anal arsehole to work with. \n\nWith its ingenious one shot camera trickery, no doubt you will feel a touch confused and perhaps even struggle to match the rather frantic pace of Birdman.

            "content": "'Birdman' Review: Brilliant and Smart, Perfect Keaton Performance - 9ish.\n\n\"Birdman\" is all about reputation and redemption. Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) was once an iconic superhero, hence the title. Thompson decides to revamp his acting career by writing, starring and directing his own adaption of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" Thompson faces multiple problems around every corner.\n\nHe finds an actor that the Broadway audience adores, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), and everything seems to be falling into place. Thompson then has altercations with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), with himself - and, it seems, with the world. Constantly battling production issues, he also fights the voice inside his head that taunts him to ultimately try and redeem himself.\n\n\"Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" to use its full title - is about crisis and how Thompson handles it. He wants to call himself beloved, and to feel himself beloved on earth, to paraphrase the opening of the film.\n\nAlejandro G. Iñárritu, who also picked up Oscars for directing and writing, has made an incredible movie. It's an ambitious stab at magical realism, with many scenes featuring Keaton moving things with his mind and flying through New York City.\n\nIñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who also picked up an Oscar, achieve an amazing feat by making \"Birdman\" appear to be just one shot with such smooth style. Most of the cuts are hidden within the pans and are so well done, it makes it incredibly hard to catch them. In the DVD's special features, the actors talk about the difficulty involved with such long, continuous scenes. If they messed up the end, it meant starting all over again.\n\nMichael Keaton is outstanding and it's hard to believe he didn't win Best Actor at the Oscars. It's ironic as well, because in reality, Keaton is mirroring his character. As Thompson is escaping \"Birdman,\" Keaton is escaping his iconic performance as \"Batman.\"\n\nIn \"Birdman,\" we follow Thompson around and experience his claustrophobic life within the tight walls of the St. James Theater in New York City. He battles his alter ego while balancing on the fence of insanity. At times he's a burning comet soaring through the sky, while in others he's a dead jellyfish lying on the beach to rot (check the special features for that reference).\n\nThere are three bonus features included on the DVD/Blu-ray. The best extra is \"Birdman: All-Access.\" This is an awesome insight to the making of the movie, a behind-the-scenes look at the process and the actors' and actresses' thoughts. There is an in-depth interview with Michael Keaton and Alejandro Iñárritu about the movie, and the package includes stills from the set.\n\nNorton and Stone both received supporting actor nominations and are well deserving of them. Iñárritu brought out the best in the rest of the cast including Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough.\n\n\"Birdman\" is an incredible experience coated with brilliant acting, writing and cinematography, and is an outstanding movie that will be talked about for years to come.\n\nCheck out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!",

En saanut tästä niin isoja fiiilareita kuin olisin toivonut. Soundtrack oli myös erikoinen. Pääosin rummuttelua. Hauskaksi asian teki se, että taustamusiikkina kuultuun rummutteluun imestyikin muutamassa kohdassa selitys, jossain nurkan takana piileksivä rumpumies, tai kadulla kulkeva paraati. Nauratti.

Eventually, he thinks he is too big for the role and spins off into a new career on Broadway.  His show sells out and is popular, but he often fights with the cast, he lacks professionalism, and is depressed that he likely made the wrong decision to stop being Birdman.  A voice in his head leads him and chaos follows.\n\n\"Why did we break up?\"\n\"Because you threw a kitchen knife at me.\"\n\nAlejandro Gonzales, director of The Revenant, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful, To Each his Own Cinema, and September 11, delivers Birdman.  The storyline for this picture is an interesting character piece with many unique elements, unexpected action, and random events.  The acting is very good and the cast includes Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, and Naomi Watts. \n\n\"Smells like balls.\"\n\nThis was added to HBOGO a couple months ago and I was excited to finally get a chance to watch this.  This was different and surprising in many ways.  I really enjoyed the script and thought it was well done.  This is a movie you will likely only need to see once, so I wouldn't add it to the DVD collection, but this is worth your time and entertaining.\n\n\"She does look like she licked a homeless man's ass.\"\n\nGrade: B+/A-",

            "content": "I cheated a little bit here: I'd actually seen the first 10 minutes or so of Birdman before, but switched off for one reason or another. It certainly wasn't alienation that turned me to tune off: I had been itching to watch it properly for a long time.\n\nRevisiting was a very, very good idea. If you haven't seen this Alejandro G Iñárritu (Babel and the upcoming The Revenant) beauty, stop reading this garbage and get cracking.\n\nIf for whatever reason you're still here, I'll continue. The plot is simple to grasp: Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton (who of course played Batman) is a washed up action star who used to play the titular Birdman in a series of superhero movies. There's more to him than it seems though: he displays ambiguous signs that his superhero role may not have been an act.\n\nIn a bid to reclaim his stardom and financial security, he is running a play on Broadway in unison with Jakes, his lawyer and chum played by Zach Galifianakis of the Hangover fame. Galifianakis is on form, playing a more intellectual role than that he is typecast in, akin to his role in the excellent but short-lived TV series Bored To Death.\n\nThrow in an array of extra talent, most notably Emma Stone as Thomson's troubled daughter and Ed Norton as an acclaimed Broadway actor drafted in at short notice to star opposite his girlfriend, played by Naomi Watts.\n\nEach share screentime relatively evenly behind Keaton, stealing scenes in their own right. As the show's opening night approaches, with preview after preview performance, the pace of the movie continuing to increase accordingly. Characters and their storylines intertwine into a complex but very coherent mess.\n\nThere are constant shouts to theatre throughout, almost as though this is a play recorded for the silver screen. Researching online, it seems rehearsals were rigorous to get the flow of the film down to an art. The hard work pays off. The start is jarring: you're thrown in at the deep end, but you're soon up-to-speed and glad of your front row seat.\n\nThe cinematography is subtle yet stunning (it did win an Academy Award for cinematography as a nod). It's appropriately dark and moody backstage, and bright when the cast take to the stage.\n\nEach shot is stitched together seamlessly. Every transition is sleeker than the last, often following a character out of one room and into another down the winding corridors of the theatre. It's deliberately fast-paced, claustrophobic, and a thing of beauty.\n\nSolo jazz drumming is the only real music here, interspersed between each 'scene', the term used loosely. It's noticeable louder and panicked in times of stress, and soothing in rare moments of clarity. When the movie approaches its conclusion, the music reaches a peak.\n\nThe conclusion, whilst perhaps erring towards anti-climactic, is still a triumph. For a film that builds up to opening night, it doesn't disappoint. You aren't left wanting more. Every loose end is tied up nicely.\n\nIt's more than satisfying end to a treat of a film. But this is more of a film. This is a love letter to thespian farce, a worthy Oscar winner and a time investment I'd gladly make again. The only tragedy here is that I won't get to enjoy this for the first time once again.",

Being that it was a critique of Hollywood and blockbuster films that never get recognized at the Oscars, it makes sense why the Oscars chose this for film of the year. It sums up what many on the \"more artistic\" and thought-provoking side (not Pop side) of the film industry find wrong with said industry. And it is probably the only \"Super-Hero\" movie that will ever win best film. Quite fitting! Even though I like some of the big Blockbuster film franchises, I can tend to agree with much of the critiques of it and I greatly enjoy quality, deep, and artful films as well. Unfortunately they tend to get overshadowed by the big budget franchises of the world. But they get their shine at the Oscars. However I wouldn't mind seeing a big budget film franchise rise up and win the big award (other than Lord of the Rings of course). I'm looking at you Star Wars! Anyway, Birdman = pretty good film!",

Right from the start we are asked to go to work, for we see Riggan levitating in meditation. Is he really levitating? Is he an alien? A magician? Is he just imagining he's doing this? And there's also someone else in the room, for we hear a voice, but no one else seems to be there, at least physically. Eventually we see that it's Birdman, a successful character Riggan has played in the past (and that's what drives the film, the need for success and acceptance of audience and critic to validate one's existence as an actor, that success being made evident in Birdman, the voice driving Riggan on). \n\nThe film is full of flair and the engaging. One technique used is the almost dreamlike, surreal coming in and out of characters. At times the characters even  ignore what's occurring immediately to emphasize the surreal. There are also great moments of dark comedy in statements made that, unlike forced comedy in comedy-specific genres, are so sincere that the viewer can't help but guffaw. And if you like drums, you're in for a treat, for the scat beat of Birdman (allusion to Charlie Parker, not a drummer but jazz artist) plays throughout a good portion of the film. This is Riggan trying to get back up on his feet, to get his career restarted, but most of the film that's not happening, represented by the sputtering drum fills. \n\nIt's quirky. It's whimsical. It's poignant, funny, and just damn mesmerizing. The acting, the oft thick dialogue, the angst, the manic passages, all work in combination to make this a most joyous experience. Oh, so is Birdman an alien? Can he really levitate and use telekinetic powers? Is he going insane? Is he hearing voices? Is it all just made up in his mind? The film gets you thinking in that direction until the final moment of the final scene as Sam spy's her father out the window apparently fluttering about high above the streets below. Or is he? Ya just got to love a film that can keep you so off balance and so engaged. Birdman, a true flight of wonder.",

The film is a deep character study of Riggan Thomson played by a moving and stellar Michael Keaton a once-time big movie star struggling to regain importance in his contemporary setting while trying to establish himself as an artist worthy of praise and to get rid of his \"Birdman\" image. Not to be underrated are a game Edward Norton playing Mike Shiner a popular Broadway star and Emma Stone as Sam who delivers such a moving monologue on what it means to be relevant and to leave a lasting legacy.

            "content": "At a time when the studios appear reluctant to produce anything that doesn't have certified provenance, along comes Birdman, an entertaining, ambitious and mostly effective backstage satire that delights in mocking Hollywood's franchise obsession.\n\nDirected by Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel, 21 Grams, Amores Perros) Birdman is the story of Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) a has-been Hollywood actor - once famous for playing superhero Birdman - who seeks to restore his artistic credibility by directing and starring in an ambitious Broadway show - his own adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". When one of his actors is hit by a falling stage light and is replaced by the egocentric loose cannon Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) Thomson now has to battle not only his inner demons (his Birdman alter ego) but also a shameless scene-stealer.\n\nTo add further weight on Thomson's shoulders, his manager/producer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is stressing about the very likely possibility they'll both come out of this venture broke. His daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), has just come out of rehab and is angry at everything. His co-star/girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), thinks she may be pregnant. And his other co-star, Lesley (Naomi Watts), is in an insecure lather about her first Broadway performance. On top of all that, the New York Times theatre critic, Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) has taken great offence at Hollywood setting foot on hallowed Broadway turf and has vowed to kill his show with the worst review she has ever written.\n\nIñárritu has shrewdly pieced together Thomson's existential crisis as if it is one long take - though the actual time frame of the story takes place over a number of days. Accompanied by a kinetic all-percussion score by Antonio Sanchez, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki takes us on a ride - up corridors, through windows, across stages, along New York streets - that is mostly exhilarating. The first forty-five minutes or so are a delightful mélange of energy, humour, music, movement and sharp performance. I was grinning, realising I hadn't been so entertained at the movies in a very long time.\n\nBut while the film as a whole never quite loses its steam, its narrative drive does soften and Iñárritu tends to rely a little too heavily on his showmanship. The barbs regarding the superficiality of Hollywood grow repetitive, as do the denunciations of Thomson as a worthless hack. Subplots are underexplored. The characters of Jake, Lesley and Laura are underutilized while theatre critic, Dickinson, is afforded too much weight and her anti-Hollywood rant is anachronistic at best.\n\nThe 'look-at-me' flashiness is sure to be dismissed as pretension and the relative thinness of the plot may leave some unsated. But through the smoke of this collision of ideas, technique and tones is the brilliance of Keaton. Sure, he was made for this role, but what he brings to Thomson is so much more than what is in the script. Angst oozes out of every pore. There isn't a whiff of inauthenticity about his anxieties though his rapprochement is too easily realised and the film's resolution is unnecessarily abstruse - and perhaps a little too affected.\n\nKeaton's supporting ensemble is fantastic. It's refreshing to see Galifianakis successfully navigate a straight role. Emma Stone proves once again she is the most interesting actress of her generation right now. Watts reminds us that she truly is an actress of substance. Riseborough is both funny and empathetic and sure to be on our screens a lot more in the future. And Norton is hilarious, skilfully treading that fine line between parody and overacting.\n\nA cynical eye could easily unpack this film and expose its flaws. But to do so would be missing the point. Birdman is intended as a delicious ride. Its adrenal affects will naturally subside once you leave the cinema. But Iñárritu demonstrates that superheroes are not the only protagonists who can entertain and attract an audience. Indeed, this extremely damaged and fragile hero not only does that, he does what those other caricatures are unlikely to ever do - touch people and win awards.",

Half way through I almost turned it off, but I stuck with it hoping it had something, anything, to offer. But alas, there was nothing there.\nBirdman offers us two things. The first is a pouty, childish lashing out at comic/franchise action movies which really reeks of nothing but jealousy, from both the movies main character and the director. At one point during the movie I even wondered if Keaton was the director and writer, pining over his forgotten Batman performance and maybe Birdman was autobiographical. While comic action movies might not be to everyones tastes, they do at least provide entertainment. The sad, dreary, lifeless intellectualism the movie seems to crave, without offering, is probably best sort after in books, and even plays, as those mediums have little to offer visually. But whether it's special effects or amazing cimematography, movies must be visually entertaining. Birdman even fails this, wasting movie money on a story best suited to a short opinion piece in a newspaper or blog. In fact, \"I don't like comic franchise movies\" is everything the movie has to say, without the 2 hours and the budget.\nThe other thing Birdman attempts to give us is an examination of psychological breakdown, which it could have done quite well if it wasn't trying so hard to be preachy about entertainment being entertaining instead of dreary. But what effort and integrity the movie had to offer on this issue, was thrown away with the sappy, magical ending where the psychosis comes to life, which seems to be the kind of thing the movie just spent nearly two hours complaining about. If you want a movie about psychosis, Fight Club does a much better job. In fact it's sad to see Edward Norton in Birdman after watching his brilliance in Fight Club.\nOne of the worst movies I have ever seen, one of the worst stories I have ever heard, and if I had paid to watch this instead of seeing it on tv I would do like Stan and Kenny and track down the people who made it and demand a refund.",

The performances shine in Birdman.  Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone all give great performances in this movie.  I honestly did not know that Michael Keaton had a strong acting performance in him like this, so that was very refreshing to see since I have always been a fan of his.  I personally thought 2014 was a weak year for movies and especially Oscar contending movies.  Was this the best movie of the year ? Probably.  Did it deserve the Oscar for Best Picture? In a weak field that it was, yes it did.",

Pretty much 90 percent of the soundtrack in \"Birdman\" is played with only the drums; some may say that this is stupid. I thought the soundtrack in \"Birdman\" was incredible, with only one instrument it makes scenes exciting. I highly recommend you watch \"Birdman\" as it is an amazing film of 2014.

Porém, o que essas pessoas esquecem é que, quando a câmera está ligada, tudo é uma maravilha. Basta sair de cena para o inferno vir à tona. Birdman ou (A Inesperada Virtude da Ignorância) - sim, o título é esse mesmo - conta a história de Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), um ator que já fez muito sucesso no passado, mas que hoje busca se reconstruir profissionalmente com uma peça que pode custar toda a sua carreira. Nisso, vemos toda a tensão psicológica que assombra a mente do ator, que só piora com o decorrer do filme. Iñárritu, o diretor, utiliza-se de sua metaficção para criticar o cinema moderno e seu público, que parece dar mais valor à filmes de ação exagerada e sem nexo algum, esquecendo dos valores tradicionais da sétima arte. São várias as referências que ele utiliza aos atores de grande sucesso hoje em dia, coincidentemente os mesmos atores que dão vida à personagens retirados de histórias em quadrinhos genéricas. Talvez essa tenha sido a jogada fatal de Birdman, porque no mais, é um filme como outro qualquer, chato, pra falar a verdade. Nem mesmo as excelentes atuações de Keaton e Emma Stone serviram de muita coisa. Eu não gosto de desistir de um filme depois que eu começo a vê-lo, mas confesso que fiz força para aguentar esse até o final. Sim, se você assistir com atenção, verá que o filme tem sacadas geniais e que eu estou exagerando, mas não posso elogiar tanto um filme que quase me fez dormir. Quem sabe a minha mente ainda não esteja presa em uma fila de cinema às sextas-feiras.",

I really liked the photography and direction of the movie. Some of the shots were really really nice but overall I was left with a feeling of dizziness from all the weird angles. The storyline was OK but nothing special I would say. The acting from Keaton was exemplary as was the one from Norton and Galifianakis, but they alone could not save a movie that was (a) script less and (b) all over the place during most of the film. \n\nI did not appreciate the constant noise from drums and other instruments and I definitely did not like all this constant confusion. I liked the effect with the special powers and they way in which the director handled the taxi scene where you understand that he's just a man after all. I did not care for the mixed up ending as well. From my point of view, I think that what happened after the gun shot, was in his mind for this brief moment before he passed away. He did not shoot his nose from point blank and he did not miraculously lived from that! He can't have. \n\nThis is a nice finding as well but we could do with a more concrete proof that indeed that's the ending. Having his daughter looking low and then high in the air and seeing him fly or not. No, that's just something I don't care about. I like my movies to end in the end and not go online and search about it, thank you very much. \n\nI did not like all the emphasis on the movie critic. She actually pushed him to suicide, doing nothing more in the movie, sitting there and drinking in the same bar, actually having 4-5 lines. What's that about? Is it to blame it on the theater critics in general? Is this a statement? I think not. As for Keaton, he is also a really fragile and strong character at the same time, with no will to live, hanging, barely on his own breath, trying to survive minute by minute. He has depicted really well his character, indeed, but it's the character himself that I did not like. What's he about? He's miserable and pathetic and then a theater critic pushes him over the edge and he just kills himself... Really? In general, all the characters were depicted on a superficial level (someone would expect the opposite them being actors and all) not allowing the viewer to relate or merely to understand their actions and pick sides. \n\nHaving watched all the other Oscar nominated actors and movies, Birdman was a true disappointment of a movie. The only thing that saves the day is the performance of Keaton, even playing a character not worthy of much.",

A pet project which is costing him in ways which cannot be counted in currency and met with resistance by on-and-off stage arguments with a difficult co-star, a spiteful theatre critic, his own family members and even his own alter ego, a constant reminder that he had it all as the big Hollywood star of a comic book franchise. Confused yet? The story, which draws comparisons with Shakespeare's Macbeth, is as labyrinthine as the set on which it takes place, but what does make Birdman a marvel to behold is the cinematography, lighting, editing and visual effects which make the movie feel as though it were all filmed in one take, with barely any visible cuts and camera movements which flow around the set without skipping a beat (even passing two actors stood in front of a mirror without casting a reflection).\nEverything about the film is cinematic genius, but simply won't be appreciated by everyone.

And Edward Norton is the king of pompous and pretentious. It's like the screenwriters are trying to impress us with how cool they are. There's a scene where they forcefully and angrily argue, like it really matters, whether you should say \"I didn't know the guy\" in 3 lines or 1 line.

And then the main character flies off the handle in front of the audience and they stop the play. Like it really matters. I suppose if you're an actor then stuff like this would be interesting and pertinent, but for the rest of us it's just gimmicky and self-absorbed and pompous and stupid.

            "content": "-Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), commonly known as Birdman, is a 2014 American black comedy-drama metafilm directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. It was written by Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo. The film stars Michael Keaton with a supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor famous for his role as superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver.\nThe film covers a two week period of previews leading to a Broadway opening. The story is filmed as if in a single long take. The script took two years to write, post-production was planned in detail, rehearsals required several weeks. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Regency Enterprises and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\nBirdman had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14, grossing more than $103 million worldwide. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with the Best Director for Iñárritu, the Best Original Screenplay, and the Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with The Grand Budapest Hotel for being the most nominated film of the Academy's 87th annual awards ceremony. It also won the Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.\n\n-Birdman was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on 21 Grams and Babel.\n\n--Critical response:\n-Birdman received critical acclaim, particularly for Keaton, Norton and Stone's performances; Iñárritu's direction; the screenplay; and Lubezki's cinematography. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 92% based on 260 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, Birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".",

When I look back over the director's previous movies, maybe he's just not the director for me.  The first film I saw of his was Amores Perros which I thought was brilliant.  However, since then, 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful have all been somewhat underwhelming, as was Birdman :o(",

            "content": "Being an actor must be one of the most psychologically tasking professions that man has yet created. You're asked to move from skin to skin, from soul to soul, from psychology to psychology, from paying gig to paying gig, and also to traverse the minefield of box office success. If you're successful, you're asked to do this with breakneck rapidity. It's no wonder some actors succumb to mental breakdowns and unhealthy choices.\n\nMichael Keaton understands this better than anyone else. From Night Shift in 1982 to The Dream Team in 1989, he established himself as one of the most likable comedians in the business. Then he was improbably cast in the coveted role of Batman, leading many to regard the news with \"Really? Mr. Mom?\" But the movie would become one the highest grossing and most beloved action movies of all time, and the peak of the Keaton's career. After a less-than-stellar sequel in 1992, he walked away and the remainder of his career hasn't ever reached that peak again, until now.\n\nThere is virtually no way that Keaton could brush off comparisons between his own career and that of the character that he plays in Birdman, a once great box office star of a hit superhero franchise who walked away from the series at its height but never really found that level of success again. As moviegoers, we love connectivity - we love seeing actors parallel their lives on the screen. We love to ask \"what if?\" What if Keaton had continued his role as The Caped Crusader under the direction of Joel Schumacher? Would he still be as beloved for the role of Batman if he had continued on?\n\nTo ask those questions is to wonder if Keaton himself ever considered this. Alas, we shall never know what might have become of the series and that question is what gives a movie like Birdman - or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, a bit of poignancy.\n\nIn what may be the comeback role of all time, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a once great box office superstar who starred in the blockbuster Birdman series 25 years ago but walked away from the series after three films, effectively giving up the fame and the money that went with it. Now, past 60, Riggan is the prime candidate for the \"Where Are They Now?\" files, a washed up actor who feels that he never really reached his potential. Yet, something is pulling him back - he misses the fame and notoriety that went with the role. It doesn't help that he continually hears the sinister, gravelly voice of Birdman in his head reminding him of this at every moment that his brain is idle.\n\nThe need to redeem himself and restore his career to a degree of respectability is what is causing Riggan to lose his marbles. In a last ditch effort at respectability, he has staked his reputation and all of his money on writing, directing and starring in a flouncy Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\"\n\nThe pace of Birdman is breathtaking as we watch the backstage preparation for a play that everyone believes is shaping up to be a disaster. Every conceivable disaster is laying on Riggan's shoulders. His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is now his personal assistant - and a reminder of his lousy parenting skills. There's the issue that Laura, his leading lady (Andrea Riseborough), may be pregnant with his child. Plus, there's the issue of Mike (Edward Norton), the self-involved leading man who is not only bedding one of the other cast members (Noami Watts), but is known to unexpectedly improvise.\n\nWhat could have been just a boring backstage farce, actually turns out to be one of the most entertaining movies to watch. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, usually known for dead serious dramas like Babel and 21 Grams takes a lighter touch here, creating a comedy that is funny not is jokes but in situation. We watch Riggan adrift in his own public image, whose most prolific moments have nothing to do with his work, like a video that goes viral after he accidentally locks himself out of his dressing room and ends up in the street in nothing but his underwear.\n\nBirdman kicks off as a dizzy backstage farce. Still in previews, Riggan's play is shaping up to be a colossal disaster. He may or may not have gotten his leading lady (Andrea Riseborough) pregnant, his estranged daughter (Emma Stone) has signed on as his personal assistant and is a constant reminder of what a bad father he was, and his newest cast member (an excellent Edward Norton) is a self-serious loose cannon who's sleeping with his insecure costar (Naomi Watts). Iñárritu, the Mexican director of puzzle-piece melodramas such as Babel and 21 Grams, has a lighter, looser tone here, taking aim at the needy egos of theater folk and the craven carpetbagger mentality of Broadway today, where movie stars without stage training are leveraged to sell tickets. Goosing the satire to life is daredevil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men), whose camera bobs and weaves amid the chaos in what looks like one long, breathless Steadicam shot.\n\nAs opening night approaches and the pressure on Riggan mounts, the taunting voice in his head grows louder until it's unclear what's real and what's imaginary. The film breaks with reality too, jackknifing into a trippy detour that audiences will either go with or not. For me, there was never any question. I was so all-in on Keaton's vanity-free, go-for-broke metamorphosis I would have followed him, or the movie, anywhere. Which is pretty much where it asks you to go. Birdman is a scalpel-sharp dissection of Hollywood, Broadway, and fame in the 21st century. But more than that, it's a testament to Keaton's enduring charisma and power as an actor. He soars.",

            "content": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu arrives with his latest film, which partly acts as a satire on the current state that films are in with big, loud box office projects from various directors, while bringing it home to a time of more character driven, smaller films.\n\nThis film focuses on a washed up actor, Riggan Thomson, who is well known for playing the superhero Birdman in several films. He plans on restarting his career by mounting the play What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, written by Raymond Carver. He has not only written it, but is also directing and starring in it. After a light fixture falls during rehearsal onto one of the co-stars, Riggan is forced to bring in method actor Mike Shiner to replace the actor, while Shiner attempts to steal the spotlight from Riggan at times.\n\nThe film is a ground breaking achievement, which perfectly pokes fun at the current state of Hollywood and how films are being approached as big, loud box office films.\n\nThe cast is terrific, in particular Michael Keaton. Keaton brings a real sense of disaster to the role of Riggan, who is at his breaking point, attempting to get the play on Broadway successfully, but also trying to rejuvenate his career. Like his character, Keaton is also well-known for depicting a superhero on screen: Batman, in the two Tim Burton directed films, Batman and Batman Returns. This further allows Keaton to be relatable to the character, while it also seems to help him bring a sense of realism at times to his role. Emma Stone does a great job as Riggan's daughter, a recovering drug addict who takes on the role of assistant on her father's play. Stone is fantastic, working well with Keaton and Edward Norton in several scenes. Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough are also perfect as actresses appearing in the play, as is Amy Ryan as Riggan's former wife. Lindsay Duncan puts forth a cold performance as an antagonistic theatre critic, while Zach Galifianakis puts forth a break out performance as Riggan's lawyer, in his first dramatic performance. The other real standout in the film, next to Keaton, is Edward Norton, who plays the volatile method actor Mike Shiner. Norton is outstanding, going to the limit, at times stealing scenes and even in a few putting forth a comedic tone, such as in a notable scene where he and Naomi Watts emerge from a bed, Norton with a large erection, which is not only unexpected, but also comical. The character is partly similar to Norton, who like Norton, is difficult to work with, even going to extremes to get his performance right. Like with Keaton, this helps Norton brings a sense of realism and grit to his performance.\n\nAs usual Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is flawless, very beautiful. Here, the entire film is presented as one long take, which required up to fifteen to twenty minutes of a scene to be filmed in one take. While the film wasn't shot as one long take, the shooting structure, constant rehearsing and editing techniques help it appear like a single long take, which is not only flawless, but also supports the film. Throughout the entire film, it never feels like a gimmick, it really does support it, while it is also something to be admired.\n\nThe drum score, by Antonio Sanchez, is also remarkable, at times unsettling, but also at times calm, bring a great sense of jazz to the entire film. The score supports many of the characters, their actions and the plot.\n\nThe end result is a film that perfectly honors character driven, small films, while also honoring at times the golden days of filmmaking. It also acts as a wonderful, satirical thesis on the matter that most of these big, dull, senseless, loud box office films have taken over audiences (for example those by Michael Bay) and have started to overshadow the more well thought out, character driven films that don't always need to rely on senseless, loud action with no clear plot in mind.\n\nWhen the film ends, you feel like you have seen not only a great film, but a film by a true genius.",

            "content": "Of note in this dark dramatized tale of a fictitious actor's aging career are the dynamic scenes between Norton and Keaton. Whenever they grace the stage (and the screen) we find evidence of two Hollywood veterans upping their game. Particularly in the case of Keaton, this is a return to form that sets up his best film in a while. \n\nThere is more than a bit of tongue in cheek that is hard not to assume in much of the films portrayal of Keaton. As the character of Riggan, he plays an actor who is best known for playing a famed superhero (Birdman), but as he ages he finds himself struggling to move past this persona and to give himself to project that could define his legacy as a bonafide actor. In this we are brought face to face with some of the demons from his past, including failures as a father, a fading career, obsessive compulsions, and a struggling rehabilitation. It is this struggle for identity, an exercise of self exploration and the importance of our accomplishments in such a wide and vast world as ours (as an actor, a father, a human being) that forms the heart of the film. \n\nThe film takes makes some creative choices that play with our perception, including the illusion of being filmed in one continuous shot, and some understated effects that allow us to play along with the voices in his head (including an opening sequence where Keaton is levitating in mid air and moving objects at will). It is meant to have the viewer operating on a number of different levels as we connect with the reality of the character's circumstance, moving from the broken mind of Keaton to the supporting characters around him, and then ultimately as the audience. It's a neat trick in terms of the directing choices, and although it does get a bit odd in places, the creativity adds to the allure of the story. \n\nThe story itself is fused with a bit of shakespearean undertones, fluxuating between a tragedy and a comedy that fuses with some modern realism and fantastical elements. In this sense it is hard to pin down. It is unique in many ways, although also familiar. Given that much of the film takes place on the stage (the avenue of choice for Keaton's character to revitalize his career), the film also retains something of that stage presence on screen. It moves us from moments that remind us we are watching a film, to sequences that feel like a dramatized stage production. Again, this provides a unique viewing experience, even as we are forced to bring our head around to the style itself. The relationships move and flow at different paces as they intersect with Riggan's world, one in which his failures as a father meet up with his failures as a husband and lover, actor and stage manager. They all reveal the sheer amount of weight that he carries on his shoulders, while also bringing importance to the supporting characters themselves. \n\nOf note as well is the perfect casting for Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter, and a very restrained performance by Zach G.. All around the supporting cast is very good.",

Unfortunately, the script often fails. The plot and dialog struck me as absurd - as if the actors are always on stage. But perhaps that is the point? Is this a slap at the ego of the typical actor?  I don't know, but I do know I found myself thinking it was a bit much at times. In particular the character and acting of Edward Norton.

I cheered, without having seen the movie, because it felt like the right pick, what with the renewal of Michael Keaton, a Spanish director Innaritu, it felt like the right socially conscious pick. Plus the commercials made the film seem really bad@ss, so I couldn't see how it could possibly be bad. FFWD a year or more and I have finally watched this movie. It started off well enough with some interesting camera movements and a disturbed Michael Keaton floating in the air. How could it fail? The problem for me was the ending. I kept waiting for that payoff, about what Birdman symbolically was and how this story was important for me to watch.\n\n It's hard to underestimate the importance of a good ending, it ties everything together and makes the perfect symbol for the audience to understand. What is the moral of the story? And with Birdman, that moral was seemingly nil. I have long grown unaccepting of Hollywood's pale use of suicide as a trope for a main character to feel any kind of sorrow. I don't know what has happened with Hollywood that characters now have to give up in order for us empathize with them. There is no spirit of the undying, just 'moop, I give up'. Very short, curt and to the point, I guess.\n\nBut why? Suicide should only be used as the ultimate expression of frustration. But with movies like The Artist and Birdman, we make extreme light of this act in a cartoony, funny sort of way--and it doesn't need that, it doesn't allow that. No one laughed the day comedy died, the day Robin Williams left us. Suicide is something completely ununderstandable, and it will stay that way. A movie trying to explain it in such pale terms should be looked down upon. \n\nI'm afraid Hollywood is guilty of not caring enough. They selected this movie probably because they felt it looked nice, even if its narrative makes little sense, and a lot of the acting performances are utterly wasted. Birdman was a callous oscars win, it showed that rich people have about as much care in them as porcelain dolls.",

            "content": "2015's best picture didn't generate much in box office returns, but it did create a lot of buzz among indie film fans. At the center of Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' is a conflicted man - a former leading actor named Riggan who has fallen from grace and turns to directing and starring in an obscure show on Broadway in an attempt to make himself relevant again. Michael Keaton delivers a standout performance, as he's beyond believable in a semi-psychotic role and really digs down deep to bring the crazy and translate it in a way to make the audience feel a sliver of sympathy for the character formerly known as Birdman.\n\nOne of 'Birdman's strengths is the craftsmanship that went into the camerawork. There are a number of scenes in the film that are shot in one take, with a single camera. This is an impressive technique no matter what, but it adds to the zaniness that transpires onscreen. There's also plenty of creative editing that is used throughout, and the special effects that correspond with Riggan's hallucinations.\n\nWhile the concept and execution are really cool on the surface, 'Birdman' is not without its flaws. For one, some of the character backstories are sacrificed for cheap dialogue. True, there are some interesting relationships explored, like the one between the daughter of the Birdman (Emma Stone) and a slightly more famous actor who is brought in last-minute to help the play survive previews (Edward Norton), but these seem to muddy the water even further and do not help much. Still, there are characters who are included only for the sake of making Riggan out to be batty, including a smug, prickly 'New York Times' reviewer named Tabitha who helps bring out the true frustration within Riggan. Zach Galifianakis surprisingly plays one of the most sane characters in the entire film.\n\n'Birdman' definitely has its fair share of fans, but it's a little too narrowly focused to have major appeal, even with its Academy Award victory.",

The acting is good, although it is not a stretch or challenge for the actors featured as they all portray someone similar to themselves.  The very cool part is that the whole film was shot with very minimal cuts. meaning some scenes last 20 minutes without cutting away or switching cameras.  That keeps it flowing but also is so different that at times makes it a negative.  The plot seemed very straight forward but at times it got really weird with super-powers and flying and it just seemed out of place in the otherwise normal film.

For starters, Michael Keaton and Emma Stone are fantastic, with Keaton being the absolute best that he's been in years. I've read a lot of praise for Edward Norton, but I didn't really see all too much that stood out from his usual performances. On the technical side of things, the long takes are quite impressive. Getting these scenes to play out properly couldn't have been an easy task, but they play out smoothly. Story wise, there really isn't much here besides Keaton's redemption, and even that gets rushed towards the end. The film just seems to plod along and bounce from side plot to side plot. The pacing is also another issue, despite being a decent two hours, the first half of the film feels like it drags on. By the time the credits roll, I didn't feel like I witnessed anything special outside of two fantastic performances.",

Keaton's personal battle with family, friends and trying to resurrect what his career was also quite interesting. Birdman is filled with excellent scenes and performances as well.

In a bid to make a comeback, he struggles to mount a Broadway play which he has written and directed. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles with his lunatic Method actor co-star, played to flamboyant perfection by Edward Norton, who earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor here, and his obstinate daughter, marvelously played by Emma Stone, who recieved an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and the persistent presence of his \"Birdman\" alter ego, which at moments throughout the film suggest that he may be losing his grip on reality. Masterful direction by Inarritu, with superlative supporting performances by Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Jeremy Shamos, and Andrea Riseborough, but its Michael Keaton's towering turn that totally dominates this howlingly funny motion picture. There is an extraordinary script by Inarritu, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Amando Bo, and stunning cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. Antonio Sanchez' musical score is terrific. A phenomenal cinematic triumphant, and one of the year's finest films.

Michael Keaton leads this cast with an incredible performance, having to show different personalities through his Birdman persona as well as the washed up Riggan, who is very passionate about the performing arts to say the least. I have not seen The Theory of Everything, so I cannot call Redmayne's win for best leading actor a snub, but I can say that Keaton was at his best and I am glad he was considered for the Oscar.\n\nMy favorite performance of the film, however, comes from Edward Norton, and this might be my 2nd favorite performance of the year behind J.K. Simmons in Whiplash. Norton is this superhero of an actor, Mike, who is so devoted to realism that he drinks actual gin to get the feel of an era, or that he \"gets hard\" as he delves into a sexual experience his character is having. It is particularly fun to watch him give suggestions to and act in front of Riggan to show true artistry - Norton's acting within acting is right on the money.\n\nAs for the visuals of this film, A+. Amazing concept to do a film in one long take (what is supposed to feel like one take) especially when this take requires moving the camera all over the place around this theatre setting.\n\nHowever, this film does seem overly repetitive at points, striking home the idea that we're not living as we are meant to live. This comes from lines such as \"stop looking through your phones and actually experience something\" and various \"rants.\" While I am a big fan of monologues, this film seems a little monologue-heavy in order to get its philosophy across. Emma stone rants about how Riggan wants significance in his life though he is not important; Riggan rants to the critic that she doesn't truly understand meaning (or significance); Norton rants that you have to delve into literature - in this case plays - to find their significance; you see the pattern, right?\n\nI like the ambiguity of the ending, but it could have ended stronger in a different spot. This different spot I refer to made my heart race so much during my first viewing of the film. I will not spoil the last shot of the film, but I like that though it does not give a clear explanation of its final shot, Birdman meshes the realistic with the unrealistic, just how Riggan has been in and out of the unreality of the play he is putting on throughout the movie.\n\nI highly recommend this film; a great drama that contains a lot of smart comedy.",

            "content": "Review:\nI really had high hopes for this movie because it done so well at the box office and most of the critics gave it a great write up but now that I have watched it, I feel quite disappointed. I was able to stay away from the spoilers so I didn't know that the film was set around the theatre, which I found quite boring after a while. Anyway, the movie is about a actor who became famous by playing the role as Birdman but once he stops playing the capped superhero, the work dries up and he struggles to hit the spotlight again. He then finances a Broadway play and his career and reputation rides on the play becoming a success. Whilst preparing for the opening night, his relationship with his daughter (Stone), his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), the leading actor (Norton), his pregnant girlfriend (Riseborough) and his annoying alter ego (Birdman), all play a part in making Riggan Thomson (Keaton) lose his mind, especially with a critic on his back who threatens to shut his play down. By the time that he hits the stage, the pressure really takes its toll and he takes drastic measures to finally find some peace. The storyline is original and I couldn't believe how long one shot was. The acting is superb from Keaton and the rest of the cast but I still wasn't that impressed with the concept or the direction that the movie took. I kept on waiting for something amazing to happen but it felt like a dull drama about a depressed man. I liked when his alter ego came into play, with the explosions and the massive dinosaur and I also liked the chemistry between Keaton & Norton but it did get a bit messy after a while because there was way too much going on. That's not too say that it's not a cleverly made film but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nMichael Keaton is another actor who I enjoy watching since Mr. Mom, Gung Ho, Beetlejuice, Clean & Sober, the Dream Team and Nightshift in the 80's. I liked him as Batman but the movies were crap and they really damaged his career. There are a few innuendos in this film which make it look like his alter ego was geared towards Batman but thats not on the record. He has played a part in Robocop, Need For Speed, Minions and the Other Guys but he didn't play a major role. Personally, I think he's a great actor but he has just made a lot of bad choices like Herbie Fully Loaded and Post Grad. I really couldn't see this role played by anyone else and this movie definitely wouldn't be as big as it was without Keaton in the lead. Its just a shame that he lost out at the Oscars to Eddie Redmayne. Anyway, the film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who is currently directing the Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy and hes made Babel, 21 Grams and Biutiful. He does have a unique style of directing, which must have been hard to achieve in this movie because the takes were extremely long. I liked the fact that he let Keaton let loose in this movie because it really pushed him to the max and Norton also showed a different side to his acting skills. Anyway, this is a well made film which made a healthy profit at the box office but I was hoping for a bit more.\n\nBudget: $18million\nWorldwide Gross: $103million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about an has been actor who is performing and financing a play to bring him back into the spotlight. 5/10",

            "content": "Though a technically notable, this film, ironically, has the excitement of a washed up Hollywood actor trying to be a serious on Broadway. In other words, see it once, say, \"Oh that was interesting,\" and never think about it again. \n\nThe script is awful. It's the real life equivalent of a widowed elderly woman's cat's shit. But not like normal cat shit. Its like the cat shit of a cat that is fed bottled water and hand prepared meals by someone who has nothing else better to do but pamper an animal as their sad life wastes away. Get the point? No? That means its pretentious, full of itself, predictable, and utterly sad that it's respected. \n\nWhen I imagine how this film won the Academy Award for best film, I picture a bunch of ol chaps standing around a fire in a mansion in Tuxedos. One man says \"M'yes this film is about us! Let us vote for it!\" Another man then suggests they fart and smell each others asses. This film is so far up its own ass its actually came out of its own mouth and went into another pretentious douche bags ass hole. \n\nI hate films that are artsy for the sake of being artsy. Its like that awkward person you knew in college who tries really hard to be different yet lists \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"American Idol\" as their favorite TV shows. If I haven't beaten the dead horse enough ill just straight up tell you, I hate this script. \n\nMoving on, I didn't particularly feel much towards Michael Keaton's performance. I thought it was relatively bland and predictable. I found myself wanting him to fail and everything to fall apart around him. I actually was rooting for him to kill himself. Literally I was watching the movie and thinking \"JUST JUMP ALREADY!\" \n\nEmma Stone accepted a shit part that she shouldn't have. That predictable Hollywood child who has been to rehab, smokes pot, and wants to sleep with the guy that drives her dad crazy. Woopidy fucking doo.\n\nThe only acting bright spot was Edward Norton. And that's probably only because I really like Edward Norton. Norton plays the difficult actor Mike Shiner very well and his boner scene was the only time I laughed in the film. Literally, the best part of this movie is a boner scene. \n\nThe cinematography was notable and the film was shot to look like a continuous shot. Something people are saying was \"innovative\" and never done before. Yes it has, Hitchcock's Rope comes to mind. Except that film was good and was real art.  \n\nThen there's the whole predictable critic who doesn't like it because he's a Hollywood actor. She wants to destroy him. She's right. This isn't freaking art. It's someone trying to be artsy. And she also reminds me why I hate critics from major markets. Their heads have disappeared up their own ass so far they think things are good that aren't. That actually describes the critic's positive reviews of this film pretty well. They are wrong. This film sucks.",

            "content": "Ambiguity. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is rife with it. Take its title for instance; it is literally impossible to come to a conclusion regarding its purpose as it either misleads or baffles. Birdman retains the danger of either getting it right by emphasising the richness of its material or simply confusing you with its inability to provide complete clarity. Birdman offers a plot so hard to explain in a few sentences for there is so many avenues the plot attacks with ingenuity building a layered story filled with tonnes of critical entertainment. Birdman tells the tale of Riggan Thomson, a washed up Hollywood actor famous for his role as the superhero Birdman, struggling to mount a Broadway adaptation of writer Raymond Carverâ??s â??What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.â?? Riggan is tormented by the voice of Birdman who criticises his career downturn whilst also imagining himself performing psychological feats, which embodies him as the ultimate unreliable protagonist. Using a piece of literature to instigate his career rejuvenation, Riggan must overcome the voice in his head, the pressures of performing and his own unattainable expectations in order to escape his life crisis indefinitely.\n \nEx-Batman crusader Michael Keaton stars as the protagonist Riggan Thomson and this performance has injected, like his character sorely seeks, a career stimulation as he has popped out of nowhere with some stellar acting. Especially in the second half of the film where the spotlight increasingly focuses on Riggan, Keaton delves completely into the role pinning it down for us all to commend. Edward Nortonâ??s portrayal of Mike Shiner, the popular Broadway actor cast in a supporting role brings out the best in Riggan as they furiously yet intimately interchange words with one another on a number of times. If the second half of the film is Keatonâ??s, Norton absolutely steals the opening as he bursts onto the screen with a pizzazz that attracts you further in. Emma Stone stars as Rigganâ??s daughter Sam and on occasions she really steals the show as she imposes herself with a mixture of a damaged faÃ§ade wrapped up in a commanding aura. Stone is one of the brightest actors of the new generation and at 26, Birdman will change her career, especially that she is now an Oscar nominee now! Naomi Watts stars as Lesley, Mikeâ??s girlfriend and an actress in the production. Zach Galifianakis, with a minor yet impactful performance, portrays Jake, Rigganâ??s lawyer, friend and producer of the show. For those of you that donâ??t know Galifianakis, he is Alan from The Hangover and considering there has not been a film of him portraying someone other than a total idiot, his performance in Birdman is a shock to witness. With Keaton, Norton and Stone nominated for Oscars, Birdman is a talented acting fest.\n \nRiggan believes himself he is Birdman and tries to convince us that he is who he says he is, but such unrealism is not possible and therefore everything you see must be questioned. There are simple ways to prove that he isnâ??t an actual superhero with superpowers but the ending leaves you sitting on the fence hoping his belief in himself is real. The problem is that we never get to know! It is frustrating because there is never complete transparency and at the end when you want a resolution, more ambiguity arrives. Riggan is a tormented soul that you want to believe can defeat his demons and become who he wants to be but you struggle to remain convinced that he can do it. He is an unreliable protagonist as his desires transgress the boundaries of believability and transpire on the screen as his truth so you must never believe what you see until the passage of clarity arrivesâ?¦ but wait, it never actually does, so Birdman is right down to its core an ambiguous character study. These films stay with you long after youâ??ve left the cinema for their lack of closure that leaves you imagining what could have been, but their irritation factor is sky high because closure is the best form of satisfaction nowadaysâ?¦ hopefully there is no Birdman 2!\n \nThe technical marvel that is Birdman is evident as the film is made to look like one big long take. Scenes never cut to show the hours and days changing, instead opposing scenes are morphed together so brilliantly that as a character travels into a new location, time changes along the way. It really is amazing to witness, as it never loses your focus, as it doesnâ??t let you lose connection with the proceedings. 2 hours will fly past and you will have experienced a layered story that functions as one big block in a manâ??s short-term life. The personal shortcomings of Riggan provide a basis for his possibly false mental capacity to dominate the technical side to filmmaking. His abilities range from levitation to telekinesis but it appears in the most peculiar of surroundings, a theatre; a place of entertainment that for actors is the paramount podium of realism. Such a juxtaposition of fiction and realism could be seen as a trying to give audiences the best of both worlds, but instead it opens up another avenue to layer this already layered world with social criticism.\n \nBirdman is a critical study of society and its growing divide between people on the same social wavelength and people who are out of touch with how to satisfy or feel satisfied by society. The story essentially revolves around a manâ??s inability to attract the same success he had in the past because of how much he is out of touch with the present. This highlights the prevalent problem with the youth of today as only the spectacular, brainless form of entertainment can be the only form of pleasure people receive as everything else is out of touch, past it sell by date or just simply has too much talking. Forms of entertainment such as theatre or books with rich history and imaginative entertainment are ignored and overlooked in favour of 6-second instant entertainment in the form of Vineâ??s and social media that provide no form of enrichment, merely short-term pleasure. Birdman highlights the fact that the only way to be great in todayâ??s society is if your connected to social platforms that notice you for your new form of extremity, not talent. A scene that springs to mind in particularly is when the Stone argues with Riggan stating he is out of touch with society because he doesnâ??t â??even have a Facebook page!â?? It appears social media is a necessity and a good old-fashioned piece of literature transported to the stage cannot be loved globally because someoneâ??s head isnâ??t being shot off or helicopterâ??s arenâ??t crashingâ?¦ well, they may be but Birdman isnâ??t relying on them for entertainment, but instead using it is as clout to their critical study of being in touch with society.\n \nLike The Grand Budapest Hotel, Birdman has been nominated 9 times at the Oscars. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a flawless piece of art and should be the Best Picture winner but I wouldnâ??t be inconsolable if Birdman won as it has a quirky originality to itself that Budapest has in abundance. For a film of 119 minutes, Birdman is a feast of a film that provides a banquet of original moviemaking entertainment in a short space of time.\n\nBirdman provides tonnes to be entertained from, critical of and mesmerised at as a result of its resonant script and intense acting.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??     9/10",

Riggan was under such emotional strain in both his personal and professional lives that the issue appeared to manifest in to severe mental illness:  the voice of Birdman taunting him and mocking him; the hallucinations of his ability to levitate and move objects; hallucinations of Birdman appearing before him.  This is what probably led Riggan to shoot his nose off while on stage in the final act.  (Was it a failed suicide attempt?  An attempt to act out the drama of his failed marriage after having a relevant discussion with his ex-wife minutes before?)  Riggan then commits suicide by jumping out of the window of a hospital when Birdman's presence persisted to plague him as did the unhappiness in his life, in spite of the success of the Broadway play.   It seems so paradoxical that a huge success on Broadway, which was hard fought and which Riggan shared with the other actors, resulted in such a morbid ending.  Did Riggan not prove himself to be a great actor and not merely a celebrity arising from the remnants of Birdman?   \n\nDoes irony make good movies?  The tone and ending of Birdman reminds me of Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream. The parts that illustrate psychological breakdown are similar to Black Swan.",

It took a second viewing for me to really get a good grip of the film as a whole as well as appreciate its dialogue and execution but man, this really makes one hell of an all time favorite classic! And what really hits it home for me is that THEY JUST WENT FOR IT! I mean, in everything! Not just the stunning and unique and original way they shot the film, but in the clever commentary, in the parodies, in the surprisingly real and at times hilarious dialogue, in the artsy psychology of the main character, in the crazy scenes (Michael Keaton vs Edward Norton fight, A LESBIAN KISSING SCENE), in the score (which is just drums), everything! It's the kind of film that you can't appreciate in just one or two watches, because this film really is a lot deeper in many ways, and not in the typical way art films are but in a very refreshing, more real way.\nAnd you see, this kind of film wouldn't have worked at all if everything wasn't done to near perfection (I mean, just imagine seeing the script of this along with all the ideas for how it should be executed annotated along the side - CRAZY!). The acting is unbelievably great, not just from Michael Keaton (who, btw, the film's main character is parodying - in case you are not familiar with the guy - in not only how he hasn't really been in anything since 1992, but he last played BATMAN, which is very comparable to the film's main character and Birdman), but the whole cast, all-round, and I was especially surprised by Emma Stone. I already had a good opinion of her as an actress before the film, but she raised the bar for herself! The scene where she just rants out at her father had my jaw drop to the floor, and this is a very different role for her compared to other films that she's been in, and she does it so well.\nNow some people talk about how they don't get the plot, and really, this isn't that kind of movie! This is a movie where the dialogue dominates, and not a twisty-turny plot. Aside from the rants of the characters that has got the film critics saying this film is social commentary and what-not, there are a lot of moments that were surprisingly hilarious. And that's really what sets this film apart from other artistic films - aside from the actual deep real things it has to say about life and fame and film, it has a great humor to it.\nAnd just like everything I already mentioned, the characters are also not so straightforward and deep. The character Edward Norton plays, while a jerk, if you listen to what he says, he actually says the truth, and it reminds me of so many of my favorite characters, like House, Sherlock Holmes, just to name the most well-known. The character of Michael Keaton, though to different degrees, really represents pretty much everyone with a dream/failed dream/past-his/her-time, and if you think through what he's going through, you can find what he's struggled through in the movie in yourself, and that just makes the film even grander for me, because that makes me reflect on my life and how I chase my dreams.\nI could go on and on and to the reader who has stuck to this point in my review, I wish I could just watch the movie with you next to me so that I could point out all the awesome things this movie has with it, but alas.",

It's not the acting (it has A-list actors), it's the story itself and the filming which is simply atrocious.  With movies like The Imitation Game and American Sniper up for an Oscar and this one wins, shows me that the Academy is made up of overly artsy America haters with very simply minds and low IQ's and I officially will never listen to their opinion again.  Anyone who rated this movie highly is just trying to keep up with the Joneses.  Birdman is nothing but hype.  And as if the movie itself wasn't bad enough, the \"music\" in the movie was some guy incessantly banging on drums the entire duration.  I wanted to gouge out my eardrums.

Avatar, Social Network, Descendants, Django Unchained, Gravity and Boyhood in a perfect world you would have won but sadly we have to deal with The Hurt Locker (ugh), The King's Speech, The Artist, Argo (ugh), 12 Years a Slave and Now Birdman.  if you look at the common pattern of the movies listed, 3 are about perseverance, 3 are about Americans, and more importantly (especially in the more recent years) 3 are about the arts.  And that is why Birdman won.  Don't get wrong, out of the bunch listed, Birdman is probably the best winner in years, I just don't think it's my favorite movie of the year.  What makes Birdman a good movie is how it almost plays out like a play in a play. Like 30 Rock.  Everything from the weird lively soundtrack is awesome.  The \"one shot\" approach is kind of cheesy at times but works well I feel.  The satire on America, the need for \"blockbusters\" and no one wants \"the moody films\" is so spot on it makes you wonder why this movie is so interesting in being that way against the dreck of summer 2014 of Marvel.  Still, Birdman I don't feel follows to it's promise.  It doesn't amount to anything substantial (you could argue Boyhood didn't either, but I feel a much more emotional connection to that film).  The acting is ok, if quirky, nothing really gets resolved and maybe that's the point.  I think the movie is more for the interest if you like the arts versus to watch as a \"good\" movie.",

            "content": "Prepare to be blown away by Birdman, a sometimes scathing satire of Hollywood's ups and downs from an actor's POV. Academy members, especially the actor's branch, are bound to love it, and audiences will as well.\n\n Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, director of Oscar nominated downers like 21 Grams and Best Picture 2006 contender Babel - two films I loved - achieves a masterpiece with his latest creation. Inarritu is in Robert Altman territory here making mock of Hollywood avarice and actor's neuroses. And he gives Michael Keaton the comeback performance he so richly deserves. Keaton is phenomenal as Riggin Thomas, tortured by his professional and personal past and present: a broken marriage, failure as a parent, career suicide and financial calamity. And now as he sinks his life savings into a play, he has to deal with Edward Norton, a pretentious Broadway star who never sold out to play a super-hero and wants to get busy with Riggan's daughter played by Emma Stone. Stone is the best she's ever been, leaving her usual light-hearted effervescence behind to play the cold, betrayed Sam. Norton is on fire, the best he's been in a decade. Truly Birdman is an acting tour de force from the whole cast.\n\n The script by a cadre of Inarritu teammates, some of whom worked on his 2010 Best Foreign Language Film nominee Biutiful - have carved out the best script of its kind since Shakespeare in Love. Gutsy to stick Hollywood's own success in its face and bemoan the loss of art to commerce. We here lines like \"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige\" and \"People, they love blood, they love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullshit.\" And the jabs at the likes of Michael Fassbender, Robert Downey Jr. and all the current caped crusaders are fast and furious.\n\n I have to admit I love the blood and the action AND the depressing, philosophical bullshit too. I saw Interstellar and Birdman in the same weekend - two films at creative odds with each other - and experienced two of the very best films of the year. So there is a reason to love Hollywood and art after all. Birdman will be an across the board Oscar contender this year. Not to be missed.",

He adapts a Raymond Carver novel into a play and directs and stars in it on Broadway.  The movie shows the roller-coaster ride that is his mind, plus the behind-the-scenes goings on of the play.\n\nCertainly not your average movie.  The blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy, as the lead character veers constantly between delusion and actuality, is incredibly intriguing and not a little disconcerting (and this is not necessarily a bad thing).  \n\nThe plot is simultaneously simple and complex - simple main structure but very complex in the intricacies.  Ultimately it is a character-driven movie, and the characters are well-developed and complex.\n\nOn that note, it is not all about Riggan.  There are some sub-plots involving his daughter, Sam (played by Emma Stone) plus other cast members.  These non-Riggan moments provide for respite from the intensity of Riggan and his issues, and are a welcome relief.\n\nWhile it is the script and direction that set up the movie, it is the performances that complete it - casting is spot-on and the cast act of their skins.  \n\nSuperb performance by Michael Keaton in the lead role - he well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination.  Good support from Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan.  Stone and Norton are excellent and got Supporting Actress/Actor Oscar nominations.\n\nEven Zach Galifianakis, better known as a comedy actor, is solid in his role.  \n\nThis movie well deserved its 2015 Best Picture Oscar.",

Inarritu has got to be one of the most insane directors breathing for several reasons--reasons that all spawn from Birdman. The technical decision to shoot the entire film in one continuous shot (though there are hidden, seamless cuts, i.e., about two or three) and the decision in the narrative to tell a satirical message mocking specific people who maybe even saw the movie. To me, there seems to be two fundamental messages in Birdman and tantamount to the movie's comedy-drama genre, Birdman has both a satirical (comedic) message and a serious (dramatic) message. The later I won't talk about, but the former (the bold one) I will. To quote Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), \"Stop living your life through your phone screens people!\" I might be paraphrasing there, but the mocking, satirical message that this line conveys is that the majority of our generation of moviegoers are those who watch movies like a juvenile, dim-witted kid. Those who come to see movies and not be challenged intellectually in the slightest, but to 'ahh' at an explosion and dose off when those stupid characters start talking again. Birdman is supposedly Riggan Thomson's (Michael Keaton) subconscious and is constantly conflicting with him and telling him, \"People don't care about this philosophical bull-crap.\" Again, paraphrasing, but this message Birdman conveys is perfectly contemporary for our generation of Hollywood movies. Because of how contemporary this is, it almost feels like Birdman breaks the 4th wall (which it actually does with Antonio Sanchez's all-drum score). In fact, Birdman almost breaks the 4th wall many times. For instance, there are pop culture references to the Avengers many times. That is why this message works because, as the dialogue mocks, the theme of the movie mocks. Again, Inarritu is very bold in his decisions, but the movie required his boldness if he was going to tell a message as insane as previously discussed.",

Michael Keaton (Riggan) as the protagonist, he is seriously impressive here. He's having this wild imagination with an imaginary friend like he is bothered nor struggled at times, and he wants to prove, he's not just a celebrity, but a stage actor. He wants to prove how he's good at it. Edward Norton as Mike, he is more of an asshole, like he does that for the better. I really dig Emma Stone's performance in here, and she feels for it. And special mention to Zack. I mean, I never though he can do one of these roles. He is a smart-assy type of lawyer and he's good at it. This is a well scripted, and with brilliant performances.

Emma Stone does a decent job as his daughter, and Ed Norton is his usual tempestuous self. There's a bunch of modern bits of nonsense tacked on in the form of Twitter and \"going viral\" and so forth, and it wouldn't be a movie from the 2010s without some random lesbian action going on to satisfy our current day version of the token minority. I did like how there were no cuts at all in the movie; it's all done with one camera that follows everyone around, kind of like Cloverfield but without the shakiness. The story itself is alright, and has something to say about modern culture and the divide between movie and stage acting, but this is weighed down by the bizarre new-age fantasy segments of Michael Keaton flying around and generally going insane. Overall, it's hard to understand why this won Best Picture at the Oscars, but I guess if you're into indie film techniques and barebones social commentary, this is the one for you.",

            "content": "Sometimes the gangster life is unavoidable in business, no matter how hard one tries to avoid it and keep going on a straight and narrow pace. Whether one wants to admit it or not, you have to get your hands dirty every once in a while. A Most Violent Year goes over those tough life and death decisions with aplomb with an engrossing character study of a business man who does all he can to not play dirty when things get tough. \nSet in the winter of 1981, New York City is statistically experiencing the most violent year in the city's history. Crime is rampant and everyone is looking to get their piece of the pie in search of that elusive American dream. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a Latino immigrant who is a self-made man who worked up from a driver at an oil company to be the boss of the operation. He is quickly rising up the ranks in the oil business and is about to become bigger when he makes a deal for riverside property that would grow his business exponentially and give him a stranglehold on the market. Aided by his trustful lawyer Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks), He seeks to do business legally and won't resort to tactics that threaten his workers or himself. Things seem to be going well but troubles arise when competing oil companies stick up his drivers and steal his product and persistent DA Lawrence (David Oyelowo) is breathing down his neck for numerous illegal business practices that threaten to derail his life as well as business. To further add to his conflict is his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain), the daughter of a gangster who Abel bought the business from, who tasks him in taking a more take charge attitude and bite back. With so much added pressure, he rushes to clear the deal and take his business to the next level.\nThis isn't your average or regular gangster drama, which may upset some but I found it to be enthralling and captivating with a couple of great performances. Isaac is one of the standouts and adds another dynamic role to his already impressive resume. Taking hints from a past gangster like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, not only in character but slicked back hair and some gorgeous coats, he is thrown into the world of crime and is unsure how to react. Michael eventually becomes a cold blooded kingpin of the criminal underworld while it's a more virtuous journey for Abel who wants to hold onto his code of honor and duty. Seeing him wade through the waters of good and evil is an entertaining exploit to what man will do to ensure the safety of his business and family. \nYou become invested in what happens to him and what he is willing to do to make sure that he won't get pushed around anymore by those that deem him weak. Isaac has a quiet and serious mentality that is often set in stone but will diminish if the pressure is put on him. He exudes a cool confidence and an imposing front that would feel right at home in a violent gangster epic by Scorsese but in a cut throat business of heating oil, it still feels right at home. The change in background doesn't make the world any less thrilling or entertaining. If Isaac doesn't take at least one serious gangster film, I would be incredibly surprised. He has a great presence and control over his character that you could potentially see him blow up at any moment. There is much intensity in his eyes that you could practically see his blood boiling, leaving you waiting if he will give in to his violent urges. \nTough and rough edged, he doesn't take things lying down, even if it never resorts to violence, and he eventually takes matters into his own hands when he won't put up with his product getting stolen any longer. But he is by no means innocent as he has been doing the same duplicitous business dealings as his competitors have done but not in a way of outright stealing from one another and threating workers lives. Doing so, it makes an interesting dynamic where you root for him somewhat while at the same time see that he was never all the way clean to begin with. Making up his better half is Chastain's amazing performance as the dutiful gangster's daughter but not necessarily the gangster's wife. She is very well connected with her family being key members of the criminal underworld that clearly influenced her character and how she does business. \nAbel wanting to do business his way stops her the moment she mentions her notorious family to offer him some much needed help. Whip smart and in control, she is in charge of the books for the company and proves to be incredibly valuable later on. She practically steals every scene she is in and commandeers the ship or attempts to when things get out of hand. Chastain made it very easy to be enthralled by her as she attempts to woo Abel to the dark side of business and give in to his inner gangster. She has an impressive presence that makes the complete image of her rather appealing. Her beauty matched with her no nonsense ideals makes for an amazing character that no one would dare mess with. She simply talks the talk and walks the walk, daring anybody else to stand toe to toe with her. This makes the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain crackling with tension and emotion where you can't help but stick onto every word. \nThe repoire they show was incredibly engaging, with neither one willing to let up it made for some great drama and interactions. Brooks was good too in a small but important role as his lawyer. He is also more inclined to go into the gangster way of doing things, trying to guide Abel in that direction too. He considers arming the drivers with pistols to counteract the hijackings but Abel argues it could prove to be more trouble than its worth. Being a comedian for much of his career, he makes for great imposing authority figures in crime dramas with his performance as a gangster in Drive being one of his best roles and he fits the role like a glove.\nJ.C. Chandor is one of the more promising directors and writers, sporting a small number of films but are all nevertheless impressive. He has a great knack for character driven films and tense moments wrought with heavy dialogue. Even though All Is Lost is basically devoid of any dialogue but it is still thrilling and captivating. He presents people who aren't perfect and puts their morality under a magnifying glass with much of the characters in the financial drama Margin Call fitting that model. It's not surprising that he got an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for Margin Call. While not full of the gun battles, explosions, car chases and gratuitous violence that is permanent in various gangster films, it instead takes a restrained approach to things. \nAlthough there was an effective and exciting car chase that later led to a foot chase that really got you in. I really liked how he went about putting a normal business like oil and heating and placing it against a mob type setting. The interactions that the characters have with one another makes for an interesting dynamic when you realize that these guys aren't cold blooded killers, just guys who want the edge on their competition. It's a slow burner where the characters are allowed to simmer where it makes it hard to guess where their emotions will take them. The dialogue is rich with intensity where you don't really expect it too. Chastain has such a great way of speaking that's threatening and condescending and she just takes everything head on. The back and forth interactions between everyone was a joy to listen to and made it much more rich and developed. \nThe scene where Abel is coaching his new recruits how to take charge of their customers was wrought with intensity and takes it up a notch when he talks down to an employee who laughs at the all too wrong moment. If it were a true gangster movie, you would have expected the boss to level him with a baseball bat like Al Capone in The Untouchables. That's how effective A Most Violent year is in that it perfectly copies what we expect from gangster films and transports them to another movie and setting where the central character is doing all that he can to not be a gangster. It feels like a 70s throwback crime drama where action wasn't the central piece of entertainment and the dialogue and complex characters dominate the screen. It ended on somewhat of a happy note but in a direction that begets an interesting scenario for all involved. It's a little ambiguous but it becomes a little clearer when you notice the previous moments in the film.\nFilms like A Most Violent Year can be hard to peg sometimes. There isn't much violence or bare knuckle action like many expected, but a film shouldn't always contain everything that it's about in the title. Sometimes I enjoy a slow burning drama that just captivates you with dialogue and story that unwanted action would have weighed it down and mad the film worthless in the end. If one puts in the time and doesn't expect a Scorsese film, you will come out the other end with a gem. A little too talky for some with not much of the payoff one may expect, it still has plenty of thrills with a pair of amazing performances that dominate the screen.

Michael Keaton gives a grand and fitting performance which humanizes this otherwise despicable, overly complex individual. Yet, I personally preferred Norton´s and Stone´s performances, as both give the film a soul and voice by portraying unconvential supporting characters.

It's a film that serves to pulverize or ingratiate with its quirkiness or originality, depending on how one interprets it.  It's a black comedy, a character study, and perhaps a tragedy. Above all, it's memorable.\n\nThe film follows a washed-up former blockbuster star as he endeavors to prove his dramatic talent by putting on a Broadway play. Along the way he must contend not only with the nightmare logistics, but also his alter-ego, who continually questions his decisions and worth.\n\nThe script was sharp and offered a lot of higher brow humor mixed in with some witty dialogue. It was stylized in parts, though not overly so for most of its run. The narrative was kept largely focused, and we are totally transformed in to the film's world. We get a unique view of not only the theater system, but also an insightful commentary on us, the viewing public, and our narcissistic, attention obsessed society.\n\nThe performances have been rightly lauded, with Michael Keaton being nothing short of brilliant. The entire cast is in fact exceptional, with Edward Norton bringing a lot of self-parody and charm to his role. The direction keeps the film running briskly; it's always engaging, and never dry. If there's criticism to be had, one would have to say that the third act gets overly indulgent. His other persona becomes more of a distraction than an actual service to the narrative and the realism is sacrificed. The ending note is also unduly ambiguous and pretentious.\n\n\nOverall, well worth a watch.\n\n4/5 Stars",

Interesting and funny. Because, in general, Oscars are for crowd-pleasers. I'm not suggesting that the Oscar films are bad, I'm suggesting just that, in general, are audience friendly.\n\nBirdman isn't. Yes, it stars Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, but it isn't audience-friendly. And those of you who try to make it like this, please stop, because it's ridiculous.\n\nBut is it Oscar worthy? Couldn't tell. Haven't seen the rest of the nominated films . But could an less audience-friendly film grab an oscar? Should it? Of course! If it deserves it, yes.\n\nNow, many people are living or feeding the delusion that the quality of a film is determined by how many people like it and if you and most of your didn't like a film, that film is bad. Nope, it doesn't work like that, I'm afraid. Cinema is not a big Miss Popularity contest. There are certain criteria to be followed and none of them imply the fact that a certain film \"bored you\", or \"you just didn't like it\", or \"it doesn't make sense/it isn't interesting\". These are not criteria, these are irrelevant things people gossip about while shopping or eating. \n\nAmusingly enough, the film kinda revolves around what I said earlier, as well. \n\nFor being rather engaging, funny, well acted and well crafted, I give this 4 out of 5.",

There are moments of brilliance, to be sure. In some ways its morality was prescient, but at other times it seemed a tad sociopathic. I liked how the voice in Keaton's head was sometimes demeaning and sometimes uplifting, and it seemed very human. But in general, I can't completely get into the style. I'm an emotionally inhibited person. I just can't relate very well to people constantly displaying over the top emotion and always telling people exactly how they feel (and as a guy who writes movie scripts, that's against the rules too) and being really angry and horny and such. Guess that means I'm not ready to be an actor. Keaton gives a solid performance. Unfortunately, he was up against some amazing performances this Oscar season, and I actually rate him at the bottom of the nominees. The supporting cast was stellar. Inarritu, of course, added some really great images. On the whole it was, uh, flighty and slightly disconnected, but that is appropriate. The score is grating and distracting, but fits Keaton's character's mental illness. The structure really does fit the narrative, and the play within a play dynamic I'm sure rated highly with the Academy voters.",

There is a contradictory muddle of themes throughout, and actually that matches perfectly with the astounding camera work. It never stops moving. Add a jazz drum score and you're well away. Maybe it's corny, but for me the only unifying theme in this film is love. Whether it's love for your family, for your work, for the theatre or for cinema... and that's not just a sappy thing... sometimes ones love for one thing can block the understanding of another... or maybe you're just too in love with yourself.

What I liked about the film was the use of the one long continuous shot that was one thing about the film that made me keep on watching it, I thought that the whole idea of the one long continuous shot was very artsy and you don't see that a lot in other films. Michael Keaton is a great actor and I'm going to be honest the role of Riggan was great for him he plays the part extremely well but Edward Nortan stole the show if you ask me his performance as Mike is probably one of the best performances ever (next to Fight Club (1999)). Birdman is an ok film but if you like films that are artsy and don't mind slow films I highly recommend it.",

Torn between his fear that his critics were correct , his own insecurities, and his waning self-belief,  Riggan's only solace is found in a voice which he is convinced \"always tells him the truth.\" Perhaps it is just an ego challenge, men experience, but I could certainly relate to Riggan's uncertainity that his life has had any lasting legacy. \n\nWhile my evaluation of this film would be closer to the critic's 93% as opposed to the audience's 79%.

The nearly seamless streamlining of film and camerawork woven together with visual effects and polish works. \nThe real problem with the film is it's real ambiguity, which is arguably just something to keep the magic of the film alive after you've finished it. It feels forced, like the movie is told from an inconsistent viewpoint in which the viewer is to assume sometimes you're following the thoughts and actions of Michael Keaton, and sometimes just wandering around and seeing what other characters are thinking or feeling.\nIt's a mess, honestly, beautiful to behold but forced into a perspective of unknown perspective. I feel like this movie won some awards not just because they felt it deserved them, but more on the perspective that it seemed almost continuous. \nBottom line, if you don't like artsy movies, this movie will not amaze you, nor will it feel like anything beautiful. The character transcendence seems to take a back seat to the camera trick, and it will leave you confused and uncaring at the end.\n\nNot really a movie for the masses, but people will watch it because it won those awards....",

It also has very neat visuals.For instance, we have this small indie film made on a small budget and it's very impressive how the blockbuster aspect was done.\n\nThe story is original. We have this actor famous for playing a superhero in a movie franchise and is performing in this play. It also has the feel of a superhero film in that the protagonist can move stuff around and has these visions where his environment is like a superhero flick. It also plays out like the real world as it references recent Blockbuster films.\n\nThe acting is great. It has brilliant performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone. During the parts where the characters are performing in a play, the actors and actresses make it very believable.\n\nOverall, this was a very impressive film and I think it deserved that best picture Oscar. There is not a single thing that I did not like about this film.\n\nIf you expect a superhero flick, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you are interested in film and/or just want something different from the usual Hollywood stuff, it would not be a bad idea giving \"Birdman\" a watch. I highly recommend it.",

Michael Keaton was on fire in a role that any audience member would say is a perfect fit! In addition to his performance, the film has a rich and talented supporting cast. The director's use long moving shots created the perfect amount of space that brought out their best and elevated every single roll; and the scene transitions were spectacular!\nKeaton is Riggan Thomson, a former blockbuster Hollywood phenomenon that has fallen out of the limelight, and is left clinging to his career by becoming a serious Broadway actor. However he is not alone. No, no, no, Thomson has a friend, his doppelganger ... the Birdman! And he demonstrates from the get-go how powerful an influence he is on Riggan. I'm not even sugar coating it; Birdman (or should I say Thomson?) actually has super powers.\nNot to downplay the \"super human\" element to this movie, but this film is not great because of a powerful fictitious hero. This movie is great because it is an original and introspective film into the minds of those we put on stage.\nIt was absolutely fascinating. You see, the film is based on Keaton's character (Riggan Thomson) debuting a play on Broadway, and throughout the film you get to see the all rehearsals and previews leading all the way up to the debut!\nWhat was fascinating was, as you watch this film, you will see Keaton (or Norton and etc.) play their roles (in the film) and all in one shot, you see them shift their roles and they acting as separate characters- on the stage!\nThis film draws you in with its main character. It sucks you in with the plot. The dialogue is ingenious and it is all shot as if it came straight from the theatre and it was playing right on stage in front of your faces!\nBirdman is currently nominated for 9 Academy Awards including Best Picture. So if by chance you find yourself not doing anything, watching Birdman would be a good life decision on your part!",

For me, that was a bad thing, obviously, but it is also a strange kind of compliment that a film can have that strong an affect. Another compliment is that is seems beautifully, crisply filmed, carefully cut to make it look like one continuous shot. But that last thing got old really fast for me. The most annoying thing? The drums. The first 20 minutes of continuous drums made me want to bang my head against the wall - reading in one review that those drums go on for the full two hours was enough to turn it off. Something that feels like something learned in drama class, without the student understanding that for many people, it's not artsy but forced, intrusive and simply unbearable. As for the plot - sure, a satire about the goings on in filmland, the struggle to always keep current and happening, maybe?

            "content": "I think my favorite part of this film was Edward Norton's acting playing an actor. He was just so good, he sort of outshines everyone else just because he is confident, egotistical, but also very sympathetic. All of the characters are sympathetic because the acting is that good and the characters are the friends we all have; prideful, hoping to be noticed, to be affirmed and loved for who they are and what they can accomplish. I can't help thinking Keaton took this role because it mirrors his career in eery ways. I'm sure others have pointed this out, I haven't read much on the film, but he was Batman (Birdman) twenty years ago and now he creates a masterful work of art, pouring his soul into every frame (scene) in this movie (play). Keaton is very good, especially his scene with the critic. A side note about that scene, I respect critics but they also piss me off because they're like so many others who critique what they themselves can't make, let alone make better. Anyways, Alejandro's direction is graceful and story driven, even his camerawork advances the drama. This is how movies are made! This is well crafted scripting and conflict. Unfortunately, the ending strikes me as a moral conundrum. I can't give anything away but the arguments go on as to what did exactly happen. If one thing happened, then his journey comes full circle and he really is becoming someone better to himself, to his daughter and to his craft. If the other thing happened, then nothing matters because it's just wrong and tragic for everyone. I'm not really a fan of black comedies but this did have it's funny parts. Again I come back to Norton, he just rocked it, his character was so interesting. I would watch this again just to study the character dynamics, dialogue, and coverage of the conversations and action. Worth the watch and worth the philosophical arguments that stem from it.",

            "content": "Perhaps the most technically and narratively ambitious movie of the year, with its seamless illusory editing, feverishly percussive score, and lyrically brutal showbiz fable. An aging former superhero mounts his comeback by quadruple-threating the short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" by Raymond Carver.  \n\nThere are just so many moments I love in the movie: the flash of jellyfish at the beginning foreshadowing Riggan's botched suicide years earlier; Riggan's restrained breakdown when he leverages his false childhood abuse story against Mike's for yuks; the tighty-whities lock-out sequence primed by the trailer (and parodied so brilliantly by NPH and Miles Teller at the Oscars) but made so much more tragicomic in full by Keaton's unblinking purposeful stride, the camera-ready viral media sensation culture, and the rousing staccato beats of the Times Square drumline.\n\nI also really love the ex-wife character played so naturally by Amy Ryan. Sylvia and Riggan's comfortable exes dynamic and Sylvia's on-the-outside-of-showbiz-looking-in reasoning for why their marriage ended really resonated with me. Michael Keaton is the perfect oxymoron of likable asshole, and Zach Galifianakis is surprisingly unschticky as the producer/best friend. I was surprised that he was passed over for a Best Supporting Actor nod in favor of Edward Norton, who was frankly just okay in the difficult task of playing an actor playing out a scene that is supposed to be good. Emma Stone's bug-eyed, strung-out, angry tirade has gotten most of the attention, but I honestly think she is a Better Supporting Actress in her quieter moments: slinking through the hallways, the come-hither dares on the rooftop, the fragile candle-burning-at-both-ends intensity about which Mike rhapsodizes.\n\nIt's not a perfect movie; the magical realism is somewhat inconsistent, but I think it's deserving of its Oscar wins.",

            "content": "From: http://justathoughtfilmandmedia.tumblr.com\n\nYou've probably seen this movie and thought, \"wow, such art.\" Well it's true, it's a work of art, mostly... The ending, although widely thought to be creative in it's ambiguity, I felt was very much a cop-out of not being able to devise an proper ending worthy enough of the questions of insanity and depression it boldly raises. That's my thesis, but I'll elaborate more on that later.\n\nMichael Keaton should have won best actor. While Redmayne was amazing in the Hawking biopic, it played much to the standard of what the academy expects of a dramatist (the movie was arguably only made for a platform in order for an actor to play Hawking in order to bait an Oscar worthy performance); the nuances of Keaton's performance takes the cake for me mainly because he was playing a popularly perceived version of himself, and thus nobody else could have done it but him. If I were the academy, the Oscar for original screenplay would have been replaced by Keaton's performance, and gone to The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), thus kept it at 4 little golden men for the film.\n\nThe directing and cinematography for the movie is to be adulated. The what-seemed-to-be-an-extremely-long-take subterfuge is what made the movie a must see, and it is dome better than its predecessor Anna Karenina, the most recent version film adaptation of the classic Russian novel, which was ultimately a disaster-but not because of its seamlessness.\n\nThe theme of Hollywood's triteness and ingenuity of recent is brought up and seemed to be answered by the very original piece, the movie itself. And the very much meta play-within-film aspect of the movie, although not original is very hard to do nonetheless, works to it's advantage and executed very well.\n\nThe drama is well made, and is what seems to be a perfect film, masterpiece even. Until you watch it again (the dialogue about the man who failed to commit suicide at the beginning of the film was too explicit and I caught during the first viewing, after seeing what the climax of the play was it pretty much ruined the ending for me). The film seems to me a gimmick. Performances are standard, but not at all better than it should be for a best picture. Who didn't see the Norton-Stone romance a mile away? These may seem nit picky, but I don't think so.\nI, at first, fell for the ending as much as anyone, but in a different manner. I was mad more so than bewildered. I was not \"played,\" and I didn't buy it. The film raised very important questions about insanity and depression and the state of Hollywood and how to fight for its art. Even if it ended with clear-cut suicide, making the statement of \"you can't fight it,\" is better than the equivocal stunt they pulled. On the other hand, if they kept the ending happy, classical-Hollywood style, I would have been disappointed, yes, but at least not disparaged. They really couldn't have devised an ending that is worthy of best-picture? If it didn't win best-picture I wouldn't complain, trust me, but it did! That changes things.\nTo be fair, the competition this year didn't seem to be very good (I mean, Whiplash was nominated, it was great, but not that great; and there is no way they were going to give it to the corny American Sniper. Thank God they didn't do that). So I guess they had to give it to Birdman.\n\nimage\nAll I am saying is that this movie is not as good as you think it is.\n\nIt is not going to be a movie that is worth repeated viewings, especially not on television-unless you're a film student, writer, etc. Will this movie stand the test of time? Certainly not the way The Prestige (Nolan), Fight Club (Fincher), or other timeless non-academy award winners will go down in cinematic history. To even mention legendary classics such as Gladiator (Scott) or Shawshank Redemption (Darabont) in the same discourse is blasphemy on my part. And, to be quite frank, I am going to lump Birdman in the Driving Miss Daisy category: Winner-yes, Classic-no.\n\nUltimately it is not the filmmakers' fault; it is the lack of redoubtable features in the year of 2014 that is to blame. This film is an unmitigated work of art. Of course it is, I am not denying that. What it is not is a large piece of cinematic history.\nCinema is greater than art. A great film needs to manifest magic. This movie lacks magic, and I argue it is because of a cop-out ending. Be bold! Dare to answer. That ambiguous ending shit is played out. Nolan is known for it, but his masterpieces The Prestige and Momento do not even include one-both better movies that Birdman.\n\nI would give it a two if it wasn't for the Cinematography and Editing (or lack there of?)\n\n 3/4 stars...\n\nbut what do I know?\nTime is the ultimate arbiter, and it will expose the film for what it really is in a fleeting moment.\n\nJust a thought",

While I remain engrossed in the wacky antics of protagonist Michael Keaton and company, I still cannot help but marvel at and attempt to decipher how director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and crew manage to pull off a narrative composed of an apparent one-take tracking shot. Not only do the filmmakers use this device to expertly emulate the immediacy of the theatre and the inner tension of the tortured protagonist, they somehow still manage to create some beautiful framing and visuals that transcend a simple documentary-style approach. This is some Hitchcock-ian level detailed planning.\n\nNot to be outdone by the brilliant direction and photography, the cast also shines bright. Keaton, no doubt, pulls off the best (and seemingly most personal) performance of his career, and I cannot be more excited for him and the comeback that this role, not doubt, is facilitating. Edward Norton as pretentious method theatre actor, and Zach Galifianakis as producer/Keaton's agent also do some really strong work here -- almost stealing Keaton's thunder from time to time.\n\nOverall, it's a fun story that certainly has lots of relevance in today's Hollywood and Broadway cultures -- especially in regards to the box office celebrity vs. artist themes. While I really enjoy the fantasy elements featuring Keaton's \"Birdman\" alter ego (these scenes feature some fantastic imagery and acting), I am reticent to heap too much praise on the narrative because of just how on-the-nose these moments are in their hammering of film's message and obvious representation of the protagonist's inner psyche. It's an admittedly minor complaint for me, but I think Birdman honestly just needs a tad more subtlety in here. Just a tad.",

It can turn off some of the audience because of its quick pace and smart ass dialogue but the power and intensity of the film can be felt throughout especially in the actors' brilliant performances and the director's guidance. I can actually feel Inarritu in the film and how it doesn't seem to be a film anymore. It's as if you are following the characters and this lonely sad man trying to get back on his feet with a weird Birdman conscience.

            "content": "Birdman is one of those movies that is kind of hard to review. I liked this movie yet it was just kind of annoying in one specific way that I will get to at the end of this. I could appreciate the fact that this movie was edited to look like one entire shot, but just because you do something different doesn't make your movie good. And it felt like there was no real reason behind making the movie like that. But it did give the cinematographer Emmanual Lubezki a big challenge and he pulled it off perfectly and it was really no surprise to me that he won this year at the oscars either because he also won the oscar for best cinematography for his work on Gravity and the Cinematography in that movie was absolutely perfect, but that movie was just practice for Birdman. Because if you look at the first five minutes of the movie Gravity the camera stays on one shot for that length of time and it didn't make any cuts until it needed. But in Birdman he was able to pull off making a movie look like one shot. And I applaud Emmanuel because it worked and it looked great. He deserved the oscar this year for his work on this movie. \n\tNow onto Birdman itself this movie is very good and very topical on what's been going on for the last THIRTEEN YEARS. I say thirteen because that is technically when this age of superhero movies that we're experiencing right now started. And it started with the first Spiderman movie way back in 2002 (The one with Tobey Maguire.)  And with all the other movies out there such as Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy and many many others this movie could be the future for all the actors in those movies and what's going to happen to them once they try to break the mold. Now what I'm about to say next is something I'm just assuming, but everyone has been saying this is why Michael Keaton was chosen for the part: but I think that Michael Keaton was chosen to be the lead role for this movie because he played Batman at one point in time. Even though this movie was fake for Keaton this very well could be what he's been experiencing in recent years. Birdman is about a former action star who's trying to get some respect by \"Making art\", break the mold of what an action star can do and he wants to stay relevant, but it's becoming hard to do so with all the junk going on in his life. And Keaton plays the part really well.\n\tMichael Keatons plays the character Riggan (Or Birdman) and he's trying to juggle a lot of things going on in his life mainly his career, but now he has a new actor for his play that's totally insane, his daughter who just got out of rehab and a girl he's banging who says that she's pregnant, but to top it all off he has to deal with his own insecurities which are manifesting themselves in the form of his former role Birdman. One thing I wanted to mention about the movie was how it used the music to a great effect in my eyes or rather my ears. Because if you listen to the music it doesn't have any other instruments playing other than just drums and rather than adding anything in they juts have the drums playing and drums without any other instrument to accompany it is just noise and in a way they used the drums to kind of get us to get inside Riggans head and to help us realize that there's ALOT of noise going on inside his head almost as much as the voice inside. And the voice in his head is justt as bad as everything else in his life because everything that annoying pest says he either contradicting to something he said earlier or he's right and is only adding more pressure to Riggan during times when he really doesn't need it. And his former role is sort of the embodiment of the mindset behind most action movies nowadays: Screw the phillosophical BS and lets make a movie that rakes in the money and gets everyone to shut off their minds. Nobody wants to think when they're watching a movie.\n\tThe thing I hated about this movie though is that it has an ambiguous ending. If you're going to end your movie just end it and don't beat around the bush. It's such a lazy thing to do and it infuriates me and for that reason I'm taking a star off. Other than that Birdman is a very well crafted movie and it does such a good job with most of the things it meant to accomplish mainly the cinematography. Well done to everyone who participated in making this movie happen.",

We now know what Robert Downey Jr will do once he's of age along with all of the avengers cast, Keaton continues to set the standard as the ultimate super hero actor as well as flexing his mind and showing any doubters what he's really about.

            "content": "Don't always believe the hype. Other than the phenomenal acting and visual effects, I don't understand why people love it so much. The plot is SUPER confusing. The story follows a man near the opening of his play which he has directed, written, and acts in. During the story it follows the cast on some of their adventures and interactions with each other around the theater. It mainly follows the director, Riggan, as he undergoes unclear mental issues and drug addictions and occasionally work on his play. The story started to get confusing as soon as the movie started when he is meditating in the air and causally just floats down and just talks to someone. Throughout the film he is seen using powers like lifting objects with the flick of his wrist, and flying, but the story makes it very unclear whether he has these powers or he was just imagining it. The story even contradicts itself when in one scene he flies throughout the city and then when he lands an angry cab driver demands his pay and then at the end of the film he jumps out the window and starts flying which is proven by the fact that his daughter looks to the sky and laughs. The comedy was also very stale. The only time I ever laughed in the movie was when mike (Edward Norton) complains about drinking water instead of alcohol. I could barley recognize any comedy anywhere. The plot was also WAY too predictable. When I was watching, I felt like I was ten minutes ahead of the film because I was always anticipating what was coming next. The only thing unexpected was when he shoots himself and miraculously survives, and without a scratch which confuses me because they said there was blood, but there wasn't even a single blemish on his face after he takes off the bandages. Also I had a problem with the audio from the film.Whenever important conversations were going on, there was always some loud music (mostly drums) playing it the back, making it EXTREMELY difficult to understand what the characters are saying. Finally, I think the Birdman character is explained too vaguely. I think explaining Birdman is important because it will give a little insight as to what powers Riggan has at his disposal. I know Birdman is supposed to be a rip off of Batman (Mainly because he's a flying mammal, talks in a Bruce Wayne accent most of the time, and is a very sneaky superhero who says he wants a movie to be named something like\"The Birdman Rises\" or some other Batman movie name) which means he will act like Batman, but he has a very different move set from Batman since he can fly.  Overall great acting and visuals, but the plot was so terrible I cannot recommend people watching this movie if you care about a good story.",

The first half was a fairly generic, slightly pretentious theater drama. The second half (when it really starts to focus on the Riggan Thomson character) is when the movie gets really good. Michael Keaton gives the best performance of his career. It's a great performance and watching the character struggle with his ego and come to terms accepting that maybe he just isn't very good is both funny and sad. I really enjoyed this movie for Michael Keaton (which it really is all about), but when he's not on camera and there's a shift in focus to other characters the movie loses a bit of its luster. Not to say there weren't some memorable or funny moments early on in the movie, it just wasn't as good as what was to come.\n\nOf course a lot of people will enjoy this movie, but it's about getting through that first act.

Ojo, con esto no estoy reparando en las películas clásicas de este género, véase Batman o incluso Superman por citar dos ejemplos por todos conocidos.  \nEl nombre \"Birdman\"  me sugería que la película estaría basada en aquella caricatura  que pasaban por Cartoon Network hace décadas. Resulto ser todo lo contrario, \"Birdman\" es la antítesis de estas super-producciones, creo que la filmaron en una toma, los efectos especiales son esporádicos, incluso la banda sonora es jocosa, ya que la interpreta un baterista que incluso llega a aparecer en una toma. \nBirdman es una  critica muy ácida al mundillo de los blockbusters , llega enhorabuena, ya que últimamente no parecen existir películas decentes, todo lo producido es meramente diseñado para entretener a la mayor cantidad de consumidores posibles, sirviendo quizás únicamente para vender muñequitos de cera coleccionables y cajitas felices en los Mcdonals.  , \nResulta paradójico ver a Keaton  interpretando el papel de Birdman, pareciera ser un reflejo de su vida misma, ya que fue el quien alguna vez interpreto al caballero de la noche. En el transcurso de la película, destaca la lucha de este para no ceder ante  o que damos por sentado hoy en día. Es decir, medir nuestra popularidad por el número de seguidores o likes en el mundo virtual. \nExiste una mofa muy bien intencionada, que incluso se llega a confundir con pretensión, no obstante esto no es atribuible a la película en sí, es mas bien una sensación que se da mientras uno la ve. \nEn fin, me alegró ver una película así, una que me inspire a escribir incluso una breve reseña.

            "content": "In Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a nearly washed-up actor best known for playing a Hollywood super-hero called Birdman (not unlike Batman whom Keaton famously played in the first two films of that franchise in 1989 and 1992 directed by Tim Burton). Riggan is desperate to escape the shadow of the role that made him famous and he puts everything he's got on the line (financially, emotionally, mentally) to direct and star in a dramatic play based on a short story by Raymond Carver that he desperately hopes will salvage his reputation if not resurrect his career. Along the way, Riggan battles with everyone around him (his co-stars, his lover, his daughter) and with Birdman himself, who appears like a specter or perhaps more accurately like one of those little devils floating above cartoon characters' heads whispering evil encouragements, here life-size and with huge menacing wings. All the while, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera literally follows Riggen, mostly through the dark interiors of the St. James Theater where the film is set in extremely long shots edited together as if in one long take, creating a powerful sense of propulsion and urgency.\n\nKeaton gives a committed performance, ironically playing down his usual squinty-eyed disapproval of everyone and everything around him, portraying a man who is put-upon by the world and trying to do just one good and worthy thing. Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis turn in typically strong performances while Emma Stone as Riggan's daughter Sam leaves little room for shades of gray in her exaggerated role as a druggie pessimist. The plot is as contained as the set and some scenes feel forced or even unnecessary. To what purpose other than titillation do we see Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough lock lips? And the casualness with which Riggan finishes a joint he finds on Sam after ripping into her for still using drugs feels like a weak attempt at portraying hypocrisy. Yet just as often there are remarkable scenes, such as when Keaton and Ed Norton as Riggan's co-star in the play run through a scene in rehearsal, Norton's infamous bad-boy stage actor Mike flashing his acting chops to a fiery yet receptive Riggan.\n\nThrough it all runs a magical realism that finds Riggan floating in the air and moving objects with his mind. The effects are outstanding, particularly a scene where Riggan literally flies over New York City. This reflection of Riggan's Birdman, both the character and the inner demon, is potentially undercut by the film's final scene in which Emma Stone's Sam is seen staring out a window breaking into a smile apparently observing Riggan floating in the air. The impossibility of that occurring in real life can perhaps best be explained as being imagined images flashing through Riggan's mind as he lay dying on stage after shooting himself in the head. Or perhaps he died earlier, jumping off the roof in the afore-memtioned scene that feels so real it's shocking until Riggan re-appears soaring over the city street. The director himself has been mum on explaining the film's ending except to say that it replaced an earlier \"bad\" ending. One has to wonder if that earlier ending was the more expected if not predictably satisfying one in which Sam, in a rare display of affection, lays her head on Riggan's chest in the hospital where he lay recuperating from that gunshot wound that turned out to be a minor injury. Though even that defies logic as the way the gunshot is filmed, it seems clear Riggan is holding the gun directly to his head; in the hospital he's told he shot his nose off but when he removes the bandage all we really see is a huge bruise. The ending will surely divide its audience and that's not a bad thing as ultimately Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), infused with questions about the value of art and the power of criticism, certainly gives viewers much to chew on.",

This movie thinks about those issues really deeply.  I related to it very much. So by being able to connect to the essential questiosn in the film, does that make me a huge egoist?

Whether it be stories of perseverance in the face of extreme adversity or subversiveness and/or satire of the business these people find themselves in.  These films are strategically marketed in order to be fresh in the minds of Oscar voters, which is why a lot of them are released in November/December prior to the Oscars.  While I agree that there is some thing as Oscar bait, in the sense that some films are made strictly for that purpose, at the same time, does that mean that the final edit of the film is any less because of it?  If the film is great then isn't that what should matter in the long run?  The Oscars are self-serving as it stands.  I guess this is brought on due to the fact that the film's main character Riggan Thomson is an alcoholic, schizophrenic on the verge of losing his mind due to the mounting stress of putting on a play that, from all accounts, seems like it's gonna be a disaster.  That's the type of shit the Academy loves, right?  Well I found this movie to be excellent, maybe not Best Movie material, though I reserve the right to change my mind as I write out this review.  First things first, Michael Keaton is absolutely incredible here.  I don't mean to suggest that Keaton is a washed up actor or anything of the sort, but the character of Riggan Thomson is in, many ways, much like Keaton's career himself after he stopped playing the Batman character.  So maybe because of that, Keaton felt an attachment to the script and to the role itself.  It doesn't mirror Keaton's career exactly, but it's close enough to the real thing where Keaton pulls it off in a incredibly believable manner.  You can just see this man, obsessed with putting on a perfect play in order to prove to the world that he can, outside of putting on a costume to play a superhero, playing to the lowest common denominator, produce meaningful and worthwhile art.  Of course, on the way to putting on the perfect play he faces his own ego, a method actor, Shiner played by the always great Edward Norton, who seemingly tries to sabotage Riggan's play at every turn, his own struggles with his family and his attempts to make everything right after being such a fuck-up, a theater critic that wants Riggan's play to fail at any cost so she'll write a negative review about it regardless, Birdman's voice continually mocking him and his attempts at being taken seriously as an artist when he could, just as easily, be making billions on a film franchise.  He's also facing the complete disdain from the theater crowd, who just sees him as a talentless hack.  All of these things, particularly with Riggan's mental state, has filled him with such stress and insecurity that you almost exactly know how everything's gonna turn out and it's not a happy ending, which we'll get to later.  This is really a satire of theater snobbery, summer blockbusters, Hollywood pretentiousness (from Riggan's point of view, at least).  Here's this guy who's been known only for his Birdman series taking a very serious undertaking in the form of a Broadway play when he has absolutely no experience on the stage.  The film's tagline, The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, also the title of the theater critic's review in the film, very obviously applies to Riggan's attempts to put on this play.  Riggan's pretentiousness clearly got the better of him.  His attempts to remain relevant in an ever-changing world has done a number on him.  He wants to be famous again, but he wants to be famous on his own terms, he wants to be appreciated for his art, not for a character where you barely got to see his face behind the mask.  It is pretty excellent character development if you ask me and the cast is replete.  The film is very funny, which makes the eventuality of Riggan's path all the more powerful.  Which brings us to the ending, or part of it  There will be ****MASSIVE SPOILERS**** so skip ahead.  Riggan finally loses his mind, or what was left of it, when he gets into an argument with the theater critic the day before his play premieres, there have been several previews prior to this that have been disastrous.  Essentially, the critic will give Riggan's play a bad review regardless of what happens on-stage, because she hates Riggan's kind, the Hollywood type, who think they can come in and take over their chosen field of profession, or what they review in her case.  This is also a satire of the nature of some film criticism where people make up their mind based on preconceived notions rather than giving the film a fair shot.  Riggan then proceeds to get drunk off his ass and falls asleep on an apartment's steps.  He's woken up by Birdman, mocking him yet again, and telling him to get over himself and to stop this pretentious bullshit and give the audience what they want, which is action, blood, death, etc.  Riggan finally agrees with Birdman on something, after trying to get rid of him all throughout the film, and he decides to give the audience something that they will never forget.  All the while explosions and giant bird robots destroy New York City (all in Riggan's mind).  You can guess where this is going to lead.  By this point, Riggan has already plotted ahead how his own journey will end in his mind.  Keep that in mind.  The play culminates with Riggan's character killing himself at his lowest point.  So Riggan, wanting to give the audience something they'll never forget, actually shoots himself on stage at the climax of the play.  You believe that he's dead, only for the next scene to be at the hospital where, it is revealed, that Riggan only shot his nose off and how he got a new one.  His play is a success, they got a great review from that theater critic, he's relevant again and, most importantly, his family is back together again.  Sounds a little odd, does it not?  I think the biggest hint that something is off here is that, when Riggan reveals his new nose, there are no stitches around it.  Assuming this took place a day after Riggan shot his nose off, there would HAVE to be stitches.  You could say that this was just an oversight, a tiny mistake.  But, watching this film, and its attention to detail, and how impeccably edited it was, this isn't accident.  Every shot is calculated and measured.  This is what Alejandro Gonzales Iñárritu and his team of editors wanted you to see.  It's a very obvious clue as to what's going on here.  Everything is just too perfectly resolved.  My theory is, and this seems to be the popular theory, is that what you saw at the end was a construct of Riggan's own self-conscious.  This was the way he would've wanted to see his life end.  He's beloved by his family, beloved by the people, and beloved by the critics.  These are some things that few people ever manage to achieve separately, much less at the same time.  Riggan wanted to die at his 'peak', if you will.  So people would talk about him for ages and ages.  Of course, the theory changes a bit because I believe that Riggan DID shoot himself in the head, rather than shooting his nose clean off, and he's in a coma nearing death.  The final shot of the film, with Sam looking up and seeing her father's powers, was symbolic because this was the moment where Riggan died.  That's my opinion.  It's very possible that the ending actually did happen, but I happen to doubt that very much.  You know, reviewing this film, I've come to the realization that my score of 4 stars is simply too low.  I'll bump that up to 4.5 stars.  I think there's simply too much greatness here for the film to be anything less than 4.5.  The writing is absolutely fabulous, the editing is perfection, makes every scene look like it's one long take.  The acting from the cast is excellent, with Keaton being absolutely incredible here.  And I think this is a film that will reward repeat viewings.  There's a lot of subtext here that I probably missed, repeat viewings will definitely tear that down.  This is an excellent film, one that's more of an acquired taste than you'd think, but one that's worth watching nonetheless.  I realize this means that, to some people who hated the film, this makes me an idiot, but I honestly don't give a shit.  I thought the film was great and I think I've done a decent job as to explaining why.  If you don't like it, then I'm sorry, that's why they are called OPINIONS.  There's no right or wrong.  This is surreal, but it's an excellent movie.",

While far from a total failure- given that this is the film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture- it could have been so much more. On the one hand, I definitely admire aspects to this film from the brilliant performances to the marvelous cinematography. Yet, regardless of these superior qualities, it's a film that leaves the viewer conflicted. To start with the positive first, the acting is absolutely amazing. Each and every star is at the top of their game, particularly Michael Keaton who delivers the finest performance of his career. Edward Norton is also a joy to watch; charismatic, charming and full of life. Even Emma Stone steps out of her comfort zone to deliver what may be the best performance of her career to date. Did I even mention Zach Galifianikis? Apart from the acting, the writing is truly breathtaking. Putting the audience into the head of a conflicted movie-star, it is filled with sharp, funny and often thought-provoking dialogue that raises questions about the movie-making business. Then there' s the intense one-shot cinematography, which is unlike anything I've ever seen before in a movie. However, it's ultimately not enough to make up for a film that's paced poorly. While the first-half of the film is incredibly exciting to watch unfold, it loses steam towards the end. To elaborate, the movie takes ridiculous twists and turns that seem to go nowhere. The ending, though, is a major disappointment. Nonsensical, confusing and leaving important questions unanswered, it left me more irritated than awe-struck. Taking everything into account, \"Birdman\" is a film that definitely needs to be seen more than once to be fully understood. It provides interesting insights into movie-business, critics and the pressures of being an actor in today's media-driven world. However, in the bigger picture, it only offers glimpses of genius. I definitely admire the film for it's risky choices, ambition and originality, but in the end it fell short of my expectations. Whether you like it or not, will ultimately depend on your patience as a viewer. Regardless, if there's one reason why it's worth watching, it's for Michael Keaton's timeless performance that will long be remembered in the years to come.",

Deustúa\n\nEl director mexicano González Iñárritu derrocha talento técnico en su nueva película, \"Birdman o la inesperada virtud de la ignorancia\", con una oscura y densa narración que bien puede ser el peso que le impida volar. Cada espectador lo decidirá.\n\nHace casi 30 años Riggan Thompson era \"Birdman\", gran superhéroe de la taquilla, pero renunció al papel aunque el personaje nunca lo dejó a él. Hoy día gastó todo su dinero en una obra teatral de Broadway que él protagoniza, dirige, produce y escribe con la idea de recuperar su propio orgullo como actor y persona, fuera del dinero y fama \"fáciles\" del cine.\n\nIntensidad es la palabra clave para todo salvo para el libreto. El guión es directo al retratar la crisis de su protagonista y su lucha personal por sobrevivir a sí mismo, aunque al mismo tiempo abusa del realismo mágico para no comprometerse con un final y éste sería el gran defecto/virtud de una película ambigüa.\n\nGonzález Iñárritu produce, escribe y dirige ésta cinta apoyado de un gran equipo técnico al mando de su compatriota Emmanuel Lubezki. Tal como Riggan tiene su alterego y competencia en Birdman, el director lo tiene en su cinematógrafo pues viendo la película es difícil sabe a quien atribuir sus méritos.\n\nTécnicamente ésta película es más compleja que cualquiera de efectos especiales de éste año. La cámara sigue a los actores en una aparente toma continua en un delirio y pesadilla de coordinación. La táctica nos contagia de la intensidad narrativa que, además, es en algunas secuencias musicalizada con una batería de jazz que parece improvisar (coordinar eso es otro mérito, pues en algunas tomas vemos al baterista). Aún así se mantiene una estética visual extraordinaria, un impecable manejo de enfoque y luces, para retratar la miseria detrás de bambalinas.\n\nMichael Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Lindsay Duncan, Andrea Risenborough y Emma Stone se lucen en las interpretaciones, el guión honra a los actores y ellos a sus personajes, aún cuando sus historias queden inconclusas.\n\nLos méritos de \"Birdman\", como su intensidad, serán motivo de que algunos la rechacen: El filme es pesado y duro de digerir, por ello algunos lo alabarán y otros no.

Es una excelente película porque está filmada de manera que no se notan mucho los cortes de edición como si fuera una sola secuencia, salvo dos cortes y transiciones que sí tiene. Pareciera que es un solo tiempo cuando la misma trama nos va revelando que las transiciones están hechas por la misma secuencia de la cámara. Es una excelente cinta, sin duda, para los cineastas, por eso no me extrañó que los frikis y otras personas no muy allegadas al cine la vieran como aburrida o que los fanboys del cine la vieran de tal o cual forma sin fijarse en qué era lo que en realidad simbolizaba la película.\nAl igual como comentaron con la película de la vida de Hawkings, esta tampoco se escapa de un checklist obligatorio para hacerla ganadora. Uno de estos elementos es el retomar propuestas cinematográficas de diferentes directores como David Lynch, Gaspar Noé, Christopher Nolan, Woody Allen (en las partes de la comedia, porque es una especie de humor negro), David Fincher y otros tantos más que se me escapan.\nHay tantos matices en Birdman que es muy difícil que se puedan englobar en un solo artículo de una crítica. Es por eso que mejor me voy a saltar toda la paja y decir que si no se le entendió a Birdman o se le encasilló solo como una crítica al teatro, como una crítica a la crítica del cine y del teatro, como una crítica a Hollywood o como simplemente una propuesta más de cine, entonces no se entendió Birdman. Birdman son muchas historias en una sola. Son muchos elementos que se deben admirar y al mismo tiempo aburren al cinéfilo. No es una película hecha para cualquier público pero eso no quita que no se le de una buena calificación. Cualquiera que sabe de cine, al menos un poco, como este humilde servidor podrá detectar por qué le gustó tanto a la academia al grado de darle los premios que se ganó.

Aesthetically it feels like you're watching a production because everything is go, go, go, go, go 100% of the time and I love that it's almost like a revolving door.  We get to see characters here and there talking with one another in standout selections and then its right back into the chaos.  Michael Keaton's performance is wonderful:  tragic, funny, likeable Keaton pulls out all of the stops for this performance.  The surrounding cast is also fantastic whether it's Emma Stone playing the drug addict daughter with the foul mouth but has the heart of gold, or Edward Norton as the asshole actor who is the \"real\" actor not the \"fake\" actor like people in movies.  The music is also wonderful, I loved the jazz soundtrack, it kept the film moving at a break neck pace the entire time.  With all of that said, I can see why Hollywood chose it as Best Movie of the Year because it fits in line with what they were trying to say at this years Oscars.  Those big budget movies with special effects galore and explosions...aren't movies.  They're not filled with actors they're filled with celebrities.  It's a very pretentious statement to make but they made it loud and clear and Birdman symbolizes that.  Keaton's character only wants to be taken seriously as an actor, he wants to put on this stage production, he's trying to change who he is in the face of the public which ultmately is why people don't like him because it's not as much about the work that he's doing, because no matter how serious he is about doing something...it's always about his image.  He is the star, he is the director, and he wants to be known for something other than Birdman.  The film makes a lot of statements about the industry and its awesome that they got Keaton to play the part because it adds a whole other meta layer to the film that it might not have had, had it gotten someone else to play the part which in itself is kind of ironic seeing as how the film is about people who normally wouldn't get the part because of someone with celebrity status like Keaton getting the part.  Birdman is an awesome film--funny, smart, fast, and ultimately tragic.  I highly recommend it.",

Actors, Broadway, good for nothing kids, you name it. Films that are about many different things usually lose their focus. However Birdman keeps its focus and strives for greatnessÃ¢Â¦ and achieves. \n   Alejandro G. IÃÂ±ÃÂ¡rritu continues to improve as a director and puts all of his talents to work here. The ensemble is incredible Keaton, Norton, Galifinakis, etc. all give great performances. This is also a very good looking film with excellent cinematography from Emanuel Lebezki (hope that's correct). And the score is fantastic as well. \n   Overall Birdman is a bold and original film with greatness all over the board including acting, directing, cinematography, and more. However Birdman is not for everyone, but if you love movies Birdman is for you!\n\n2014 may have been a great year for comic book movies but it will also be remembered as the year the art house struck back!",

There are so many moving parts to this plot that interweave reality and the film it is hard to list them, or indeed perceive them.\n\nTwo characters, Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, and Mike played by Edward Norton, carry the film from beginning to end. You might be tempted to see Keaton as a man trying to regain his former glory by pulling this serious play off; but in fact he is a man who views his prior roles as Birdman as a sell out for easy money. Faced with the choice of recreating his earlier Birdman role, or showing the world that he can create and perform something that is indeed both serious and witty, he chooses the latter. Riggan sums it all up in one line: \"I want to matter\". Mike is both his last minute only hope to pull it all off, and his constant pain-in-the-ass, any second catastrophic failure figure.\n\nIf you like constant action with car chase scenes, real bullets flying, and bare breasts bouncing with intermittent sobbing from broken hearted women, then this is not the movie for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to see a movie with a real plot, edgy directing and sharp dialog, then see it - - and pay attention!

My jaw will remain dropped for the rest of my life at the mere thought of this colossal masterpiece. It is a must see for anyone interested in the film art. Iñárritu is a freak genius, making so many celebrated directors pale before him. The entire film and all involved were miraculous. Michael Keaton was pretty much robbed of an Oscar. I've never seen a more moving and riveting performance. Real tears just drop from his eyes; not those fake drops or fake tearless sobs. I feel honored to have met him 5 years ago at a funeral in Los Angeles. I never realized I was in the presence of such a great actor. What an extraordinary and beautiful film for him to throw himself into. If you haven't yet seen this film, you must see it. Do NOT heed a single negative audience review. They are wrong. This is a perfect film from beginning to end, with the most unique script and style possible. Thank the gods Boyhood did not win the Oscar over this because I would have died of shock.

            "content": "Batman, Interrupted\n\n Bringing so many award nominations that if it doesn't win something will quite literally brake; it is Birdman! So I suppose the reel question is, will this... I don't know what it is really, a drama? A thriller? Comedy? Some kind of psychological warfare?.... Let's just start the review...\n\nPretentious, that's a word that is used far to lightly now a days, you can be pretentious for almost anything, but no matter what you think about Birdman it is pretentious, and I kind a think the film knows it. As if the entire idea is some kind of massive joke that the audience isn't part of but everyone else is. Birdman feels like a joke that starts off strong, like a one liner but never quite gets round to delivering the punchline.\n\n I'll admit it here and now Birdman is not an easy film to watch, or to enjoy. You have to really put the effort in to love it and it's so easy to fall by the wayside. Here are just a few of the really obvious issues you have to get over to enjoy Birdman properly. The shooting style, is it at best bewildering and worst totally unwatchable, as is the musical score which seems to take the format of unorganized drum solo's (As if Rick Allen has gone off on one), the way most of the characters are played can be either phenomenal or grinding, and actually the entire premise of the movie and sureness of the story with both one foot in reality and one foot in fantasy leaves us with many, many elements never explained. Actually that could be the biggest setback of al;, it's own self. But, if can get past all that, something really quite amazing happens.\n\n If you can get past all of Alejandro González Iñárritu ( the writer and director) obstacles you discover one of the greatest pieces of cinema possibly ever made. Birdman is unique in just about every way that matters, every single member of the cast give career defining performances (even the lesser roles make the effort), and each twist and turn the plot takes gives us a deeper understanding of the pure insanity that is locked within Riggen's head. \n\n Birdman isn't really a film at all; Birdman is a moving work of art. That's the truth of it. You can take any one single character or element of the film and justify it as art. I'll prove it by doing just that. The score for the film is irratic but it's timing is perfect, it throws us out of the context of the film like a signpost to the inner rhythm of Riggen's brain. Lets all consider that for a moment. Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a film that is so close to a characters thinking we can literally hear the beat of his brain. We know the film is set inside Riggen's head because he is the only inner monologue voice we hear for the duration of the movie. \n\n The entire film comes together for one single sequence when Riggen gets locked out of the theatre that he is appearing in. That sequence is pure art, from start to finish it is a perfectly observed and presented piece of art, every element and thread of the movie comes together for that sequence and then it all starts to disintegrate again. Pure genius.\n\n To comment on Birdman now is almost unfair of me to do, I feel like it's too soon. Birdman is the sort of film you need to look at 20 or 30 years from now and see how much it has impacted the further films after it. It's THAT kind of movie.\n\n The directing for Birdman is so bold that it can barely be described, technically the film is a masterpiece without doubt. The entire movie is in one shot and instead of getting cuts we just follow different characters as they enter and leave scenes, but the amount of space that is shown is at times incredible. \n\n I feel like I'm stating the obvious if I say anything at all about the cast here, but it feels like this is the role Michael Keaton has been waiting his entire life to play. His voice is like silk blended with gravel. In honesty I could write an entire new review on Keaton's performance alone. \n\n Birdman is as close a study into insanity as I have ever witnessed, it's a film that is about everything at once, and is directed within an inch of it's own life, it's a love it or hate it movie and I don't hate it.",

            "content": "Birdman was released in 2014 to almost universal acclaim, giving Michael Keaton's career a serious boost and director Alejandro González Iñárritu one of his most well-received and widely-seen films. To say that this film is a masterpiece goes beyond how I feel about it. It's one of the most compelling and perfect films that has come out in the last twenty years. Of Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous work, I had only seen Babel, which I didn't care that much for. So when it was announced that he was making a film with Michael Keaton, I didn't give it much thought, despite how much I like Michael Keaton as an actor, Batman films aside. Once I started hearing the rumblings about Birdman and how it was going to change Michael Keaton's life around, I knew it was a film that I was just going to have to see, and now that I have, I wish I had seen it sooner. In my mind, Birdman is perfect. There's just no other way to describe it than that. It's not a gimmick movie, it's not a pretentious or philosophical movie, nor is it a special effects movie. It's none of those things. It doesn't merely tell the story of a washed-up actor trying to make it in the theater because he has nothing else left. It's also about all of the people working in show business and how their lives can become affected over time, in the good and the bad. It's a father/daughter story, a jilted lover story, a lost friend story, a disappointing life story... it's a lot of things. It also never gets overly melodramatic. It has the perfect blend of humor and pathos. But above all else, Michael Keaton is 100% amazing in it. If nothing else, see it for his performance and be reminded of what an amazing actor he is and always has been.",

Both movies are very non-eventful.  Birdman is another mystery film that doesn't give much away in the trailers.  Michael Keaton plays a character who resembles his real identity.  Think of Birdman as Batman, and Keaton as his washed up self putting everything he has into a Broadway play - attempting a comeback into fame.  Edward Norton plays the hated impudent lead actor (in his play) who clashes with Keaton throughout most of the film.

Underlying this desire to further prove his worth to society, and more importantly, himself, are the fruits of his past: a detached daughter, a broken love, and an intense anger problem. \n\nBursts of satirical comedy accompanied by Keaton's battle with the human desire for approval yields a great story that has the capability to trigger a real emotional response.",

While it is hard to tell if he's acting or not, he is made into a frustrating character who can barely keep it in his pants in some scenes. However, he does improve.\n2) The fact that 'not a whole lot happens'. My parents blamed this film for that, and I still can't get over the fact they consider it a bad movie.\n\nTo be fair, the central figure of Riggan, the film being made as if it were in one shot, and the fact that it actually can sum up a Michael Bay film in only a few minutes.

            "content": "Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is a washed-up Hollywood actor famous for playing the superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies decades earlier. Riggan is tormented by the voice of Birdman, who mercilessly criticizes him, and he sees himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan hopes to reinvent his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". The play is produced by Riggan's best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis), and also stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and first-time Broadway actress Lesley (Naomi Watts). Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering addict, serves as his assistant. During rehearsals, a light fixture falls onto Ralph, an actor Riggan and Jake agree is terrible; Riggan tells Jake he caused the light to fall so he could replace Ralph. Through a connection with Lesley, Riggan replaces Ralph with the brilliant but volatile method actor Mike (Edward Norton), refinancing his house to fund his contract. The first previews go disastrously: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, and attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene. Riggan reads early press coverage and is incensed that Mike has stolen the attention, but Jake encourages him to continue. Riggan needs to find a way to keep the play together and himself as well...\n\nAside from a few shots near the beginning and end, Birdman appears to be filmed in a single shot (The concept of shooting a feature-length film in one, continuous take was actually accomplished twelve years before Birdman's release in the film \"Russian Ark\" (2002), which was shot in a single 96-minute Steadicam sequence.), an idea the director had since the film's conception. This required an atypical production approach, with many elements of post-production needing to be considered before principal photography. As a result the script took two years to write, the cast went through several weeks of meticulous rehearsals, and during shooting takes were cut for the slightest mishaps. The film was written using a dramatic device similar to Magical Realism - Magic realism or magical realism is a genre where magical or unreal elements play a natural part in an otherwise realistic (often mundane) environment. Although it is most commonly used as a literary genre (mostly during the Latin American \"boom\" generation, which includes Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes amongst many others), magic realism also applies to film and the visual arts.It was filmed in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million, jointly financed by New Regency and Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival. \"Birdman\" was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. The film has grossed more than $86 million worldwide. It has garnered critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed to the cast's performances, Iñárritu's direction, editing, screenplay, and cinematography. It is widely considered to be one of the best films of 2014, and has received multiple awards and nominations. Birdman won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director for Iñárritu, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography, and also receiving five additional nominations, tying it with The Grand Budapest Hotel for the most awards and nominations at the year's ceremony. It also won the Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. Alejandro González Iñárritu is a great director with some truly fantastic films on his CV and I reckon we all raised an eyebrow when he took upon himself to do the project \"Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" as this is pretty far from his usual style and art form. First of all I love the camera work which depicts most of the film as one continuous take and I can only imagine how difficult that is to make that happen so it looks good and believable. The idea of having a self aware showbiz satire as the foundation is not new, but it´s how you actually handle the topic that makes it interesting. And Iñárritu puts everything in it. I have been a fan of Michael Keaton since \"Beetlejuice\" and I love that he gets to show his full range yet again in a movie that will propel him into the industry yet again with good roles at hand. And I reckon you can´t get away from   the fact that the role is close to his own life and his stint as Batman. He is magnificent as Riggan Thomson in \"Birdman\" and I do think he should´ve won the Oscar for this role. I´m on your side Michael. Edward Norton is great as well together with Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis and the lovely Emma Stone. In the midst of all the black comedy and pointed fingers at what it means to be a celebrity with the good sides and the bad sides that comes with it, my personal problem with \"Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" is the feeling of this being an \"invite only\" show for the people on the inside and not for us outside of the entertainment industry. I didn´t feel invited by Iñárritu while he was dissecting all the ugly sides of the industry in his personal laboratory making the movie also feeling a bit self-important and pompous on the side. This does however not drag down the movie and the experience.",

I know a lot of people will hate me for saying this... I thought Birdman was overrated. Yes the whole one-shot thing was extremely well done and yes the acting is good, but best picture worthy? First off, Michael Keaton DID do a good job as Riggan Thompson. He had some funny lines and he gave a good performance. What I didn't understand was why Edward Norton got so much praise. He's a good actor and I have nothing against the guy personally, I just didn't see what was so great about his performance. Yeah sure, he got butt naked in front of Naomi Watts and Emma Stone, big deal. I guess just after hearing so many times from friends that Edward Norton should have gotten Best Supporting Actor, I was a bit too overhyped. The one part of the movie that I loved was Zach Galifianakis. Although he wasn't in the film for long, he stole every scene he was in. I did like the \"Birdman\" voice talking to Riggan throughout the film. I liked those scenes the best. Plus the dream sequence where the Birdman starts following him in the street and where Riggan flies around the city was a pretty neat scene. Overall, I liked the movie. I just didn't see a masterpiece like some other people did. If you love this movie, that's great! More power to you! But out of the other Best Picture nominees, I preferred American Sniper, Boyhood, The Imitation Game, Selma, & Whiplash.",

I do not consider myself a critic,  I'm just some nerd who likes movies, so I'm not the type of person to sit down and care about nothing but the character development, and themes,  but this movie did both so well I did care about both.  All of the characters have layers and layers on them,  Emma Stone isn't just some dumb teen,  she plays a teen struggling to connect with her Dad,  she has addiction problems,  she wants to be relevant,  she wants to help others,  but struggles to help herself.  Edward Norton is not just some jerk who only cares about his preformance, he is also struggling to find a way to feel alive,  to live life,  but life won't give him a break.  They are all real characters,  and the movie expects you to know that.  It never spoonfeeds you info,  you have to make your own connections,  you have to figure out what is happening,  why people are the way they are in the movie,  so it kind of pisses me off when someone puts a review saying that it made no sense,  because it's not the movies fault that you can't put 2 and 2 together,  that's your fault for being too dumb to be able too.",

It all makes for a very odd cocktail and it left me scratching my head.\nLikes: Keaton, Norton, and many other very fine performers; an effective motif of continuity; some *extremely* clever editing tricks, e.g. on several occasions, the camera seems to somehow squeeze through the bars of a window; and a very snappy, tight script that is expertly delivered by all.\nDislikes: obviously, my biggest dislike is the rather casual treatment of mental illness... is it really okay to mix laugh-out-loud humor with a plot that traces the predictable breakdown of a schizophrenic? This tale is way more serious than, for example, the film about Walter Mitty, who came across as whimsical. Here, Keaton's character is in rapid decline You know it right from the start, and you probably guess the ending right from the start too (I did). Surely the entire audience anticipates what Keaton's character will do when it's all \"for real\"... and on several occasions we're actually surprised that it goes on a bit longer.\nFellow photogeeks will note that on several occasions, the movie reverts from film to digital. E.g. when Norton joins a female supporting character on a balcony, the film quality is completely lost and the scene looks like it's shot on a handy cam. Why? I found that very disruptive to the story line...it broke the implied continuity. Maybe that was the intention? Odd.\nOn the whole, I do recommend seeing this, but it's *definitely* not for kids- don't mistake the overarching action-hero theme as light entertainment. It's an adult film. And, fair warning: if you know anything about mental illness then it may not sit well with you at all.",

Yes, they are all good actors but, honestly, I wasn't caught up in the story; the play within the play has been done much better - and not just by Shakespeare. I could have done without Riggan's psychosis about his super-hero status. And, we get it, actors and actresses are prima donnas who like to bask in their faults. Also, maybe this is just me, but too much yelling and psychological pain. I was grateful whenever his ex-wife was in a scene because she was the only character I liked in the whole movie (and, arguably, though not a  household name, Amy Ryan may be the most versatile actor of the star-studded cast). I realize that we were not supposed to like them, but, there's a way to make even the seemingly unlikeable likeable. One more thing - I don't care what they say, this was not a black comedy. It was just a dark movie in which I'm not sure I laughed once. Laugh at what - that he got caught outside in his underwear - it was sad, not funny? The third star is for the technical work.",

Anyway, this was a good movie, borderlining on great. Its a tad hard to express emotion about it. Things I liked were the single sort of unedited one shot style, I thought that was extremely impressive because not enough movies even attempt to make that happen. As a musician and primarily a drummer, I appreciated the use of the free range jazzy drum beats for a majority of the interlude music. I also like the plot, how you see pieces of this play here and there in that single shot style and have Michael Keaton battling his inner voice of Birdman, and that they leave the thought of him having actual powers ambiguous until the very end of the film, and you never really find out.  Edward Norton and Zach G. and Emma Stone were all pretty fantastic in their roles. There were a few pieces of dry plot here and there, but ultimately entertaining and weird. So I guess I can say, money well spent. 4/5",

The story about him and George Clooney on the plane and his alter ego voice captures what may have happened if Keaton himself just had Batman under his belt.  Slightly confusing at first but once you get it with the continuous shots and the elapse of time it is like watching a dream.  In a dream you go from one situation to another without cuts or subtitles telling you elapsed time.  Following Riggan we can see how he battles himself to be a respected actor.  Knowing the West/East coast battles of Broadway and Hollywood adds tension to the story.  I haven't seen an entire film that is like one continuous shot since that Russian film that I can't remember.  Everyone is at their best.  Keaton is good in anything so his versatility is well established, Edward Norton is always good, if anyone remembers his first film with Richard Gere where he was nominated for best supporting actor, this is no surprise.  The big surprise for me was Zach Galifinakis, he wasn't a weird funny type guy in this which is his bread and butter.  He played a human being very well.  I am happy to say that the Academy got it's head out of it's own Butt and actually gave the Oscar to the best picture of the year with this one.  Hopefully they will keep their heads out for a few years.",

What makes it stand out are the performances and the unique way it's shot (it looks like one long take, but those familiar with editing will spot the cuts).  Michael Keaton gets full credit for holding the entire thing together and fully deserves every award he wins for his performance.  Birdman takes plenty of shots at the superhero genre, and Hollywood in general, but none of it would work without Keaton's meta-casting.  The supporting cast is impressive, but none of the characters get much development or resolution.  Birdman also gets in the bad habit of playing the \"is it real, or in his imagination?\" card one too many times.  Leaving it up to the audience's imagination is a great thing for filmmakers to do, but here it kinda comes off as lazy writing and doesn't add much to the movie.  Aside from Keaton's performance and some impressive camerawork, there's just not much here.  Good, but far from great.",

Staging a Broadway play seems to be his last ditch effort to feel remembered and relevant again but it seems to come with a cost. The cost being a combination of colliding egos (both within and outside of himself), a daughter who loathes him and the risks one must take to stay in the lime light just long enough to feel famous again.

One scene flawlessly segues into the next by the camera following characters who only briefly appear in the previous scene. It's quite a ballet.\n\nHow's the actual story though? It's pretty good. It's about an aging actor trying to perform a theater play to make his comeback. The ensemble cast really makes this-specifically Emma Stone and Naomi Wattts. I wasn't really so much struck by Keaton's story but the ensemble cast carries it. The latter half suffers a bit because it focuses mostly on Keaton and forgets a lot of the supporting characters, but most threads do wrap up nicely. It's a good movie.",

Keaton as Riggan hires Mike played by Edward Norton in the hope of getting the play off the ground, but with Mike being an actor in the theater and Riggan coming from Hollywood-egos quickly clash between the two and to make matters worse, Riggan runs into a theater critic from the New York Times who simply will not give Riggan credit for risking what he was into what he wants to be. This leads to the back and forth battle between Riggan and 'The Birdman'-of whom he can only see. On top of all of this, Riggan is attempting to get back in the good graces with his daughter played wonderfully with passion by Emma Stone.\n\nThe takeaway from this movie is still a question and not really sure that by the end of ''BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' that anything was resolved but that might actually be the genus (or madness) of this movie.

Although I did enjoy the film it rattles me to the core what is considered a great film in the eyes of people in this generation. I sense a message coming from this movie that says todays big Hollywood hits, mainly comic book superhero films, are nothing more then big flashy expensive productions that is not real art, and does not represent good creativity in the movie making industry. At times to me it bathes in its own self-righteousness all while maintaining its central theme of suicide. I swear that this movie couldn't go ten minutes without referencing suicide in some way shape or form. At some points you actually start to believe that Keaton's character will abandon his selfish desires for the betterment of his families needs, but in the end chooses to end his own life in an attempt to show everyone that he is in fact \"somebody\" and not just a washed up Superhero actor. It even tries to convince us that in this act he is taking some sort of admirable approach to his dying career. Going out with a bang fashion. It upsets me that they mock films that inspire us to do good, and try to show us morals even when we doubt ourselves. Films that teach us real courage and sacrifice for the better of mankind, such as the Dark Knight trilogy, are considered less creative, and not deemed real art while films that teach us to ignore loved ones for selfish desires, and that suicide is a reasonable and honorable approach to failure are widely and critically acclaimed. My opinion of what true art is seeing something that you did not think was possible coming to life in front of your eyes. I get that from films such as the Avengers or Man of Steel. Those movies are the reason I go to the theatre, to see something spectacular come to life that I have never seen before. This movie is nothing more to me then a carbon copy of all other films that show us the inside of a mentally unstable characters mind, and we get to witness his depressing fall into madness only to try to shock us and disgust us with what actions this madness makes them do. Making people try to guess what atrocious horrible action this character is going to next approach to film making is not art to me. It is my hope that great films like the ones Marvel studios puts out, and hopefully DC soon, will get the same recognition and awards that these films about crazy people doing crazy things do. Unfortunately I don't see this happening anytime soon. It was a good movie, but deserving Best Picture of the year I do not agree at all.",

Meh. \n\nCinematography was absolutely amazing and well conceived for the unique feel of a continuous shot. Keaton was great, but how hard is it to play basically yourself? Still a good performance. Norton was also really good. It was also nice to see Zach in a different role, although used very little.\n\nBy winning Best Picture, Hollywood only helped solidify the narrative that nobody loves Hollywood, as much as Hollywood. It's a business movie and they love movies about them.",

It's hard to describe because it is a highly peculiar movie. What I'll say first is that I am not in the club of people who praise this film as one of the best ever, however there are plenty of attributes that deserve applause. For starters, who's ever idea it was to blend and edit all the shots in the movie to make it look like one consecutive take is brilliant. It added an entirely new spin to the movie that is something I've never seen before and makes me appreciate the movie more than I would have otherwise. Another aspect of the film worth recognition is the spectacular script that is carried perfectly by the actors. The dialogue is quick witted and always ahead of the audience which also adds to the play-like dynamic of the film. The surrealism is a large part of the movie and almost feels out of place although it manages to work. It factors into the protagonists' struggles and morals as he decides who he is and his meaning toward society. Without going into detail and avoiding spoilers, there is a \"Christopher Nolan\" type cliffhanger ending that lets the audience speculate which direction the director wants this story to end. In my opinion, this movie is not that type of movie and almost seems like it was thrown in there for the hell of it. I would have preferred  a more complete and finalizing ending for this movie and protagonist.",

This film was shot beautifully, I didn't realize it was in one take beforehand, but noticed it right away and loved it. I'm a sucker for those things. I thought the acting was superb as well! But it was just too weird, it didn't make me feel like I had to finish it, like it was leading to something worth while, and I can't say it really did. I don't agree with hardly anything in the film as far as morals go, and I guess that makes it just a little more realistic if they were going for a hollywood vibe.

It's not hard to see why, what with director Alejandro González Iñárritu's ambitious technical achievements, the razor sharp satirical screenplay and a bunch of soul-bearing performances. Presenting the story as one long continuous take, Iñárritu employs all the tricks of the trade in search of something unique and it largely pays off; his ever-flowing camera segues between scenes creating a dreamlike atmosphere. Finding where the shots have been joined, however, can at times distract from the emotional journey crafted by Iñárritu and his team of writers, in a script full of dark humour and irony. Unfortunately there's also a hint of pretension and self-satisfaction in Iñárritu's work - intentional and otherwise - that comes across as smug and, therefore, annoying. As Riggan Thomson, the former A-lister seeking professional rejuvenation on the stage, Michael Keaton gets a long- awaited opportunity to shine in a lead role and attacks it, for better and worse, with unbridled gusto. Ed Norton hogs the spotlight though, with a comedic turn as a supercilious stage actor looking for the \"truth\" in even the tiniest of things, whilst Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan round out the impressive cast. Birdman is clever, enterprising and admirably distinct, if occasionally laborious and inaccessible; it's not for everyone, but lovers of film and/or theatre should seek it out.",

There is much about this movie that is loathesome - its pretentiousness, its over-acting and its recurring bait-and-switch phoniness; but ultimately, all that awfulness results in a pretty innovative film about our obsession with celebrity.

Michael Keaton is superb somehow keeping up the pace with both the real and imaginary characters despite the constant assault by all.

Maybe if you are from NY you know the significance and that lends more weight to the performance.

Their honesty and raw emotion set the tone and pace beautifully. Norton, in particular, brought an electric energy to the picture. \n\nThe film is layered in every way, ambitiously taking on themes such as: what is art? What are the risks of an artist? How does Hollywood really compare to the stage? What is the nature of reality? How do you escape past success to redefine who you are? Who does that really matter to? And many, many more. \n\nBirdman is unabashed in its answers to these questions, running the gauntlet of emotion to delve every ounce of meaning from every frame on screen. The cinematography and editing were both masterworks, boasting a nearly seamless long shot of the entire 2 hour film. \n\nAdding to the layers, the film often goes completely meta, with things like being able to see the source of the music in the film and Keaton's character acting as both director of his play and, at times, his life. Despite the seeming lack of cuts, there's still plenty of highly stylized moments which often raise more questions than they answer. \n\nBirdman, overall, was a thinking movie with great acting that had great ambitions. Though, its worst sin is that it didn't go far enough in any of its many directions to truly create a masterpiece. \n\nStill, watching it try is a great ride.",

AL FINAL TODAS ESAS PELÍCULAS SON LO MISMO. Acto en tres partes Inicio, desarrollo y final con un protagonista que gana y un antagonista que pierde.\n\"Birdman\" es más que eso, es un viaje lleno de pasión a la actuación y a los que se sacrifican por interpretarlos, para hacer felices a los ignorantes como nosotros y perdiendo su carrera por culpa del alter ego que después olvidamos.\nEn resumen la mejor película que jamas se atrevieron a hacer para nosotros que adoramos ver a las estrellas en trajes de spandex o armaduras coloridas.\n10/10",

At every turn, Birdman is taking chances and changing the game. As for the movie's end, I cannot think of a better way to wrap together the two realms that we are presented with throughout the film (the actual, and the supernatural). With Riggan's success in finally achieving what he wants in life (a nod to the opening card), his daughter looks down in horror, then up in delight--acknowledgment that he has left Birdman behind and is finally a person of self-significance and worth. Is he dead or is he flying? The answer is simply no. Audiences who crave concrete answers will be frustrated by the movie's metaphysical end. But the metaphor is just so beautiful.",

Then we learn that these are probably in his mind, Then a CGI sequence persuades us that he can fly. Then it appears he can't because having landed he has to pay the taxi driver. Then he;s in hospital and fantasises about flying with the birds. Then his daughter arrives and thinks he's jumped and fallen to his death - and then she looks up in wonderment. So - can he fly?

Time, sound, and editing also create elements of magical realism and reflect the mind of Riggan.\n\nThere are a couple things I did not appreciate very much, including sexism that is played for humor and a titillating kiss that doesn't make much sense to me and adds to the undercurrent of sexism.

Zach Galifianakis is amazing as his agent. And Naomi watts is great. \nMichael Keaton is amazing. This is hands down the best performance he has ever given. He is believable, ballsy, and damn perfect. \nNow let's talk about the movie. It is the most original, unique, and strange movie I've seen this year. The way the director, who deserves the oscar, uses metaphorical imagery, and focuses in the characters is flawless. Not to mention the whole movie looks like one continuous shot! The beginning of Goodfellas is this entire movie. Amazing. \nThis movie is also funny as hell, the line delivery and facial expressions the actors give is perfect. This movie succeeds in every way and deserves Best Picture",

I knew this was gonna be Keaton's showcase, what I wasn't expecting was that every other actor was splendid on this as well. They all had great monologues that threatened to steal the show from Keaton on more than one occasion. Add a very nice one shot gimmick that is never intrusive or trying to show off; but rather immerse you on the psyche of this wonderful character that is pretty much summing up Keaton's true career this far. It takes balls to be aware of it and turn it into a quirky comedy that at the same time is constantly throwing knives at the movie industry. Complete, secure, well-performed, memorable soundtrack, fantastic scenes and a delightful conclusion, Birdman only sins for not trying to go a bit further. It ends and despite the varied approach, you end up feeling this could've been much more. Maybe next time.",

            "content": "Birdman tells the story of seasoned actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is preparing for the opening night of his first Broadway play. He's best known for his starring role of superhero Birdman decades earlier and is in quite a bit of a personal crisis. He wants nothing but recognition for his professional accomplishments and he wants his new project to be a success.\n\nIn Birdman, we're dropped right into the backstage drama leading up to the play's opening night. We see several people connected to the play as well as Thomson's daughter/assistant Sam (Emma Stone). We also get the idea that the Birdman character invaded Thomson's psyche and the tragic lead of this story doesn't experience reality in is head as we observe it.\n\nPossibly interesting only to theatre production people, the drama is quite dull and predictable, giving the audience time to pay attention to the fact that director Alejandro González Iñárritu is playing games with time and space in this movie. Those games are executed to a T, with props going to Emmanuel Lubezki, the cinematographer, and Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione for their superb job at editing these scenes.\n\nThese technical accomplishments of making the movie look like it's one long take instead of connected scenes overshadow the actual story and acting here. Sure, Keaton does a good job with the troubled Thomson. And when Edward Norton enters as co-star Mike, the intensity sure picks up a bit. But after almost two hours of this story, I am left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the actual content of the narrative and characters. And annoyed by the pseudo-artsy-fartsy drum soundtrack. If you'd look up 'style over substance' in a 2015 illustrated dictionary, you'd find this movie.\n\nDon't be fooled by reviews claiming it to be the greatest work of art in filmmaking in decades. There's quite a few people jumping on the chance to showcase their love and admiration for this film in an online movie review. I get the feeling most critics do it so as to not lose face with their peers. There's even a hint of \"let's write this is the best movie ever made, because if I don't, I'll be considered a neanderthal who doesn't understand art.\"\n\nLet's get one thing straight: the production value is excellent. Unfortunately, the story and characters are severely underwhelming. If this takes 'best picture' at the Academy Awards, it will be a crying shame.\n\nPros: Great production value, excellent editing and OK performances\nCons: Style over substance at every level\n\nVerdict: Meh",

The story line related to the fragility and arrogance of actors was lost on me because it was self-indulgent.

It's too cynical except the one scene were the main character is helped down from the ledge (figuratively and literally) by someone with genuine compassion.

I don't care about Riggan's past or future - the single-take shot scenes anchor you so supremely in his present moment yet the majority of the conflict in the film is propelled by events you never witness. And so we're invited to attach a popular meta-narrative of other films and real life personas too (perhaps it would have been better to go the whole Being John Malkovich route and just reference Batman directly). \n\nEdward Norton is fantastic and then squandered upon cliché.\n\nMy favourite scene is when Norton first comes on stage to workshop a scene. The anatomy of this is really basic: 1) Riggan commits a basic writing crime (redundant dialogue), 2) Mike fixes this error; but the execution is so perfect. Too bad nothing really tops this exchange making many subsequent scenes just appear as self-parodies. \n\nThe personal conflict does not motivate the best sequences, instead the mere accident of locking oneself outside a one-way door is the trigger and so the resolution of this conflict fails to really connect with anything deeper - while being wildly entertaining.\n\nThe end is crap. At least in Ghostworld, when the main character departs the reality or world of the film, this potential had long been foreshadowed and built up - here it's just confusing. Why doesn't Riggan want the magical success he's just been granted? Why was his surgery so neat? Was the performance really so good it could change the spiteful critic's bias against him? What happens to everyone else? Birdman just derails.",

Há acidentes, saídas de roteiro, pessoas à beira de uma crise de nervos, visitas da imprensa, e até mesmo desentendimentos entre os atores, tudo envolto neste conceito de que há alguém perseguindo os personagens o tempo todo pelos palcos, corredores e até pelas ruas.\n\nO filme todo se desenvolve basicamente no mesmo cenário, um teatro de Nova Iorque, o que igualmente ajuda a dar aquela característica ainda mais teatral ao projeto. E como uma boa peça, o componente essencial é a atuação dos atores, e não deleites visuais que distraiam da história e seus personagens.\n\nAssim, Michael Keaton brilha como o atormentado Riggan Thomson, atuando basicamente como si mesmo. E a ironia de que Keaton igualmente fez fama há 20 anos quando viveu o personagem Batman nas telonas, apenas reforça o efeito metalinguístico. Ao contrário de seus colegas indicados ao Oscar de Melhor Ator, que ou interpretam pessoas reais, ou contam com artifícios como dramas exagerados, Keaton foca sua atuação dentro da alma do próprio personagem, salientando que tudo se passa dentro da própria perspectiva de Riggan. As angústias, dúvidas, e alegrias do personagem são meramente naturais, e conferem um peso muito maior à sua atuação.\n\nEdward Norton, então, se sai extraordinariamente bem, no que talvez seja seu melhor papel em anos. Emma Stone, com seus grandes olhos, sempre se sai encantadora. E até mesmo Zach Galifianakis, nitidamente mais magro, consegue nos surpreender em um papel mais sério. Eu não acreditava que ele fosse capaz de fazer qualquer coisa sem encarnar a aura amalucada do Alan de Se Beber Não Case.\n\nTrazendo ainda uma história que pode gerar entendimentos ambíguos, Birdman honra a si mesmo com efeitos especiais divertidos e pouco usuais em momentos chaves, deixando os espectadores ainda mais surpresos quando a trama larga um pouco o teatro para focar quase que exclusivamente em Riggan.\n\nSem dúvida, Birdman talvez seja o filme que mais divide opiniões dentre os vários indicados ao Oscar de Melhor Filme de 2015. E gerar debates nunca é ruim. Principalmente para o cinema, que vem optando por escolhas cada vez mais fáceis e certeiras nos últimos anos, adaptando livros popularescos e histórias em quadrinhos como se fossem requisitos infalíveis para se arrastar multidões às salas de cinema. E até isto é debatido em Birdman, numa amalgama metalinguagem extremamente perspicaz. \n\nTalvez não ser fácil seja uma qualidade, afinal de contas.",

On his journey of redemption he tries to escape his past, stay releveant and not be remembered as being Birdman. On the journey we see parallels with the real film industry: the critics being the only option that matters, celebrities who feel loved but in reality are admired, not being able to separate reality with acting and one actors fame causing him to overstep others. In the end which can be interpreted many ways, Keaton realizes he cannot escape Birdman and just accepts it. Just like Christian Bale will always be Batman and Robert Downey Jr will be Ironman.",

            "content": "Basic: So, Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance, Riggan Thompson (played by Micheal Keaton) is a washed-up actor, he's been famous for playing the character, Birdman, and now he's trying to redeem himself by doing an adaptation of a novel, by not in a movie, but in a play. He's also trying to get his family back together. Amy Ryan's character wants Micheal Keaton's character, Riggan to spend more time with her daughter, Sam (played by Emma Stone), after she got back from rehab for all the drugs she's been doing. Well, in fact, she worked with Riggan on his play he's doing as his as. Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's agent. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and Andrea Riseborough are all playing the actors, who are in Riggan's play he's doing. Just an absolute A- level cast there.\n\nWhat's the deal: Let me just start off to say about Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu, and his films he had done. In 2001, he directed Amorres Perros, a very bleak and a very strong film, which had great performances, and considered it to be a classic for a lot of people out there. Then, in 2003, he did 21 grams, (his first English film), that somehow may not be as great as Amorres Perros, but it was good for a lot of critics. In 2006, he made Babel, a movie that went down a little, but it did earn a lot of Academy Awards Nominations including best picture. In 2010, he goes back on making another foreign film, Biutiful, starring Javier Bardem, and that does marked the least film that he has done due to its graphic images. Now, he makes Birdman, a dark comedy, which really does take a very thrilling leap forward by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu. After watching many times of the trailer, I really thought the film was going to be a lot like Silver Linings Playbook. The fact, that these two movies have different genres, but it does have that same subject that the main character is trying to fix his problems, and also trying to get his life back as he wanted to be. Now, when I watched the film, it felt different of what I experienced. That it's not like Silver Linings Playbook at all. It was an absolute darkly comedy, that I was quite amused by it, and the filmmaking was pretty ballsy.\n \nThe nominations: The film is nominated of nine academy award nominations, including best director, best actor, and best picture. Everybody has been talking a lot about Michael Keaton's performance, and I think he does a great job as playing a washed-up actor, who's going into this reality and fantasy world of his. I do think he's going to win the Oscar for best actor in a leading role, but I'm not 100% sure of it, because people do talked about another actor in another movie, Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, which I had not yet saw the movie. Of course, Michael Keaton's recent films: Robocop (remake), and Need for Speed has been disappointed. In fact, I haven't seen the remake of Robocop. I really detested Need for Speed, though. But, anyway, I do think his performance carried a lot of great strength in the film. As for the rest of the cast, I do think they did a solid job in the film, especially Edward Norton, and Emma Stone, who are nominated this year.  Emmanuel Luebezki's cinematography (better known for winning an Oscar for Gravity) is very beautiful to look at. The direction by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu is pretty ballsy, and the reason why I'm saying that because almost the entire movie is done with this one long shot, and the camera angles were moving around in places, when we see these characters of where they're going, and what they're doing. It reminded me of something that Sam Raimi had done that with The Evil Dead trilogy, except he was only doing it to make it scary. Now, my only question I have with this movie is why Birdman won best screenplay at the Golden Globes?  I mean, I do see the fact that the screenplay is very well written, and it does have some creativity, but I really do think The Grand Budapest Hotel deserved to win best screenplay because it had so much creativity, and it is just so wonderfully written, that it was so hard for me to resist. The screenplay to this film is still well-written, though.\n\nMy full opinion: I wouldn't say that Birdman is a perfect film for me, because some of the visuals in the film really does warned me down, but for the most part, I was actually quite amused by this absolute ballsy dark comedy, that Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu had just created. 8.6/10",

This is in part due to their chemistry and in part due to how the character was presented.  After watching several interesting and well written scenes involving Mike (Norton), the character is then quite abruptly and inexplicably dropped.

So this movie opens on him preparing a show on Broadway that he is writing, directing, and starring in. Of course if you've heard anything about this film it's not the plot, but the fact that it is intended to appear as one entirely continuous take. It's a fun artistic choice, however I did struggle with it at times because without breaks I sometimes had difficulty figuring out how much time had passed in the moment it took them to sweep the camera from one end of the room to another. However, the rapid-fire way they moved from one scene to the next without cuts made the whole thing feel very theatrical. In fact, the stuff that was happening to the characters backstage sometimes felt as scripted as the stuff we see them doing on stage. I don't mean this as an insult because a number of the speeches and monologues that characters have in this film are simply wonderful. It all flows very nicely and even caused me to question what was actually a line in the play and when someone was bringing their personal life on stage.\n\nThe true brilliance of Birdman is in the cast. I could walk through every single actor on the list and talk about how awesome they were, but it would get repetitive after awhile. I could not ask for more from their performances, and it seemed almost every person had their one scene to shine which they nailed. Instead of gushing endlessly about the cast I think I'll get to the couple of things that I didn't love in Birdman. First of all, this movie continuously inserted some magical elements into the story. I thought it did a nice job of straddling the line and making the viewer question whether these things were happening in reality or only in the main character's unstable mind. However, towards the end it feels like we are given a definitive answer, and then a little while later we are given a contradictory definitive answer. I just would like the movie to either leave it ambiguous or make up its mind. The only other problem I had with Birdman was the way it seemed to take a number of stands on things but it was never solidly decided on one stance. For instance, is it villainizing superhero films or glorifying them? It was beautifully presented, perfectly acted, and had a lot of excellent scenes but it didn't really have anything to say. There were several moments where I was asking myself \"Why is this scene even in the movie? Is there an overall point to all this?\" I guess I didn't totally understand the film, but I'd gladly watch it again to attempt to figure it out.",

Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone are fantastic -- Norton's performance being my particular favorite in this film. The story, which follows a former Hollywood star (Keaton) who tries to write, direct, and act in a broadway play to prove himself an artist, seems like it might be deriving aspects of Keaton's real career. The plot is very well structured, but it loses a bit of its balance in the final act. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu's coolest superpower in \"Birdman\" is how the film appears to be all one take. This gives the film a dreamy vibe which is accentuated in several surrealist scenes that are scattered across the film. Furthermore, the single-take style gives somewhat of a broadway feel to the film itself, while maintaining incredible filmic staging. The director's intent is clear throughout \"Birdman\" and it makes the film a wonderful, wholesome, and energetic experience.",

I looked at his filmography and he's been busy cashing paychecks, but in nothing I have seen since 2002's Live From Baghdad, an HBO movie, which itself was billed as a sort of comeback.   What Keaton does in this movie is what all the great movie stars have done before him, he is both himself and the character at the same time.  The material is that of a Neill Simon satire of Hollywood and Broadway minus the comedy.  Those of us that remember how good Michael Keaton he was in the 1980s have probably wondered why he stopped getting the A-list roles.  Maybe it was Batman, but he was also occupying the same real estate as Tom Hanks and Robin Williams.  He had the problem that Joel McRae faced with Gary Cooper or Randolph Scott had with Jimmy Stewart, winning actors that find themselves with the rejected scripts of bigger stars.  \nThis movie trades the comedy normal in satire for a bit of art house pretension that works better in European movies but fits right in with this material.  Keaton's alter ego is BIRDMAN, the character that had made him rich and famous 20 years prior.  Birdman is constantly getting into his head and the audience gets to see Keaton's super powers when he gets angry.  I don't think I have read Raymond Carver since around the time Keaton was making Batman movies, but the play is based on his work.   It's a great choice for an actor of fluff that is looking for something he takes to be depth and the script also gives Keaton a personal connection back to Carver.  Overall the movie is realism splashed with dreamlike moments, but on reflection the movie only makes sense as a dream or a delusion.  I appreciated the nuance and the ambiguity.\nIt has some notable co-stars, including a deglamorized Emma Stone, a youthful looking Naomi Watts, Edward Norton channeling that pipsqueak Brando thing he does, along with Amy Ryan as the ex-wife and Zach Galifianakis as the best friend and producer.  \nThis is one of the better films of 2014 and I look forward to the director's commentary when it comes out on DVD.   We can only hope that this time Keaton is back for good giving us some meaty performances over the next ten years.   If I had to place a wager I think this would be most likely to win Best Picture by process of elimination.",

What I like about the film is that the characters are vulnerable, hurt, bewildered, confused, but they carry their confusion with a certain dignity.  After all, life is just a stage; the cinematography looks like a guy with a camera following the actors around and never quite knowing what the actors will do next. \nThe female parts show surprising kindness and vulnerability--which empowers them.  The all- too -powerful theatre critic is brassy and tangles  with Keaton; he needs a good review: they both stick up for their rights: she to be a critic and he an artist.  After all, it's not the result that is all important, but its all important that he try.  Keaton shows about every emotion in the acting book and his nomination for a best actor Oscar is timely.",

You essentially watch him fall to pieces over the course of a few weeks. (Going back to the long takes, using those made weeks feel like one long day, which was a brilliant move).

Edward Norton and Emma Stone are both excellent whereas Michael Keaton gave his career-greatest performance in this role that was pretty much made for him. I did like its themes a lot, but it only touches the surface and rarely truly explores them. The movie is admirably ambitious, but uneven at execution. It's thus far from Inarritu's best.",

Emma Stone is not a favorite and seems to sleepwalk thru her role and feels miscast.\nBottom line...I recommend...will watch it again....but hated the ending.",

            "content": "Alejandro González Iñárritu has thrown himself into the Oscar ballet with his critically acclaimed film Birdman, but is it really has good as the hype says it is? The story revolves around Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) a down on his luck actor who is better known for his portrayal of the super hero Birdman. He attempts to make people remember the man behind the mask by producing, directing, and staring in a broadway play, but he keeps hitting walls at every turn, sometimes real and sometimes in his own mind.\n\nThis film was beloved during it's limited release I personally left the theater enjoying what i saw but also confused at what it was. Birdman is a good movie, but it is by no means perfect and some elements are just plain bad. It's biggest strength is in it's cinematography with long uncut tracking shots following characters in and out of rooms, conveying that you're watching a play more then a movie. It also plays around with diegetic and non-diegetic sounds to convey a sense of frustration and instability. However while the film falls flat when it comes to the plot, it starts out strong and pulls the audience in quickly, but during the second act the film seems like it forgot what it's trying to say and goes all over place. Certain scenes that would be large plot points are just forgotten by the third act and gives us an ending that just seems forced and cliched. \n\nThe best performance of the entire film goes to Michael Keaton, while he was not actually in Alejandro's mind when we wrote Birdman he was still the perfect choice. He does wall at conveying an actor who isn't a good person but makes you root for him. We may not see Keaton as much as we used to but after this film it's should be obvious people will want to see him more. Edward Norton nearly stole the show as a antisocial overly realistic method actor. He can sometimes become over the top in his performance, but brings it down at the right moments for him to be taken seriously. Emma Stone plays Keaton's post-rehab daughter, who's always been a great actress but in this role she's a mixed bag. When she tries to convey an angsty depressed Lindsey Lohan type girl, it comes across as simply forced, but she really shines in the more sincere moments especially with Keaton, doing well to convey a loving relationship. The most disappointing performance in the whole movie has to be Zach Galifanakis, while he looks good he just doesn't stand out among the herd of other great actors. Anytime he wasn't on screen I would totally forget he was even in the movie.\n\nAll in all the film started strong but ran out of breath near the end. I am not dissapointed i saw it at all, but i'm happy to have only seen it once. While I highly doubt it will win best picture hopefully this will mean Keaton being brought in for leading rolls.",

He was Batman! I love Batman! And he's in a new film! Brilliant!\"\n\nThrough Keaton-coloured glasses, Birdman is viewed as a sort of homecoming party, and I can't help but fast forward a few years to wonder how time will treat it. We start out with an engaging little ensemble drama set on Broadway, and we finish with a maddeningly self-indulgent, freewheeling \"exploration\" which upends most of our established feelings about Keaton's Riggan Thomson, renders nearly everything we've seen happen prior to be either meaningless or nonsensical, and leaves us on a note which is \"open to interpretation\" in as much as you're choosing between thinking \"what the fuck was that?\" or yawning.\n\nIt's problematic.\n\nBut, it is undoubtedly a technical marvel - if you've any interest in cinematography, this is a no-brainer. It is extremely meticulously put together, and it looks fantastic. And everyone in it is good. And it really is a good film for the first hour or so - infuriatingly so, as it turns out. As it ran out of steam somewhere into the second hour, the film that leapt to mind by way of comparison was Darren Aronofsky's howlingly pretentious Black Swan. Both films have an annoyingly loose grasp on what I was demanding from them: structure and meaning. Indeed, in a moment here which is supposed to be self-referential and clever, Keaton literally walks past a character using Macbeth to describe the film he's in: \"It is a tale. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.\" - I couldn't help but think to myself, \"yup!\"",

Pocas veces me he sentido tan identificado con un protagonista, aun a sabiendas de que vive en un perpetuo error.\n\nLa historia de Birdman tiene quizás el problema de tener el enfoque del mundo del cine/teatro, lo que seguramente para gran parte del público sonará como algo distante con lo que no puede sentirse identificado, pero realmente su mensaje puede ir más allá de eso.\n\nPuede que lo más llamativo de la cinta sea el \"cómo\": una soberbia realización de cámara y montaje que nos engaña a todos con un falso plano secuencia durante prácticamente todo el metraje y que no debería caer en saco roto ya que no solo ayuda mucho al ritmo de la trama y a esa sensación de angustia que sufre el protagonista, sino que también es todo un alarde cinematográfico.

You combine it with the uneasy camera angles and the annoying music (which was probably produced by JK Simmons' conservatory after throwing some cymbals at his drummer's head), and it created a strange dizzying sensation that matched the plight of the Birdman. I loved the ending and think this movie is the dark horse to win it all since the historical/true story movies will split votes and people will wake up and realize that beyond the gimmick of filming it over 12 years, Boyhood wasn't a very good movie. When all is said and done, though, Birdman's most lasting contribution will be that it inspired two artists to create a new style called \"extreme realism.\"",

The acting however is excellent. Michael Keatons performance is unreal, a perfect depiction. Emma Stone and Edward Norton also turn in a+ performances.

            "content": "Strong performances,mind-bending layered screenplay and technically brilliant\n\n Honestly I really don't understand why I ended up liking Birdman so much. The story feels as much ignorant as the alternate title.To begin with I truly was not able to stick myself with plausibility of the events shown in the film. Although I was quite able to relate to it metaphorically but the ending left me pretty much hanging. The story has a multi-layered point of view and the writers have done splendid job working on small little details which many casual viewers miss. Birdman is a kind of movie where you will spot something new on multiple viewings that you might have missed earlier.\n\n The story revolves around Riggan (played masterfully by Micahel Keaton) who was once a famous superstar for playing superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies. Now past his middle age, Riggan seems to have lost his path in the film industry but his mind is not a phase to accept it. He is working on Broadway play which he himself is directing and writing apart from acting in it to showcase his talents. We get see his internal struggle countering with his alter-ego \"Birdman\" who makes him feel he is still a superstar and shouldn't waste his time on Broadway plays. Also he is facing family problems with distances between him and his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) constantly increasing. Starring in his play is a hardcore actor Mike (Edward Norton) whose dedications have no limit while he is acting and two more actress Leasley(Naomi Watts) and Laura(Andrea Riseborough) who have relatively smaller role. The entire star-studded cast was absolutely brilliant to watch and each of their characters is given ample amount of depth.\n\n The cinematography is excellent and the entire film is edited to make it look like a one continuous shot (except once in the climax). The background score comprising mostly drums was also splendid. The multi-layered screenplay was very interesting and there were also many laugh-out-loud moments which was a really surprising considering the theme was more of dark comedy. I am not very clear about what rating to give right now, will have stronger opinion after re-watching it few times. Still with its stellar cast, weirdly intelligent script I must admit Birdman is one the finest films I have seen this year. \n\nRATING:[4.5/5]",

Birdman es una pelicula que critica a otras películas y ellos se critican a si mismos, un circulo vicioso de la ignorancia. Esos 4 OSCARS los tiene muy bien merecidos, mi favorita del 2014.",

            "content": "\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige\"\n\nMexican director Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu is not normally known for his jeu d'esprit and has seemed more comfortable while dealing with heavily pessimistic and sombre themes. His previous films Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful are all excellent works but they require serious commitment to get yourself through their excruciatingly downbeat material. With that in mind, it's no surprise that his latest effort in Birdman is ultimately about the fractured and fragile psyche of a man on a seemingly downward spiral. However, Birdman shows another side to IÃ±Ã¡rritu's talents; black it may be but he now surprisingly  displays a great talent for comedy.\n\nRiggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was once a massive Hollywood star that made his reputation playing the superhero Birdman. However, his career faded after the third instalment of the franchise and he now finds himself working on the Broadway stage. He's determined to prove his worth as a real actor and director by adapting a Raymond Carver play but problems with his cast, his family and his own fragile mental state threaten to sink his ambitions.\n\nFilms within films have often been a theme throughout filmmaking. To become self-referential is a bold move. Robert Altman's The Player, Spike Jonze's Adaptation or the surreal work of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive are notable works that have toyed with the life imitating art imitating life structure. It can be hard to pull off but these films are just some  examples of when it's done right and IÃ±Ã¡rritu's latest can now consider itself to be on the same level.\n\nOn previous evidence, IÃ±Ã¡rritu has proven to be a very clever director. He has always had a grasp on his material and delivered their fractured structures and timeframes with deftness and consummate skill. His work on Birdman is as impressive as he's ever been but it's the handling of comedy that's impresses most. Not only is he able to capture the absurdity and quirks in human behaviour but he also utilises these behaviours to create an inventive and original farce.\nEmploying the likes of Emmanuel Lubezki as director of photography is also a genius stroke. In a short space of time, Lubezki has become one of the most respected cinematographer's in the business and if you look at his work on Gravity last year or his work here, you can easily see why. He manages to keep the camera constantly moving throughout the films entirety; one minute we're focused, up close and personal, on the actors before sweeping through claustrophobic corridors, upstairs and down to find another dramatic moment. The film wasn't shot as one continuous take but it's miraculously made to look like it and credit must go to editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione for their seamless work on Lubezki's constantly mobile camerawork.\n\nAs the long, seemingly  continuous shots grab your attention, though, so too do the performances. Across the board, everyone delivers. Amy Ryan and Andrea Riseborough are given small roles but they're by no means ineffective. Naomi Watts produces the emotional quality she always does and Emma Stone really sinks her teeth into the conflicted and tortured daughter role. Again, Zach Galifiniakas is given a small role where he only sporadically appears throughout the story but whenever he does, he commands a surprising range of emotions. I was very impressed with his dramatic work when he's normally considered a comedy actor. From the supporting players, though, it's Ed Norton who shines brightest. It's been a while since Norton has had a role that he's able to reaffirm his talents but he finds it here. Again, self-referential, Norton sends himself up. He has a reputation for being difficult to work with but bravely embraces a character that similarly reflects his acting methods. As a big admirer of Norton, I can only hope that this sees him back where he belongs. Which brings me to the leading man; I've never really been too kind or retrained on my dislike for Michael Keaton. I've often found him to be quite a self-conscious actor and could never shake off the feeling that most of his work is nothing more than a performance. He never allowed me to suspend my disbelief and for any actor that is a major demerit and (to be brutally honest) unforgivable. That being said, as Riggan Thompson, Keaton wonderfully parodies himself and I have to hold my hands up here... he's absolutely outstanding in Birdman. It's by far his finest work to date and a role that's tailor made for him. Having successfully donned the Batsuit in Tim Burton's take on the dark knight, Keaton never really reached those heights again. He had the occasional role that provided him with reasonable supporting hits but, for the most part, Keaton had had his day. This is the film that will, no doubt, bring him more work where his fans will rejoice in seeing his solid return.\n\nI was honestly one for passing Birdman by. I do enjoy the works of Norton and IÃ±Ã¡rritu but when I heard about Michael Keaton headlining a film, I considered giving it a wide berth. However, the buzz surrounding it left me with no choice but to check it out. I'm glad I did as it's an accomplished piece of work that explores the weighty themes of the human ego, past successes and the inability to come to terms with failure. Meanwhile, it satirises showbiz, and in particular, the superhero hero genre. Everyone from Woody Harrelson in The Hunger Games to Robert Downey, Jr in his \"tin-man get up\" takes a dig but ultimately the film is one big in-joke that manages to tread a fine line between fantasy and reality.\n\nMark Walker",

The acting was exquisite across the board, and the tongue-in-cheek premise of Michael Keaton as a washed-up former movie superhero was explored exceptionally well. Riggan Thomson (Keaton's character) noted that the role he was playing on a Broadway stage felt like a microcosm of his character's life, and I can't help but wonder how much Keaton felt Thomson was a microcosm of his actual life.\n\nAt one point in the film, Thomson decries a critics' review as nothing more than a mere \"label.\" Well, here's a label for Birdman: phenomenal.",

            "content": "I'm pained to say that I didn't love Birdman, as the single-shot cinematography was executed fluidly and delightfully. It's ambitious. Even Gravity had a few cuts littered throughout the film on occasion. Birdman, from the introduction of Michael Keaton as washed-up actor Riggan (formerly titular star of superhero film 'Birdman'; great casting) meditating in the air to the intense on-stage climax, has no cuts. This condition certainly limits director Alejandro Gonzalez in reward for unique results. Admirable, too, considering how costume and makeup changes had to be at Broadway level for certain transitions to work. I doubt that Gonzalez would cheat via editing. The music feels like New York and Broadway, switching between familiar classical movements and the showmanship of a sole jazz drummer. We become familiar with the layout of the Broadway theater that the movie takes place in, and the streets around the theater. On the subject of familiarity, since this film centers around Keaton's play production, we also become familiar with certain scenes of the play, and each repetition feels drastically different. As an actor, I empathized with those in the production, in fear of the show fucking up at any moment, or at the worst moment.\n\nStrangely, what happens on stage or in public was far more interesting than the exposition behind the curtain. Besides Michael Keaton, the other stage actors are hardcore method acting and controlling-in-compensation-for-flaccid-penis Edward Norton, the sexually unsatisfied Naomi Watts, and emotionally unsatisfied Andrea Riseborough. Keaton's character has a daughter, played by Emma Stone, who got out of rehab and blames Keaton for the err of her ways. What's unfortunate about the cinematography is that Gonzalez limited himself to focusing on one or two characters for an extended time, inherently leaning towards the Birdman. I can't articulate how the minor characters change, as the movie abandons their side stories well before the climax.\n\nThat leaves us with Birdman/Riggan. His character is a wreck, despite directing and starring in a Broadway show. He is constantly unsatisfied with his show, primarily because Norton is hogging the spotlight from him. Combined with one critic's promise to destroy the show and on-stage embarrassments, Keaton is in constant conflict with his former self, a true superhero. Literally. He has mental, sometimes physical, arguments with himself in a Birdman costume. Keaton's losses and victories over himself, and the world, might be the first time I discovered how talented he really is, beyond his works with Tim Burton. Within Keaton's vision, we see him exploit telekinetic powers and the ability to fly. No one else sees that though. I won't spoil the climax, but what happens afterwards warps what I assumed to be the real world. Rather than people seeing Keaton as mentally ill, they hail him as a truly groundbreaking actor. The film ends with others seeing him as the superhero, as Keaton flies around New York City and possibly fights crime. I understand that the superpowers are metaphorical. That's not what I'm talking about. By the end, I couldn't tell what Birdman wanted to be. A satire on the celebrity culture of Broadway, in comparison to Hollywood? A 'hyperrealistic' depiction of how less successful shows can beat the odds and trump the critics? It can't be both, so whatever the screenwriters and Gonzalez were going for, I'm opting for neither. The lack of focus and undeveloped characters are disappointing. It may not be the decades-to-last art piece that I wanted, but I would still recommend seeing this once for the cinematography alone, with committed performances, some enthralling scenes, and a definite New York feel as bonuses.",

Look past narrative and character depth and acting--which are all on point here anyway--and realize that you will rarely watch anything like this in your lifetime. There's nothing commercial about this. Much could be said about the equally innovative Boyhood. \n\nBut in Birdman's case, the long takes adds to the complexity of the story and the palpability of it. You know there's no BS because you're seeing everything--and it all makes sense. And while the film seems to mostly be one single shot, it still has so many stories intertwined that all relate to one another as though the characters are apart of the same plain--and they can't avoid each other.\n\nIt's a commentary of show business, but it isn't preachy, and it doesn't blatantly take sides. It shows things for what they are.\n\nTo me it's impossible to criticize something that's as honest as this. You watch this film an then you go and watch the next Nicholas Sparks film and compare their integrities. One of those you feel like you're a customer at somebody's business, and the other you feel like you're staring at a masterpiece at an art gallery. A masterpiece of film is greater than the sum of it's parts. Birdman doesn't fall apart at the seams if something is out of line. It isn't dependent on one aspect of the film. Even with mediocre acting this film would be incredible. \n\nTwizard Rating: 99",

Director Alejandro González Iñárritu uses a lot of handheld cameras and extreme close-ups in Birdman; this results in a claustrophobic film that gives the audience the impression that they're spying on the actors rather than watching them perform. That helps the film achieve a chilling effect, but the principle strength of Birdman lies in the excellent performances by Keaton, Norton, and the rest of the well-chosen cast.",

            "content": "The story which is presented in Birdman isn't really compelling or particularly interesting. What is though is the Oscar worthy acting and the unbelievable cinematography.\nThe Camera - When the camera simply refuses to jump cut, as an audience member you are stuck along for the ride that is this fluid film.  You feel like you're part of the film.  As the actors do their thing each innovative transition gracefully moves you from room to room and scene to scene and you are right there with them. Because of this effect you are infinitely more invested in what's happening because it is as though there is never a moment to naturally blink.\nThe Acting - Actors are good memorizing lines. Though too often dialogue feels like just that, a memorized line.  The filming style of this movie (super long takes with complicated behind the scenes choreography) purposely left in 'mistakes' in the dialogue. But in reality everyone stumbles, repeats, stutters, etc. when speaking in everyday life.  The actors in this movie, and within the play within the movie, really do seem like they are just improvising everything, speaking normally, and it comes across as really real. There's no other way to put it, it's as though you are watching real life. Even the outlandish moments, like Michael Keaton's fantasies, are believable because the world created by the non cutting fluid camera moves refuses to pull you out of the story.\nThe Music - It is sparse consisting almost entirely of jazz drumming. And it fits perfectly. Enough said.\nConclusion - The performances truly are Academy Award deserving (See the Emma Stone and Michael Keaton scene where they discuss using drugs). The cinematography is so engaging you simply cannot get away from the story if you want to. This movie is an example to all other movies on how to almost force an audience to like your movie; by making an overall bland story interesting with phenomenal acting, 'in real life' camera work, and the 'less is more' mantra repeated throughout every aspect of the film.",

The women (with the exception of Emma Stone) were pretty much cardboard characters, and there is a pointless scene between two of them that goes nowhere, and at times,  it plays coy and overly clever.

Emmanuel Lubezki is one of the best cinematographers in Hollywood and he should continue working and experimenting with his fellow Mexican directors. Birdman is visually astonishing and one of the most unforgettable moviegoing experiences of the year. He blew us away last year when he took us to space in Gravity, and now he astonishes audiences once again by giving us the illusion that the film is taking place entirely in one single shot. From the opening shot, Lubezki is letting us know that we are going to get our heads spun and so he circles around a table with four actors discussing their roles in the play they are about to act in. Birdman is unlike any other film I've seen in that sense, where you feel like you are watching actors in a live theater. The audience becomes the camera which follows around these egocentric and troubled actors as they interact with one another. The film has stuck with me and it is one of those rare movies I'd like to experience once again in the theaters.

He also uses dark and satirical humor to critique egocentric Hollywood actors, critics, artists, and even audiences who eat up anything they are served as long as there are loud explosions and non-stop action scenes. Iñarritu takes a shot at just about everyone.\nAlexander Dinelaris's script was wickedly smart and satirical with some great and memorable dialogues that complement the technical achievements of the film very well. Birdman has a lot to say about our human nature and our desperation to become relevant and important. It is a complete film that deserves all the recognition and awards it has been receiving.\n\nThe performances in Birdman also stand out above most films released this year. Michael Keaton is fantastic as Riggan Thomson, a once popular actor who starred in a superhero franchise but hasn't been able to do anything relevant since. He is known for the character of Birdman, but he wants to prove he is a real artist and not just a washed up celebrity. That is why he is risking everything in a play he is directing, writing, producing, and starring in. His good friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is co-producing the play with him. Lesley (Naomi Watts), Laura (Andrea Riseborough), and Mike (Edward Norton) are the actors he hires for the play, while his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is working for him as his personal assistant as she tries to recover from her former drug addictions. The supporting cast is excellent in this film, especially Edward Norton and Emma Stone who share several great scenes together along with Michael Keaton. Galifianakis also impresses in a much more serious role than what we are used to seeing him in, but this is still Keaton's film who displays a wide range of emotions. Birdman has become such an important part of his life that he actually interacts with him in a surreal way. The film balances this magical realism very well and Keaton pulls off the feat of having these inner conversations with himself. The intimate camerawork only enhances these performances even more.",

But for the unfortunate one that never had such a dream in his life, this part was completely misunderstood, it was just the delirium of a poor one. \nIn the end, after Rigan jumps out the window of his hospital room, somebody feels he was, at last, able to fly. I am rather on the side of who believes he died, smashed on the ground under the window, his doughter smiles because he is, at last, free from his obsessions, at the cost of his life.\nWell, that feeling of the first group makes of Birdman a great movie.

He is not sure what is real and what is not real based on the fact that the truth is buried deep within a chaotic whirlwind of perceptions. And this is exactly how the movie plays. You are never quite sure as to really where things stand for our anti-hero except he is psychologically on a sinking ship. We know this from the very beginning. The screenplay keeps the audience off balance as we try to unravel the puzzle as the camera weaves through a maze of illusion and reality. It is perfect that this plays out in an actual theatre, because illusion exists on stage and also within the psyches that quite can't see beyond oblivion. Michael Keaton plays the actor beautifully and we see a truth in his disintegration. Is he his past career which has disappeared or is there an ability to make sense of  his being. Ably supported by Naomi Watts as a fellow actress, Ed Norton an upstart, New York actor who is full of himself, and Emma Stone as the actor's daughter that can't quite see beyond the veil of her twelve step program. Hollywood is playfully skewered. This is the twenty first century All About Eve, but for a man. Existential cinematography that has long shots makes the dream seamless. To say that this is perfection, would be an overstatement. It pokes fun at the masses, the press, and our trivial way to delude ourselves. Yet it is fascinating nonetheless.",

It was her character who said the most interesting lines. Her rant at her father sums up the idea of the movie pretty well. And the ending is beautiful. The movie is quite original and definitely has talent inside. I just didn't like it more than that. I guess I must be tired of Hollywood (or Broadway) gazing at its navel.",

While I appreciate the effort taken to build up each scene, not enough of the film was spent dissecting and evolving Riggan Thompson's alter ego. While Emma Stone might've thought her role was meant to be portrayed as minimalist she could've added a lot more meat to her character. The director blew a very clear cut opportunity to take the human form aka Riggan Thompson and transform him into the psyche that was playing on his mind aka Birdman.

And unfortunately for me I suck when it comes to going to films with no expectations. I just had to read all the reviews, watch the trailer twenty times and so on. And nine times out of ten it damages my enjoyment of the film.\n\nActor Riggan Thomson is most famous for his movie role from over twenty years ago of the comic book superhero Birdman in the blockbuster movie of the same name and its two equally popular sequels. His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story.\n\nBirdman is just about as good as everyone is saying, which is praise worthy in itself. First thing to talk about is the direction by Alejandro González Iñárritu, no sorry, rather Emmanuel Lubeski, who is without doubt the best DP working today and here he delivers his finest achievement. This is any cinematographers wet dream.\n\nIt was originally Alejandro's plan to shoot the film in one seamless take. And if you know anything about filmmaking you will understand that is near on impossible. I say 'near impossible' because remarkably it has been pulled of before. Back in 2002 director Aleksandr Sokurov pulled this off managing to shoot his 99 minute film, Russian Ark, in one take without any cuts at all. Birdman, in my opinion does something just as impressive.\n\nWhat director Iñárritu, DP Lubezki and editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise have done here is to shoot a series of long takes and masterfully blend them together creating, what appears, is one seamless take. If you're a film fanatic like myself you will probably pick upon where they might have cut but it's very hard to notice unless you're really paying attention to the logistics of the thing.\n\nIn a way this could be seen as a flaw in that the film's technical achievements could be used as a tool to distract you from the fact that film's storyline isn't as polished as its surface. But Birdman does a fine job in telling its story so I don't think it's too much of problem, other than maybe a few characters feeling underwritten. The acting in the film is first rate, everyone does superbly in their respective roles especially the man everyone's shouting about, Michael Keaton. What a comeback! My god.\n\nThe score is great which is entirely percussion based, really original and goes brilliantly with the film. I can't say it's the best film of the year but it's certainly up there. Birdman is a real achievement.",

Much of the film is made of long, continuous camera shots that follow Keaton around as he tries to make this show his comeback from painful obscurity as a has-been celebrity. He also tries to make amends with his neglected family. The camera keeps rolling while following him around like a documentary but with minimal shaking, as he runs from from person to person and challenge to challenge. The ending leaves some room for interpretation, but whatever you conclude, this is definitely a journey through the psychological affects of being famous (at one time). It has some bizarre moments where we sometimes cross over into the mind apart from reality without any flag to mark reality and fantasy. It's not the standard fun flick, it has some dry humor to give it a lighthearted feel. is notably creative, well-acted, and gives deep characters that altogether present a commentary on the highs and lows of being a celebrity.",

            "content": "In \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" former Batman star Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a has-been actor who used to play a superhero named Birdman in three successful Hollywood blockbusters. Now he aims to gain respect and recognition on Broadway, directing and starring in an adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".\n\nThe film follows Riggan through a painstaking process of rehearsals and drama both behind and in front of the curtain. He stars with his girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and Broadway newcomer Lesley (Naomi Watts). One of his actors gets injured and has to be replaced on the spot by Mike (Edward Norris), a volatile but ingenious character actor of bigger fame than Riggan himself. Mike is also sleeping with Lesley, how else. Creative differences and conflict abound when two special egos collide. The play's producer, Riggan's lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is desperately trying to hold the production together. Among all the action is Riggan's teenaged daughter and current assistant Sam (Emma Stone), freshly out of rehab.\n\nRiggan hears the voice of Birdman in his head. He uses supernatural powers of telekinesis on objects- only when he is by himself. The pressure to create something meaningful begins to overtake him. A deconstruction of his fragile psyche seems imminent. But he has so much to say. He needs to create, but does he have it in him?\n\nThis is the fifth feature from art house favorite Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu. I have found all of his movies fascinating, but often a bit tedious. \"Babel\" was especially dragging, if accomplished. I was from the start pleasantly surprised by the intensity of \"Birdman\". It's a mixture of drama, comedy and magical realism, all of which work together perfectly. But the experience that is this movie runs deeper and captivates absolutely.\n\nTheater is always an interesting setting but here it's being utilized in its fullest capacity. The film is shot as if with one take like an evolved version Hitchcock's masterful \"The Rope\", the camera floats completely free as a bird, following the characters through the maze-like structure of the theater, relieving the viewer from an otherwise claustrophobic experience of the location. The picture never cuts, nor does the storytelling. \"Birdman\" film is a lot about dialog, and who says what and especially where in the setting is crucial; the theatre is like a Freudian interpretation of the movie's- or maybe Riggan's- psyche which we get to explore.\n\nAnd then there's the atmosphere. We are definitely working somewhere within the subconscious. The subtly surreal reality of the movie borrows from the greatest works of Woody Allen, David Cronenberg and Martin Scorsese, but stands on its own. The script reflects Raymond Carver in just the right way, considering. The actors are all superb, the Broadway a character in itself. The soundtrack is a showcase of minimalism, an occasional jazzy drum solo elevates key scenes, telling us that we are experiencing a deeper level of the dreamscape whose symbols we are invited to decipher.\n\n\"Birdman\" is magic. It's unique, seductive and special, a masterpiece that confirms Iñárritu as not only a talented but genius filmmaker.",

Michael Keaton (Riggan) as the protagonist, he is seriously impressive here. He's having this wild imagination with an imaginary friend like he is bothered nor struggled at times, and he wants to prove, he's not just a celebrity, but a stage actor. He wants to prove how he's good at it. Edward Norton as Mike, he is more of an asshole, like he does that for the better. I really dig Emma Stone's performance in here, and she feels for it. And special mention to Zack. I mean, I never though he can do one of these roles. He is a smart-assy type of lawyer and he's good at it. This is a well scripted, and with brilliant performances.

Everyone can see that it's naked, but they're all afraid to say that it's naked for fear that the people standing next to them will say they don't \"get it\". \n\nWell, I'm sorry, but I don't get it. Not because it's too deep, or surreal, or because of all the long tracking shots with drummers inexplicably in the middle of the scene, but because there's no actual substance here. There's a lot of muddling about, a lot of self-reflection and even a little grandstanding, but in the end the characters have not become any more fleshed-out, the story hasn't moved in any particular direction, and the audience is being dared to not like the movie. By inserting the evil critic character and the scene immediately following her comparison of  \"celebrity versus Actor\", the movie essentially says, \"if you don't like this piece of high art, then you're just a heathen who likes Michael Bay movies.\" \n\nWell, I'm neither. Michael Bay is horrible, but \"Birdman\" is bland.\n\nWhile I can say that every actor gives a fantastic performance, I can also say they're not actually DOING anything in those performances. Their characters are made of particle board. The plot is thin-to-nonexistent. The \"message\" is nothing special. The moral never comes into focus. \n\nI'm telling you: It's okay not to like \"Birdman\". Really. It's okay not to \"get it\". You're still cool, and you're not making yourself look foolish or unhip. There's nothing to \"get\" here. It's just a big ball of directorial ego wrapped in brown paper. \n\nMark Twain said a \"classic\" is \"A book which people praise and don't read.\" Well, I predict \"Birdman\" will become a classic in that vein. It will be a movie that people praise, but don't actually, deep-down, enjoy. However, because the movie flat-out tells people that not liking it means you're a schlock-loving peasant, people will maintain the dissimulation.",

            "content": "Birdman is a bit of a strange film in that I both liked it and disliked it simultaneously.  It tells the story of Michael Keaton who plays a washed up actor trying to make it big with his broadway play.  His daughter treats him like an asshole, his costar kind of IS an asshole, and his attempt to reinvent himself seems to be failing.  \n\nThe film tells the story linearly, but in a way where time jumps forward without any specific indication.  The camera work is fluid, relying on a constant long-take approach facilitated by steadicam and giving the film a dream-like quality.  The acting is quite brilliant, with Galifinakis, Stone, and Norton really standing out in my opinion.   The soundtrack is also fantastic, featuring some really groovy jazz tracks and some brilliant classical tracks including Ravel's Pavane (a personal favorite).  So why do I dislike the film?  Well...  \n\nThe subject matter is, in my opinion, fairly shallow.  There's a lot of emphasis on some deeper spiritual/philosophical meaning that feels patched together rather than properly explored.  The long-take steadicam work is well done, but I found it unnecessary and distracting, waiting for cuts instead of paying attention to the film.  Everyone in the film is barely relateable, coming across as shallow and self-absorbed.  The film strives to be surrealistic, a style I love a lot, but something about the combination of elements made this film feel like it was using surrealism as a crutch to obfuscate the otherwise thin story.  \n\nTL;DR - 5/10\nI'm probably going to be crucified for my review, but that's fine.  This film is simultaneously great and horrible, but that doesn't mean you won't end up really enjoying it.  I highly recommend checking it out at least once to get your own opinion, because although I'm not the film's biggest fan, I do consider it a worthwhile film, especially in today's relatively shit cinematic landscape.",

            "content": "While innovative director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us many brilliant films before, this is the first time he's delved into the genre of comedy, that too black comedy. His ambitious attempt to make the movie appear to be shot in one seamless motion for most of it (with the help of numerous retakes and proper edits) certainly works to the movie's advantage; it makes us a part of the lead protagonist's (Thomas Riggan's) inescapable reality, much like life. But more importantly, it takes us into the mind of the director himself.\n\nIn a bird's eye view, the film may appear to be a critique on the ever-growing trend of superhero movies, and the politics of show business in general. But essentially, it's a satire on human traits like ego and ambition, our constant search and struggle to feel relevant and important in this world; many of us forsake everything else in order to achieve this. We can see this through Riggan's character, who is conflicted between the once-achieved stardom through his Birdman movies and his present, where he is adapting the work of an author (Carver) because of whom he became an actor in the first place. Birdman vs Carver - On one side, we have Birdman, which gained him the love and affection of audiences worldwide, and on the other side, we have Raymond Carver, which represents the kind of intellectual work which usually gets critical acclaim. So, he is stuck between the two, internally struggling to decide which one to choose; he ambitiously wants the love of both audiences and critics alike.\n\nOther than being a black comedy, the movie also falls into the genre of Magical Realism (movies like 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Life of Pi', 'Midnight in Paris'). Riggan keeps hearing this voice speaking to him, and can perform telekinesis and levitation whenever he wants. This Birdman is just the personification of his inner ego and the larger-than-life image he once had; Riggan wants to soar through the sky. And ego's personification here (Birdman) draws parallels to Icarus (who flew too close to the sun with wings made of feathers and wax).\n\nOther than the amazing screenplay, the dialogues are the film's biggest strength; they are sharp-witted and hilarious, and form the backbone of the film. After that, it's brilliant performances given by Michael Keaton and Edward Norton; they are pure delight to watch. Zach Galifianakis also does a good job, and the four ladies (Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan) look and perform terrific. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work and Antonio Sanchez's drum score certainly help the movie feel like it does. Without Lubezki's assistance, the apparent single shot feat couldn't have been achieved; the movie looks spectacular.\n\nIt's interesting to notice how many of the actors have association with superhero movies; Keaton was Tim Burton's Batman (this is what makes his character self-referential), Norton was the Incredible Hulk, and Stone was Gwen Stacy in the contemporary Spiderman series. On top of that, we see that Riggan's character has many similarities with the character Ed he's playing in the stage play within the movie. And the few aspects of Ed's life which aren't there in Riggan's life become fulfilled towards the second half of the movie. All these parallels help in blurring the lines between fiction and reality, which makes the movies quite psychotic, and at the same time, fascinating.\n\nOverall, the movie tackles with so many captivating themes that a simple review like mine is not enough to discuss all of them. All I can say is, for people who get what the director is going for, the movie is sure to stay etched in their minds for a long time, and forms an important topic for many round-table discussions. 'Birdman' is a mesmerizing experience not to be missed by ardent movie lovers.\n\n-------------------------SPOILERS-------------------------\n\nPeople who might be left confused by ending - We see Riggan get up from his bed and getting onto the window. Then, we see his daughter Sam coming into the room, looking outside the window. She looks up and smiles. The movie ends there.\n\nMy interpretation is: No, Riggan didn't jump off the window and try to kill himself again. We don't see him jumping, we just see him standing there. Maybe he was just enjoying the view of the city (world) with his new-found perspective. He's done with the inner struggle, his mind is at peace now, and his act got him the feeling of relevance he craved for, so there's no need to kill himself. When Sam looks out the window, she looks up and smiles; this is when Riggan's metaphoric fantasy meets Sam's physical reality. Sam sees him flying and soaring through the sky. All this time, Riggan was the only one who was in these delusions of fantasy. He had the larger-that-life image 20 years ago, when he was popular with his Birdman movies. Sam was too young at that time. Now with the new-found fame and acclaim all around, Sam finally sees him the way he has always seen himself - as the majestic hero soaring above everyone.",

            "content": "\"Birdman\" directed by Alenjandro Gonzalez is a mixture of masterful film making with tremendous performance from Michael Keaton , Edward Norton and Emma Stone. The picture got some other stellar performances but we will come to that later.To begin with MIchael Keaton has given one of his career best performances with a single word - \"Range\" . That was one hell of a mixture of comedy to extreme drama without a sense of getting over the top. You could literally hide that character in mask and get the same viscous performance one would imagine. The supporting performance of Edward Norton was brilliant and for a moment during the first act of the film I thought Norton was giving a stellar performance but the most under appreciated performance will probably be Emma Stone but she was right at the heart of the picture. There were many things to make this film work and it required Emma Stone's character to tie them at many places and she nailed. Now when you get stellar performances from your great cast and mix that with one sensational edit which makes this film play out as a play. That is a very subtle metaphor to execute and for that the director and the writer Alenjandro needs to be praised. Not only did he bring out tremendous performances from the main cast but he tied them together along with the editor and presented the whole picture as a play with three acts. Much of what I appreciate about the directing skills is because of that. The screenplay on it's own however lacked a bit of \"special\" to make it all great and it by itself did not have the quality of exuding emotions if one were to read it. It's a brilliant one but it does contain some unnecessary scenes specially when one considers it as a character based drama. So if that would have been tightened the review would have all stars. The music needs to be appreciated and not just the composing of it but the application of it which is why the director along with the composer must be praised . The music does tell a story and not just an underlying factor. But the real star of the picture and it's quite obvious from the look of it is Lubezski. Again the director requires recognition for shot composition but the way the cinematography morphed the story was brilliant. You can consider this 2 hour picture as one long shot and that applicability was brilliant. The lights and the focus of it all was done through the cinematography. It is one of the rare occasion that the cinematography brings out a brilliant performance of the actors. It reflected the whole story. This mexican pcokethouse is actually one of the greatest if not the greatest cinematographer of this era. Everything about that art was brilliant and we don't know whose choice it was but it was seamless.",

Michael Keaton is great in the lead role as a very human middle-age actor in need of renewal. The music is unique too.. it's not Gustavo Santaolalla this time, but it's just lots of minimalist sounds - brushsticks on snare drums and hi hats; evoking the flow and taking the viewer from one room to another.

Being mentioned for and receiving awards, curiosity got the best of me. Should have went with my gut. \n     Forget the acting. Yes, you can have great acting in a bad movie. Will Smith in Six Degrees of Separation comes to mind. Nobody stands out that much in Birdman to make it worth seeing. There is a moment of an entertaining movie here and there buried beneath all the gibberish, but not enough to keep me entertained for 2 hours. That's right: TWO HOURS! \n     If you take actors seriously, and think their lives that go from multi-millionaire to person trying to get it all back after squandering it is interesting, by all means, this movie is for you. \n     Birdman doesn't make you feel sorry for the lead. It doesn't make him a likable person. He's not even a very insightful guy. He's merely a man who's been so wrapped up in himself for such a long time, that now that everything is collapsing, is having something of a breakdown. It's a selfish douche, his screwed up daughter (surprise), a jerk of a critic (unique), a broadway douchey actor (there's plenty of them), and a cast of low self esteem people ranting about nothing, and I mean nothing, important, for TWO HOURS. Then cap it off with a stupid ending. Aaaand curtain. It's not worth seeing at any point, in my opinion.",

            "content": "I'm Birdman! Wait, Crayola Steve is Birdman. Oh wait that's Michael Keaton, wait Michael Keaton was Batman, what the heck is going on here! My review of Birdman right now.\n\nBirdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is directed and written by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Michael Keaton, Zach Galifiankis, Edward Norton and Emma Stone and tells the story of Riggan Thomas, who in the 1980s played the popular superhero Birdman. Now he is a washed up actor trying to gain success once more by directing, writing and staring in his broadway play. But things are complicated Riggan begins to hear the voice of Birdman.\n\nBirdman is a holy original and masterful piece of work from Alejandro G. Iñárritu. This features the best ensemble cast of 2014, some of the best editing I've ever seen and is one of the best movies of 2014. If you get the chance to see it, don't miss out.\n\nThere's been a lot of Oscar buzz surrounding Michael Keaton's performance and oh my god does he deserve it! Michael Keaton is at his absolute best in this movie and is perfectly casted. He pretty much plays himself since in the 80s he played Batman and in this movie he played Birdman. It's almost a spoof and it works so great. Keaton here plays a very wounded, sad character who might or might not be losing his mind. In the quiet moment is where Keaton is able to shine and show off his acting chops, something I haven't seen in a very long time. This is one of the best performances of 2014 and he's the frontrunner to win the Oscar for sure!\n\nIn supporting roles are Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifiankis. Norton plays Mike Shiner, a method actor who comes on the set of the play and begins to cause some major problems in the production. He is so freaking great in this movie. He basically plays a parody of himself, Norton in real life was been known to have a temper and hard to work with (he got fired from The Incredible Hulk). His interaction with Michael Keaton is some of the best chemistry I've seen in a while since they don't ever see eye to eye. He definitely deserves his Oscar nomination without a doubt. \n\nThen Emma Stone gives the best performance of her career as Riggan's daughter, Sam. She is this rebel character who isn't the best working with people. Her chemistry with Keaton is out of control, they work so well together but it's the scenes she shares with Edward Norton where she truly shines. Stone is one of the best actresses working right now, she and proves it in this movie. And holy crap Zach Galifiankis is freaking great in a small role of Riggan's agent.\n\nBut all credit has to be given to the director of the film. His direction here is so strong. He creates the illusion that this movie is just one log continuous shot. A lot of the movie was shot in ridiculous long takes and with amazing editing, it looks like it's all shot in one whole take. It adds to the feeling of the film. Characters are constantly moving around the stage, front and back and you get this sense of what it's like in these small halls. The camera moving right in front of them or moving in the back of them at all times it was absolutely immersive. Though you can tell where some of the parts were cut for the next scene, it's still amazing to see these characters moving around.\n\nAnd the screenplay, oh my god, the screenplay is brilliant. It's completely original in every sort of way, I've never seen a movie like this before. This movie actually a lot to say about hollywood. It tells and shows you everything that's wrong with hollywood today. It mentions big stars like Robert Downey Jr., and Woody Harrelson so we know they are living in the year 2014. It mocks people who just go to see big blockbusters for the action and visual effects and my personal favorite, what's wrong with critics. There's a reason I don't like being called a critic and the movie tells you why. Some critics don't even watch the movie, they just want to find big or professional words to slap on a DVD cover. They don't even look at the structure, performances, or meaning of anything it's just an easy way to get money. This was my favorite aspect of the movie.\n\nThe music is also great, I loved the score in this movie. It's a very jazzy score with drums playing for the most part. At times you actually see the man playing the drums in various scenes and that was awesome as well.\n\nI'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this movie is nearly perfect. It really is. The performances are great, the directing is great, the editing is nearly perfect and the script is even better than those. Birdman would have completely been on my best of 2014 video because:\n\nBirdman gets an A+.",

The show's previews are a disaster, despite the presence of wunder-kind Mike (Edward Norton) to share his stage, and Riggan struggles with the challenges of both the production and keeping a grip on reality. Birdman is an impressive visual journey. Though the story is a bit bonkers at time, it is also very interesting and the performances are quite compelling, especially that of Edward Norton. Its editing ensues that that it almost appears as one single take, which is simultaneously compelling and distracting. ] Intellectually, it explores the nature of celebrity with its tongue-in-cheek casting and commentary, however, there is also much about the role of theatrical art.",

That man is Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton), an aging Hollywood star who struck success with a series of superhero films (he was Birdman).  Now, he is trying to redeem himself by writing and directing a version of a Raymond Carver short story for Broadway - but everything is falling apart, himself included.  That's the plot, briefly, but it is difficult to convey the force with which director Iñárritu and the cast throw everything at the viewer.  As the camera glides along, so too do various ideas and associations get thrust into your stream of consciousness. Sure, we think about Keaton as an ex-superhero whose career is winding down and Norton as a possibly intense and difficult to work with asshole.  But questions of truth, performance, reality, and fantasy (not to mention problematic psychological breaks) are never far from the forefront.  Shot in a month with incredibly long takes and then edited in two weeks (if I've got my facts right), the result is nothing short of amazing.  Keaton impresses as a man just barely holding on (to everything) and Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, Andrea Riseborough, and Zach Galifianakis manage to keep the emotional intensity of the picture at a fever pitch in support.  And just when you thought there was no way to end the picture without copping out, Iñárritu teases the audience with numerous possibilities and manages one that works.  A tour de force.",

            "content": "Birdman is an odd mixture of psychedelic introversion and hard bitten reality, vacillating wildly between the two states without really giving you time to adjust. Broadway actor and director Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is living in the past, man, or rather the past in the form of a giant hallucinatory birdman is living in him. Once upon a time, he used to be said Birdman, star of three epic superhero films and Gen X darling of the screen. Now, that's history and he can't come to terms with it. Who could when there's a giant bird living in your head?\n\nThis film drags you with gritty realism through the dressing rooms and back streets of New York's world of theatre, most of it not very pretty at all and much of it produced in what seems to be one long documentary-style, follow-me-with-the-camera-as-I-do-whatever-it-is-I'm-doing take. Which is clearly impossible to manage without careful scripting and repeated efforts to get it right, but that's obviously how it's meant to feel. It's on the 'live' stage, however, that the film's most compelling moments occur. The acting is delivered with an intensely manic vibe and features some gruelling interaction between Keaton, Ed Norton and Naomi Watts, with some equally powerful backstage dramatic scenes involving those three plus the likes of Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis.\n\nFor me, the most resonant chord echoing powerfully throughout the film is the metatextual, unspoken comment on Keaton's own career. After his unforgettable performance as Beetlejuice in 1988, Keaton agreed to play Batman in the following year's eponymous film, once again under the direction of Tim Burton. He reprised the role in 1992's 'Batman Returns' and was meant to appear as the Dark Knight for a third time in 1995's 'Batman Forever'. But Burton was dropped as director for that project and Keaton followed him through the exit door...and has never been seen again in anything remotely important. Until now, that is. Clearly, Birdman = Batman, in case you needed the dots joined for you.\n\nThis is a film that is really two stories in one. On the surface, it's an abrasive account of the shallowness and superficiality that pervades professional theatre, of the massive egos that occupy its spaces, of the dizzying highs and the terrifying lows that come with the territory, of the bitterness and bewilderment of once having been someone and now being no one. Beneath that, though, it's the story of a man with something that lives deep within him, defining him and only emerging slowly as the film progresses, rising eventually and powerfully from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix. The final scene, in which Sam Thomson (Stone) rushes to the window to look for her father, looking down to where his earthly body clearly lies then looking up to where his alter-ego has evidently taken flight, all without showing us anything but the emotions that pass across her captivating face, is simplicity, brilliance and poignancy all rolled into one.\n\nBirdman deserves to win several Oscars later this month, and it is nominated for nine. There is some stiff competition, as always, but I'm hoping that Michael Keaton, at least, can pull off the big one after a much vaunted career of frustrations that spans my entire adult life. He is a superb actor and this is a superb film.",

Scene transitions are so seamless that the whole movie seems to be one long shot by a single camera. I found myself suddenly realizing the story had move ahead in time, sometime minutes, sometimes hours or sometimes weeks. That was amazing. \n\nI found it disturbing that the film so accurately captured how it feels to be teetering on the ragged edge of sanity where it is hard to tell the difference between real and unreal. I had the unfortunate experience of having an Adderall  prescription for ADHD that sent me to place like that. Unlike the character in the story, I knew I was in trouble and didn't believe the unreal things I saw and held on 5 long days for the medicine to wear off. This movie brought back that terrible experience in realistic detail. So, if you want to know what it feels like to go crazy, this is the film for you.\n\nOn the surface this seems like an old story - the comeback of a forgotten hero - but it is made fresh in a new and interesting way. The acting is spectacular too with truly gifted actors giving their very best performances.\n\nI think this movie will win the Oscar, not because it is entertaining to the general public, but because it is a revolutionary movie in the movie industry. This could be a new \"Citizen Kane.\" \n\nHowever, I think the average moviegoer will not like it. If your preference in movies runs in the categories of action, romance or family friendly then stay away.",

It also works as a social satire, fantasy and unique look into the workings of a Broadway play. It has one of the best ensemble casts of the year and is filmed in a way like no other movie you've seen.\n\nIt is a comeback piece for long-forgotten actor Michael Keaton ?who plays Riggan Thomson, a washed up actor who was once famous for playing a superhero called Birdman in the early 1990s (which makes it seem as Keaton is playing himself) who is attempting a comeback directing and starring in a Broadway play with the movie's events unraveling in the days leading up to the play's opening night. Riggan is a borderline-crazy, haunted soul dreading his existence and battling his own ego and alter ego Birdman (who speaks in a deep voice reminiscent to Batman). \n\nThe movie is a great acting showcase particularly for Keaton in the kind of flashy comeback role that critics and Oscar voters love. My favorite performance from the movie, however, has to be Edward Norton in a very different performance as Mike an eccentric last minute replacement actor who gives Riggan the run for his money. He always seems the utterly crazy one in Riggan's presence. Emma Stone is also good but for the most part true to her form as Riggan's former junkie daughter who is also his assistant. Her performance is elevated only by a long monologue where she preaches her dad. Cast also includes an almost unrecognizable Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's lawyer and best friend, Naomi Watts as an actress making her Broadway debut who is Norton's love interest, Andrea Riseborough as another actress who is Riggan's girlfriend and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife. Watts and Riseborough's characters feel at times awash in the movie's midst and are somewhat underdevelopment especially with a mid-movie plot development involving the two ladies - that's probably the movie's only quibble.  \n\nThe movie is a landmark achievement for director Alejandro González Iñárritu (\"Amores Perros\", \"21 Grams\", \"Babel\") with the movie shot in a way as if it is all one unedited continuous take (kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki right off his Oscar for \"Gravity\" last year, which really works well with the movie. ? The drum-based soundtrack by Antonio Sanchez is also groundbreaking and suits the film's vibe perfectly. It is shame the Academy didn't deem it eligible due to it sampling some classical music. And then there's that movie's final shot that keeps you thinking. Nominated for 9 Oscars: Picture, Director, Actor (Keaton), Supporting Actor (Norton), Supporting Actress (Stone), Original Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing.",

Great credit goes to director Alejandro González Iñárritu who really put together an altogether new type of film to tell a dark comedic narrative.  Michael Keaton being cast as Riggan Thompson was inspired, who could possible connect closer to this role than the man who played Batman twice?  describing the real nature of the film and its appeal, one has to recognize who the TRUE audience of this film is.  No question about it, this is a film for actors and people in the entertainment industry.  The average person who doesn't act on stage or film can get a glimpse at some of the narcissistic traits of the principles in this film, but it isn't really a film for everyone.  It has a lot of great parts to it, but what the film fails to do is truly set up a protagonist you really want to root for.  Ed Norton plays a character who is both scene stealing and undeniably unlikeable.  But each of the principle performers are given an opportunity to shine.  Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Norton, Keaton, even Galifianakis, they all have very great scenes to show their tremendous skill.  The film asks a few industry questions to stew on, like the conflict between the art and the celebrity. Understandably such a film was well received in its industry.  But film maker navel gazing doesn't necessarily resonate with the average person.  The film is a solid R film, not family entertainment.  As a dark comedy it is not laugh out loud funny, but still a solid work worthy of some acclaim.  A singular piece, I doubt you'll see another film like it.",

But once I got used to it I really enjoyed the uniqueness. \n\nEmma Stone is very likeable but is essentially a giant pair of eyes on legs which when typed out looks super scary! Imagine giant eyes on legs....actually that's a Great idea for a horror! Don't steal! Trademarked phil!!! \n\nThe ending was disappointing, not because I didn't understand, or because it even fell flat, I just felt the film deserved better in a weird way!  Still a great watch....I think.....yeah it was",

            "content": "Michael Keaton playing an actor who at one point was at the top of the box office in his role in one of the original superhero movies, is so close to reality that it has to be more than a coincidence. This was a  conscious decision on the part of director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, to cast the man who played the original (modern day) Batman and basically kicked off the Super Hero blockbuster genre. And I love that Keaton did it, being so derivative of his own life. \nWith a star studded cast, everybody brought their A game to Birdman. Edward Norton plays a pretentious broadway actor, and a dick, as he tends to do so well and does again here. But you can't help but like him. Emma Stone is probably one of the only chicks out their that can make looking like a drug riddled skank look so good, and turns in a sterling performance here as Keaton's daughter, Sam. Then of course Michael Keaton is just fantastic in his role as Riggan, aka Birdman. I love the way Keaton's brain looks like it is ticking over as you see his character trying to deal and understand with the problems of running a broadway show and facing his own self doubts. He is deservedly up for an Oscar in this role. \nBut probably the most impressive thing about this movie, is the way that it is shot. Made to look like the entire movie is all one continuous take (save a few time lapses here and there) the cinematography and directing is just flat out unbelievable. I have never seen anything like this, and for a style that could potentially make things feel slower, Inarritu instead brings a fast paced energy with his well choreographed shots. Scenes seamlessly blending in and out of each other as the players come and go, highlighting how stressful things are becoming. If this doesn't own Best Cinematography at the Oscars, I will be dumbfounded. And I like that it hasn't been a selling point for the film, normally movies that take the 'one shot' approach use it as a gimmick and the story lacks for it. Bit that is definitely not the case here. With a spectacular script, Birdman is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's ambiguous ending may have a few people scratching their heads, but I like it. It's one of those endings, not unlike Prisoners or Inception that will make for great conversations as people compare their own interpretations of it.\nYou must see this in cinemas. \n\n4.5/5\n\n 'You aren't doing this for the art, you're doing this to feel relevant again' - Sam",

I love her dearly but her role in this is so small its quite laughable she is up for a nomination in a supporting role. \n\nI think it may still be a top-three front runner for Best Picture. Having seen Boyhood and Whiplash, two movies I rated 9/10, this is a distant third in my books. Whiplash was just great. Boyhood was stunning in that it had that gimmick about the 12 years and it was actually moving. Birdman has its own gimmick: the one-take shot thing. It looks as though the entire movie was shot in one take. I thought it an unnecessary and detrimental gimmick, but reading up, I guess the emphasis was that theater is one take so they did this movie about theater with the \"one take.\" Bleh. I thought it made it less interesting. \n\nSo I really don't see what's great about this at all. Not as a best picture, leading male role, supporting male role, supporting female role, screenplay, or sound mixing...those drums were so terribly annoying.

            "content": "Birdman is narcissistic. In a fit of self-righteousness, it has decided to eschew current trends, scorn social media, and travail constantly towards being \"real.\" In its mind, the film is a martyr, a revolutionist standing up for what needs to be said. It seems to think that saying something loud enough and long enough constitutes taking a brave, bold stand. In reality, the film is simply a regurgitation of popular nonconformist sentiments. The filmmakers aren't fighting for the current state of entertainment, they are fighting for Birdman. In turn, the film is arrogant, egotistical, pretentious, heavy-handed, self-centered, abrasive, and in the end, to use a label that Riggan Thomson hates, lackluster.\n\nLackluster is the last thing the filmmakers of Birdman were attempting to accomplish. The film couldn't be any more in your face. The cinematography by the unparalleled Emmanuel Lubezki is, well, unparalleled. There isn't a single other DP in the business who can do what Lubezki does with such precision. The film is shot to look like one continuous take, an accomplishment that is very impressive indeed. But much like the film itself, it's technically stunning but ultimately distracting and empty. I get the reasoning behind the camera work, in an attempt to merge the worlds of film and stage, one shot more accurately symbolizes the theatre. But it does not service the best interest of the story. It proves noticeably distracting. Instead of \"making you feel like you're actually there,\" the technique ushers in a certain level of detachment. I didn't feel like I was present during the film, I just felt like I was being dragged along for the bumpy ride. But of course, director Alejandro González Iñárritu would prefer to incapacitate his audience with over-the-top filmmaking techniques to hide the fact that Birdman is a cold and haughty film, almost entirely devoid of human emotions.\n\nAfter the cinematography, the performances are the film's second calling card. And once again, they are often magnificent fiascos. There is an abundance of great acting to be found here, but it is so often misplaced and ineffective. The acting in the film feels very much like the theatre. It has all the bombast of the British acting style, but little of the finesse and potency of \"the method.\" Iñárritu would much rather show Riggan thrashing around his dressing room, or Riggan and Edward Norton's Mike Shiner wrestling in their underwear, than to actually have his characters experience moments of reflection. The movie huffs and puffs and assumes that the best way to impact an audience is to scream in their face.\n\nOnce again, that's not to say that there aren't terrific performances in Birdman. Michael Keaton does some wonderful acting (the more Michael Keaton the better!), but the performance is often pointed in the wrong direction. Emma Stone does some of her best work here, with one particularly show-stopping monologue. I've been waiting for another performance from Andrea Riseborough ever since she stole the show in Oblivion, and she is a stand-out once again. Zack Galifianakis also does a wonderful job keeping his character grounded. And while I wasn't entirely a fan of the aimlessness of Mike Shiner, I am 100% in accord with those who lobby for an Oscar nomination for Ed Norton. He deserves it.\n\nI can't comprehend how anyone who earlier this year enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy could simultaneously say that they enjoy Birdman. The two films are diametrically opposed. Now, I have just as much distain for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Transformers 4 as the next guy. But I also have no patience for the bitter and broad strokes the film paints with. Once the cinematography and acting are looked past, the movie is trying to say something. The film is very much about the Hollywood/Broadway divide. The real art and acting invention of the theatre, versus the celebrity and explosions of the movies. In the most insulting and pretentious moment of the film, Iñárritu sardonically points to his audience and says, \"People? They love blood! They love action! Not this talky, philosophical bullshit.\" A comment like that applies directly to Birdman and its audience, and it is really, gratingly pompous. The movie can shake its fist at excessive superhero filmmaking all it wants, but it has absolutely nothing new to say and certainly no groundbreaking commentary to provide.\n\nOn a side note about the whole superhero thing, Birdman thinks that referencing actual current actors and movies is a stroke of brilliance, that it somehow gives the film another point on the \"masterpiece\" plane. Riggan makes note of Robert Downey Jr. making billions of dollars with Iron Man and The Avengers. And yet, the film casts Emma Stone who, obviously, played Gwen Stacy very recently. Taken a step further, Ed Norton actually shared the same cinematic universe as Downey Jr.'s Iron Man! So, if The Avengers exist in Birdman's world, then so too must The Incredible Hulk, and so too must Edward Norton. So who the heck is this Mike Shiner character? Now, I'm sure that if I liked this movie, I would love these references. It's all one big meta joke, right!? Right? ...Right.\n\nThen there is another thematic layer of Riggan himself. Throughout the film, Riggan is constantly fighting \"The Birdman,\" the personification of big Hollywood, his ego, and the very superhero movies the film detests. But in typical fashion, the movie has no idea what to say with its pulpit. Towards the end of the film, it appears as if Riggan finally gives in to the Birdman. He accepts his ability to be a movie star over toiling on the stage. Or does he? The movie quickly throws (what I understand to be) its symbolism right out the window. It feels like the film chooses each scene based on optimal Oscar bait potential, and less in adherence to plot.\n\nThe following paragraphs will contain spoilers, be warned... As the film draws to its first close, Riggan prepares for opening night of his play. In the performance's finale scene, he is supposed to shoot himself in the head (fake gun and blood, of course). Instead, Riggan decides to actually shoot himself on stage. And he does. But when he does, the film finally breaks from its continuous shot. It goes into a dream-like scene, with painfully ham-fisted symbolism. In a daze, we see a Broadway stage, but instead of actors, we see Transformers and superheroes battling it out on the stage. In the moment when Riggan shoots himself, he becomes popular, a sensation, he goes viral. In the fallout, stage and screen have merged. Riggan has spent the entire movie striving towards his perception of the legitimacy of the theatre, only to have his efforts rewarded with a \"celebrity\" style reaction. The film's ideology, once again, becomes baffling. Is Iñárritu trying to say that popularity is what's truly wrong with Hollywood? And if so, that is an infuriating mindset that completely disregards talent and craft, just because it is popular.\n\nThen there is the matter of the film's ending. There were three possible points where Iñárritu could have broke off the story. The first point would have been a daring and dramatic finish, an abrupt, thought-provoking conclusion I could definitely get behind. But the film continues on. The second ending would have been ... happier. Twisted, but still on the positive side. But yet again, the movie drags on. Instead of ending the film on one of two separate but acceptable points, the movie goes for an oh so masterful ambiguous ending. Of course, it's classic Birdman horse crap. One last shot at the half-baked symbolism that has pervaded the film.\n\nThe movie's musical score is another prominent example of the failure of Birdman. The original score, composed by jazz musician Antonio Sánchez, consists almost entirely of drums. Drumming, drumming, drumming, on and on for two hours. It's a bold idea, but in typical Birdman style, senseless and detracting. There were multiple times over the course of the film where the music noticeably makes the experience worse. Scenes of important dialogue and character introspection are ruined by aggressively intrusive crashing and pounding. Classical music is occasionally used, to much better ends than the drum score. Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2 is easily the stand-out musical cue.\n\nBirdman is, without question, the biggest disappointment of 2014. Underneath all of its crashing, screaming, and condescending, there isn't a beating heart. The film's antiquated, \"get off my lawn\" mentality towards modern media wears thin after, oh about thirty seconds. It's easy to get twitterpated by the admirable camera work, but to focus on that is a disservice to the film's thematic ambitions. Yes, the movie deserves to be examined, if only to hinder bandwagon hoppers from exalting a film that so acerbically belittles absolutely everything that is \"mainstream.\" Much like Riggan Thompson, Birdman is painfully unfunny, loud, and angry, desperately flailing about for some semblance of significance. And then it shoots itself in the head, and we have to pretend to care.\n\n\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige.\" 5/10",

            "content": "Birdman: A Smart Movie with a Stupid Ending\n\nThere is a movie making the rounds of the award shows about an actor who was last widely known for playing a famous superhero in tights. He is attempting a comeback doing something artsy, not unlike Michael Keaton in Birdman. Because it's self-reflexive, it must be FABULOUS! Well, not so much. But it is usually smart and oft entertaining. Like a piece of lesser-known theater, it has its moments. \n\nThere are some things that are fabulous in Birdman. First, the bits of magical realism throughout the film work quite well, until the ending. Second, there is Ed Norton chewing up the scenery with controlled, skillful over-acting. And last on the list of the fabulous is the jazz drumming that follows the actors as they wind their way through the maze of rooms: dressing, make-up, costumes, and through the stage rigging, the lights and other tools of the trade found backstage at a Broadway theater. \n\nThe other acting is as good as its script allows. Emma Stone is fun as Sam, Riggan's (Birdman) daughter, but her petulance becomes irksome after awhile. We fail to see one moment of genuine emotion from the character, even when showing her concern for her father. Her father, Riggan, is played adequately by Michael Keaton, but the famous actor down-on-his-luck schtick is tiresome. Riggan takes himself so seriously that he is a bore. Somehow, I believe that was NOT the intent of the director/writer Iñárritu. \n\nNaomi Watts is adequate, but her character's lines about trying to \"make it on Broadway\" were repeated too many times for me to care. It wasn't so much her acting that annoyed me, her hackneyed and out of place dialogue. If she improvised them, well, then it was her acting. \n\nZach Galifianakis was surprisingly not the most annoying one in the movie this time. He plays the straight man, the producer of the play, to counterbalance all the lunacy of the actors. He keeps it together and does a fine job. \n\nIñárritu is making an artistic comeback himself as the writer and director of \"Birdman\", not receiving this much acclaim since his first feature, \"Amores Perros\", a much more compelling drama. \"Birdman\" is interesting and clever with all its metaphor and fantasy. The problem is that Iñárritu could not get away from magical realism long enough to make a coherent ending. And as we all know, a terrible ending can turn a good film into a mediocre film. That, unfortunately, is what happens to \"Birdman.\" It's treatment is so unusual, but its theme of a washout actor making a comeback so worn out, that a cogent ending was needed to make it work.  \n\nThe camera work and editing are excellent, as are the sets.  The script is at times brilliant and at other moments, mundane. Another run-through by actors and other writers may have brought some needed realism to the magic on the screen. As far as New York goes, the city plays its part well, as always. \n\nRating: Matinee\n\nIt's fair, but for a better, harder hitting film featuring a washed-out actor, rent \"Sunset Boulevard.\"\n\nPeace, \nTex Shelters",

            "content": "One of the best movies I've seen in years. Birdman is a modern fable of the Icarus story mixing with the style of Hitchcock but in a scenario of Singing in the Rain. Riggan is an actor who still believed that he was \"relevant\" to the public but  he has become forgotten by nearly everyone about his old superhero movies in the 70s. He decided to adapt a play about love with the help from his estranged drug addict daughter. But as the days pass, his chance to become popular again became slimmer and slimmer, he must start to reconsider his stance and experience and deal with the chaotic actors and crews.\n\nThe film heavily used drum music, particularly the ambient, jazz era variety. Music was really important as the film was set in New York where the American exceptionalism was prevalent like in the Great Gatsby. Other music were also used to express the mood of the atmosphere, masterfully. Diegetic sounds were used cleverly too to create the illusion of being physically involved in the film.\n\nThe script was superb, dark yet brutally hilarious. It involved all sorts of comedies available: blue, black, slapstick, shock, embarrassing, bizarre, etc. All the characters had distinctive characteristics making them memorable and well developed. The film was about the culture of fame seeking but also satirized the superhero genre (A genre that is getting out of hand with mediocre writing, pretty faces and lots of CGI and action, e.g. Iron Man). Riggan represented Icarus (Birdman) who flew too close to the sun but began to crash and burn due to the wings catching fire from the intense sunlight. Schizophrenia was also heavily suggested, reality became distorted as his worldview crumbled.\n\nI absolutely love the non stop tracking shots, which was used similarly to Rope by Hitchcock. The minimalism also took influence from the master of suspense. The film was unique in it's ability to confuse the audience, e.g. the camera suddenly stopped moving (audience could hear what going on in the next room) but then everything made sense as Riggan returns. \n\nBirdman is not merely a film, it's a piece of sophisticated philosophical art.",

            "content": "\"Birdman\" is probably one of the most hyped of movies of this awards season, however, the only word I can find to describe the film is overrated. \"Birdman\" follows washed-up actor, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) of former superhero glory, as he stars in a risky Broadway play in an attempt to revive his flat lined career. As opening night approaches, Riggan faces a crisis when one of his castmates is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an unpredictable, yet talented actor (Edward Norton) who causes problems for Riggan. Meanwhile, Riggan has to deal with his druggie daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), his ex-wife, and his inner demons that constantly torment him. Although the acting from the cast is superb, (especially from Keaton and Stone), \"Birdman\" is cheapened by the portrayal of Riggan's inner struggle, which is presented onscreen as a massive Birdman who torments Riggan in an overdramatic, almost laughable, Batman-esque voice throughout the film. In addition, Riggan's unstable mental state is expressed in the form of telekinesis powers and an ability to fly, which made me take the film a whole lot less seriously. However, I must admit that the directing side of the film was extremely impressive. The whole movie is filmed to appear as one long shot, with no cuts, resulting in a seamless, unique, and satirical look at society's obsession with celebrity culture and staying relevant. \n(http://joannalynch.weebly.com/)",

After seeing the horrible and over-hyperd Boyhood and the lackluster Gone Girl, this was a much needed glimmer of hope.\n \nThis film grabbed my attention from the get-go. It was a mish mosh of arthouse, big-budget, independent but with a theatre feel to it. I was about 5 mins in before I had to ask myself, 'Is this all one shot?!\"  The film flowed scene to scene effortlessly, giving the feeling of one continuous shot, a remarkable feat by director, cinematograher and editor (all deserving of awards). It gave a sort of theatre atmosphere to the film that brought you into their world and made you feel like a fly on the wall, observing but not intruding.\n \nThe dialogue was well-written and the acting performances all around were top notch. Michael Keaton is phenomenal, as he portrays an actor in the twilight and dwindling years of his career, trying to stay relevant and risking everything to do so. His alter-ego subconcious plays a significant role in his psyche that appears to affect the world around him. It gives us a glimpse into his world and allows us to better understand the character.\n \nYou can easily tell that a lot of planning, consideration, care and thought went into making this film. It's not a gimmick, but an amazing accomplishment by everyone involved in the making of.  It's not a movie that needs to be explained or defended, it stands on it's own, delivers a clear message, but still leaves a little personal interpretation for the audience.\n \nFor those of us who grew up with Keaton films, there's the added nostalgia and links to his film past as the Batman and his alter-ego (Birdman) almost as a Beetlejuice feel to it. I can't say enough good things about his performance, watching him reminded me of what real acting should be and I have no doubt that his co-actors raised their game to this new standard. \n \nThe arthouse-like score blended the film together from beginning to end, giving a more anxious feeling and sense of urgency, appropriate to the scenes and story. There were few slow spots in the film, but were necessary for the audience to relax before bringing us back into the moment. The SFX were very well done and again, major kudos have to be given considering this appeared to be a single shot throughout (I'm still blown-away by it).\n \nNYC was the perfect backdrop; the landscape and sounds virtually took me there and for 2 hours I forgot I wasn't.\n \nThis is a must-see film for anyone (except those who only like $200 million Michael Bay action/explosion-porn movies). Easily in my top 5 of all time",

This journey of crisis, transformation, battling of stressful emotions and the inner powerful demon of himself are well played by Michael Keaton, thanks to the strong and loud jazz drum scores as well as magical, thrilling, ambitious style of delivering by Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu. The mind blowing and overwhelming development might make the audiences to feel that this film about art and life is imitating Nolan's style of cinematography, but the ambiguous ending has rather more complex which gives the opportunity to the audiences to decide whether to end it positively or negatively.",

            "content": "\"I thought I knew what this movie was about. I was wrong\" A man in the row behind me said these words during the first scene of Birdman. That made two of us. I thought Birdman was about a washed up superhero movie star trying to revive his career on stage. And at least on the surface it is. But that barely scratches the surface. Birdman is one of the most complex and multilayered films I've ever seen. There are deep glimpses inside the human mind, reflections on the nature of entertainment and art, scenes straight out of Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Walter Mitty, and all of it is hilariously funny and completely insane.\n\nNow most movie reviews start by telling you what the movie is about, but I'm afraid I can't do that. I can't tell you what this movie is about, because it is about so many things at once and because words simply cannot do this movie justice. You absolutely have to see this movie for yourself. I mean that. Whatever you're doing, get up and buy tickets to this movie right now! Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy, it's just that I just finished watching this movie and it's really got me worked up. It's that good.\n\nAlright, that last paragraph was a little crazy. But I meant for it to be, because that will help prepare you for how crazy Birdman is, because it is utterly insane. The people in this movie are crazy. They say whatever they think, which frequently includes thoughts that would never go through a normal person head.  They do whatever they feel like, no matter how inappropriate. Ed Norton's character is especially shameless on this count. He will hit on any woman, anywhere, anytime. If something bothers him, he will act out in the most outrageous ways, no matter how many people are watching. He is the ultimate Broadway prima-donna, with no self control, unlimited ego, and the unshakeable conviction that he knows true art. In short an unbalanced A-hole who happens to act brilliantly.\n\nWhen it comes to crazy though, he's got nothing on Riggan, the former Hollywood action star turned Broadway hopeful. Riggan is on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown. And much like Bruce Wayne, he has the voice of his costumed alter ego stuck in his head, reminding him of what they had together and mocking what he's become. And he may also have telekinetic powers. The movie isn't entirely clear on that point.\n\t\nSo this is a very unconventional role to say the least, and Michael Keaton is brilliant in it. He perfectly embodies every facet of the role: the endearing insanity, the anger and frustration, the ego and arrogance, the fear of being an old, washed up has-been. He does things in this movie that few actors of his stature would agree to do. He puts everything he has into this role, and a big part of it is that in a way he's playing himself. This is the guy who did the first two Batman movies after all. And come to think of it, the same is true of Ed Norton. His temperamental prima-donna is the embodiment of every story floating around Hollywood about how hard to work with.\n\t\nAdd Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's frazzled lawyer Jake and the charming Emma Watson as his longsuffering daughter Sam, and the casting in this movie is perfect. So are the writing, direction, editing, and everything else about it. The screenplay blends the real and the fantastic until you can no longer tell them apart. The pacing is flawless, alternating between the serious and the outrageous so that neither becomes overwhelming. The dialog in this movie is more offbeat and maybe more realistic than Tarantino's. And the camera hovers beside the actors, matching their pace and looking over their shoulders so that you almost feel you're standing in the room with them. \n\t\nAnd oh how this movie can deconstruct. It thoroughly dismantles the realities of acting; the jealously, egos, and clashing personalities, the overlapping worlds of stage vs. screen acting, and the very act of pretending to be someone you're not. It shrewdly examines the jaded and cynical critics, the entertainment driven news cycle, the public's current obsession with the superhero genre, and our addiction to smart-phones, YouTube, and all things viral, and what it might mean for older forms of media. In a movie where a guy in a latex bird suit follows the star around there's even time to ponder the true meaning of art. This film deconstructs all of show biz in greater detail than Unforgiven did the old west.\n\t\nAlejandro González Iñárritu simply cannot get enough praise for what he has produced. Birdman is deep, outrageously funny, utterly insane, sometimes downright poignant, and awesome in every way imaginable. I would consider it the best movie of 2014. Like I said earlier, go see it.",

This masterpiece really did do the job\nyou want from film and the story and acting and cinematography among\nother things, are just perfection and it has been a long time since a\nblack comedy has really come close to absolute flawlessness.\n\nOne major point about this movie is Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson\n(and Birdman) and his performance here really typifies what acting can\ndo to us the viewer as we feel not only his emotions but also the true\npower great acting is. The cast is to be fair absolute excellence\nalongside Keaton and people like Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi\nWatts create such a display I felt this movie is one to watch for\naspiring actors because they create emotion and depth in the they're\nportrayals. \n\nI felt the comedy side flowed beautifully as well and although coming\ninto the cinema screen I did feel almost like this would be overrated\nin terms of laughter, I was sorely mistaken. The word black comedy is\nthrown as a label on many movies these days but this is what I call\ntrue black comedy and even the appearance of Zach Galifianakis as\nRiggan's lawyer Jake just adds to the overall humour we see and manages\nto be a rare film in which funny parts are mixed with dramatic\nbrilliance.\n\nWhat else can be said about Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu other than this\nman creates a movie which far surpasses anything I thought this would\nbe like. He masterfully directs and at times it seems so simple yet not\nthought of and Inarritu locates what inside we really want from a movie\nlike this. He alongside others write a script that is pure gold in the\neyes of not only actors and directors but also for critics and it feels\nalmost impossible to criticise this movie, even with a slightly slow\nbeginning. \n\nThe cinematography just adds to everything I have said and complimented\nand although it may seem a stupid arsty move with the continuous shot,\nIt just lets you delve in to the action and really not only makes you\nfeel your there, but it also brings a certain reality to fictional\ncharacters who by the end you actually start to care and feel about.\nEmmanuel Lubezski at the time of writing this review is at the top of\nhis game still and whatever he does in the future, it can be assured\nwith movies like this that he will always have a part in academy award\nwinning film.\n\nDon't go into this thinking \"Oh it is looks too dull\" or as if only\ncritics like this type of movie because this movie is a force and the\npowerful performances can just light a spark in your eyes and it bursts\ninto life. I think for many this truly raises questions about the\nquality of movies especially in Hollywood and how something like this\ncan just point out where in the last maybe decade, CGI and big budgets\nhave over taken true cinema storytelling made by people who seem to\ncare.\n\nI think with my grade of 10/10 it means I just felt this was perfection,\nand if this was truly a piece of school or university work then I would\nhave no choice but to declare this astounding. Although my review seems\nkind of a bit crazy and over the top, the movie will make you feel\nalive again in my opinion and people like Keaton who is so underrated\nin the world of Filmography stick in your mind and the formula of this\nis just comedy and drama and fine acting boiled up into a fine fine\nmovie that in truth should be classed as an epic for future generations\nas we maybe see such films as On the Waterfront or Citizen Kane today.",

The rest of the cast is excellent, each giving career best work (Norton shines a pretentious theater actor with more layers to him while Stone shows the biting intelligence & humor that made a star in the first place).  Inarritu direction is genius, and the 'single-take' look is not a gimmick but a device showing the hectic events of the story.  A slight quibble is the more metaphysical moments of the story stick out (is this guy Birdman for real?) but provides for plenty of thought afterwards.

Everything looks improvised but it's not really. Everything here is purposeful and I am in no position to say much after only one viewing but I'm going to try.\n\nEveryone does a stellar acting job and I love the writing,  the soundtrack, and the way it was shot. No breaks until the end and you feel cramped and trapped in this reality the same way Reegan is. He's seeking happiness but as his ex wife says, he thinks happiness is admiration and he can't get that. He's a blockbuster actor (washed up but still) playing in Broadway's world and he is not at home or welcome here. Edward Norton's character makes that wonderfully clear as does the critic. \n\nThe theme there between hollywood and Broadway is also done to great effect as well. The big scene with Birdman suggesting a new film is fantastic and the ending is delightfully absurd but oh so true.  The actual ending also a bit of a head scratcher but I have my own ideas and I'll keep them to myself for the sake spoilers but there are theories.\n\nThe use of \"what we talk about when we talk about love\" is also really interesting and it worth a separate entry.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Black Swan and Taxi Driver in many ways and if anyone wants to chat i am more than game. I really want to see this again. \n\nIt was really well done and really interesting. Everything thing is really tight and really intentional and i'm looking forward to puzzling over it.",

That may sound complicated, and for the first twenty or so minutes of the film while you're getting your bearings it is, however, once you see how the film is broken up into these collections of long, no cut, one take shots, as the camera swoops through the backstage of a Broadway set, you find yourself in awe at the sheer brilliance of it. I would definitely recommend Birdman for anyone who truly enjoys film-acting, directing, dialogue, etcetera. Along with Boyhood and Whiplash, Birdman is one of the top films of 2014 and beyond.

Somos testigos de las dificultades que encuentra en el camino y sus propias inseguridades que lo persiguen constantemente. Birdman más allá de una película es un gran logro de producción. Toda la película simula que fue filmada en una sola toma y lograr esto requiere una sincronización perfecta. Introduce también muchos elementos que normalmente no se ven en una película de Hollywood como por ejemplo esta realidad fantástica donde es difícil de apreciar que es verdadero o no. Alejandro González Iñárritu es un director que no le teme a sus retos y todas sus películas son innovadoras en su propia manera. Birdman es definitivamente la más original de todas. En cuanto a historia, me costó conectarme. Se enfoco demasiado en las tecnicalidades que lleva montar una obra de Broadway y siento que eso le quitó un poco de peso a la emocionalidad. Michael Keaton para ser el actor principal fue una opción excelente, porque él es Riggan. Fue un actor popular en su época gracias a Batman y luego desapareció, por lo cual puede reflejar su propia experiencia en el papel. Emma Stone como la hija rebelde de Riggan me sorprendió, porque este papel es completamente distinto a todo lo que ha hecho, y sorpresivamente logró dar una actuación realista. Zach Galifianakis se lució y se aleja de su fondo comédico, Norton también se lució y demuestra porqué la longevidad de su carrera y Watts y Riseborough impecables como siempre. Birdman es un buen paso hacia lo que podría ser una reinvención a el tipo de películas que se hacen en Hollywood. Ya basta de las secuelas y de las historias que se repiten una y otra vez. Fue una agradable sorpresa cuando Birdman fue nominada en varias categorias en los Oscar y finalmente ganar como Mejor Película. Es un gran paso hacia la dirección correcta.",

The performances are also top-notch. Keaton's portrayal of existential angst is often brave, raw and vulnerable. Edward Norton is sharp and charismatic as Mike Shiner, an egocentric thespian who embodies the Oscar Wilde quote: \"I love acting.

IÃ±Ã¡rritu really compliments the acting of the actors and he demands their full attention and top performances.\n \n\nThe true stand outs of Birdman are Micheal Keaton and Edward Norton. Great films often have multiple great scenes. This defines great films and Birdman has multiple great scenes that one would want to revisit over and over again. I love all the scenes where Riggan is unraveling and his Birdman persona is coming full force. Also Nortonâ(TM)s opening scene with him convincing Riggan he should be the fill in is one of the finer acting jobs anyone can pull off. He comes in and out of acting and reality with ease where you have no idea if he knows the difference at times or if he is acting or just going on with life.\n\n\n\nThe score is another huge factor in Birdman pulsing and making you hyped and nervous all at the same time. The constant percussion is unnerving at times and brutally honest for how the characters seem to be feeling.\n\nBirdman is a must watch. Birdman is a 9/10 a true cinema masterpiece with few holes. The dvd just came out so go check it out.\n\nShare this:\nTwitter1LinkedInEmailFacebook2PinterestPrintGoogleTumblrPocketStumbleUponReddit",

I'm not sure though whether what I read misguided my imagination from what I actually seen or the film was so over hyped that what I eventually ended up watching didn't live up to the expectation as predicted.   I ummed and ahhhed over re-watching the film before reviewing it again but in the end have decided watching it again would be unfair and to be an honest review I should write my first thoughts.  Perhaps I'll write a second review sometime in the future, for now though I'm going with my original feelings and thoughts and penning that hopefully this review will leave make way for some great discussions.\n\nRiggan Thompson sits in his dressing room mediating, he hovers about three feet off the ground legs folded and hands in a praying position.  Riggan Thompson was once a great comic book turned movie hero to the film industry with a legion of fans, that was all back in the 1990's. Since leaving half way through the third and fourth films his career took a dive, these days he is a washed up almost forgotten actor so to make his way back to the hearts of his fans and create some new ones he decides he will write, direct and star in an adaption of a Raymond Carver story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".  The play is set to debut in the St James Theatre in New York, 24 hours before the first preview screening one the main actors is injured and can't do the play.  He brings in a very well-known method actor Mike Shiner who has done more than enough to empress Riggan.   During his first preview screening Shiner does the unthinkable and Riggan's world suddenly comes crashing down around him, his estranged relationship with his daughter gets father apart, his best friend turns on him and to top it all off a famous and reviewer has threatened to destroy the play no matter how good it actually is.  With Riggan's \"birdman\" attacking him from the inside slowly Riggan's world becomes more than he can handle but what and how will he make this all work....\n\nThe first and last thing you will notice about this film is that of the amazing camera work, the entire film appears to be shot in one single take which is absolutely stunning to behold, fantastic idea by both the director  Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams, Babel) and his lead cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, the second thing you will notice is the brilliant acting by Michael Keaton (Batman, Beetlejuice) who plays Riggan Thompson, he is amazing in his role very believable you almost think that perhaps he isn't at all acting but being himself which must be the sign of a true genius, add to the amazing acting the stunning performance by Edward Norton (American History X, Fight Club) who plays Mike Shinner, I loved his character and thought he really helped the film where it would have otherwise fallen down.   I found the story though very lack luster, almost boring, I personally believe it just tried too hard to be an arthouse but failed, sure it had its moments and the camera work is more than enough to class this film as amazing, as is the acting from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, I felt it needed a lot more though to deserve all the acclaim it's so far received.  Also in the cast is Zach Galifianakis as Jake, Emma Stone as Sam and Naomi Watts as Leslie.\n\nBirdman is a film that needs your full undivided attention, I personally don't believe it will be for everyone, it is a very intellectual film (perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else) It's a film that will take you deep inside a man's mind and what makes him tick, it's a film that will wish for that little bit more and lastly I believe it's a film that lies to you especially if you have seen the trailer so don't expect no big budget action film as the trailer leads you to believe.",

This film beats every film whe cinematography is involved it is made like the whole thing is filmed in 1 shot. THE CAMERA NEVER TAKES A BREAK! I couldn't find any editing even though there was editing. Just beautiful to look at. This was by FAR Michael Keatons BEST  performance! The other cast was really great as well. I thought the score was quirky and fun. The screenplay my word the screenplay. The creativeness of Alejandro Innaritu just shined in this story of a washed up movie star who used to play the role of a popular birdlike superhero named Birdman getting his life back together while writing, staring, and directing his own broadway play. He has Birdmans voice stuck in his head telling him to go back to his original role as Birdman so he can be popular cause that's all he wants is popularity and through that the character chemistry with Michael Keaton is fantastically done to where through his fights with Birdman he becomes a better person. It's hard to explain unless you see it. Overall though one of the greatest films of this decade. A perfect film with no negatives WHAT SO EVER!  It has my vote at the awards. I highly recommend Birdman if you haven't seen it see it now,  no I mean now! Best film of the year so this beats the mark and goes higher than a 10.",

Using (fake) single take for the entire film gives it a visual style suited for a movie about theatre and gives the cast the stage to really show their skills in long takes and dialogue heave character moments. Keaton leads the excellent cast strongly followed by Norton and Stone making both dramatic and comedic moments work perfectly. Iñárritu again proves his a true talent also in this kind of enviroment.

Michael Keaton is amazing as a warped version of himself struggling for appreciation and relevance, whilst Ed Norton plays his part as an up-himself-but-talented douchebag so perfectly that I'm still not so sure whether to love or hate his character. Just brilliant! The shooting style of \"Birdman\" makes the film seem like one long and continuous take, which becomes appropriate as you're there through every grueling moment that these characters endure, never quite getting a break from all the drama going on around them. Additionally, the constant use of closeup shots on each character really draw you into their every emotion (literally, delivering an \"in your face\" performance for each part). Technically, this is quite an outstanding movie, however I feel as though the storytelling -  as well as the story itself - may polarize folks who go into this not expecting a layered, philosophical journey... but at least there's some humor to go along with it.",

Setting itself up as a masterwork of acting, it is unrelentingly self important. On the plus side, it supports the renewal of competent artistic careers; and it gives some idea of an actor's challenges, though the latter is diminished by the sacrifice of reality in the interest of hyperbole. The film's strength is the cast, with the extended takes showcasing talent that we are rarely given to see fully in Hollywood films. The women uplift the film.  Their beauty is spectacular; they speak the truths of the story and each creates a grounded centre of her own, rescuing the film from total posturing. The male roles are more like strutting birds displaying. Keaton blasts through the film in an exhausting panoply of his own tours de force. Mostly these are photographed in tiresome closeup. In a major but typical fail, the screenplay delves into the supernatural. You groan at the beginning and can only hope against hope that it is all in Riggan's head, enough to see you through most of the film. Written as it seems by a committee, the film pecks at everything. A bizarre, eclectic superstructure balances on the one repetitive note of Riggan's career obsession. There are numerous reminders and parodies of other shows - often ironical, but derivative and childish. No doubt it is full of in-jokes and in-innuendo. As for the clunky combination of Hollywood and Broadway, there are reasons why screen acting and theatre acting are different. What it must be to live with your emotions always hurtling ahead, laying waste to everything in their path. Anyone who has undertaken a difficult role in a fragile theatre piece, that was important to them, will feel the anxieties acutely. But it is also true that theatre requires stamina, stoicism, patience and measure.  As indeed does feature film. There is no deus ex machina for actors. The film does not teach much, despite the claims that it is a look behind the scenes. It leaves that reality out of your grasp. If that elusiveness is intended as its subliminal message, it seems untrue, and too easy by far. The ending is lazy. Having clothed itself in some authority, this film misuses it.",

Each scene goes on for what seems like an hour, as director Alejandro Gonzalez IÃÃ,Â±arritu shifts smoothly between scenes. IÃÃ,Â±arritu had been much of an unknown, but after a film like Birdman, he will certainly receive the attention he lacked before. I haven't even gotten to the performances yet. Keaton deserves not only a Best Actor nomination, but the award itself. And if only J.K. Simmons didn't exist Norton would be the Best Supporting Actor in a landslide. This is an excellent film and I enjoyed the ending, but it wasn't perfect. I felt it was a bit confusing that he gained the superpower of the Birdman when he was trying to overcome that label.

All the supporting performances are excellent, especially Norton's, but what surprised me most was the incredible performance by the former Batman superstar. He's certainly grown as an actor, and carries this film by his shoulders. \n\nThe story may be a bit uneven, with a few scenes that last a bit too long, and some confusing time jumps, but it really goes out of its way to be unique - to simply be an important addition to cinema. If only every film tried to be unique and set itself apart, the industry would be a much better place.\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu, of course, has to take almost all the credit to assemble such a fascinating study of fame and its psychological tolls on those who aim to achieve it.

A film that makes up for Nicholas Cage flops and box office bombs or even the occasional Wayan brother film.  With 2014, Birdman is that film.  Eminently watchable, thoroughly absorbing, acted on a touching, intuitively humane level, and led with such a distinctive direction that it's near impossible to turn away from, Birdman soars over the viewers who dare miss a minute of the on-screen vibrance and promises to fascinate the rest.  It's hard to argue whether it is the best movie of the year, but I was so taken aback by its visual style and constant flow and focus that I can't say I noticed any flaws with it whatsoever, working the audience in favor of the film for both fans of live and cinematic theater.  Birdman is its own entity of magnificence that has restored my faith in film after an arguably dry and stagnant year in film and strives for and achieves on every level.  Driven by a message that can be respected by all purveyors of film in cheering on the underdog, Birdman is the underdog with the effort and appeal to remind us why film and theater is so vital, but most importantly, why small-time, arthouse productions must also be given a chance.  Thankfully, the Academy has seen to that.",

Now forgotten and irrelevant, Riggan is trying to reignite his career by directing, writing and starring in his own play based on a short story by Raymond Carver. But from the previews to opening night, Riggan's psyche is split between letting the show go on, or letting the bird out of the cage. \n\nBirdman is completely original. You will not have ever see anything like this before. The reason being is the entire film is shown as a single rolling shot, and no cuts. A complete illusion which completely captivates the notion of a Broadway stage show under pressure, following every step of ticking time bomb  From a technological stand point of films, this is mightily impressive.\n\nKeaton and Nortan play the best performances of their careers by far. Particularly a scene where their two characters are practising a scene for the play. The bouncing of spontaneous ideas and raw emotion between the two discussing how to perfect a conversation is incredible.\n\nBirdman is everything I expected it to be; masterful, relevant, unexpected, compelling.

I have to say even though it was chaotic at times and very strange it had a certain flow to it that ended up making sense. Michael Keaton delivers a great performance both dramatic and comedic. He plays a movie actor that was made big by playing a comic book character decades ago named Birdman. He now is trying to become relevant again after many years through doing a stage play from an old book. He encounters life problems, doubts, pressures and competition that makes you wonder if he what he is doing is actually worth it. Edward Norton does also a perfect job of playing a character that gave strife, discomfort and just plain foolishness to his co-stars because of the character's own crazy methods to his acting. An eccentric, eclectic piece of work that you would either like or dislike. I'm glad I got the chance to watch it because I actually did like it. It is vulgar and again weird at times but the story does come together at the end. Bravo to Michael and the director for doing such a risky project. \n\n4 out of 5 stars ï»¿",

            "content": "'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' sets out to tell the story of Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), an aging Hollywood movie star whose fear of becoming irrelevant brings him to Broadway in hopes of reinventing himself as a serious thespian and, naturally, quirk and chaos ensue along the way. \n\nFor Riggan, the production-an adaptation of Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'- is one mishap after the next. His co-star, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) is a pain to work worth, his fresh-out-of-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) constantly reminds him that he's both a washed up actor and a lousy father, and a surly New York Times theater critic decides to hate the play before even seeing it. Then there's Birdman-a superhero Riggan played in the blockbuster franchise that launched his career-who haunts him day in and day out. This ghost of Hollywood past fuels the actor's self-doubt and self loathing, blurs his sense of reality, and eventually, leads Riggan to a full-blown descent into madness. \n\nBut instead, 'Birdman' does a better job at telling the story of an aging movie director, whose fear of irrelevance leads to his own attempt at reinvention through a stab at satire and-because the filmmaker clearly fears failure as much as does irrelevance-clutter, banality and desperation plague, what otherwise, could have been one hell of a movie. \n\n'Birdman' had so much potential. Its stellar cast, featuring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Zach Galifianakis, among others, collectively delivers solid performances across the board. The cinematography is not only beautiful, but also serves to give the film an uncannily distinct aesthetic from beginning to end-an aesthetic that is further accentuated by an atmospheric musical score, which, consisting predominantly of jazz drum rhythms, captures both the film's midtown Manhattan setting as well as the escalating neurosis of its protagonist. \n\nHowever, in all other respects, 'Birdman' fails to deliver. The movie's most glaring flaw is its complete lack of focus-it simply tries to be too many things at once. \n\nThematically, it appears to aim for dark satire. The cinematography, for instance, which has been praised for giving 'Birdman' the look of one continuous shot the whole way through, is actually remarkable for a different reason-which is that the use of lighting and camera angles makes every scene and every frame look like a comic strip panel, if paused and gone over in pencil. And that's damn fitting for a dark comedy/drama about a man that once played a superhero, and his weird, imaginary superhero frenemy/alter-ego! \n\nIn their roles, Keaton and Norton both poke fun at their real life public personas-Keaton really WAS the star of a superhero film franchise back in the day, and Norton really IS known for being a masterful yet hard-to-work-with actor. It's clever because we like it when actors prove to be in on the joke. \n\nShould 'Birdman' have fully committed to farcical absurdity, the film would have been a live-action, existential comic book for the thinking man-successfully spoofing show business while making a statement about celebrity culture, social media, today's desensitized, bloodthirsty audiences (Riggan gets a rave review from the aforementioned bitter critic only because he shoots his own nose off onstage during his play's premier, thereby \"proving\" himself a true artist), and of course, the destructive capabilities of our own minds. \n\nBut 'Birdman' did not accomplish what it had the potential to do, due to its inability to fully embrace the intended motif. The script and story line didn't allow the leads to be the caricature-esque archetypes the film needed in order to be a dark, comedic parody of actors. \n\nInstead, the stereotypes, particularly those portrayed by Keaton and Norton, were tainted by sporadic (and rather unnecessary) bursts of depth and idiosyncrasy. The result made for a roster of on-screen personalities which were neither one-dimensional enough for satire, yet not developed enough to make for a character driven drama. You neither fully care, nor fully not care about them-and apathy is perhaps the worst kind of emotion a film can illicit. \n\nThe film's lack of follow-through brings me back to, what appear to be obvious parallels between its lead character and its director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Like Riggan, Inarritu, 51, perhaps decided to go against the grain of the heavy dramas that made him famous and prove to viewers that he's still got a few tricks up his sleeve, by dipping his toe into the waters of dark humor. \n\nBut based on the end result, Inarritu wasn't comfortable enough with the genre to fully commit to it, because 'Birdman' is peppered with many of the same dramatic elements that have proven successful with audiences in the past-seemingly just to be on the safe side, but making for a muddled, wishy-washy mess of a movie instead.\n\nInarritu's insecurity is best exemplified by the film's antagonist-a New York Times theatre critic who hates Riggan for daring to set foot on Broadway, which she believes to be reserved for serious actors and not Hollywood sell-outs. She's heartless, callous, uncaring and straight up villainous in her determination to shut down Riggan's production via the power of a bad review. Inarritu gets an A+ for actually not overthinking her as a character, but D- for trying to conceal a built-in deterrent from any real-life bad reviews that his attempt to venture outside his comfort zone could potentially be subject to. It's a cowardly message to critics: I'm going to make you look bad, before you get a chance to make me look bad. \n\nAnd perhaps Inarritu was right to be nervous. He's got the cinematic exploration of the human condition down to a science, but when it comes pop culture and comedy, a natural he is not. \n\nHis previous films, like Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams and even the uncomfortably heavy Biutiful, all feature at least a handful of funny moments-like, actually really funny moments-which work because they aren't forced. In 'Birdman' much of the humor tries too hard-and worse yet, feels like listening to your grandparents trying to sound 'edgy.' \n\nWhen Naomi Watts' character (a member of Riggan's cast whose storyline is feverishly made out to be of great importance to the film in its first 40 minutes, then inexplicably completely ignored for its remainder) cries, \"Why don't I have any self-respect?\" to a fellow female cast member, her friend replies,  \"You're an actress, honey.\" Zing? Oh no, he didn't? Someone's FINALLY dared to call out actresses as being fucked up and vulnerable? The joke kind of seems like the overused, low hanging fruit one would expect from a rom com or Adam Sandler movie-not an Oscar contender. Unfortunately, the film features plenty more examples of such pedestrian humor and is only genuinely funny when Keaton, Galifianakis and Norton deliver unintentionally funny lines in a prodigiously humorous manner-which fortunately, they frequently do. \n\nAnd instead of letting the movie's plot organically serve as social commentary, that aspect is forced as well. Kids today only care about Twitter and going viral, rather than plays and stagecraft. Yes, we've known this for a while and the film's smug use of social media jargon comes off as Inarritu's way of proudly demonstrating that he knows what it is and how it works-and ironically makes the filmmaker look even more out of touch than he would have if he just didn't reference it at all. \n\nActors are tortured, insecure people, incapable of healthy relationships or dealing with reality. Yep, that's also been covered before. \n\nAnd how about the tremendous opportunity the film had to address the escalating insignificance of the New York Times? Instead of lampooning the relic publication's comically out-of-touch ways, the film maintains an antiquated and, no longer existent, level of reverence of a newspaper that's long since become a joke. \n\nIn fact, 'Birdman' manages to insult viewers' intelligence on other levels as well. Take, for instance, the epic spoiler of a line that comes damn near the beginning of the film, in which Mike Shiner (Norton) tells Riggan (Keaton) to have some respect for himself by getting a more realistic-looking gun to use in the play's final scene (in which Riggan's character commits suicide).  The scene lacks so much as even an attempt at subtly. Thirty minutes into the movie and you already know how it will end-the tortured, desperate for actor-cred Riggan is going to shoot himself onstage with a REAL gun.\n\n It would have worked as foreshadowing, had Riggan's attempt at onstage suicide not been the film's conclusion, but rather a pivotal moment which leads to a greater, more profound epiphany, or steered the plot in a specific direction. But no. You are literally (and shamelessly) told at the beginning of the film, exactly how the film is going to end, and are STILL expected to be surprised by its final scenes, you fucking idiot, you! \n\nAll that said, my love and respect for Inarritu remains unwavering despite this cinematic blunder. I do respect his desire to branch out beyond, what has become, \"classic Inarritu.\" And he did...okay, at it. As a fan, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. But at the same time, given his talent, sense of humor (when he's not trying too hard), amount of A list actors at his disposal, and eye for visually sexy filmmaking, Inarritu-whose 'testing the waters of satire' project wound up being a critically acclaimed Oscar contender-is poised to dominate the genre before long, should he choose to do so. Personally, I'd like to see him make a black comedy in which he redeems himself for the shortcomings of the if-it-had-been-directed-by-anyone-else-it'd-be-great 'Birdman.' Which I trust he can. But I also wouldn't be mad if he made Amores Perros 2.",

As a last chance at rekindling his iconic days he is fully financing, acting and directing a Broadway stage production of a Raymond Carver short story. Around him, his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is desperately trying to show him that his method behind his quest for pop culture relevancy is archaic and outdated. Thompson's business partner and agent Jake (Zach Galifianakis) tries to keep his clients ego in check and turns a blind eye to the cracks appearing in this ageing movie stars ego, an ego that lusts for revitalisation and fame. Thompson's ex wife and current lover both have active roles within the theatre he is performing act as well has his deranged acting partner Mike (Edward Norton) who has incredible acting talent but a delicate psyche. Every character has a heavy influence of Thompson's story as he struggles to succeed with his play and regain his stature in the performing arts in the face of a film critic determined to close his show as she feels he is underserving of that iconic stage.\n\nDirector Alejandro González Iñárritu's intention was to shoot Birdman as if it was just one long take, and it really feels that way as the story flows perfectly and the editing is virtually invisible. Scenes lasting several minutes - requiring the cast to learn up to 15 pages of dialogue verbatim while also hitting their physical marks and cues - meant Birdman wrapped in less than a month of shooting. It's no big secret that while Birdman is very close to home for Keaton it is also miles away, the character of 'Birdman' represents the career high for Keaton when he played Batman in 1989/92 but in this production the 'Birdman' character, to wit only Thompson can visualise, represents and manifests as his overpowering ego convinced that everybody is trying to impede and restrict him. Thompson rages an internal battle against this 'Birdman' toward a dramatic psychological crescendo that will leave you thinking. Fantastically well made, amazing camera work and indeed career best performance from Keaton. This is exactly the type of movie the Academy loves, it's high brow, it's multi layered and very cerebrial. At time of writing it has 9 2015 Academy Award nomination and I believe it's in with a good shout for either Best Actor/ Best Movie. Watch the space, but first watch this movie!\n\nFutureProof Movie Review Score: 8.5",

Artistically filmed, as it's also directed with blurred imagery of fiction and reality (what was imagined vs real). This film also takes a stab at critics, Hollywood productions, feeble minded audiences, social media and etc. Edward brings life to the film during the slow development phases.

            "content": "Every now and then a movie comes out that takes a different approach to the most basic elements of film. In this case the uniqueness lay in the camera format. There are no cuts, everything is shot on one continuous shot that follows the character being focused on at any given time around to create a more real time play-esque atmosphere. Upon first hearing about this, I was intrigued but doubted that over the course of an entire movie that this style would not hold up. But how wrong I was, outside of the few rare occasions when the camera would've benefitted from being a little further back, the angling and continuous drawn out shot work succeed in making Birman a refreshing, daring experience to watch unfold. \nBIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance is a black comedy that tells the story of a fading actor (played beautifully by an uncharacteristically energetic Michael Keaton) famous for his portrayal of an iconic superhero- as he labours to mount a Broadway Play. The days leading up to the opening night show the actor struggling against ego, familial strain, his career and most worrisome of all, his own mind. I found it interesting that Michael Keaton chose this role as it appears to mirror his own career. He of course known to most for portraying Batman in the Tim Burton adaptations in the late 80's and early 90's, has, much like his character done nothing of much consequence in the years since. Going into this film, I was not a Keaton fan. After watching his performance though, I am now firmly on his bandwagon. In every scene Keaton displays a previously untapped energy and feverish passion that forces the viewer to sit up and look on in awe. His comic timing and body mannerisms remain on point from beginning to end and help to stop even the most casual of watchers from losing focus. However, despite his performance, Keaton does not turn in the best display of the film. That honour belongs to Edward Norton. Playing his character (that of a wildly eccentric, pretentious theatre actor) with more gusto than we've seen from him in year, Norton owns every moment of screen time that he is given. Perhaps it was good direction or perhaps it was a strong endearment for the material, but Norton has thrown himself into this role and elevates him to the positon of Oscar contention later this year.\ngood turns are also provided by the supporting cast Zach Galifianakis under plays slightly, while also delivering his punchlines so subtly you'd almost suspect he came up with each one on the spot. While Emma stone plays a tired and worn out trope of modern cinema, the angst wrought daughter with father issues, with enough charm that one can almost overlook the fact that you've heard it all before.\nThe faults of the movie are few and far between. Yet, if I had to nitpick I'd say that the apparitions of Birdman himself could use more clarification. At times you are lost as to whether or not he is real and if Keaton does possess the powers put on show in all the trailers. Another thing to strife over is the occasion social media aspect that gets shoehorned in. Such little is said in relation to the internet you're left wondering; Why bring it up at all?\n\nUltimately, this comes highly recommended. Blending art-house narrative with a mainstream flare perfectly I can't help but feel that this is the movie that \"Synecdoche New York\" had wanted to be but failed in finding the blend between reality and otherwise.

Well crafted satire presented in the most odd ways maintains the audience's interest from start to finish. And that nasty voice inside his head provides a clever and thought conjuring antagonist, having you question who Riggan really is. Well deserving of an unprecedented 9 Academy nominations, finally a smart, different movie breaks its way into the mainstream. 5 Stars, yes its a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"Birdman\" is really odd but you have to see it.  Its cinematography, which captures the entire film as if it was a single tracking shot, is absolutely stunning and gives the film a unique feel that is unlike any other.  While some trickery is used to create this effect, it still necessitates that each scene be shot in one take as each stop and start of the camera occurs during a transition between scenes.  The tracking shots within each scene can last up to 15 minutes, requiring the actors to be on point with their timing and emotions at every moment while the crew and cameraman must operate with absolute precision.  The Oscars don't lie when it comes to the acting categories and, when a film receives nominations in three of those categories, you know that you are going to see strong emotional monologues and a lot of chemistry.  Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone do not disappoint.  Keaton has spent most of his career dwelling in comedy and action roles that put him in the spotlight but never proved him as a great actor.  Everything changed with the release of \"Birdman.\"  The role of Riggan Thomson has allowed Keaton to put on a dramatic, psychological performance in which he is unpredictable, unstable, and gets to really freak out.  Edward Norton adds to his repertoire of arrogant jerk roles with several high-energy scenes that leave you hating him (as usual).  Emma Stone, who I believe to deserve more credit as an actress than she receives, secured her Oscar nomination with a single scene in which an impassioned monologue allows her to flex her acting muscles.  The supporting cast adds to the natural feel of the film and director Alejandro González Iñárritu had incredible vision to put this entire film together within a playhouse on Broadway.  He is no stranger to the Oscars as all five of his feature films have received nominations, and this film will surely take home a few.  I do take issue with the trail of loose ends that this story does not resolve.  It is obvious that the writers want the reality of Keaton's superpowers, whether they exist or are in his head, to remain ambiguous.  This results in an incredibly clever ending that forces us to reflect on the characters and decide what happened; however, what is the purpose of including seemingly significant events and never addressing them again?  Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough seem to disappear from the film for no particular reason after \"the scene\", Amy Ryan creates insight into Keaton's character and then also disappears, but why?  I feel like this misuse of characters cheapens an otherwise inspired script.  I like this because it is something different, from its single tracking shot approach to its use of a real Broadway playhouse for its set.  It is rare that a director can create a film that defines its own style, but \"Birdman\" is undoubtedly one of a kind.",

I guess it must be a big deal for a Hollywood superstar to prove to his peers that he is not just a money-making machine but also a talented actor.  However, I truly do not care about the hysterics and anguish of Hollywood actors.\n\nThat is why, when Birdman was acclaimed by the critics I already suspected yet another inflated balloon full of nothing.  I waited until I could watch the movie for free, because I was very reluctant to waste money on yet another \"Academy-worth\" piece of crap and I am very happy I saved my hard-earned money\n \nThe joke is twice on the audience, because the other theme explored by Birdman, besides narcissist actors, is audience stupidity. Not being the sort of person who cares about superheroes movies, I was nevertheless annoyed by the fact that the public of said movies is vilified by this piece of elitist crap. \n\nIt is difficult to point out what I disliked most about Birdman, since I hated everything: the overbearing drum soundtrack, characters shouting their lines, the smugness of the whole concept, the patronizing dialogues, etc... I do not even think Keaton was so great in it.\n\nFinally, it is depressing to notice that the number of movies I want to walk out from is increasing exponentially. After decades of watching movies, what I expect is an interesting story told in an engaging way, but what I find is more and more egotistic directors busy only with producing crap bearing their trademark signature, being it Tim Burton Goth-chic or Wes Anderson smug-naïve.",

Presenting the story as one long continuous take, Iñárritu employs all the tricks of the trade in search of something unique and it largely pays off; his ever-flowing camera segues between scenes creating a dreamlike atmosphere. Finding where the shots have been joined, however, can at times distract from the emotional journey crafted by Iñárritu and his team of writers, in a script full of dark humour and irony. Unfortunately there's also a hint of pretention and self-satisfaction in Iñárritu's work - intentional and otherwise - that comes across as smug and, therefore, annoying. As Riggan Thomson, the former A-lister seeking professional rejuvenation on the stage, Michael Keaton gets a long-awaited opportunity to shine in a lead role and attacks it, for better and worse, with unbridled gusto. Ed Norton hogs the spotlight though, with a comedic turn as a supercilious stage actor looking for the \"truth\" in even the tiniest of things, whilst Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan round out the impressive cast. Birdman is clever, enterprising and admirably distinct, if occasionally laborious and inaccessible; it's not for everyone, but lovers of film and/or theatre should seek it out.",

A dazzling film on many levels this is a story about lost souls, identity, celebrity and meaning in the world. Michael Keaton is superb as Riggan Thomson, a man searching for answers many years after reaching fame as 'Birdman'. His soul searching takes him to Broadway to star in and adapt Raymond Carver. All the while his inner voice of 'Birdman' is questioning his every move. He seeks answers but can't find them. Throw in a troubled relationship with his daughter and his battles with the ego of his star actor, the great Edward Norton, and you have a potent mix of regret and ambition. This is a sad, dark and funny film. It pokes holes in the modern film world obsessed with comic book adaptations and the world at large concerned with celebrity. To add to the mastery of the film is the sublime cinematography of  Lubezki. He has combined with the director to construct the film as if it shot in one take. The effect is to thrillingly lead you on a non stop journey through the theatre, a theatre of dreams. Of fantasy. This wonderful films plays with big ideas. The fact that it totally succeeds is even more astounding.",

            "content": "Michael Keaton's most recent cinematic turn as Riggan Thomas in Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman is the bravest performance of the year from a leading actor, laying bare all of Keaton's insecurities, vanities, and virtues through a fictional character who possesses more than a passing resemblance to Keaton himself. Riggan is a washed up, out of work Hollywood actor, attempting to breath new life into a public image that has been distorted and manipulated by the cult of celebrity, bringing with it all of the personal vices of arrogance, avarice, and self-absorption that such distortions of self-worth and identity inevitably represent and instill. Likewise, Keaton is a figure of the popular culture who appears as more of a caricature than a three-dimensional actor in the collective mind of the general public, associated with some of the most iconic movie characters from the 1990's, including Batman and Beetlejuice, thereby mirroring Riggan's association in Inarritu's film with the fictional big budget superhero, and at times near literal alter-ego, Birdman. Inarritu's film thus becomes an examination of the blockbuster movie star, simultaneously celebrating and deriding the actor whose relevancy is at times more dependent upon the associations conjured up by the characters he portrays as opposed to the power of each individual performance, Birdman bigger than Riggan, in much the same way that Beetlejuice looms larger than Keaton, in both name and persona. Michael Keaton's cultural status as one of the big budget stars of the 1990's thus becomes a meta-fictional aspect of the very fabric of Innaritu's film, inevitably informing the audience as to how to read Riggan's deeply conflicted interiority and ego-driven flights of astrally projected fantasy, visually represented in the film through Inarritu's use of one continuous, and spectacularly edited, long shot, seamlessly encompassing the entire film, and further mirroring Riggan's subjective vision and reality in a way that is intensely characteristic of the film, the character, and the surreal nature of Inarritu's beautiful meditation on the unexpected virtue of ignorance.\n\nThe frame narrative of Inarritu's film centers around a stage production of the classic American short story collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love by minimalist writer Raymond Carver, adapted and produced by Keaton's Riggan Thomas in the lead role, providing for an accessible point of entry into the film's visually driven first person narrative, as Riggan's highly subjective point of view very quickly begins to drive the entire course, and at times alter the reality of, the film's plot and cinematic scope. As the camera pans across and through the small, claustrophobic hallways and back stages of New York's Broadway theatre district, the playhouse a veritable Pandora's box of Riggan's artistic dreams, hopes, and delusions, the viewer is swept up in the storm of his creative fruition, bordering on the insanity and emotional fragility that makes up the core of Inarritu's film. When we first see Riggan, he is literally floating in mid-air in his dressing room, a ludicrous first shot that boldly establishes the subjective unreality of the film, and immediately establishes a clear directorial vision, one that will be impossible to outwit or predict, making for a deeply compelling and intimately truthful performance based piece of storytelling. According to the demands of the one shot take that establishes the subjectivity of the narrative, every other actor's performance becomes a part of one long stream of Riggan's conscious and subconscious, each line delivered with the grace and elocution of live theatre, the players all a part of one organism in motion, their individually delivered performances in active participation with the creation of Keaton's persona, the entire film brimming with a communal vitality. In establishing a film centered on, around, and within one character, Inarritu has created his own subjective world in Birdman, one that mirrors the celebrity driven popular culture of our own, each one of us supporting actors and walk-on's in the theatre of celebrity and fame, all of us culpable in the ignorance of Riggan Thomas.\n\nIn this way, Inarritu's film is about solipsism, with its closest precursor in terms of thematic scope and directorial vision being Charlie Kaufman's 2008 directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, wherein the subjective reality of the New York actor and playwright is examined with the fierceness of an unforgiving and distinctively authorial force, at times remarkable in its overstated ambition and pretentious precocity. And yet, Birdman is never overly heady, as Kaufman's film is, never treading too far into the subjective lens so as to become impenetrable, self-avowedly brilliant but visually opaque. Where Kaufman seems to be too overly in love with his own brilliance, his protagonist suitably left in a literal apocalypse of his own creation by film's end, Inarritu's Riggan is relatively warm, capable of emoting and connecting with those around him, even if they are all forced to co-inhabit his own subjective dreams and nightmares. Where Kaufman's New York Theatre is filled with shadows of narrative misdirection and evasion, coupled with the indecipherable, Joycean mutterings of the literary intelligentsia, Inarritu's is inhabited with the light of the artist still struggling to connect with his audience, embittered towards the academic establishments of theatre and film criticism, and eager to engage with Carver's comparatively accessible text. Birdman is a worthy successor to Kaufman's film, more immediate and emotionally compelling than Synecdoche's grand opera, delivering the equivalent of a three and a half minute pop song to Kaufman's twenty-two minute progressive rock noodling, Synecdoche, Lite in essence.\n\nDespite the near insurmountable ambition and hubris of the film's concept and subject matter, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman lives up to the self-conscious precocity of its subtitle, examining the socio-cultural status of the Hollywood celebrity through the eyes of a falling star. Michael Keaton makes a stunning comeback performance as Riggan Thomas that ranks as one of the best performances of the year, in addition to an already enviable body of work from the past. The level of meta-fictional, self-reference that Keaton is able to pull upon to lend some empathetic tragedy and intimacy to the iconographic nature of a former Hollywood superhero is effectively comical and heartbreaking, Riggan's professional and personal association with the Birdman character as inseparable from his sense of self-identity as Batman is to Keaton in the public eye, lending the film much of its satirical bite and cultural relevance. And yet, for all of its carefully composed strategic plotting that might feel a little too smart for its own good in anyone else's hands, Inarritu never falls prey to cinematic convenience or contrivance, his story of artistic redemption moving and dramatically satisfying, hopeful despite the melancholy of its character's solipsistic ambition. When Riggan finally soars free at the end of the film, both in terms of creative fulfillment and surrealistically projected fantasy, the final note is hopeful, even though the viewer knows that the character still resides within his own head, ignorance his and our creative bliss, made necessary once more by the film's titular and unexpected virtue.",

I like how Whiplash, my favorite film of 2014, was nominated for Best Picture, and it's good to see Dick Poop get the attention he deserves as a cinematographer (yes, I'm actually going to start with a joke about that flub). One movie that didn't surprise anybody was Birdman, which was nominated for many awards. I have seen this movie today, so now I am going to review it.\n\nThe film centers around Michael Keaton's character, who played the lead role in a superhero movie franchise twenty years ago, and now is a washed up actor who hasn't been in much lately (sound familiar). In an attempt to kickstart his career again, he writes, and stars in a Broadway play. The movie is about his struggles with his lack of confidence, as he tries to make this play.\n\nThis movie is advertised as a dark comedy, but it doesn't really have as many humorous scenes as you may think. It is also artsier than the average dark comedy, with most of the movie being done in one long take, and with frequent sequences that seem to be in his imagination.\n\nThe film's casting is clever. In addition to casting Michael Keaton in a role that could almost be considered autobiographical, there are also actors who were in other superhero movies, such as Edward Norton (The Incredible Hulk) and Emma Stone (The Amazing Spider-man).\n\nThe film itself is a pretty good one. It has an interesting story, and is very well directed. It's different from most movies, and I like that. It is not so much a comedy as a satire of the entertainment industry with occasional bursts of humor. It discusses the struggle of has-been actors, as well as how actors are treated according to others' expectations for them.\n\nBirdman is an intriguing, unique movie, that is sure to win a few awards.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

All of that, expertly moulded into one film that is part All About Eve, part Batman and part Noises Off and part Sunset Boulevard. It's also a strong look at mental illness and the pressures of success in the modern world. \nMichael Keaton is amazing. Almost forgotten in Hollywood, Keaton's most recent outing was the very forgettable Robocop remake, for which he was a very underwhelming villain. Here, he clearly knows the material is top notch. \nBut the supporting cast is also excellent, with not a single poor performance or weak link. Edward Norton (playing a satirical version of himself) is brilliant as he switches from amazing stage actor, to egotistical and destructive before suddenly becoming rational and logical. \nZach Galifanakis is a revelation in his role, so much more subdued and layered than his usual comedic buffoon. And Emma stone continues her climb in Hollywood with another great performance.\nThe film, not seeming a big budget film, takes place mostly in one location, inside a theatre. This gives the film feeling of being a stage play (much like old Hollywood films that were based on plays such as The Petrified Forest or Wait Until Dark) that the limited sets give away the story's theatre roots. However, the film suddenly explodes into a Hollywood comic book movie, with very impressive visual effects. Birdman 4 looks like it would be a great film to go and see.",

            "content": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman made a large buzz on the Film Festival circuit before (finally) securing a wider release. Getting a lot of word of mouth, not only for the quality film making and interesting continuous sequence look, but also because of star Michael Keaton. Keaton, probably still best known for his turn as Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 landmark film does a fantastic job playing an aging actor, past his prime and out of his depth in Birdman.\n\nRiggan (Michael Keaton), a once prominent action star is trying his hand at being the lead actor in a play he wrote the adaptation of and is also directing. The play is a project to show the world, and more importantly himself, that Riggan isn't a relic of the past who can only act in a rubber suit. To paraphrase Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), that he matters. Riggan's agent and best friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis), is stressed with trying to balance actor's egos, an ever changing cast, and other stresses that go along with opening a major Broadway production. Mike (Edward Norton) a true performer, lover of the stage, and arrogant actor is brought in last minute to replace a cast member that dropped out. Mike's love of the craft could make or break Riggan's play. Lesley (Naomi Watts) and Laura (Andrea Riseborough) round out the rest of both the play's cast and the movie's cast.\n\nAlejandro Gonzalez Inarritu may not be a household name for many casual movie goers but a quick search on IMDB will undoubtedly ring a few bells for any movie fan. He directed movies like 21 Grams and Bable, just to give you an idea. Trying something that isn't often attempted, Inarritu shot all of Birdman in what appears to be one long sequence, a single take. This technique was most famously done by Alfred Hitchcock in the fantastic movie Rope. More impressively in Hitchcock's time was the limitation of a reel of film, being only so long forced Hitchcock to make cuts and hide them to keep up the look of a single take. Inarritu had technology on his side and used a few techniques, like time lapses, to keep the continuous sequence. In addition to the continuous sequence, the shots and framing are outstanding. The camera feels alive. The angles are creative and follow the action like audiences bobbing their heads back and forth at Wimbledon. The only time the camera is at rest is when the days are transitioning during very well executed time lapses.\n\nMichael Keaton is famous for playing an iconic super hero thirty years prior, he is also an aging actor. The similarities to Riggan stop there. Keaton is a steadily working actor who had a career before he donned a rubber suit and worked steadily his whole life after. Keaton is a fantastic actor who does Drama as well as he does comedy and can now add crazy to his resume. Riggan's is clearly unhinged. Talking to his alter-ego of Birdman throughout most of the film it is clear. Edward Norton is pure Broadway, New York City, 'starving' artist. Starving isn't literal since it is established that his character, Mike, is successful and wide regarded, but Norton plays the stereotype perfectly. Arrogant yet insecure off stage, when it is time for Mike to act he is unmatched. Riggan deals with the craziness of the actor to escalate his play. Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, and Andrea Riseborough are also all amazing performers. There really isn't a weak actor in the entire movie, but a special mention should be made for Zach Galifianakis. Galifianakis is most famously known for his role in the very successful Hangover franchise. Playing an awkward idiotic man-child Galifianakis is incredibly funny. In Birdman he sheds the comedy (and more than a few pounds) to become a full fledged actor. While not an actor within the movie Galifianakis does a fantastic job playing the straight man alongside so much insanity.\n\nSadly, Birdman is guilty of going a bit too far on some things and stepping over a few thin lines that separate brilliant from absurd. The film has Riggan imagining himself with psychic powers, the ability to fly, and being truly more than a simple man. These instances are completely unneccesary. It is clear that Riggan is teetering on the edge because of Keaton's amazing performance. The inner voice was all that was needed to drive the message home. The added science fiction of it all makes it seem like the director didn't have enough faith in his actor to get the job done. There is one larger than life sequence that is supposed to be the turning point for Riggan. The entire scene amounts to nothing, and even makes Riggan's next big move seem out of character. This scene seems to have been shot entirely for the benefit of the trailers. There is also some imbalances in the characters. So much time is spent with Mike and his own version of mental illness that when the character disappears from the movie it feels like a loose end that will never be tied up. Mike isn't dismissed in the form of an open ending or ambiguous results, he is dropped outright.\n\nWith only a few faults to speak of, Birdman is an incredibly directed, acted, and written drama. The continuous sequence look is a technical achievement as well as a totally engrossing way to keep audiences latched to the screen. We are so trained to look for breaks when one doesn't come we practically forget to blink. Michael Keaton is mesmerizing, Edward Norton is commanding.",

            "content": "Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, a former Hollywood actor, best known for playing the role of a superhero known as Birdman in three blockbuster movies. His career suffering since he turned down a forth film. Thompson seeks to recapture his fame by making it as a theater actor.  Throughout the film he has to deal with his co-star, his rebellious daughter, and Birdman himself, who symbolizes his self-doubt. Only real criticisms being I felt the critic played by Lindsey Duncan was a little too strong. Though I agree everyone has their personal tastes when it comes to acting, to wanna kill a play simply because the lead actor is known for playing a superhero seems rather unprofessional. Also the I felt the scenes between Stone and Norton seemed unnecessary. But overall, these are minor criticisms.\n Admittedly  the theme of the film is a bit difficult for me. One possible theme is life imitates art shown in such scenes when Keaton's character seems to gain super powers. Though it seems to be more of a symbol of his character going mad. Another theme is just wanting to be loved. This is supported by the fact the films lead wishes to regain his former popularity, and repair his relationship with his daughter. Hence the play What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\n Birdman draws you in with it's visual style. As the film is shot, for the most part, to look like it's all one take. This was done to give the film the feel of watching a theater play. It's a very unique style that draws people in and immerses them  in the films story. \n In conclusion, Birdman is a very odd, but unique film, with a deep story, and fantastic performances. The only real disappointment I can think of, is for people expecting a superhero film about Birdman.",

But under Alejandro Iñárritu's (\"Amores Perros\", \"21 Grams\") capable hands, it is also an experimental film that many other directors have tried before in one form or another. It is made to look like it was filmed in one long unbroken shot from beginning to end with continuous scenes. It is technically impressive with its ensemble acting, writing and cinematography as the standouts. It is also the type of film that may polarize audiences. Those who have seen other experimentally influenced films from Stanley Kubrick, Lars von Trier or Pedro Almodovar know what I'm talking about. But while Iñárritu's approach to the material he also co-wrote is very unconventional, it is far from being inaccessible.\n\nSet against the backdrop of actors trying to launch a new Broadway play, the film deals with so many themes including, but not limited to, the ephemeral nature of success, the question of relevance, confusing love for admiration, the quest for what is truly art vs. pop culture and the longing for instant gratification where the definition of achievement is measured in terms of having countless \"likes\" or \"followers\" instead of a lifetime or body of work - universal themes for all of us.\n\nScenes around New York City and its theater world play secondary characters here. The film was shot near Times Square at the St. James Theater where I saw \"The Producers\" with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.\n\n\"Birdman\" is multi-layered, open ended and allows for more than just one interpretation. It is simply brilliant.",

            "content": "A virtual masterpiece, Birdman is a shoo-in for the Oscars but still manages to be a edge of the seat, highly watchable film. Arthouse is often a dry bleak affair, all interpersonal drama and poignant character study with no meat and often no soul. This goes triple for November oscar-bait movies. But Birdman, if you would pardon a bad pun, is a bird of a different feather. It hits on all levels. Director Inarritu creating a modern day fable about a washed out hollywood actor trying to reinvent himself with a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver. MIchael Keaton's character, Riggan used to be big, then he became 'too big' when he played superhero birdman in three blockbusters. Many years later he is washed out, a shadow of his former self and is desperately trying to prove to himself and others that he is a true actor once more. When he comes face to face with new co-star Mike, a 'true' Broadway method actor Riggan's life, play and sanity slowly start unravelling.\n\nLet's start with the cinematography. Inarritu is a great director but the real merit in Birdman's spectacular, unbelievable pacing and its construction as a 'single shot' movie (yes, the whole movie is one -two maybe?- 'faked' tracking shot.) go to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who was also responsible for Tree of Life and almost all of Cuaron's movies: Gravity (a movie I hated but whose technical merits stand firm), Y tu Mama Tambien (a movie i loved), Children of Men (remember _that_ tracking shot?) and many many more. Even if we disregard the faux one-shot style this movie looks stunning, with the framing, the often dream-like lighting and some incredibly framed transitions standing as testament to just how important a good DP is to a movie.\n\nThe score is stunning, a collage of freeform drumbeats that manage to 'break the fourth wall' in regards to whether or not they are diegetic or not and keep the pacing up, driving the story along at times. It is simply unbelivable how simple but at the same time powerful Birdman's score can be. God bless Antonio Sanchez and fuck the Academy for its bullshit rules.\n\nFinally, the acting is simply fantastic with not one single performance dragging the movie down. Michael Keaton puts a nuanced and at the same time batshit crazy performance in and is contrasted extremely well with the incredibly natural Ed Norton. Emma Stone, of Amazing Spiderman infamy plays seamlessly off those two, a telling example of how a good acting environment can push others to greatness. Speaking of which - Zach Galafinakis. God damn, he might not be the greatest actor out there but he really does give his best in this one. Also Billed: Naomi Watts who i've never liked but puts on a good if slightly exagerrated performance and Andrea Riseborough who i only know from the dreadfully forgettable Oblivion but who I'm sure i'll be seeing more of.\n\nBirdman is a modern classic and an unforgettable film. It is certainly a movie i'll be watching again, a meaty, juicy film about theatre, stardom, depression and oblivion that everybody should see.",

At first that is what it seems it is going to focus on but it does touch on more deeper meanings involving his family and his relationships with himself and those around him. Michael Keaton was definitely the best part of the film, he portrayed Riggan so well that i began to believe that this could have actually been a real person. He showed so much passion in playing this character that you really get sucked in to his amazing performance. The supporting cast i felt also did a pretty good job but did not shine as brightly as Keaton. Another highlight from the film has to be the ingenious and mesmerising method used to film it. The one-shot sweeping camera technique used gave this film a very different feel than many other films and really let you follow these characters and get to see them in all different environments without all of the jarring cuts. The performances as well as shooting technique are what make this film what it is. But that was still not enough for me to absolutely love this movie, the overall tone of the film didn't really work for me, i understood why they went for a dark and comedic yet also dramatic tone as there were some sections that i really enjoyed but for the most part i couldn't really enjoy the entire film as much as i wanted to. Despite not being able to really enjoy this film as much as i had hoped, i still got to see one of the performances of the year in one of the more different films of 2014, if you are an admirer of some different, quality film this may be the film for you - 7.6",

Though there are obvious delusions, one has to wonder if even every day activities are happening or its just in their head. To take it to an extreme, one could wonder if he really was a movie star. Was he really a Broadway actor? Nothing is a given. This unpredictability makes the movie stand out from cookie cutter movie story lines. \n\nMicheal Keaton, the first real movie Batman, sorry Adam West, is the perfect actor to portray a man typecast in one particular role. No matter what Keaton does, the majority of the population over 30, who were alive to see his movies, will still see him as Batman. \n\nBut now the younger generation of millenials have a different reference. They think of Batman as Christian Bale and soon maybe Ben Afflec, depending on how good he is. If he's like George Clooney or Roger Moore as Bond, he may just be a fleeting impersonator. The New Coke of a Hollywood Icon.\n\nWhen teens like this movie and decide to go back and watch Batman or Batman Returns they'll say, \"Birdman was a pretty good Batman.\"\n\nBirdman humanizes a bigger than life character and the actor behind the mask.

But the attempts to be innovative and creative overshadow any substance the story might have had - and there isn't much of substance. It does explore the desperate need for love and identift - but there is nothing new here and it is mostly pretty boring except for a few moments of intensity. I'm not sure why many are raving over Michael Keaton's performance - I suppose it is a bit more in-depth to what he usually does.

On a purely technical level, it's astounding. Precisely edited to appear as though the whole thing were executed in one extremely long take, it's a mesmerizing experience, profoundly different and expertly crafty when the timeline needs to leap forward. It's dazzlingly acted, too, with Keaton delivering a masterful performance alongside noteworthy supporting work from Ed Norton, Emma Stone and (to my surprise) a very versatile Zach Galifianakis. The moral lessons are laid on thick, though, and too often it feels like we're being lectured for daring to indulge in the kind of loathsome fun that drove our lead to this strange brand of mania. One scene in particular, Keaton's confrontation with a stuffy critic before opening night (who glares right into the camera before storming off in a cloud of self-righteousness) plays like a direct scolding of the audience. Maybe theatre purists will take this as a firm voice of reason, the rare call of someone who finally *gets* it, but to me it came off as tremendously stuck-up and pretentious. I can't deny there's a lot to enjoy here, and it's a clear arrival for auteur Alejandro González Iñárritu, but I also can't help wondering how much better it would be without that permeating air of superiority.",

There is wit and at times we laugh out loud. And the way it is shot means we are often backstage and part of the ensemble that is struggling to launch the show on Broadway. \nThe trouble for me is, even allowing for the fact that actors can be wrapped up in their own melodramas to a greater extent than those they are employed to portray, this sad and sorry collection of individuals eventually brought me down to their level - one of unmitigated gloom and despondency. The result was, feeling they were architects of their own fates, I ran out of patience with their stupidity and no longer cared what happened to them.\nExcellent though he is in the lead, as the one-time superhero attempting to resurrect a career otherwise heading towards the toilet pan, Keaton's character (who can only speak the lines given to him) seems to suffer from a death wish that would thwart even the archangel Gabriel. In fact the whole cast in this play within a play (with the possible exception of Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter - who almost steals the whole show in my view) seem so consumed by their own misery they tend to forget they are on the verge of launching a play that has the potential to actually succeed.  But success does not seem to be what this is all about. Even when handed the golden key to Broadway, Keaton prefers to sabotage the project by veering off on a tangent of his own making. I was with them for a good three-quarters of the journey, but felt by the end they were best left alone to drown in their respective sorrows.\nI can see why so many viewers of this film are on their feet and applauding, but for me, proficient though it undoubtedly is,it contains an element of the king without his clothes on. Consequently I found its particular version of nudity somewhat tiresome. It might be cleverer than I am giving it credit for, but, you know what?

From the incredibly detailed direction from Inarritu to the pitch perfect acting from the entire ensemble (Keaton gives an award worthy performance). Birdman was the film in 2014 I have been waiting for. Alejandro Inarritu has constructed a feast for the eyes as the majority of Birdman's two hour run time is shot and edited in such a careful way that the film looks like one long scene. My eyes were glued to the screen as I marveled at the technical wizardry i was witnessing. Add the score by Antonio Sanchez which is mainly a drum set playing elaborate solos and fills creating an unpredictability in the film. The screenplay is top notch as this drama/comedy likes to pick fun at how blockbusters have taken over Hollywood and the struggle for a small/independent project to get made. The dialogue scenes between characters are by far the best constructed I've seen all year. The ensemble as i said earlier is perfect. Everyone brought their A-game. Even Zack Galifianakis surprised me playing a reserved role instead of a loud, fumbling idiot. But it truly is Michael Keaton who is the brightest of the star. The inner battle with Riggan propels the movie from one character to the next. Keaton's performance is definitely worth an Oscar Nomination (and he will probably win). This is on the Academy's radar for best picture of the year and it should be because in my eyes it is the best film I have seen all year! If you have a chance to check out Birdman I suggest you take it. It will be a film you will not forget anytime soon.",

Few critics have dared to be honest and nail this movie to the wall as the smugly self-important wank-fest that it is. There is an Emperor's New Clothes hype surrounding this film that I can't fathom. Maybe critics are too afraid of being labelled a vitriolic curmudgeon like Lindsay Duncan's character in the movie; a long since defunct pastiche of theatre critics. She is just one of the many clichés and stereotypes which litter this movie: the overpaid, narcissistic actor/director-on-the-edge; the over-burdened, neurotic manager; the brattish, rebellious daughter; the insecure, needy actresses and of course, the genius-but-impossible-to-work-with, method actor. \nEven the clever in-jokes are over-played, like the casting of two actors embittered by their stints as superheroes to satirically act out their real-life reputations, Keaton famous for playing on-the-edge characters (Beetlejuice, Batman and Dream Team), Norton famous for being notoriously difficult to work with. I found it hard to stomach these actors, both of whom made super-rich by their trade, ironically riffing on the amount earned by RDJ for Iron Man, even as art imitating life, imitating art. We get it! Don't labour the point to absurdity. Hollywood is solely about the money and imaginatively bankrupt. We get it! \nI am being a bit unfair, the casting and acting does redeem this film, as does the amazing cinematography, but as demonstrated by other actor-indulgent-films, like American Hustle last year, allowing actors to improvise does not necessarily make for realistic, gritty dialogue. It comes across as stilted, unfocused and self indulgent, just like this movie. It won one well deserved Oscar for Best Cinematography. Best Director, okay I can appreciate Alejandro González Iñárritu's vision and his talent at getting such performances from such notoriously difficult actors. Best Film? I don't think so, though not really surprising when looking at the narcissism of the voters, \"Ooh look, a film all about me\". That said, I am deeply appalled that such a hackneyed story, full of clichéd characters spouting unrealistic dialogue, could win Best Original Screenplay when compared to the other nominees.

            "content": "Once in awhile those few gems will come around and remind you of why you watch films in the first place, while I still think Boyhood is the best of 2014, Birdman joins a pretty awesome list of those films of 2014. Birdman is a truly excellent film that does so many unique things and actually has something to say. \n\nI'd like to think that in my reviews that I come across as someone that doesn't just try to say snarky comments just to have something to quote on a DVD case. I love film and review films from a personal and passionate standpoint, not just to look at the technicals and tear into people. However, it feels like a joke to even try review Birdman because one of its many themes that it addresses is critics, which has an excellent scene and that rant where Riggan just tears into that critic is a fantastic scene and hopefully one that got a few people thinking. Michael Keaton really felt like he pulled from his own life experiences for this film but especially for that scene in particular and I wonder how much of it was ad-libbed. \n\nThe pseudo-biopic angle that this film has going is quite surreal, I wonder if when the actors read the script they just thought of something strange or a remark to say to the filmmakers. All of the characters in this film seem to be played up to be exaggerated versions of the actors, Keaton more than most, obviously; and strangely enough it works really well, even if some aren't used that much near the end, unfortunately. Keaton said that Riggan is unlike himself and that works even more in the films favor for the exaggeration and they have the same amount of letters! He also said it was the most challenging film he has ever done but that hard work really paid off! I'd hate to use the term 'washed up' because, especially in Keaton's case, I don't believe it because he's been consistently working for many years now and I just don't like that term anyway. \n\nThe acting in this film is outstanding and everybody does an excellent job, the script is brilliant and they all work fantastically with each other, through excellent dialogue and well developed relationships. The way the script references things that have happened in 'the real world' does give it that extra touch of realism. This film seems to have shielded itself from criticism in a way, clearly not because it doesn't have 100%, but if anyone has a complaint about it, people, or at least people I know, would have a little laugh and a joke about them bringing up a complaint. However, there was one scene, just one, where the acting felt really fake. One character was yelling at another character about something and whilst their body language and face were acting out that moment, their eyes didn't seem like they were in the moment and it just felt really manufactured, it reminded me I was watching a film. I know that's a real nitpick if there ever was one but hey.\n\nSeeing as how I haven't really spoken about structure yet and just used big words to label everything, why don't we talk about the story? The way everything is put together in this film is some of the best filmmaking I've ever seen, it looks like one shot but it isn't and there are points when it looks like you can tell where it's been cut but having everything look like one long take certainly gives the film a new kind of life. While I haven't seen a film that was actually one take, like Russian Ark, at the time of writing this, this style really puts you into the story. I felt totally engrossed in this film and I felt like I was there with them, this totally gives new meaning to the term, 'experience', it's smartly assembled and the transitions are flawless. At first, when I saw a few little clips of the film, everything looked to be close ups of the characters and I'm glad the whole film wasn't filmed like that because that would have gotten annoying really quickly. I love why the director chose to have it all be one take, because life is all one take and doesn't have cuts, that's awesome. The soundtrack is much like the film, it is unpredictable and feels improvised, especially in scenes involving the unique, stylised text, to fit the moment that it's playing with, which is brilliant.\n\nBesides everything else that already makes it unique, a lot of what happens in the story are things that I don't think I have ever seen before. It's just so refreshing to watch something that really has something to say about pretty much everything, this film tackles so many interesting subjects from interesting angles from its excellently written characters and it really gives the audience a lot to think about, not just critics. It's an emotional film and it is totally unforgettable. But hey, it should have been Birdman 2 where Riggan stooped, not 3 but that's pretty clever why it was 3 and 1992 was the right year, odd that, isn't it...\n\nBirdman, and it's very Dr. Strangelove-like name, or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a perfect film and something that was made for the right reasons that really has something to say and it was all filmed in under a month, terrific. With brilliant effort from everyone involved, Birdman is, just simply, a masterpiece and one of the best films I've ever seen.",

Score was great and some lines stuck with me after i watched that I suspect will be famous quotes a few years from now delivered all by the Birdman himself. The ending was also magnificent and for me, perfect. There is no technical faults in this piece.",

            "content": "En este filme que uno de sus factores es la carga de haber encarnado a un super-héroe hace muchos años, no es raro encontrar liderando al elenco al brillante Michael Keaton quien dio vida a Batman en el fenómeno cultural mundial que fue el filme de 1989 y repitiendo el rol en 1992. Pero es también curioso encontrar a Edward Norton, quien fue el Dr. Bruce Banner en \"The Incredible Hulk\", segundo filme del Phase 1 del Universo Cinemático de Marvel, y para rematar tenemos a Emma Stone, quien encarnó a Gwen Stacy en las primeras dos entregas de la actual saga de \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Pero no se equivoquen, quien vaya al cine a ver este filme porque busca ver otro filme más de super-héroes que ahora es algo regular, se darán una gran sorpresa ya que fuera de mencionar de una forma muy casual que el personaje principal (Keaton) encarnó a un héroe en el cine llamado \"Birdman\" (sin ninguna relación salvo el nombre con el personaje de Hanna-Barbera, aunque bien puede ser una amalgama de ese Birdman y Blue Falcon), hasta ahí llega el vínculo con el glamoroso universo de los héroes uniformados. Incluso me extraña que los Globos de Oro la hayan metido en la categoría de comedia, ya que salvo un momento irremediablemente divertido, la película es eminentemente un drama. Una de los principales detalles de esta cinta es haber sido filmada \"en una sola toma\" o la ilusión de haber sido así ya que fue realmente un impecable trabajo de edición para que parezca así, aunque no es algo nunca antes visto, ya que el filme de horror \"La Casa Muda\" hecha en Uruguay en el 2010, usó esta misma idea, solo que manteniendo además el factor de tiempo real, o sea los eventos duran lo que dura la cinta, lo cual no es así aquí en \"Birdman\" donde el gran trabajo de edición y fotografía crea una ilusión efectiva donde la trama tiene evidentes saltos temporales pero no así en la \"toma\" que se vé en pantalla. En cuanto a la atmósfera de la cinta, podría considerarla como una mezcla entre \"Black Swan\" y el esquema típico de un filme de Woody Allen, que tal vez por esa similitud a una cinta de Allen es que la consideraron una comedia, pero honestamente no creo que eso sea acertado. El director, Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful) maneja un impresionante elenco de actores sacándoles actuaciones muy buenas, pero creo que lo criticable sería el guión, el cual es un script que permite sacar a luz aspectos internos de las personalidades de los actores, principalmente Edward Norton, ya que si bien Michael Keaton hizo a \"Batman\", dudo mucho que en la realidad se sienta con ese personaje, como lo hace en el filme con respecto a \"Birdman\" (de hecho el ha comentado que este personaje es el más diferente a como es él en la vida real que ha actuado), pero creo que el guión pudo ser más crudo, más personal, más revelador, y además la trama no tiene un norte claro ni un propósito evidente salvo visitar a esta gama de personajes en su interacción durante unos cuantos días de sus vidas cuando una obra de teatro está por estrenarse. El factor surreal de la historia es brillante pero igualmente, al carecer de un objetivo claro la historia en general, como un todo, salvo obviamente el deseo de la mayoría de la gente de dejar una huella en este mundo, de ser recordados, pero sobre todo de ser recordados por lo que nosotros queremos y no por lo que la gente decida, sin embargo, creo que el filme queda debiendo un poco en establecer una coherencia estructural completa en su guión, que es brillante sí, pero difícil de asimilar como un todo. Pero eso no significa que no sea algo interesante de observar y dónde su final (tranquilos no voy a hacer spoilers) es simplemente genial e inapreciable, algo breve pero monumental y abierto a ser debatido por años.",

You're running along with this film chasing it's characters and eventually stepping into their shoes. The Director blurs the line on how close you can get as an audience member. Celebrating performance and also berating uninspired social hierarchy, the media, critics, people on the interwebs.  For me, Birdman gets to the painstaking truth lying just beyond ideas we have about being famous, or successful. It takes you seriously into America's fantasizing, and explores deeply the circles of entertainment. You almost expect to have an intermission, because it requires so much focus, but the film takes respite from its constant motion. Like a well-crafted painting, it leaves moments for the audience to \"rest\" upon before coming at you with another detailed edge. Mostly I just wanted to applaud the performers, their production team, and the director. EVERYONE involved really, that's because it's such a gem- designed by what must be an incredible team of inspired individuals. Birdman is the play, within the movie, within real life that we all must desperately want to be a part of. Keen audience members will remark that the space in which all things happen is really the star of the show. Life it seems is CAPTURED with a flash and a picture frame. Performance is drawn, lifelike, out of the \"real\" situations to only to rise and then fall back into the space of the moving picture. Like man known to death, Birdman knows it's own convictions and place in existence. It's aware that it's a \"Movie\" and seems to want to crash down those walls securely hanging it there. Mostly just incredible through and through, it's a must watch for the season, and for the year. Delivering the kind of mind-bending experience needed the kids these days all tuned in, and never letting you breathe until it's over. So go, and witness all the magic and depth that modern story telling can provide. Draft Two (to be edited and revised)",

A movie shot to look like a play, about an actor who might be magic on the brink of irrelevance putting on a play, Bird Man is a refreshing movie experience for those who are tired of the typical hollywood blockbusters we've become accustomed to from lazy directors like Michael Bay, or James Cameron. Michael Keaton shows us once again why it's a crime he has never been nominated for an Oscar, and why his first nomination could be his first win. Edward Norton once again shows us his prowess and versatility as an actor playing an actor with serious problems that lead him to clash with Keaton and make us think he could also have his first win here, with possibly his strongest performance of a long and brilliant career. Galifianakis, and stone both exceed expectations with career high performances. Put all this together and what you get is the disturbing, funny, and brilliant movie that bird man is, and if it's success in the award season doesn't convince you than watch it yourself and you'll wonder how you ever doubted this movies potential.

The social \"mask\" that he has put on is one of a successful play director and actor, but beneath the façade he has created, he longs for spiritual liberation and to become his true and authentic self. He used to play the superhero Birdman on Broadway, and he felt more at ease and himself when in that role. The whole movie is a metaphor for his cathartic struggle to break free of a life he is miserable in, and the voice in his head that torments him is his id trying to break free. This movie is brilliantly acted, superbly directed, and tautly scripted. It is poetic in parts and tragically funny in others. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Edward Norton and the entire supporting cast all display fine acting, which makes the movie both an easy contender for Best Picture and will undoubtedly find some of the actors with nominations as well. The message is the movie is existential, and is embedded within many layers of profound metaphysics and the issue of authenticity that so many existentialists have struggled to solve. The film is intelligent and creative in its approach and is one of the most complex films of 2014. Immensely enjoyable if not tragic -------------------------------------------------------- A",

Without that not-so-subtle real world connection, what lure would this story have?\n\nWhile it is certainly well made and the actors do a good job with what they are given, it left me wondering what I just watched. There is little, if anything, that is really new regarding subject matter. The sets are realistically grungy and New-York filthy. As a technical production, it goes back to the few-cuts approach used by the likes of Hitchcock, and does it well. But why?\n\nUltimately, I see this as an example of film that will be studied by art directors and editors. It is a movie for people who make movies, and they will be the people who love it the most. For me, it's an oddball that never really drives its message home, though it shows off a lot of talent in the attempt.",

This story has been told before in many ways (have seen many films like this before, not new to me and TV shows with a kinda similar taste as that one of 2 seasons...yeah, SMASH). The music score is not the best (remind me of that show I love called FARGO....oh wait, it works for TV...but not for a movie, oh well). The acting of this cast was strange and at the same time inspiring (the story helps with that but...have seen better). Emma Stone & Keaton are the ones who deserve awards from now on (hope they win a Golden or an Oscar, who knows?). Naomi was great also and the rest too. Alejandro como director es muy bueno but even if he tried not to use editing in most part wehn his editor did...I would have cut all of that (for me it was not worth it but if for Ale works, let it be).

There's a few laughs, but this is definitely not a comedy.\n\nKeaton (Riggan) is great and ably supported by Stone (Sam, his daughter), Norton (Mike - happy to get around in underpants or his birthday suit for most of his scenes) & Watts (Lesley, his co-stars), although Galifianakis is a little wasted. Even though the cinematography is good, the fact it's basically one shot means there's a fair bit of wasted time as we follow characters down hallways. Probably could've been an efficient 100min film, rather than two hours. The other thing I found annoying was the drum/cymbal fills - they're in his mind, but are very distracting.\n\nIt's essentially about ego and the driving force behind actors. Sure, Riggan is a more delusional character than most actors (hopefully!), driven by his insecurity. As the critic says to him: \"you're not an actor - you're a celebrity\". Burn.

Edward Norton and Michael Keaton are quite superb here as the two male leads, the female characters are not written as strongly but Watts does well with what she has as does Stone as the ex addict daughter who just needs to be loved by her father.

Anyways, Birdman is one of the best American movies ever, also one of the best Stage play dramas ever to put on film since Synecdoche, New York last 2007 or 2008 which some critics claimed it to be the best of the 2000s. Inarritu's direction is one that should definitely get an Oscar nomination, look at how he (Inarritu) shot face to face and set to set and area to area, it's truly one of a kind. The performances, I keep saying this over and over again, but here it's no excuse, Keaton should deserve his long awaited best Actor nomination and so does Norton too who I think his best Best movie performance to date since 1998's American History X. Emma Stone and all the other female supporting characters here should get some praised for some of their important and meaningful roles that as we see it, not portrayed as some street hookers or f****d up women. Did I also forgot Zach Galifaniakis here? Is also his fine role here than what we used to see him in some stupid comedic roles, thoroughly a breakthrough performance. The more that I think and go deeper on how Birdman was shot and filmed, I thought of how you can create a piece of art without copying or plagiarizing other people's work, so you see it here, Inarritu's direction is a work or art, from as I said it earlier, the score, the introduction of Keaton and the other characters, the stage with and without the audiences, the stress on and off the stage, the father and daughter arguments, Keaton and Norton arguments, Keaton and his women, the people outside the theater, the New York in day and night, and to the last scene which I can say is more of a resolution to the Birdman. I also found out on the news that they are making a sequel to Birdman and it's gonna be about believe it or not, the prequel to King Kong. \nOther than that, great stuff, we wish we're gonna see more films like this.",

(Not all that dissimilar from the Batman\nfranchise the real-life Keaton starred in 25 years ago). \n\nKeaton's character, Riggan Thompson, is trying to resurrect his career, but as a\nserious actor, by directing and starring in a Broadway play. Pulling of\nthis feat, will have numerous barriers, including a co-star lover, a narcissistic, unpredictable co-star (played Ed\nNorton), that seems to be trying to sabotage the production at every\nturn, if it means staying true to himself, and most importantly, his own self doubt and terror that he is a fraud.\n\nIs Birdman light on plot? To an extent. Although I would say the plot\nrevolves around an aging Hollywood movie star trying to pull off a\nhugely expensive Broadway show, without losing millions of dollars of\ninvestors money, all to see if he can salvage his career, and hence his\nreason for living. But even if some do feel it's light on plot, who cares? It's a\ncompletely engrossing film that follows interesting characters, played\nby actors who are compelling to watch.

As far as I can tell, it is composed of four continuous shots interspersed with time lapsed edits. This becomes somewhat tedious during the first, longest 54 minute continuous shot but Birdman begins to soar in the second hour when the more fantastical elements of the story come to the forefront (involving Michael Keaton's 'split personality' as an actor/celebrity and his superhero alter ego, Bridman). This filming technique and the Broadway setting leads to some 'theatrical acting' (especially from the three biggest stars, Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, and especially Emma Stone). This unbalances the performances a little against the whole ensemble (Edward Norton, Lindsay Duncan, and a notable Amy Ryan). This doesn't help the (somewhat elitist) intellectual, nazel-gazing at its heart about the difference between acting and ACT-ing (thank you). Birdman is certainly a bold experiment in film making  but that doesn't mean it's necessarily a great film. Mark's Grade: B",

            "content": "I have seen Birdman twice. Enjoying it much more the second time. The first time it came off as pretentious and rather bland. I switched my opinion the second time. The film is a triumph. I don't care for any of the praises the world is singing, such as the way it looks like one singular shot. Those things don't matter to me. The story is all that matters, and this has a great one. A very meta one too.\n\nBirdman follows Riggan Thompson, portrayed by Michael Keaton, an actor known for playing a superhero. He's clearly past his glory days, and now, wants another shot at glory, in a completely different medium. Everyone, from critics to his family, laugh and ridicule him for his upcoming project. He writes, directs and starrs in his own play, on Broadway.\n\nIt's a story of redemption. Riggan falls into the trap of trying to please everybody. Ever hear the quote 'I can't tell you how to succeed... but I can tell you how to fail, by trying to please everyone.' That's Riggan. Michael Keaton is magnetic, desperate and angry. He plays an actor so well, his problems, his superficial problems are relevant and funny. Like most actors in our generation. He desires another shot to escape mediocrity. Something he clearly lives in, and is reminded of everyday.\n\nSupporting Keaton, is an all-star cast comprising of Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts. Who all carry and distribute the load well, they have their own issues. These characters could have their own story, their own film, they meld in this seamlessly. These actors and actresses know what they are doing, they know when to be loud, and they know when to be quiet and blend in the background as to not takeover the story. Brilliant effort by the supporting cast.\n\nThe most memorable scene of the film occurs when Riggan argues with a renowned critic. Who wins that scene? Still wondering.\n\nMichael Keaton, delivers a career best performance, and is all but standing on the Oscar stage. While I do think there were better performances in the year of 2014, specifically Jake Gylenhaal and Benedict Cumberbatch in 'NightCrawler' and 'The Imitation Game'. This performance seems like one the Academy would enjoy and give the nod too, and rightfully so.",

            "content": "One thing that this film proves is that even at the age of sixty three, Michael Keaton can rule! This time he is poking fun at the his own career choice of playing a superhero with the fact that he has played Batman (Batman & Batman Returns) in the past makes his appearance all the more hilarious & ironic. The story follows Riggan (Michael Keaton), a washed up actor who used to play a superhero icon called Birdman. In a valiant attempt to reclaim his career, he adapts, directs, and stars in a Broadway play. With problems from one of his very method actors (Edward Norton), assistant daughter (Emma Stone), emotional co-star (Naomi Watts), overly sexual girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), flamboyant producer (Zach Galifanakis), and loving ex- wife (Amy Ryan), Riggan prepares for the breaking point of his career well of course while dealing with his \"inner voice\" of the alter ego Birdman. This movie left me feeling as though every emotion I've ever experienced and every thought I've ever had were condensed in 2 hours of amazing cinema and then reflected back at me, defying me to stare them in the face, right there, where I sitting & saying wow! Every aspect of the film is masterfully crafted and executed & the brilliant cinematography only exemplifies this. The brilliant choice of always having the camera rolling lets the viewer see what happens before and after any given event. This added information creates a realism unknown to nearly every other movie ever made. What better way to capture the raw emotion and awkward stumbling of an angry outburst at your father than to show the immediate reaction of the ranter following her outburst; you get to see the anger slowly fade from her face as the reality of what she said sets in. Rarely does a film come around that manages to be creative, original, funny, well acted, spectacularly anchored, well written and technically profound. The film has an excellent cast ensemble - Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, Ed Norton, Amy Ryan, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, every single actor gets to shine in their moment of screen time provided & utilize its full potential. Michael Keaton has been criminally underutilized in his career, despite some iconic performances. While the nerd crowd (Like me!) worships him as one of the most ideal Bruce Wayne/Batman combo, his career hasn't been stellar and it's a surprise I even knew his name before I saw this film! But his performance in this film deserves all the attention he gets and all the awards he is being nominated for. Riggan is a complex character and you are never quite sure about him, how he feeling and how he feels towards others, not only because of how Riggan changes as the film goes on but also because of how that reflects the ever-changing nature of the film, moving from one question or theme to the other without actually leaving it behind, instead leaving it in the back of your mind for you to think about later. A scene-stealing standout, Edward Norton makes us realize how unspoken dialogue between characters can be just as humorous without the punchline. is brilliant (playing the self-obsessed, ego-driven actor who feels more real on the stage than off it, Mike Shiner). Emma Stone has finally arrived in 2014!! Criminally misused and passed over by Hollywood for \"bigger name\" actresses, Stone finally shows the world what they've been missing. In one single scene, Stone revolutionizes and captures the essence of a \"father-daughter\" with a ferocity that you couldn't see from any other performer. She finds the heart and soul of Sam, laying her on the screen meticulously and transparent. Zach Galifanakis (playing Riggan's agent, Jake) is probably his most grounded role, is also brilliant. Though brief in screen time, the vivacious Naomi Watts, the sexy Andrea Riseborough, and the seasoned Amy Ryan make their marks exquisitely. Watts gets the most chuckles out of the ladies while Ryan has the greatest arc for us to explore. The only criticism I have about the film is that more aren't like it. A smart, satirical movie that is capable of criticizing without being hypocritical is unfortunately rare. However, it's rather nice to have movies like this stand out from the crowd instead of being the norm, because the relative quality only makes them that much better. On the whole \"Birdman\" is so damn enjoyable and one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It charms not just because of its story, but because of the performances and slick way that director Alejandro González Iñárritu plays with tone. It's downright hilarious in parts, and then there's the dramatic edge that comes into play, and simply breaks your heart. Above all, \"Birdman\" is a celebration of cinema. It's an audacious achievement that floors just about every aspect of film witnessed in 2014.",

Its far-reaching impact on the world of cinema shall be felt for many years into the future, its commentary on the criticism and management of the showbiz world real and resonant.\n\nSo why does Birdman feel so god-damned overdone?\n\nFormer cinema superhero Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It's risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he's a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a castmate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor (Edward Norton) who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife. Courtesy of Google\n\nEvery single scene in this film is full of bright lights, energetic performances; shouting, screaming, laughing, weeping, thrasing, sweeping. The melodrama is constant. The aggression is admirably palpable; though strangely not as consistent as one would desire. Birdman is, honestly, a bit of a mess. It's a redundant, self-indulgent, highly entertaining mess of a film. It's a film of pretentious standards; one that believes in merits, ideals and concepts that it views, at least from my examinations, as profound or unique. The concepts that it tackles are so overtly blatant that it's completely laughable. Iñárritu smashes the idea that corrupted, ungenuine film, stage and entertainment criticism is ruining the business right into our heads, and you can be sure that no audience member, whether they actually give a shit or pay attention to the metaphorical components behind the flashy exterior, will be able to gather a clear understanding of exactly what the director is trying to provoke. Hasn't the man ever heard of the word \"subtlety\"?\n\nPerhaps he's saying that the only way to get through the thick skulls of casual cinema-goers and producers alike is to shout at them; to throttle them and throw them about; to scream right into their ears until they adhere and can fully comprehend what you're saying? Tell them in the loudest voice possible that they're spending money on bullshit franchises, sagas and action films whilst the \"art\", what should be earning recognition and money, is shunned and thrown into the dirt. But by doing this, everything within Birdman becomes so immensely literal; for something that appears to be trying to provoke higher thought or commentary, there really isn't any place higher to look for Iñárritu's thoughts on the showbiz world than the surface level of the film. That coupled with the fact that nothing that Iñárritu is saying is really that original or inventive makes Birdman into a thoroughly disengaging film on the level of metaphorical importance.\n\nAt this point, it sounds as if I'm completely shitting on the film. In all reality though, I really loved a majority of this picture. It's infuriatingly obvious in what it's trying to say, but that doesn't necessarily mean its message is unimportant. It's self-importance doesn't at all have me disregarding the technical weight of this oft-times astounding picture. The cinematography, provided by one of the greats of our generation, Emmanuel Lubezki (responsible for the cinematography for Gravity and The Tree of Life; two of the best looking films of the past decade), is fast-paced and always moving forward. As you've undoubtedly already heard, the film is made to look like it's shot in one take, and it is an amiable effort from all those involved to produce a film which looks as good as this does whilst also contending with the issue of not having time to recoup between smaller takes; every single individual take is long and arduous, and so even minor changes in terms of the lighting equipment and set design would've been irritating, time consuming and major in the scheme of things.\n\nLubezki's cinematography, working alongside the immensely compact set design which emphasizes the limited space provided within Broadway theatres, is intimate, even in the scenes of larger size, and is always frantic and moving. Whereas many directors vie for complete and utter control of their camera movements, Iñárritu and Lubezki allow the frame to roam, traversing high and low, capturing all the variables of the performances provided by the incredible actors and actresses on offer. There really isn't a film which I can actively compare to Birdman on a visceral level, and so despite any gripes that anyone may have with the film on a storytelling level, I find it hard to believe that anyone can fault the efforts of those involved in terms of cinematography, lighting, set design, etc.\n\nAlso deserving of universal acclaim is perhaps the greatest editing I've ever seen in a film, period. To match up the individual takes so goddamn perfectly deserves nothing but praise; Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione are geniuses. I can't even imagine how much tedious work it would have required to have it feel so seamless! And then we move into the performances; to describe the acting in this film, the vast majority of it feels alive. Invigorating, as fast as the speed of the camera, and full of personality; despite my numerous quibbles with the slapstick comedy and dull \"raunchy\" humour that the screenplay contains, those who deliver the lines are oft-times sensational. The lead, Michael Keaton, is nothing short of outstanding. Every single second that he was on screen, my heart was pumping and I felt rejuvenated. It wasn't on the same level as Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game or Bradley Cooper in American Sniper, but Keaton's immensely aggressive, assured performance is worthy of admiration all the same. The rest of the ensemble is either outstanding with their roles or greatly melodramatic (still entertaining at that, though). Edward Norton is fantastic, enacting the self-indulgence that his character displays perfectly, and provides what is undoubtedly the closest thing to a perfect performance from a supporting cast member all throughout. Zach Galifianakis is almost as incredible, his line delivery some of the fastest and most versatile on offer; his humour always hitting. Other performances, including those from Emma Stone and Naomi Watts in particular, feel far more artificial, and despite a quality monologue from the former around halfway through, don't contain as much lively energy as the others around them.\n\nAll that said, no matter how impressive the performances, they can't help but be pulled down into the unavoidable abyss that is Iñárritu's constant bombardment of melodrama. Whilst the numerous (by this, I mean a shit-tonne) hostile exchanges between characters are often engaging to begin with, their constant reintroduction and implementation feels immensely forced; not necessarily due to the work of the performers, but because of Iñárritu's relentless direction and need to make everything as flamboyant and huge as possible. There are only so many times where I can take a verbal sparring match seriously, before it becomes repetitive and redundant, as it does here. Still, there are times when it is entirely applaudable; the first few times Keaton's character Riggan loses his shit, whether it be towards himself or a fellow actor, it's hard not to sit up in your seat and watch with interest and intent.\n\nWhether I sound like I'm contradicting myself when I say this or not, I don't care; I did enjoy Birdman. I enjoyed its technical achievements, the performances, the intensity and frenzied pace of the entire thing. It was a heap of fun! All the same, I can't help but feel like Iñárritu is being immensely self-indulgent all throughout; I can almost hear him screaming at the Academy to award him with as many top honours as possible. His desire to provoke something more, something we haven't seen, seems only detrimental to an otherwise fun and vibrant picture. How this can be seen as groundbreaking or one of the best of the year, I may never know. Films like Under the Skin, Whiplash and The Grand Budapest Hotel seem far more unique in their execution and ideas than Birdman, a film which thinks of itself as if it is the opus of cinematic expression in 2014. It's a great film all the same, whether or not you can move past the ego that is obviously at play all throughout.",

He has decided to step away from it all and throw all his money in on produing, writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play. Here we see the trials and tribulations leading up to opening night. Riggan battles against the cast, his family, his agent, critics, but mostly his own ego which comes in the form of his former alter-ego.\nKeaton is quite the perfect casting in the lead role, but he heads up a delightful stellar ensemble. The story has notes of Woody Allen in it, especially as it is ensconced in New York, but its wry snappy humour does help too.\nThe cinematography is quite something from Emmanuel Lubezki. Tracking shots flow out through walls, up and in through windows. The magical realism has some lovely subtle touches at the start, but in the last reel they do get a bit much. Brilliant editing though.\nTis a very wry look at acting. Cinema vs theatre. Art vs commerce etc. Sometimes things get a little too on the nose, but this is a fun time to be had. Edward Norton's performance is a riot.",

This is a film that builds and builds, and you will laugh with enjoyment with - it's rich in dialogue and the various spats between characters invest you in the success or failure of the opening night.

            "content": "After the critically lauded Boyhood (which I didn't like) I entered the critically lauded Birdman with some trepidation but within just a few minutes I felt that I was watching something genuinely special. We begin by following an out-of-the-limelight actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is attempting to put on a Broadway play after 20 years of being known as the star of a Hollywood superhero franchise called Birdman. After an accident knocks out his underperforming co-star, Keaton is recommended to use the actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who joins the ensemble, yet comes into conflict with all involved especially Keaton himself. As Riggan prepares for the preview shows, he is also seen battling with his relationships including the ever-watchable Emma Stone playing the \"hot mess\" of a daughter and with Andrea Risenborough (seen in the sci-fi Oblivion) as Keaton's possibly pregnant girlfriend. The acting is top-notch throughout with brilliant group dynamics and a cast that also includes Naomi Watts as a frustrated actress and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife. \n\nAlthough Edward Norton will be rightly regarded as playing a great supporting performance the real surprise here is Zach Galifianakis as Keaton's producer trying to help his client hold it all together. Zach to me is a cinematic jinx for me, playing the same unlikeable idiot in each film but here I felt he was much more suited to the straight man role as the Producer trying to keep it all together emotionally and financially. Although flashes of his comedy were here, it was all part of the story and played with a much lighter touch. The film includes both laugh out loud moments and tenderly played family scenes as well as metaphorical scenes of the metaphysical - as Keaton is shown floating and using telekinesis - which are brilliantly used when he trashes his dressing room and fights his \"alter ego\". \n\nYou could view the movie as a narrative on Hollywood versus Theatre - there's plenty of heavy handed moments involving critics as well as YouTube and social media commentary - or as a treatise on getting old and feeling relevant but it's the private moments and Keaton's subtle performance that stick with you most. One technical aspect of the film which never took me out of the movie (unlike Boyhood's unique conceit) was that the film 'appears' to be one shot. That's right, there are no obvious cuts at all in the film- digital trickery plus clever pans like Hitchcock's 'Rope' cover the breaks - but it works brilliantly as the camera floats around the actors, up the side of buildings and through windows whilst also using different devices to show the passing of time. \n\nAn enigmatic ending open to interpretation is fitting for a film that balances both sides of someone's self-image and the audience can bring their own views on the story at its conclusion. With a unique style, a group of actors playing to their strengths, a well-played out narrative and an interesting score (by jazz drummer Antonio Sanchez) Birdman is a great achievement and one I recommend you checking out before a no-doubt successful night at the 2014 Oscars.\n\n9/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

It's also something that is really hard to know exactly what to make of it in just one viewing, but the fact is that I enjoyed it enough to happily sit through it again. In fact it may be brilliant and I simply haven't realised it. Only time will tell. But in the mean time this is a wonderfully assembled comic drama with brilliant one take direction that needs to be seen to be fully believed (even if you can spot the joins), the amount of work that must have gone into it is unimaginable. The writing, despite the story not being what one would call overly substantial, is razor sharp; and as everyone who's seen this already have thus far said, the acting throughout the entire cast is outstanding. This has its sights set on the jugular to many different aspects of the entertainment industry, from the differences of attitude in stage and screen; with critics getting a good roasting, which is both fun and brave. If you want something smart, unique, with solid lumps of pure gold quality added in every corner, then this is an enjoyable, very quirky must watch.",

This film still possesses almost all of those qualities, but the chaotic plot distracted me a little bit, especially given the continuous-shot style (which is actually trademark of the film's cinematographer - Mr. Lubezki), which followed the intention of Inarritu and built an emotional bridge between the protagonist and the audience of being restrained and claustrophobic,  but I did not enjoy that much (except for the final shot with the big blue eyes of Emma Stone scintillating under the sunlight, which is simply perfect shot!). Still, this film has absolutely excellent cast, which are all very very cinematically beautiful (even the male characters) and very very able in their roles.

            "content": "\"Birdman (Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" is a simply excellent film. Why? There is a scene in \"Birdman\" where Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton), who is trying to direct and star in his Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver play \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", walks towards the front of the stage and talks about love, what it is to be loved, and how we all crave that. But is it love we crave? Or, as Sam (played by Emma Stone) puts it, is Riggan confusing love with admiration? These are some of the many wide-ranging questions that \"Birdman\" leaves you with as you leave the cinema and you thus don't really realise how good the cast, direction, dialogue and score are until you've given up on those questions, realising that they are just too difficult to answer.\nThe cast is simply stellar in \"Birdman\", brilliantly led by Michael Keaton in what Variety's Peter Debruge calls the \"comeback of the century\" and which I agree with him over. However, I'm not sure if Michael Keaton would accept this title, in a recent interview promoting the film he laughed at the concept, yet the comparisons between his career and that of Riggans are unavoidable, he also laughed when this was bought up too. But, to be fair, all I knew of Michael Keaton before I saw \"Birdman\" was that he had starred in the 1989 \"Batman\" film as well as in its 1992 sequel \"Batman Returns\".  His career hasn't been stellar and it's a surprise I even knew his name before I saw \"Birdman\" really... But his performance in this film deserves all the attention he gets and all the awards he is being nominated for. Riggan is a complex character and you are never quite sure about him, how he feeling and how he feels towards others, not only because of how Riggan changes as the film goes on but also because of how that reflects the ever-changing nature of the film, moving from one question or theme to the other without actually leaving it behind, instead leaving it in the back of your mind for you to think about later.\nAgain, as I said earlier, the rest of the cast is great too. Edward Norton is brilliant (playing the self-obsessed, ego-driven actor who feels more real on the stage than off it, Mike Shiner). But then Miles is so much more than that and again it's hard to put your finger on what or who he is and what he is looking for. Zach Galifanakis (playing Riggan's agent, Jake) who is trying to keep Riggan grounded, is also brilliant and then so is Emma Stone and Naomi Watts (although both seem to be in very familiar roles). I could go on listing actors and actresses but it would just be a paragraph of names. (Last one I promise but Amy Ryan also does well playing Riggan's ex-wife Slyvia.)\nBut each of these is alleviated, and should thanking him in any of their Oscars speeches, by the film's director, Alejandro González Iñárritu. Alejandro hasn't done many English-Language films before (except Babel in 2006 and 21 Grams in 2003), and considering that, it makes his direction in \"Birdman\" even more outstanding. Where he really excels is in how \"Birdman\" is seemingly filmed in one take. These really emphasise how good the acting is in this film, be it a monologue by Emma Stone as she rants at her dad, a take that involves Michael Keaton walking in just his underpants through Times Square, or a scene where Keaton and Edward Norton rehearse on stage. What makes these one takes even better is how the film is almost entirely set in St. James Theatre and you really get a feel for it as you glide around it in these one takes, feeling, seeing and hearing everything that is going on. It truly is an experience. I loved every moment of it and what this ultimately did for me was make me feel like I was part of the production, as if I was being given this behind the scenes look at what was going on. This thrill inspired me to get back into acting, something that I used to do a lot of. What happens with this you as the film goes on, you begin to realise that this is less of a trip to the cinema and more of a trip to the theatre. It's a good mix of both and I can't really imagine it being the same on DVD, although it never is. I will definitely be seeing it again.\n\nBirdman's dialogue is great too and it matches the fast-paced score of \"Birdman\". Both are unique, with the dialogue being fast-paced, witty and blackly comic and the score being performed and composed entirely by the four-time Grammy winner and first-time film composer drummer Antonio Sanchez. Yeah. Drummer. The film's score is made up of two instruments, the drums and the cymbals. And it works perfectly! Its good not just because of how I haven't experienced something like this before, but also because it builds on that idea of you being a part of the production thanks to the one takes, but makes you feel as if that these drums are not just in your head and are there for benefit of the audience, but that they are in the actors heads. In testament to this, we occasionally see Sanchez' brother performing as we walk past be it in the theatre or in Times Square.\n\n\"Birdman\" is a unique film. And that is where its brilliance lies. Just like how when you are in a production and the curtains come down on closing night you come to think that you really did not want that to end, and I had the same feeling when \"Birdman\" did. Its cast, score and direction are all what will be directly nominated come the Oscars, but there is no specific award for the questions \"Birdman\" made me think about, the way \"Birdman\" made me feel and the lessons \"Birdman\" taught me.",

Look a blatantly sad movie can leave a bad taste in your mouth but this majestic movie found a way to give it the saddest ending ever while tricking people into thinking things are okay................ let me start   he definitely tried to kill himself  with the gun. he failed at his second try at suicide(when he was on the roof he was thinking about it )  Now when he woke up and lived . i only have ideas on why or how he felt  but he did 1000% jumped from that hospital window and died ya it looked like he  flew but that is not it  his daughter comes in the room to look for him  looks out the window looks down then looks up and smirks laughs whatever  but  the reason behind that  is  she had felt  he was never there for her or loved her enough she explains to edward norton then when she finally comes to her senses  that she was kind of being a bitch too  even though he still sucked at being a dad but no reason to hate him anymore and  she express  her new found love to him moments before  her  realizing he had left her again alone   witch is just really super ironic and funny in its own way therefore the laughing ...ALSO the man had attained everything   his family career money every thing  losing his sanity along the way  also i felt he had planed on shooting himself  when ed nortan told him to get a better gun or mainly when he was giving up on the play to zack  an he dumbly thought he helped by lying to him but just further pushed a man to suicide (gun was in a box loaded rdy to go on top shelf hidden)when he had the conversation with the movie critic she messed him up and he almost killed himself earlier than planned the good Samaritan saved him for him to soar to his real blaze of glory  witch he immiediatly tried and the man failed .  wish i was sure on why he jumped out the window to kill himself when he lived through the attempts  i'm guessing humiliation or sumthing deeper up to you ........ my first review i know is a  lil crude and lazy",

            "content": "The show biz satire and dissection of Hollywood, Broadway and fame in the film Birdman,  written, produced and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, will either satisfy you or turn you completely off.  I have heard both from various people; I happen to belong to the former.  The film stars an extraordinary performance by Michael Keaton as the leading protagonist, Riggan Thomson, Edward Norton as Broadway actor, Mike Shiner, Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's lawyer and friend Jake, Naomi Watts as Lesley, Mike's girlfriend, Emma Stone, as Riggan's daughter, Sam, and Andrea Riseborough (Riggan's girlfriend Laura) and Amy Ryan (Sylvia, Riggan's ex-wife). The supporting cast, chosen well, only highlights Inarritu's script and directorial abilities.\nThe story deals with a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" written, directed and starring a faded Hollywood actor (Keaton) who was well-known for his superhero role as Birdman in an attempt to recapture some of his fame through this particular production. Is this reality imitating life? (Keaton played Batman twice in Tim Burton's versions of the same!)\nThe plot tells the story of Riggan (Keaton) who unfortunately is being besieged by the voice of Birdman, a character he became famous for, while he envisions himself performing some small acts of telekinesis and levitation.  He is hoping as I have already stated to reinvent his sagging career with the adaptation of Carver's short story in this Broadway play, being produced by Jake, and starring Riggan and his girlfriend Laura, plus Lesley, Mike's girlfriend.  Riggan's recovering drug addict daughter works as his assistant. Realizing that he needs a better actor in one of the supporting actor's parts, Riggan replaces him with method actor Mike.  During a preview, Riggan laments that he does not exist and shoots himself.  It is here that Riggan is advised by Mike to use a more realistic prop gun, and while reading the early reviews of the play, discovers that Mike has stolen the spotlight from him and that Mike is his daughter Sam's lover.  \nLocking himself out of the theater, Riggan has to walk through Times Square in his underwear to get back inside.  Running into critic Tabitha Dickinson, who lets him know that she really does not care for Hollywood celebrities who she believes pretend to be actors and will give the play a negative review, in essence, killing its chance for success.  Using a real gun for the final scene on opening night, he shoots his nose off while he is on stage, receiving a standing ovation.  In the hospital, he learns that the critic gave the play a positive review.  Sam visits and then leaves and returns to his room only to find him gone and the window open.  Looking up, she smiles while looking out at the sky.  \nThe film has been nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Score, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress and SAG awards in the same categories as well.  The screenwriters, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. And Armando Bo, along with Inarritu have written a marvelous script, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Oscar winner for Gravity) was filmed as if it was one continuous take going back and forth from reality to illusion with little or no break in the filming.  This is a very dark and twisted comedic film showing what someone's desperation can cause his behavior and actions to succeed in his chosen career that has hit the skids can do.  \nThe film, shot at the St. James Theater in New York City, begins with a quote from one of my favorite writers, Raymond Carver, whose short story the play being performed in the film is about and an excellent choice to explain what is happening in Riggan's life (and head).  I am not a big fan of voiceover and the film had more than enough scattered throughout the film, which to me was very annoying.  The use of drums also was used strongly and seemed to distract from the action on screen.  It is a well scripted and acted film. Plus makeup, costuming, dialog, acting, lots of close ups to show emotions...all done wonderfully!   If you haven't seen it, you should.  It is worth the price of a ticket, if nothing else then to see Michael Keaton (or his double) fly over the New York City skyline!  GRADE: 4 of 5 crowns",

The cast all round were superb in carrying a film which could have easily come across as pretentious if not handled with such tongue-in-cheek aplomb. The ending however did feel slightly aloof, no matter what interpretation you take of it (no spoilers here!) but as a whole Birdman is a gripping, emotional film with some of the best camera work and music scoring I can recall.

It seems like most of this film is done in one take, which made me start thinking about where the film was really cut, and where the cameraman was in certain scenes.  I shouldn't be thinking those things in a film.  It is distracting.  It might have been a cool idea in a student film, but here it just feels like a gimmick.  In fact, just casting Michael Keaton in this film feels like a gimmick - he is playing an actor know for playing a super hero, leaving the franchise, who is trying to be taken seriously as an actor now.  Also, the ending is just such an \"Independent movie\" ending.  It just makes my eyes roll.  We've seen it before and it wasn't all that great the first time.\n\nThe performances were all good.  I thought Edward Norton was perfect.  I think this movie is good, but considering all of the award attention it is getting, I thought it would be better.  I expected more.",
