La película empieza bien y ofrece buena acción y drama, pero a medida que avanza, toda expectativa comienza a descender. En realidad este no es el final épico que la saga podría haber tenido y la muerte de la hermanita de Katniss fue algo injusto al final. Las actuaciones, la acción, la banda sonora y la producción son destacables. Jennifer Lawrence aún sigue siendo lo mejor de la saga y es una pena que esta película como capítulo final deja mucho que desear. Un final bastante suave y nada épico para una saga que empezó muy bien en sus inicios con las primeras dos entregas. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 7/10.",

The notion that they absolutely littered the entire city with death traps and thought not to put anything in the easily-accessible sewer system until after they'd went there is just completely unbelievable and neither side would ever have put themselves in position for the climax to happen the way it did; if detonating really was Coin's idea then Snow's decision to bring everyone to his mansion is among the dumbest choices in the history of war. They didn't play up Peeta's \"real or not real\" thing enough for her choosing him over the far superior Gale  to feel right. The sewer part of the journey was unnecessarily long and the zombies, while effectively suspenseful, felt contrived for the sole purpose of killing off some of the protagonists. Of all the young adult literature adaptations from the era this one has the worst finale of them all by quite a wide margin.",

Some of the supporting characters were more interesting to me than the two headliners.

Based on the award winning book, the long awaited sequel marks the finale of the film series that made actress Jennifer Lawrence a star and inspired young girls the world over to rock the braided ponytail and take up archery classes. When we last left Katniss Everdeen and her friends, she was in the midst of planning an invasion of the Capitol city in District 1 to seize control of the country of Panam from the villainous President Snow who had just succeeded in brainwashing and turning the love of Katniss' life Peeta and turning into a slobbering lap dog of the capitol. Now, Ms. Everdeen and company soldier on towards The Capitol, destiny and a reckoning with President Snow.\n\nI really have to commend this movie on its faithfulness to the book. Director Francis Lawrence really did a great job of turning the book into an action packed adventure. The movie was well shot and the supporting cast did a really good job too especially Jena Malone and Michelle Forbes. The only qualms I have with the movie come from it's dramatic moments between Peeta and Katniss which all come off as hokey and overly manufactured to seem more dramatic than they should be. At the same time, other moments, that actually were naturally dramatic and probably should have been focused on are played a lot dryer than they should have been. Ultimately, I can't fault the movie too much because in actuality, the book played things out in the same way, and what am I going to do about that? Complain that the movie is too much like the book?\n\nOn the whole, I liked a lot that this movie had to offer. The special effects and action sequences were very impressive and it was very loyal to the source material; so much so that the only things I didn't like about the movie were the same things I didn't like about the book. So if you liked the novels, I definitely recommend seeing the film but if you're just a movie watcher, you might be less satisfied. In the end The Mocking Jay Part 2 gets a 3.5...out of 5.",

There's some really memorable moments as well like Coin's death, the battle in the sewers and the ending scene. Also, I love how it wasn't just a predictable finale about the rebels marching into the capitol and killing Snow. It has deep themes about the futility of war and tryannical rulers emerging. the However, cutting the book into two parts really affected this movie. Mockingjay Part 1 did drag out a bit but it wasn't a big deal but considering this is a part 2 and the book is pretty short at 390 pages, it made the movie drag and have more build up and it's clear they were trying to stretch it to a 2 hour movie.  It also suffers from blindly following the book ironically. Mockingjay is easily my least favorite Hunger Games book (still good but not great) due to infuriating decisions in the story like knocking Katniss out when the rebels finally win as well as not really letting Katniss do much! It's still a good ending but it's no Deathly Hallows Part 2 or Return of the King. (B)",

I disliked the first 30 mins alot, too much poor plot development that just isnt really compelling. Hardly any haymitch, the new characters are bad again, and alot of moments at the end just felt off and shouldn't have fallen into place like they did imo.  \n\nOverall, I liked it ... I wasnt too fond of it on my first viewing, but after a second rewatch I liked it alot more! a mostly satisfying ending (at least for Peeta and Katniss)",

The cast continues to carry their characters to new depths and the story unfolds into many twists and turns. The ending feels like it accomplishes what the films set out to do, but without a chance to breathe from the final scenes it’s hard to fully be invested how our characters journeys end.",

Lawrence's direction is solid for the bittersweet end as he makes the action exhilarating, while the Mockingjay's revolutionary losses hurt. He could have done something more experimental as The Hunger Games now feels old hat with so many dystopian coming of age movies around now. Collins' writing is very clever with tyrants and revolutionaries getting critiqued for their brutal methods. I like how Katniss is not the deciding figurehead of the revolution, but merely a symbol of righteousness as The Mockingjay. Her decisive final arrow is a spectacular movie moment, but President Snow's downfall occurs earlier thanks to the people rising up against their oppressive government.\n\nJennifer Lawrence is wonderful as the heroine Katniss Everdeen. She puts the weight of the world on her capable shoulders with emotive acting and stalwart bravery in the face of danger. Lawrence captures the modern woman who can be both strong and emotional without judgement. I liked her as an actress for all 4 Hunger Games films. \n\nFurthermore, Josh Hutcherson is great as the brainwashed Peeta Mellark learning to love again. Liam Hemsworth's conflicted feelings are apparent as Gale Hawthorne. Willow Shields is as devastating as Primrose Everdeen as is Mahershala Ali as Boggs. I am sad to see Sam Claflin's Finnick Odair go. I adore the gorgeous Natalie Dormer's courageous camera director Cressida as well as the striking Jena Malone's feisty Johanna Mason.\n\nDonald Sutherland is fantastic as he bows down as the fearsome dictator President Snow. Julianne Moore is amazing as the coldly shrewd President Alma Coin. Philip Seymour Hoffman still gets some memorable moments as revolutionary tactician Plutarch Heavensbee. Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks get emotional send offs as Katniss' mentors Haymitch Abernathy and Effie Trinket. Jeffrey Wright is interesting as the tech wizard Beetee. Stanley Tucci is wasted as the propaganda announcer Caesar Flickerman.\n\nJames Newton Howard's score is the unsung hero of The Hunger Games franchise with his emotionally sweeping music. Jo Willems' cinematography comes up with several crafty shots that frame the revolution and the dictators with equal majesty and gravitas. I just wish Suzanne Collins' writing was stuck to more besides her heartfelt look at teenagers building a new world. The zombies underground and the furry fashion designer was just dumb. I think there should have been more action or Katniss shooting her bow to keep you engaged.\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a bit bloated at 137 minutes, especially when the endings keep coming without satisfaction. I wanted a happier ending I suppose, instead of the bittersweet one with few farewells.",

To critique a story, not only we must see the words written, but also those meant, what happens between the scenes, or after the end.

And how more sexist can it get (meant spoiler), the ending? The hero —and a few more characters— can do a big success , like a revolution. But what about the rest? We can't all be big success, otherwise no one would be. This is a competitive view on society, and most stories are based on this, as well as a \"villain\" who makes the protagonist \"the good guy\" for no apparent reason: they good guys don't seem to make any big choices: they were just born in this world and (violently) fight for their lives. It also glorifies violence to some extent. And how can a story (action or not) be without all these? It can, and I have read it. This book (\"Political thinking for the masses: way to freedom\", Tsikoudis) talks about life, how we can be without all these (hatred, violence, demonization, sexism).",

Instead of giving us an explosive finale, it’s more like entire a bottomless pit, the story takes many turns and it’s grim all around, save for an ounce of hope towards the end of the film. I respect the decision because the book was like that. Jennifer Lawrence gives a subtle but emotionally complex performance as Katniss Everdeen. If it’s predecessors were about being angry, she pulls it off. In this final installment, her anger had simmered down, in its place is a more weary Katniss, a young woman thrown into the ringer too many times. It’s compelling and devastating to watch. ",

            "content": "This is not an action movie, but it has a lot of action scenes of the final struggle between the rebellion and president Snow. It also has many drama scenes which explore the evolution of the characters and political developments in Panem. Fans of action movies might be irritated by the amount of drama scenes. The movie is an atypical anti-war drama since it plays inside a revolution and avoids most of the typical battle scenes of other (anti-)war movies but instead depicts violence in unusual ways. When violence appears on screen, it sometimes is gruesome, bordering on horrific. The story explores several highly significant topics of warfare, which are ignored by other war movies. The movie has an original score with truly remarkable tracks, some romantic, some wildly energetic, others iconic for the franchise.\nThe pacing had some problems. some scenes were stretched out without necessity, e.g. at the begin of the team operation in the Capitol. On the other side, the climax of the war needed a little more time, a steady cam and a zoom into the scene.\n\nThe acting in the last part of the franchise was again very good. Donald Sutherland shines again as diabolic, cold blooded tyrant in his final fight against his arch enemy Katniss Everdeen and her friends. Jenna Malone and Sam Claflin are very convincing. Josh Hutcherson shows an astounding variety and intensity of his character. Jennifer Lawrence portrays the evolving personality of Katniss Everdeen with precision, lots of detail and calm power.\n\nThe story of the revolution comes to an end. This movie is thematically extremely dark. The revolution war creates hell on earth. The characters undergo transformation under the immense pressure of what happens around them. War brings out the best and the worst in humans. Everybody has a choice: be shattered into pieces by the violence or be consumed by hate or grow to a personal strength that allows to love and protect fellow men?\n\"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.\" - Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\n\nSnow delivered a massive precision strike against Katniss at the end of part 1. That threw Katniss and Peeta into a very personal hell where her soul and Peeta's are suffering agony. Her strongest personality trait which has always been her saving grace since her father died is the one which keeps her alive and going. With sheer willpower Katniss stands up and determines herself on getting revenge for Peeta.  Katniss is not crying anymore for peeta in this movie. She shed so many tears in part 1, now she is emotionally exhausted. But Katniss still has her morality, charisma, willpower and wits.\n\nWhile Peeta undergoes a very slow mental healing in hospital, Coin uses Katniss as a propaganda tool for her rebel army on the path to Snow. During the fights, Katniss gets into life threatening situations where firepower cannot save her but only her personality can. She is appalled by the cruelness and perfidiousness of some allies and she has to reconsider whom she can trust. She feels more alone than ever.\nIn the beginning of the movie, her revenge for Peeta is all that matters to her, but after she witnesses the love other people show to each other, she undergoes another personality transformation. Katniss declares that Snow corrupts everybody and everything. She realizes that Snow is a threat to all good and the love inside humans. She commits herself to kill Snow, so that love can continue to exist, even if this costs her own life.\nKatniss grows beyond her borders again and emancipates herself from the rebellion. She has more important things to do than posing for propaganda videos or fight for Coin's power. Katniss decides she has to liberate humanity from Snow's corrupting influence, from surveillance cameras, propaganda and deadly games.\n\nBut on her path towards fulfilling her self selected destiny, Katniss runs into an obstacle. She is forced to join Coin's propaganda team to create more videos for Coin. During her march towards Snow, she has to convince the team on her mission, she has to survive Snow's deadly traps and cope with a reappearance of Peeta, who is still somewhat brainwashed and a lethal danger to Katniss. Katniss realizes she cannot let go of Peeta and tries to heal him with the power of her love. As they fight through the Capitol, her team has to save each other's lives many times. Nonetheless, her comrades die left and right beside her. Katniss realizes she made a horrible mistake, she also underestimated Snow's power and Snow lands a devastating strike. Katniss cannot stand the pain anymore. She Is in her darkest hour, but she is not alone. Her friends put her onto her feet and Katniss finds her resolve to march forward as long as she lives. But the worst has yet to come. Katniss has to endure a boundless amount of pain which threatens to destroy both her body and her mind. \n\nKatniss receives a revelation from an unexpected source. She has to make one final decision that changes the life of everyone in Panem forever. To fulfill her destiny, Katniss depends on her ability to grow beyond her borders, rely on her own morality and on the trust of her friends.\n\nThe movie shows the immediate and long term effects of Katniss' decisions during the revolution.\n\nWatch the movie until the end of credits. The music is sensational. The best film score I ever heard.\n\nINTERPRETATION of the entire franchise:\n\nAfter having read several analyses of book readers and movie watchers, I want to present the most fascinating one of them:\nThe story of Katniss is the search of a soul for union with god.\nIn the entire franchise there is no mention or sign of any religion, instead a tyrant enslaves humanity with violence (in the districts) and hedonism (in the Capitol). This tyrant subdues morality, awareness, compassion and conscience in humans. He corrupts everybody and everything, he turns humans and animals into murderers and Monsters (mutts). He is the personification of Satan who reigns on earth.\n\nIn her innocent childhood, Katniss was in union with god, personificated by her father. The books describe her unconditional love and closeness towards him. In this state, Katniss represented Adam, the ancestor of humanity being in Eden.  After she lost her father, Katniss and her mother fell out of Eden into the harsh world and had to live in world without god. Her mother represents Eve who enters a catatonic state of despair from the loss of union with god in Eden. Now Katniss' personality is a hybrid of masculinity and femininity, she is hunting, feeding and comforting as father and mother to her Family, representing all of humankind.\n\nIn the 74th hunger games, Katniss meets Rue, which symbolizes a plant which can heal the eyes. Katniss begins to see Rue as another sister. Witnessing Rue's violent death enables Katniss to express powerful love and compassion for other people and to see the requirement for all people to love other people as brothers and sisters. This is the begin of the end of Satan's reign on earth as her behaviour is televised to everbody and inspires them to follow her example.\n\nPeeta saved Katniss' life when he nourished her with bread. He saves her again from the career tributes. He inspires Katniss to tears with his realistic painting of Rue's grave. He has been in love with Katniss (humankind) since he saw her the first time and he publicly declares his love for Katniss. At the end of the 74th games, Peeta wants to sacrifice his life so that Katniss will be redeemed from the deadly games. Haymitch tells Katniss she would not deserve Peeta in 100 lifetimes. Peeta represents Jesus Christ who unconditionally loves, protects and inspires the humankind he is willing to die for.\n\nBefore the 75th games, Peeta declares publicly: \"the bond of love is our greatest prize. For it is true love that allows us all to bear our hardships, that mends the heart and banishes loneliness and gives meaning to our lifes.\" This is Jesus Christ explaining to humankind that love is the essence of divinity. Katniss (representing humankind) has to find love for Peeta for her soul to find redemption and union with god. In a conversation in the train, Peeta encourages her to open her soul to accept a bond with him. During the victory tour, Katniss' soul is in pain and fear and when she asks Peeta to stay with her during night, Peeta comforts Katniss and pledges eternal support. They spend each night together in bed, but there is no sexuality. Katniss will never again be alone with her fear in the darkness, Katniss and Peeta have made an eternal bond between Jesus Christ and humankind, so that humans bonded with Christ do not have to fear death anymore.\n\nDuring the 75th games, when Peeta nearly dies, Katniss realizes the strength of her love for Peeta, she panics at the prospect of losing him. The importance of the eternal bond between Christ and humankind is fully realized in Katniss and that bond must never be broken. Peeta donates a pearl to Katniss as a token and pledge of the eternal love of Christ to humankind. Katniss holds this pearl close and safe for the rest of her life. It will remind her of Peeta's love when she cannot see him.\n\nKatniss commits to sacrificing her life to destroy the game arena of Snow (Satan), thereby breaking the power of Satan on earth. Her body nearly dies, she passes out, her arms are spread out, light from above shines onto her while she is being lifted into the sky. Katniss has become a martyr. But her task on earth is not finished yet, so she wakes up and comes back to earth. Katniss endures a figurative death and rebirth as the Mockingjay because she has followed the example of Jesus Christ's sacrifice to redeem humankind from evil. Katniss herself now has become a mythic being: the Mockingjay with symbolic wings and a powerful weapon is a synonym of archangel Michael, who will defeat Satan at the end of days. As archangel Michael, patron of soldiers, Katniss inspires then also leads the army of the part of humankind which is in divine grace against the army of Satan. Katniss is revered everywhere she goes and many people sacrifice their life for her idea of fighting Satan. While Peeta (Christ) is captured by Snow (Satan), Katniss becomes Christ's deputy on earth, she becomes the face, voice and later also the deadly force of the revolution against Snow,\n\nHer love in Peeta gets severely tested when Peeta comes back from Snow's capture as a programmed assassin to kill her. Snow (Satan) has taken possession of the body of Peeta. But Katniss knows that this assassin is not Peeta. She made an eternal bond with him before the 75th games and after being supported by Haymitch, she uses the power of love to restore Peeta's mind in his original shape, thereby performing exorcism on Peeta.\nWhen Katniss seems to have lost her confidence in doing the right thing because of all the suffering she induces and witnesses in the war, Peeta reminds her of her task. She (as archangel Michael) is meant to defeat Snow (Satan). There is no turning back for her and her army.\n\nBefore the end, Katniss also has to recognize and defeat a false prophet who wants to usurp Satan's reign on earth with perfidious heinousness.\nAfter Satan and his reign got annihilated, in the end, Katniss unites with Peeta for eternity and gives birth to children. Humankind is redeemed from evil and in its eternal bond of love with Christ, the soul of Katniss and humankind becomes immortal, with their children being their physical representation of immortality and the meadow the representaion of paradise, the place where humankind and god are united.",

I'm like 90% sure I have but there at least a 20% chance I haven't.* Nevertheless, I watched the Hunger Games Mocking Jay Part 2 last night and was incredibly underwhelmed. I feel like absolutely nothing happened. For starters, I was super confused by the first few minutes of the movie because either a considerable amount of time has passed since the last movie left off, or again, I didn't see the last movie so it would make sense that parts are missing for me. But that's not why I didn't like the movie, I didn't like it because the storyline just sucked and they tried to hide that with cool weapons and big explosions and that's not enough to win me over! (throw in a couple cheesy jokes though and I'm all in) This movie was so predictable too, every death you could see from a mile away and knew when characters weren't actually in any real danger. At no point was I captivated by this movie. Then the ending came and I think any 5-year-old daughter could have predicted this. This movie came out like 3 years ago so I'm spoiling it. So Katniss is walking up the 2-mile long walkway, which she finishes in 30 seconds and is getting ready to shoot Snow, the evil president. But standing straight behind him on a raised platform is the new soon to be evil president who they didn't realize was evil until now. So what does Katniss do? She raises her bow just slightly and nails her right in the heart. Oh my gosh, who saw that one coming!?!? Literally everyone.",

            "content": "I have a lot of problems with this movie, particularly the ending.  First, I wasn't clear whether Gale constructed the bomb that killed Prim or whether he was the one who came up with the idea of the bombing.  If it is the former, then it is ridiculous to blame him for Prim's death.  Bombs are created to kill people in war, and he had no idea or way of knowing it would kill someone on his side, much less Katniss's own sister, who he swore to protect.  If that is the story line, then I lost all respect for Katniss for sending him away for that reason after all he did for her and sacrificed to protect her family.  It would have been much more tolerable if she just told him the truth that she didn't love him the way she loves Peeta and that Peeta represents hope and all that is good in life, whereas Gale is a rebel and a reminder of bad memories of war and the death of her sister.  I think she made the right choice because she is a better match with Peeta, but she showed a complete lack of gratitude to Gale for all that he had been through for her.  She could have at least had the courage to tell him the truth about her feelings rather than using the excuse of a bomb that he may or may not have built.  If, on the other hand, the latter is true (that Gale came up with the idea of the bombing in the first place), then I find that completely out of line with his character.  He previously said that he could live with a few civilian casualties if it was for the greater good of destroying the capitol.  I can't imagine that he would have ever condoned dropping a bomb deliberately on the refugees, including children, as they walked into the capitol, especially after how we have seen him as a protector of Katniss's family.  He would have supported attacking President Snow, and could have lived with some civiilian casualties, but to say that he would concoct an idea to drop bombs on refugees is just totally out of line with who we got to know in the previous movies.  Secondly, I thought it was a terrible way to end the movie by having Katniss kill President Coin.  If she killed Coin  out of fear of her getting too much power, then why didn't she instead vote no on the Hunger Games when she was given the opportunity and then proceed to try to overthrow Coin by legal means rather than by killing? Katniss, who often seems reluctant to kill people of the opposing side because she sees the good in them, determines that killing Coin is the only way to remedy a bad situation? Could she not have stood up to her and organized the people to do a fair election? I like to think she could have at least tried and probably been successful since she has the support and respect of the rebels.  Killing Coin was a cowardly and cheap way out, something she didn't have the courage to do to President Snow, who caused her much more harm.  And, if she killed her simply to get revenge for Prim, then what kind of leader is she? Is that what the heroine of the story represents - revenge and anger? What she did was premeditated murder because she voted yes on the Hunger Games with a plan in mind all along that she was going to kill Coin rather than Snow.  It's so ironic that she was fighting to liberate the people from Snow and yet instead of using the newfound freedom to rise up and select a new leader of their, own she resorted to violence.  I find this to be the most disappointing from a character that I thought more of.",

            "content": "\"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\" defiantly finishes the franchise with a bang, no not a bang something even more than that. \"Mockingjay Part 2\" defiantly gives the fans a more than satisfying conclusion. The plot begins at the same point \"Mockingjay Part 1\" left off. For all past deaths made as entertainment, and for the insidious modification of Peeta, Katniss deems to strike out on her own to take down President Snow once and for all, but being the Mockingjay, the living symbol of the rebellion now headed by Alma Coin, has its drawbacks. Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed. \n\nOnce again the director \"Francis Lawrence\" is very smooth with his style and truly is the perfect director for these films. He again brings very beautiful visuals to the screen with the locations and brings back the \"games\" in a perfect way. \"Jennifer Lawrence\" was exceptional as always but in this one she defiantly boosts her performance as a character with PTSD. I can proudly say that this is the best she preformed in the franchise and even up to \"Silver Linings\" and \"Joy\" standards. \"Josh Hutcherson\" is very good in this film as well. Although this is his toughest part in the role yet is defiantly not his best as I liked him a lot better in Mockingjay Part 1. \"Sam Claflin\" also boosts his game as Finnick Odair and with a lot more screen time then he had in \"Mockingjay Part 1\". This film has major character development and its amazing to watch on screen. To see where Katniss began at the beginning of the movie to the end blows your mind. But unfortunately the Secondary characters do not have as big character development they still do have some. \n\nYou can tell they spent every single penny they had wisely on this film. With an extremely high budget of an estimated $160 Million the special effects are exceptional. The underground lizard mutts where very very well done in terms of CGI as well as the multiple explosions and the avenue of the tributes in snows execution scene. The Original Motion Score composed by James Newton Howard was one of the best in the Franchise. With the multiple standouts being, your favourite colour is green, Sewer Attack, Rebels Attack, Snows Execution and the Medley. Once again the Pace in this film is perfect. The aim when Squad 451 got into the capitol was to make it feel like a ghost town and the pace at that point made it feel so much more like the ghost town they where going for. Then it starts to speed up with the majority of the action scenes in the middle at its climax. \n\nOverall \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\" is a more than satisfying ending to the franchise as it goes out with a bang. With exceptional acting, characters, special effects and a perfect score and almost no flaws apart from small pacing issues near the middle of the film. I give 2015's \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\" a 10/10.",

Its biggest failure is in its strict adherence to every damn thing that is in the book, when a lot of it does not translate to film and was stupid in the first place. This story would have been so much better served by just making one long movie instead of overstuffing two with extraneous characters and crap that does not drive the plot forward. Consequently, this chapter lacks focus. On top of that, the ending (or rather, endings) is just terrible, the film tries to tie up all the loose ends in about 10 minutes. It feels very rushed, which is insane for a 2.5 hour movie with one hour of real content. Then there is the sugary \"Harry Potter-esque\" dénouement that's just odd after a movie that's so pervasively dismal. The middle hour is fun and exciting, even though you usually can't figure out who is who or what is happening due to the quick cuts, the dim lighting, and the fact that the characters are dressed the same. But at least it keeps you interested. The director did not do such a good job with the emotional side of the film either, it's super grim and totally humorless, and there is only one truly emotional scene... and it's between JLaw and a cat. Similar to the last film, this one does a good job of exploring politics and the power of media, and had some interesting things to say about the cycle of oppression, so it does have some merit. But mostly, I was just not impressed. It's disappointing, there is a good story hiding in here, but the filmmakers did not capitalize on the opportunities to improve on the book's many weaknesses. For the most part, The Hunger Games has been a quality film franchise, it deserved a better send-off than this.",

It is an escalation on the world building beyond the televised battle to the death arena.\nMockingjay part 2, was a nice wrap up to the entire series, showing how societies are never as black and white as oppressors and oppressed, good guys and bad guys.
