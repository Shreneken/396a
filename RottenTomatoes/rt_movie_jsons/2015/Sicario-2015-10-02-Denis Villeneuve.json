    "summary": "After rising through the ranks of her male-dominated profession, idealistic FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) receives a top assignment. Recruited by mysterious government official Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), Kate joins a task force for the escalating war against drugs. Led by the intense and shadowy Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), the team travels back-and-forth across the U.S.-Mexican border, using one cartel boss (Bernardo Saracino) to flush out a bigger one (Julio Cesar Cedillo).",

Killing someone is wrong and generally thought of as evil until it's someone you care about that's been killed. Suddenly, it seems like a logical choice.\n\nAs in life, this movie doesn't have heroes and villains, protagonists and antagonists. Instead it tries to make the point that we are all capable of both good and bad deeds. This is emphasized heavily in the movie through the use of color. The movie is primarily told through the viewpoint of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who starts the movie as an idealistic FBI agent. Director Denis Villeneuve chose to represent Macer's initial naivety with vibrant blues. Though as the character interacts with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) she slowly becomes jaded and her clothing slowly fades to grey. So if you're looking for a movie with a happy ending, or one that makes you feel good, this ain't it.",

Dialogues are dull and fail to build any depth that goes beyond romanticizing violence, and while Kate blunt acted phenomenally in the lead role, her character is non-faceted and had less depth than a puddle of rainwater. Takes ages until the plot goes anywhere, but after 2h of waiting for action, you're at least blessed with an end to this tantrum of boredom.",

At one point I counted four consecutive sentences by the main female character in which she dropped the F word!\n  As for the smoking, it was so pervasive and gratuitous I really began to wonder if some  films receive financial incentives from tobacco companies to show so much smoking?

Even though the film is much more than just an action film, it still manages to keep your undivided attention.  The film is smart, thought provoking, and incredibly suspenseful and it isn't surprising that it is so well received, garnering three Oscar nominations.  Sicario has solid performances from everyone involved and Emily Blunt does a good job at taking on the role of the audience, who like her, are new to the crazy drug world of Mexico.  After a grisly discovery in the opening sequence of the film, she is quickly drafted into service by higher ups to dive in to this new and brutal landscape filled with murders, drugs, money, and assassinations.  Benicio Del Toro gives a commanding and complex performance as a government consultant with a mysterious and violent past.  We learn midway through what has happened in his life to lead him to this point, and it's got him  focused and lethal throughout the film.\n     Anyone who is is not able to view grisly images and intense violence, may not wish to proceed as the film is obviously dealing with some very serious and exceedingly violent themes.  The film has a couple moments that hold it back from perfection, some overly contrived dialogue and some of Blunt's character traits are at times annoying.  What I mean by this is that when you are in this world, even if being thrust into it, you have to adapt quickly or die.  Her character is so focused on doing things by the book, she doesn't see the bigger picture, and at times this gets frustrating.  Looking past these minor shortcomings, the film delivers on the drama and character development as well as the suspense it generates as you are pulled into this new dangerous world.  If not easily upset and don't mind dealing with the heavy themes, this is an amazing film that is both gripping and complex!",

There are no prolonged action sequences or car chases.

Emily Blunt is terrific as the patriotic but naive FBI agent who volunteers to help apprehend Cartel kidnappers and killers.   She is perfectly vulnerable and human in this difficult role.  Her eyes are opened as she becomes embedded with Josh Brolin, and the mysterious Benicio del Toro.  Daniel Kaluuya is very compelling as Blunt's partner and friend.  Jon Bernthal is always good to watch-whether the part is big or small, and this part is no exception.  This film is riveting, violent, and well done.   It is one of the most visually engaging and visceral movies I have seen in a long time.   The Direction and Cinematography are masterful-but I have come expect nothing less from Villeneuve.",
