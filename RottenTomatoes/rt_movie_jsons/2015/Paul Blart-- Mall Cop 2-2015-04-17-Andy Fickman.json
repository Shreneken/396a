    "summary": "Six years after he saved the day at his beloved New Jersey shopping mall, security guard Paul Blart (Kevin James) is taking a well-deserved vacation. In recognition for his hard work, he's won an all-expenses-paid trip to a security convention in Las Vegas, and decides to take his teenage daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez), with him. True to form, however, Paul just can't relax and take it easy, so when he uncovers a criminal threat to the hotel, he springs into action.",

This piece of garbage didn't even have a mall in it except in one sector of the hotel/casino and it was barely utilized! There were so many flaws and mistakes in this movie that it was hard to not notice, and the ending was just atrocious with his CGI body flying across the street! Blart was much more unlikeable for most of the movie and idc how strong anyone is, no man his size is going to hold onto a zip line suspended 60 stories over Vegas for more than 2 seconds! This movie annoyed me and made me want to turn it off more than it entertained me! Call me a film snob but idc, I know I am one!",

            "content": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\n\tPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a cinematic masterpiece. The film begins with Paul Blart reflecting upon a few tragedies that have recently befallen. He remembers how he felt on top of the world. He recalls the amazing view of life when you get to the top. However, the tragedies began to occur. After six days, his wife left him after having some regrets, then his mother got run over by a milk truck, and his daughter was leaving for college next year. Blart was feeling as though he had peaked in life, and it was all downhill from there. However, just when he was close to admitting defeat, he received some incredible news! He opened his mail one day and received a letter that invited him to the Security Officers Trade Association Convention in Las Vegas! Blart is thrilled and believes that he will finally be recognized for his great work at the West Orange Pavilion Mall. Paul Blart arrives and the Wynn Casino and Resort and prepares for a luxury fun-filled event with his daughter. Things begin to look up for Blart when he arrives and thinks that the resort manager is hitting on him. Blart begins to feel very confident that he will be the one to give the keynote speech at the convention later that night. However, his hopes are all crushed when he finds out he will not be giving the speech and that his daughter plans to move away to go to UCLA for college. Things go sideways when Blart stumbles upon a criminal who plans an elaborate scheme to steal art from the hotel. Once again, security is compromised and it is up to Paul Blart to save the day again.\n\tI will award this film 5 stars because it is, as I already said, a cinematic masterpiece. I have awarded this movie 5 stars because it is a film that I watch over and over again and still causes me to have the same emotional reaction every single time. I have probably seen this movie 10 times and I love it more every time. If that doesn't cause a movie to receive a 5-star award, I don't know what will.\nThis film truly has it all. It has action, comedy, love, and a beautiful underlying plot of a father who is reluctant to see his daughter off to college. This film is beautifully done and Kevin James has truly outdone himself. Kevin James is perfect for the role. This movie is amazing because it is absolutely hysterical. There is a scene where Paul Blart's hypoglycemia, a disease that causes him to constantly need sugar in his body, causes him to pass out in the middle of trying to stop the villain. He uses the last bit of energy he has to position himself under a father carrying his sleeping daughter who is holding a dripping ice cream cone. He catches the drips from this ice cream cone in his mouth and is re-energized to go and stop the villain. Another funny part occurs when Paul Blart is sitting in the hotel garden and clearing his mind. In the middle of his relaxation, a crane disturbs his peace. After several attempts to shoo the bird away, the bird violently attacks Blart and a full-scale fight breaks out and Blart eventually defeats the bird. Another amazing moment occurs when Blart is fleeing one of the armed criminals and stumbles through a dressing room and ends up in the middle of a live-action performance stage. Blart perfectly blends in with the ongoing play and the crowd roars in approval. This scene, along with all others, is very well done. Nearly every scene throughout the movie is just as well done and amazing as the ones I just described.",

That's how I felt when Paul Blart was lying on the casino floor licking ice cream off of it.  Paul Blart: Mall Cop (the first movie) is a harmless comedy that's just a lot of slapstick and goofy humor.  In this adventure, Paul Blart and his daughter Maya, now grown up, go to Las Vegas for a convention after his mother gets run over by a bus.  Maya tries to get romantically involved with this dude, but Blart, being the overprotective father he is, disapproves.  Meanwhile, this bland heterochromic villain attempts to steal Van Gogh's Sunflowers, which for some reason is at the Wynn.  Oh, yeah, another thing that sucks about this movie is that it seems like an ad for the Wynn.  The signage on the hotels, while present throughout Las Vegas, is seen often throughout this movie.  While the Wynn is probably is an extravagant place to stay, we don't need that much product placement in this movie.  Plus, if you're spending your money to see this movie, you're probably too young for Vegas anyway.  Anyway, the villain's eye color is the most memorable thing about him.  What was his name again?  So, after that, it's nothing but generic slapstick humor and clich√© plot points.  Way too much of the humor depends on Blart's hypoglycemia, which is not particularly funny, especially after its been done before.  There's also a scene where he gets his ass kicked by a goose.  There's one where he falls down stairs in a suitcase, and also a lot of jokes involving the use of Blart's Segway.  It's just forgettable, generic, and above all, not funny.  But what do you really expect?  It's a comedy sequel.  The list of good comedy sequels is very short, and this certainly isn't on it.",

I thought a little refresher, somewhat funny too, so on such scenario, anticipating a sequel is common, but this is not what I wanted. After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again. Especially mocking a fat man is too offensive at the present era. So the hashtag on body shaming would go viral on social media.\n\nThey did not get a decent story. Even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. Even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. The concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! Yeah, Paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to Las Vegas. Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.\n\nI felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original. That ain't a masterpiece, though a much better one.\n\n3/10",

However, after 12 minutes into the film, I felt that the comedic overtones seemed forced. Watching the scene where Paul is standing at the hotel front desk, and after some light conversating with the conceirge evacuates a draw out vocalization at first thought to possibly be intended as comedy displays itself as the skin of a mid-life human wearing a lacey santa silk nightie somewhat undraped, exposing the spider veins usually shamefully hidden but now showing authenic human beatuy in it's true primal form. The beauty  though, is masked at this point and Paul's expression is ineffectual only to be portrayed as homunculus. The true beauty is not only the film itself, but the observation of self. \n\nComedy. Disesteem. Ing. Extrospection. Introspection. Realization. The essense of life. \n\nOne believes to be fit is to propogate and assist in the development and rearing of progeny. However; in the case the elephant seal of Tierra del Fuego recorded by explorer Samuel L. Cook in the late 19th century; the wails of the Omega males resulted in nulled courtship and thus his geneaogical lieage was forever lost. In this example, it is shown in human society that although, it is not formally expressed - it is a hunger. The hunger to be allowed to thrive, although fruitlessly. Opportunities for feasting, socialization and tertiary enjoyment are not liberties the low-tier animal word can secure. In human society - the modern republic, this being was allowed, and desires to be embraced - for it is the uniwitting soul of salvation. It's dead end is one step towards a smaller profit on palm oil in a remote virginal jungle. This figure looked upon as distateful - blunders incuding the elderly woman in the red and white polka dot gown, the stranger man in the shadowed expanse beneath the casino who looks straight into the essence of the protragonist exposing obvious previous trauma in his unblinking gaze, detached from humanity - there is a sense of reminiscence - of the verdant modern degenerate. He looks upon Paul as not a buffoon, but as the eventuality of the human conditon - a facade of ignorance when the truth, hidden not only within the film itself, but in the audience's visceral interpretation reveals itself as the crowd appears before Blart, unsmiling and cruel. \"Sluggish\" a term describing not only Paul Blart and his confident cajole. It is not merely an artifice, but true confidence as the true hero. He contributes nothing, but consumes less than \"success\". He is the end of the line, which he has an awareness that the other lines can continue but martyred. It is a story of a dark horse. A view of who we believe wins in life, but nobody wins because you are a large mall cop or you are a rich heterochromatic art thief, or an attractive angel-haired vixen. In the end, your progeny's desire for corn oil and the generations to come, soaked in tradition outnumber Paul Blart's total consumption of oil covered food products ten-fold at least. These epiphanies reveal that we are all Paul Blart, everyone loses in the end, the world is dead, get fat, enjoy life, nothing matters, you're okay, they think they're better and they're not.  \n\n\"if you believe the purpose of life is to serve yourself - then you have no purpose\"\n\n- Paul P. Blart",

There is no mall in this film and he only acts like a cop to protect the hotel. \"sigh\".

My favorite line in the movie is when Paul blurt says what happened to my little George Washington he could never tell a lie. That was funny, or Paul saying let the games begin!! And a lot more!! So I'm all about this when I watch this movie I laugh so much because it's so funny!! It takes place in Las Vegas, people should see the trailer to this movie! And give it a try",

The film picks up with Paul at a difficult time in his life, and he gets invited to a convention in Las Vegas where he has to put his skills to the test again. I'll be honest and admit I never saw the first Paul Blart. Why? It looked terrible. Why did I watch the sequel? That's a great question, and one I'll never truly get the answer to. But what I did get was almost two hours of non-stop fat jokes, none of which were even remotely funny. Kevin James screams and flails his way through the role, and everyone else around him looks incredibly bored, much like any viewer over the age of four. The plot is lame brained and hits all the obvious beats, and that is actually a good metaphor for any Happy Madison film as of late: Lame brained and obvious. Hopefully this is the beginning of the end for them.",

I had only watched it once, but when I saw it a second time before ultimately seeing the sequel, I did find the second half of the first act very boring. But I think there are somethings commendable about the original. Is it as funny as I originally thought? Hell No! But I did see it as a parody to the original Die Hard movie, something I've noticed people not seem to pick up on. And so I will always ultimately like the original as an average movie. However, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a louder, more obnoxious carbon copy of the original! So, it is stupider and not nearly as subtle with its Die Hard parody as the first one. So, if you didn't like Paul Blart, you're not going to like the sequel. If you liked Paul Blart, you more than likely will find the sequel irrelevant, which is totally is. So, I can see why people feel this is the worst movie of 2015, but personally, I can think of at least seven more from this year that I disliked more!\n\nI think saying it's a louder more obnoxious version of the original is a perfect description of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. There is really not much else to say about it other than that. They use the same gags, it's the same plot, and he even falls down the exact same way when he runs into the glass like the first one! I'm not kidding, the same roll and even down to the same exact camera angle, I believe. The plot is even more ridiculous with a mall cop convention, but I guess he needed to get his gadgets from somewhere, right? It even tries to be dramatic by having his daughter about to go to college and him not being able to take her leaving and such, but it's done poorly. \n\nEven Paul Blart is all wrong in this movie! In the original, there was a likability to him. Yes he is delusional in believing he's a serious cop and yes he is crazy, but there was a true underdog story in the original and he did have hopes and dreams. There is some real heart in the original that many don't seem to see. The Paul Blart in the sequel is just more over-the-top in his delusion to the point of being unlikable and very obnoxious to me.  I just couldn't get behind him like I could in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. And the whole subplot of him believing a hot girl is in love with him is completely unnecessary and ludicrous.\n\nThe movie even kicks fans of the original in the balls by having the wife he married at the end dump him within a week! Like she just steals from him and takes off, making it feel like the filmmakers didn't give two shits about the original.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is absolutely unnecessary and copies heavily off the original to the point of having no creativity whatsoever. It's more over-the-top and stupider than the first. I laughed a few times during the movie and still entertaining enough, but ultimately, the film is not worth it's existence.",

I felt every funny part made me feel unsure on rather if the writers were looking for sophisticated humour or if it was an attempt to really make you chuckle and if it was meant to be sophisticated humour then they managed to achieve that because I didn't really laugh out loud at all but I still laughed a little bit and many people will dismiss this movie as not funny because sophisticated humour is not very popular in movies but it doesn't mean that its bad . it just means it's a different style of humour . but on the other hand as the movie keeps rolling I don't feel like this movie is aiming for sophisticated humour. I feel the writing of this movie is  poorly written and lazy writers . eventually the movie starts to feel boring and every effort that was put in the start of this film to get a chuckle out of the audience goes right out the window. Some of the segments in this film were just completely stupid , not funny at all and I had no idea what the writers were thinking . I had an open mind going into this movie thinking that maybe its not that bad and as a matter fact its not that bad but its still bad .Kevin James is talented but some of the slapstick stuff used in this film is something that Chris Farley could have pulled off. Kevin James is certainly no Chris Farely and the happy Madison Studio needs to learn that . Its very hard to defend this movie but at least you will care about the characters.

            "content": "I am not as angry with Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 as I have reason to be. The movie is too lethargic and bland to earn any sort of rage; the closest I come to anger is that while I was watching the movie I had an intense desire to be anywhere else - a feeling I haven't had since Gods Not Dead a year ago. My anger for this movie is possibly quelled by the fact that Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is still fresh in my mind, a comedy that contained a joke that brought up mental imagery of The Oklahoma City Bombing. Paul Blart 2 is merely boring and uninteresting.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a colossal waste of time. It is 94 minutes of watching an otherwise engaging comedian flop around on the floor and make a fool of himself. What it illustrates is that Kevin James is at his best away from Adam Sandler's crew. Sandler's Happy Madison Productions is responsible for this chunk of indifference and also the two Grown Ups movies, and most of the movies that make up James' filmography. They illustrate the low points of his career. Away from HMP, James is a funny likable guy in his stand up and on his TV show and in movies like Hitch.\n\nHere Kevin James is a requisite tool, playing a character who is an annoying bongo hunk of flopsweat who is persistently under the mistaken assumption that what he's doing is clever. Paul Blart's signature attribute is that he makes faces and gestures that suggest that he thinks he's being agile and intuitive while in reality he's just a dumpy loser who spends his life embarrassing himself by falling over things and making colossal miscalculations. The problem is that you don't laugh at his antics; you feel sorry for him because of his misfortunes in life and groan impatiently while waiting for him to move to the next obvious slapstick gag.\n\nLet's examine one gag in particular.  Paul meets a man outside a Vegas hotel who is renting Segways.  Since Paul uses this particular item on a regular basis on his job, he fancies himself an expert.  He wants to show off but the vendor tells him that he needs to see a valid driver's license first.  Paul scoffs.  The man is irritated and insists again that he needs a valid driver's license before he can let Paul try it out.  Paul goes ahead, doing stunts and showing off while we see the face of the poor vendor who becomes irritated by Paul's stunt show.\n\nWhat is frustrating is that we agree with the vendor.  He's a guy doing his job and this idiot is putting his job in jeopardy.  The vendor is never set up as an and angry malaprop, but as a normal guy doing what he should be doing.  For this, we don't like what Paul is going.  That pushes us away from him, and the scene works against the character.\n\nThere are at least a dozen scenes like this in Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, up to and including a running gag in which he provokes a fight with a peacock.  This happens three or four times in this movie, and every time I saw the peacock, I winced because I knew that the movie was recreating a epic fight between Peter and the giant chicken on \"Family Guy.\"  It's wastes time, and it isn't funny.\n\nThe plot finds Blart traveling to Las Vegas after his wife (Jayma Mays) divorces him for no apparent reason after only six days, and then his mother (Shirley Knight) is run over and killed by a milk truck - that's suppose to be funny, and so are the scenes of Paul Blart crying over it. One the cusp of sending his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) off to college, the two travel to Las Vegas to attend a convention of security guards, and run headlong into a heist of precious works of art.\n\nThat's it. That's all you need to know. The rest of the movie is watching Paul Blart make a fool of himself. He makes a miscalculation, and usually ends up flying across the room for his troubles. Why? Cause he's fat, and the people who made this movie are under the mistaken assumption that fat people in and of themselves are funny when they fall down.\n\nThe movie isn't funny.  There are no laughs here.  Normally I blame the writers and not the actors, but here I have to because Kevin James himself is one of the writers.  He wrote himself into a corner.  The problem is, you don't laugh at Paul Blart, you feel sorry for him. It's deadly to a comedy, as Roger Ebert once asserted, when you feel sorry for the character. It's painful to watch him embarrass himself, fall on the ground, slide across the floor, nearly get hit by a car or, fighting that peacock, and one endless scene in which he ends up on stage during a performance of Cirque du Soleil's \"La Reve.\"  The character isn't funny, he's pathetic.  Watching him is a dreary experience.",

The jokes were really bad and the far fetched plot just went from bad to worse. Anyway, it's about a mall cop, Paul Blart, who is feeling pretty depressed after his wife has left him and his mum gets run over by a milk truck, so he heads to Vegas with his daughter to spend some time with her before she heads to college. He's also been invited to an security officer award ceremony in a posh hotel so they pack there bags and they make there way there. His daughter immediately falls for one of the porters so she spends most of her time with him while Paul is preparing his speech and checking out the security in the hotel. He then finds out that another officer is giving the speech but on the day, he is too drunk to say a word so Blart takes over. His daughter mistakenly walks into a heist of people trying to steal some expensive paintings from the hotel and so she calls on her dad to save her life, along with the porter who is also mixed up in the whole mess. Blart then recruits some of the other security officers to help save his daughter but it's Blart who saves the day, as usual. This movie did take me some time to watch because I kept on falling asleep, out of shear boredom. It goes from one crazy scene to the next and the actors, especially Kevin James, just seemed to make complete fools of themselves. The whole painting scam was a shambles and I cant believe that the professional killers got taken out by a bunch of amateurs that didn't have a clue about what they were doing. Anyway, I'm sure that there going to make another Paul Blart movie because of the profit that this one made but I will be staying clear of it. Awful!\n\nRound-Up:\nKevin James has made quite a hefty sum from making a fool out of himself, $1.2Billion to be exact but his biggest achievement to date is his role in Hitch which made $370million worldwide. At 50 years old, he is a bit of a late bloomer because he didn't start making movies until 2002 were he had a small role in Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio. He then played cameo roles in 50 First Date and Hitch and he added his voice to Monster House, Barnyard and Hotel Transylvania which made $358million worldwide. After starring in a couple of TV series, he finally hit the big screen alongside Adam Sandler in 2007 with I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry which made $186million worldwide. Since then, his career has been pretty impressive but were yet to see another side to his acting. He did have a slightly serious side in Here Comes The Boom but he still ended up making a fool out of himself. Anyway, the film was directed by Andy Fickman whose known for his comedy movies like the Game Plan, She's The Man, Race To Witch Mountain, You Again and Parental Guidance with Billy Crystal and Bette Midler. Judging by his previous work, I'm not surprised with the outcome of this movie because he seems to like light hearted fun with silly jokes and not that much depth. Personally, I couldn't stand this movie because I just didn't find it that funny but they will keep on bringing out movies like this because they make so much money.\n\nBudget: $30million\nWorldwide Gross: $107million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a mall cop who goes to Las Vegas for a security award ceremony with his daughter and ends up saving her life after she witnesses a heist. 2/10",

Nothing unites people more than finding a scapegoat that you can all agree to hate, and the natural peer pressure within groups will always perpetuate this pattern. Well, I suspect the community of critics are the same, and unfortunately any movie associated with Adam Sandler or M.Night Shyamalan is automatically slated. They're the scapegoats in this community, and unfairly so in my opinion. I love these Happy Madison types of movies. Yes they're a bit crap, but they're supposed to be. They're fun. They're like B-Movies and they always have a great spirit and message to them; that we shouldn't take life so seriously and that it's ok to be different. \nAnd while I'm on the topic, animated movies, foreign movies and documentaries are always rated excessively high. These seem to be the movies that it's \"cool\" for critics to like. Moral of the story, take ratings with a pinch of salt. Make up your own mind.",

Sure, he has had a few hits and/or decent performances, but when he continues to lead films like this, it only furthers his downward spiral. This time, Pul Blart is invited to a convention in Las Vegas, where he is lead to believe he will be receiving an award. Like every other cliche in the movie, of course a conflict had to happen. Paul Blart becomes the hero taking down bad guys again, and it is as unfunny as it is unnecessary. This film defines why we no longer need sequels to comedies, especially ones that never worked in the first place. There is not much to say about this picture really. It's script is horribly lazy, it's direction is un-inspired, and the comedy is slim to none. There is a forced attempt to make you care about the father daughter relationship, but it keeps going back and forth to the point that I didn't care.

He heads to Vegas with his teenage daughter before she heads off to college. But safety never takes a holiday and when duty calls, Blart answers. \n\nWell the first film wasn't the best movie I have ever seen but it was a good family movie and I did have some chuckles. On the other hand Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 was an unbearable watch; the jokes fall flat and they feel really forced. The first movie was a good family film, but to make your family watch this god awful sequel is more like torture. \n\n\nThe cast did feel like they had fun making it but I wish I felt the same way about watching this movie. There wasn't anything good about the film at all so take my word for it and save yourself some time.

            "content": "You can't stop Kevin James from making movies.  Because the masses were clamoring for a sequel six years after the fact, everybody's favorite mall cop is back, and he's headed to Vegas.  Of course given that this is a Paul Blart movie, he's immediately going to find himself in some sort of caper he's going to unintentionally thwart.  I'm going to start by paying this film a mighty big compliment: this isn't nearly as bad as I thought this was going to be.  I watched a trailer, and I shivered with how terrible this looked.  I mean it's not like the first movie was anything to write home about, why on Earth did they decide to move forward on Paul Blart 2?  While I may not be able to answer that question per se, I do want to go ahead and issue a bit of a disclaimer: this review is likely going to come off as sounding more positive than negative, but that is only because I sat down with the expectation that I would be gouging my eyes out before the end credits.  Make no mistake, this is a bad movie, and unless you have a thing for Segway jokes, you can skip this, carry on with your life and go to the grave with a Paul Blart free existence.  So let's get to why this isn't the worst film in the world, and there will be minor spoilers here (I figure that if there's a movie I can get away with spoilers on, it's Paul Blart).  For one thing, I watched this stony faced and arms crossed, and this actually started with a big laugh that cold-clocked me.  If you remember from the first movie, it ends with Blart getting the hot chick and saving the day.  This opens with him getting divorced 6 days after his marriage.  It's just something that I wasn't expecting, and it actually started this off on the right foot for me.  It took me a while, but I did eventually have to admit to myself that this movie was making me laugh to myself, in a shaking-my-head kind of way.  The amount of padding that is here is actually kind of hilarious from a filmmaking standpoint.  For example, there is a scene where Blart just looks at the camera, says he needs some fresh air, and then walks outside to fight an African crane for five minutes in front of a piano player.  Why?  No reason other than to watch him flop around for a while, and the movie continues on as usual immediately thereafter.  I started off hating myself for laughing at this one joke, and I don't want to go so far to say that I was won over by this, but I was definitely less irked by this than I imagined I was going to be.  It's filled with sight gags and buffoonery, but I really didn't end up groaning all that much.  Also, Neal McDonough is featured as the bad guy (type casting), and to be honest, he does elevate this to being above the bottom of the barrel.  The standout scene in this is him and Blart getting in a verbal spat, trying to one-up each other on how insane they are.  Anyway, this is still a bad movie that you shouldn't really take the time with, but surprisingly, there are worse movies out there.",

To me, the emotional moments land better than the first, they are more believable.  For me, the action was awesome for what the movie is.  It was well planned and executed, again, for the Comedy that it is.

The writing is incredibly awful; featuring cheesy character stereotypes and horrendous dialog.  And Kevin James seems to be phoning in his performance, and doesn't have any charm.

            "content": "I'm sure there were a few fans of the original film that were longing for the sequel but, seriously, come on now, it's not like there was huge clamoring for a sequel to the first film.  A film that wasn't that good to begin with.  Perhaps I gave the first film a break because Kevin James has a likable enough personality that I thought that people might gravitate towards that even if the film wasn't good.  And, in fact, people did gravitate to that and the film was pretty damn successful considering its minuscule budget.  But, and this has been a little over half a decade now, Kevin James just isn't that good of a comedic actor.  It's not like he ever was, but people found him so likable that they were willing to overlook the fact that he's just not all that talented.  That's why both Paul Blart films, essentially, are just one big 'fatty fall down' joke after the other.  Some people, in defense of James and others like him, would make the argument of if you were to take this same film and show it in the 20s or 30s that James would be regarded as a genius.  And that just couldn't be further from the truth.  To be fair, I just don't know what would happen, but James relies on a lot of laziness whereas Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin relied on their physicality because of they fact they weren't able to use to dialogue to tell their stories.  Chaplin made the transition to the talkies smoother than Keaton did, but Chaplin still had a way at adding a lot of heart and personality to films that featured a lot of slapstick.  Keaton was better at creating over-the-top physical stunts that no A-list actor, in this day and age, would actually perform.  The point is, that Keaton and Chaplin were both incredibly creative and innovative for the style of comedy they presented.  Kevin James is just repeating what others have done prior to him without any of the heart or creativity.  Again, he's just falling down because, you know, fat people falling over is funny.  It really doesn't surprise me that Kevin James had a hand in writing this film.  This is like a collection of deleted scenes from the first film that they thought would be a good idea to make a full-length film out of.  There's no way that this isn't how this film came about.  How else do you come up with a sequel to a film that nobody, in their right mind, probably loved?  It's either that or Adam Sandler just wanted to give one of his buddies more work, considering that almost nobody outside of Sandler actually casts Kevin James in their films.  It's not that I want James to go away, it's just that I want a little more effort to be put into the films he's in, instead of relying on what's cheap and easy.  The film has a few laughs, like Blart and the villain going back and forth on how crazy they are.  It's not like I would call this a hilarious scene, but it produced some chuckles.  And that's literally all I can remember.  There's also one ridiculously bad fight scene, which is understandable, but it's really fucking bad even by the low standards one has when watching a film of this type.  I know earlier I mentioned writing, but that would be offensive to the actual screenwriters that actually put in an effort to create stories.  I'm sure they still have to structure the film, but let's be honest here, not much effort was actually put into the script and I will be damned if someone tells me otherwise.  If you couldn't tell, this film was absolutely dreadful.  One of the worst of the year.  Though I am unsure of whether it was any worse than Grandma's Boy.  I will say this, Grandma's Boy may have been absolutely fucking awful, but I think they at least made a conscious effort at making a cult film.  I thought it was horrible and terribly unfunny, but there was some semblance of effort.  I can't say the same about this film.  I guess, in a way, this would have to be worse than Grandma's Boy, because it relied on everything that people hate about these comedies.  It was lazy and it relied on tired cliches and stereotypes.  It goes without saying that this is one of the worst films of the year, so far.  And Joe Dirt 2, another film from Sandler's production company, comes out this weekend.  So Paul Blart 2 will have some company among the worst films of the year category. I can't believe I paid to watch this.  It was $1.50, sure, but I still paid money to see rent this.  Maybe I was kinda hoping it might provide some unintentional laughs, but there's not even that.  This is an awful movie from beginning to end and it does nothing to improve Kevin James' image of relying of shitty and lazy 'fatty fall down' comedy.  Absolutely dreadful and please trust me when I say that you should avoid this at all costs.  I think Observe and Report is still out there in a $5 Walmart DVD bin somewhere.  That movie's strangely dark, but it's still vastly superior to both Blart films.  This, on the other hand, is fucking awful.",

For every \"The Hangover\", there's something like \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\". So, when I saw the theatrical trailers for \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" (PG, 1:34), I said to myself, \"Self? You know something? This one has potential.\" Paging Burt Wonderstone.\n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is the sequel to the very profitable (read: low budget) \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" from 2009. Six years after thwarting a Black Friday heist at his local mall, and in spite of the original movie's tag line (\"Security Never Takes a Holiday\"), we now see Blart (Kevin James) and his daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez) on vacation in \"Fabulous Las Vegas\". Well, it's not completely a vacation. There's a security convention in town and Blart is hearing rumors he's going to be asked to be the convention's surprise guest speaker. And he's still the same old Blart - excessively proud of being a mall cop and insulted when someone doesn't give him his due, or give his job the respect that he feels it deserves.\n\nDuring the back-and-forth over whether Blart is giving that speech, thieves begin stealing the hotel's art - and kidnaps Blart's daughter and the hotel valet (David Henrie) that she's been talking to. In the inevitable face-to-face showdown between Blart and Vincent (Neal McDonough),the thieves' leader, Vincent has his henchmen and Blart has his fellow security officers, each one more... unusual than the last. Throughout Blart's attempts to stop the bad guys, he proves as resourceful and physically resilient as he was in the first movie, as do his back-ups. But when the ways they battle for truth, justice and Steve Wynn's art reminded me of the scene in \"Vegas Vacation\" when Cousin Eddie takes Clark to a casino with silly simple, but impossible-to-win table games. But even \"Pick a Number\" or \"Which Hand Is It In\" were more amusing than this film's marble gun or goop sprayer.\n\nOne subplot in the movie has Blart dealing with his beloved daughter's rapidly approaching departure for college, which will leave Blart even more alone than you'd think based on how the last movie ended. There's a definite family-friendly vibe in the Paul Blart movies. The conflicts lack any real danger (unless you count the many assaults on Blart's person, mostly born of his own clumsiness). There's no real profanity and no sexual content, but also a plot, characters and dialog that are so bland that they make dry toast look like a fancy Vegas buffet. I enjoy family-friendly comedies as much as the next open-minded movie reviewer, but I do expect them to be funny.\n\nThis movie is earnest and tame, but just not that enjoyable. The script is lazy and settles for bon mots like \"It's a bad day... to be a bad guy.\" James' delivery of supposedly comedic lines is so over-the-top that they're more likely to produce eye rolls than guffaws. He literally throws himself into the film's physical comedy, but the effect wears thin quickly. There are about four laugh-out-loud sight gags in the movie, but ONLY four - and they've probably already gotten their laughs out of you if you've seen a TV commercial or theatrical trailer for the movie. James' antics might give some kids a few giggles (very few), but there's not much here for adults to appreciate. Personally, I'd take James' work in his erstwhile TV series \"The King of Queens\" over most of his movie roles, including and especially this one.\n\nThis was the first film to receive Nevada's newly-enacted film tax credit. That's potentially a good news / bad news scenario. It'll probably mean more Sin City scenery splashed across the big screen... but that might mean I'll be subjecting myself to more cinematic suffering. Well, better me than you. After all, that's what our Facebook page is here for. So, instead of seeing this particular motion picture, I'd advise reading a nice family-friendly joke book... or taking a trip to your local mall. It's safe. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is fiction, grade \"D\" fiction.",

The one that after watching you thought \"i need to have a sequel to this\"? No? well neither did i, and six years on someone answered your request for a film you didn't want. This has to be one of the laziest attempts at a comedy sequel i have ever seen. The structure is extremely unoriginal, just following the exact same formula as the last film from start to finish. And the jokes were unbearably awful, every single one made me sigh and ask \"really?\" It looks like a five year old wrote the jokes in this film to entertain his 4 year old friends, and it just makes this whole film look stupid, as well as Kevin James. Do you remember the days when he was funny? No? well neither do i, he is like a parody of his character from the first film thrown into a similar situation and makes a fool of himself every 5 minutes. Not only was the plot terrible, i had no idea what the actual plot was until almost half way into the movie, yes there are bad guys from the start but i had no idea what they were doing until like 45 minutes into the movie, maybe because it wasn't clear enough or i just didn't care. \n\nI must say i smirked like twice in the entire film, one of those times was seeing Kevin James get smashed into the side of a car, and so was the other time. I have to say there was nothing good about this movie, the comedy was atrocious, the plot was pointless and at times non-existent and the bad guys were stereotypical movie bad guys from the moment you see them. It also tries to shove some emotional crap down your throat the entire time and i actually bought some of that for like 5 minutes and then i remembered that i don't care. There were also a crap-load of secondary characters that all factor in through many side plots, most of which were there to fill the hour and 30 minute runtime. \n\nSo in the end, even Kevin James on a Segway could not save this pile of horse crap, do yourself a favour, and stay far away from this excuse of a comedy. - 1.7/10",

Hell I'm sure there will be a third too, because all the bigwigs like to make trilogies, its great for DVD sales.  But yeah...I did like the first movie somewhat, it was a reasonable idea, a mall cop thinking he's a real cop, trying to be a real cop, it worked on some levels.\n\nThe main pull for this franchise was/is of course Kevin James who uses his weight to gain laughs lets not beat around the bush. Admittedly I am a fan of the guy to a degree (said it before and I'll say it again), I think he's enjoyable, fun and effective with his physical gags, plus he's a good everyman that we the audience can relate too. Unfortunately he does seem to have had more success on TV than the big screen, and he's not helping himself here.\n\nThis movie is virtually the same shit that we saw in the first movie. Blart and his daughter go to a security convention in Vegas, low and behold at the exact same time a group of criminals are planning to steal all the valuable paintings from the same hotel Blart is staying in. Just like the first movie Blart blunders into the crime caper and ends up stopping it in his usual clumsy overweight manner, spoiler alert! he manages it. Oh...would a Las Vegas hotel have the Van Gogh Sunflowers painting in it?\n\nYep its the same as the first movie yet somehow its much worse, probably because its a babyish infantile pile of crap this time around. Seriously, the last movie has some good moments of sarcastic humour, this has nothing, its completely void of anything that would make an adult or child smile. Its bizarre, there literately isn't anything funny at all! not a single moment that made me smile. Hell there aren't any actual jokes! it pretty much consists of James making stupid faces (that aren't funny faces) and mincing around trying to be funny. What I really don't get is the franchises obsession with those Segway things, seriously there is an entire scene dedicated to trying to make out those things are funny. I realise its Blart's little trademark and part of his character but it isn't funny! watching him trying to show off on one isn't funny, its just lame.\n\nEverything else is completely predictable throwaway spiel we've seen a shitzillion times before. Blart's daughter is fat just like him, she falls for a good looking guy who is clearly out of her league and Blart doesn't like it, the main baddie looks like a Bond villain, the baddie henchmen are a standard bunch with a token black guy and token sexy females, the hotels security is headed by some uber sexy male hothead and the hotels general manager is a sexy supermodel type. The only thing they add here which had promise and showed some ingenuity, was the little gang of security officers that meet with Blart for the convention. A ragtag team of misfits that really shouldn't be in security...but are, clearly for reasons other than actual security. James older brother Gary Valentine stars in this as one of the aging, fat, balding security guards in this little gang. Again clearly meant to be a hilarious addition...but it isn't.\n\nThe whole security convention aspect could of been a winner, they did the same silly thing in the US TV version of 'The Office' with an office supply convention. Seeing that episode shows how funny this movie could have been in the right hands, even with James, the material was there (albeit a little bit of good material) but its been wasted. That one small idea does not make up an entire movie of course, and as already explained there is nothing else here of value. Even the apparent suspenseful finale where Blart takes down the bad guys is pathetic and not even up to the meager standards of the first movie! This could have been better with a slight adult edge, it was never gonna be great but it could of been better, but its not, its pretty darn terrible.",

            "content": "The first Paul Blart movie was fairly inoffensive. Much like its titular hero, it was buffoonish and loud and something to simply shrug and ignore the idiocy. It had a couple funny moments tweaking action movie conventions, less so with Kevin James' numerous pratfalls. The world didn't need a sequel beyond the demands of the first one making money. And much like the Die Hard sequels, the \"spiritual forbearer\" of Blart, our security guard finds himself miraculously being put in the same miraculous position again, this time in a different location. While Die Hard 2 is a fairly mundane follow-up, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a true test of everything we hold sacred. Midway into the movie, I thought my review was just going to be my unintelligible suicide note.\n\nBlart (James) is in Las Vegas for an annual security convention. He's brought along his teen daughter Maya (Rami Rodriguez) for some valuable father-daughter time, especially in light of Blart losing his wife and mother. It's at this convention where Blart runs across a team of art thieves lead by Vincent (Neal McDonough). It's up to the most unlikely mall security cop to save the day again, Vegas-style. Oh, and when traveling in Vegas, make sure to stay at the luxurious Wynn Casino and Hotel. Can I get a check too for the self-promotion like this movie?\n\nSomewhere along the way, James and co-writer Nick Bakay decided the lovable lug needed to be a modern-day Pagliacci and be the crying clown America deserves. The opening act feels like notorious cinematic sadist Lars von Trier designed it. In the opening minutes, Blart's wife (Jayma Mayes) divorces him not even a full week into marriage. She couldn't stop vomiting from the thought of being married to him (this literally happens). His mother is run over and killed by a milk truck. His daughter has been accepted into college but fears telling her father this joyous news because she doesn't want to push him over the edge. This and he's still emasculated and looked down upon by an assortment of industry peers at the Vegas convention. All of this culminates in Blart becoming a paranoid, overbearing bully who loses the sense of likeability that comes naturally to James even in dreck. Take a moment where Blart intervenes with his drunken friend. The guy has been obnoxiously making sexual advances on a woman (played by Adam Sandler's wife) who just wants her privacy respected, and Blart saves the day by... convincing the woman that she should be flattered by the drunk's advances. Yeah. He rejects his daughter's academic accomplishment and demands she attend a lesser school closer to home for his own selfish benefit. He's pushing her away. Then there's the weird ongoing joke about his arrogant assumption that an attractive hotel employee is hitting on him; he's dismissive of her throughout and, here's the weird part, it ends up working. She falls for him (\"I can't say no to you\"). That's right folks, Paul Blart successfully \"negged\" himself a date. He's not a loveable loser any more. He's just an angry, bullying, self-pitying loser. \n\nThere won't be a joke (I'll be charitable and refer to the as \"jokes\") that you won't see coming a mile away and still roll your eyes when they arrive. When the movie has an exotic bird walk out, you know it's only a matter of seconds before it comically engages in a fight with Blart. When he steps back onto the familiar confines of a Segwey, you know it's only a matter of seconds before he does something stupid. The crux of the humor of this movie is about 90 minutes of a fat guy falling down, and it still takes 47 minutes for the plot to get in gear. Let me repeat that for those in the cheap seats: a movie that is built upon the frail premise of being a Die Hard parody takes 47 unholy minutes to actually have its plot kick into gear. I watched Blart fight a stupid bird before the movie had the villain's scheme play out. Naturally, the film would have been bereft without that man-on-bird action (sorry to disappoint those who came here vis-√†-vis a salacious SEO keyword search). Likewise we needed 28 shots of James falling over. Anything less would have been unacceptable to the viewing public. If you're going to be a dumb comedy just be a dumb comedy and don't waste my time. \n\nAnd oh what a dumb comedy it is. The first Blart film wasn't going to be confused with Tom Stoppard but it at least had some action conventions it could tweak. This go-round can't even manage that, and so we're inundated with tired slapstick and comedy that rarely rises above the most obvious joke at every opportunity. Blart gets ready to attack an intruder and, wouldn't you know it, he ends up punching an old lady. Hilarious. Even funnier is that the injured hospitality worker apologizes to her attacker. There's also a thinly disguised gay panic joke where Blart freaks out when a guy eats a brown banana. Who cares about how brown a banana is? At one point Blart hides inside a suitcase positioned at the top of the stairs. Why? Well so that the suitcase can fall down those stairs and hit the bad guy in the head. Don't you get it? He's fat. There are few comic setups or developments, no payoffs. Scenarios that should be comic, like Blart stumbling on stage of a Vegas dance show, are practically played straight, with the visual of Blart cavorting his large torso as the only joke itself. In case you forgot, he's fat.\n\nI should not have been expecting much from Paul Blart 2 simply by the choice of jokes highlighted in the trailer. If you wanted a cursory reminder, it included Blart fighting a bird, Blart punching an old lady, Blart running into a plate glass window, and Blart getting kicked by a horse in what should be a spine-obliterating accident. Let's take this last gag and really explore how it's indicative of Paul Blart 2. The foundation is a dumb act of slapstick, but that's not good enough and so it's exaggerated to even dumber magnitude. With the help of self-loathing CGI artists (they can't all be Jurassic World), Blart ricochets across a street and violently bounces against a car door. It's not enough that a horse kicks this guy; he has to get kicked by a super horse because it just wasn't funny enough. That sums up the comic ethic of Paul Blart 2: when stupid isn't enough, amp it further, and then be proud about what you've done. \n\nNate's Grade: D",

In that sense, it's not a good feeling to bash it considering that it really does mean well and is just about the least offensive movie out there, but considering everything it gets wrong -- relying on tired jokes, failing to innovate even in the slightest -- there's really not much room for praise. James, at least, seems like he was born to play the part. He does it well, even if what he does doesn't stretch him, or the material, very far. There's a fair bit of potential left in the tank if the filmmakers are willing to put in some effort instead of just recreating the first movie in a different environment. If there is a third, it will hopefully do something fresh.",

            "content": "You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations. To his credit, director Andy Fickman (\"The Game Plan,\" \"Parental Guidance\") keeps the inanity moving apace and there are a few chuckles to be had courtesy of the supporting cast. But, as is so often the case with big, star-driven studio laffers, \"Cop 2\" needed several more spins in the comedy punch-up machine before cameras rolled. In the past, James at least had likability on his side. He was a big, lumbering oaf, the ideal drinking buddy. But there's an arrogance to the way he treats people here, particularly a gorgeous hotel employee he's convinced is in love with him, that renders him strangely unsympathetic. Sequels are cynical by nature, but this one, with its casino product placement ad and director Andy Fickman apparently checking his text messages instead of trying to punch the limp gags into shape, is purely a paycheck. James may not deserve better, but the kids they're pitching this to do. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough. Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.\n\nVERDICT: \"Not So Hot\" - [Negative Reaction] These films are truly terrible films. They are not the worst things ever made, but they are definitely awful and should not be seen by anyone. (Films that are rated 1.5 or 2 stars)",

Another thing is, next time for the nnth time, please don't parody Die Hard ever again, there's still many other action plots that you can think of, and not like in Die Hard OK?

Mall Cop) who is invited to a convention of his peers in Vegas. It just so happens that an art thief (Neal McDonough) and his crew are planning to steal several works of art from the casino during Blart's stay, which causes West Orange Pavilion Mall's shining hero to ride into action.\n\nWould I ever watch it again?

I also thought that this movie was pretty darn lol funny if you like movies that are dumb, loud, full of heart, composed and downright transcendent. This viewer thought it was a decent movie, although to be honest, I don't see why it is disliked, but can see why the average viewing in other countries didn't get it top praise - it still gets top praise from many people like me who thought it was just goofy and silly and dumb, with something for everyone. I have never had such goofy laughs in a movie. Making the audience laugh in an uproar. Pretty wild, but also sweet. It was somehow, someway a hooting hollering movie for this jaded and overcomplicated well done and over the hill movie watcher. I guess the kiddies are too unspoiled to enjoy something this ridiculous. I am old, you see? :)",

            "content": "There are good sequels, then there are bad ones. Unfortunately we get another one with Happy Madison Studios making the not-so-likable character Paul Blart in his sequel \"Mall Cop 2\".   Kevin James plays in the title role yet again as one of  New Jersey's well known mall cops this time he is more annoying and obnoxious than ever. I don't think I have sat through a movie looking at a character more annoying than any of the other bad characters I have seen in other bad movies. Actor Kevin James has spoken out about liking this character (for whatever reason) and had the idea of making a sequel. \n\nThe movie begins with Paul Blart, who had just got married and started to have a new life; that is until his wife divorces him after six days of marriage. This is ridiculous as it sounds but it gets more distressing after only five minutes in. Paul's mother goes out for a newspaper, and then is randomly run over by a milk truck. It suddenly goes from sad to dark just minutes apart. After Paul's mother randomly dies. his daughter gets accepted into UCLA, but she does not want to tell her father because she thinks it will hurt his feelings. They then take a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada to go on vacation. \n\nThen the problems go on from there. There are so many gags and offensive jokes through out the entire movie. For example, the Segway that Paul shows off to two lousy men later in the movie is only there to extend the movie's duration time in order to get to the ninety minute mark. There are countless amount of these scenes in the movie that it makes the film boring instead of reaching its goal to be funny. \n\nSpeaking of which, where is the comedy in this movie? None of the jokes are original and don't make any sense. I waited patiently for ninety minutes waiting for a funny moment to happen, but it never came. There are times where the movie adds in a random scene to make the movie look more ridiculous and redundant. There is one particular scene where Paul Blart attacks an African Crane, this scene tries to make Paul look like a funny guy, but really, he is being a jerk and shows that he is very easy to annoy. \n\nThis isn't Happy Madison Studios' first film to have a sequel worse than its predecessor, Grown Ups 2, Joe Dirt 2 are both examples of bad films that the Studio should listen to the criticism in order to make their film better. \n\n\"Criticism is a lesson\"- 30 Cents.",

This movie had the perfect blend of action and adventure, comedy, and a deeper meaning of life. There were definitely some memorable moments in this movie, such as the part where the team of mall cops beat up the others who are opposing them. This scene was particularly awesome because it seamlessly combined the silliness of the cops with the action and adventure that the move was sought out to be. I give this movie 5/5 starts because not only did it exceed its expectations, but it also created a higher standard for action/adventure movies in the future.",

Loud, broad, and god-awful, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 plays out like a bad kid's movie mistakenly marketed to adults. An incompetent, he pratfalls about while facing basic challenges. An annoyance, he embarrasses his daughter while being overbearing. An unfortunate, he stumbles into victory purely by accident. An irritant, he gets rendered unlikable by putting him - and audiences - through the same sad paces as in the last go-roundwhich was pure garbage. The script renders him so incompetent, annoying, unfortunate, and irritating that moviegoers end up hating this ne'er-do-well--not sympathizing with him unfunny failure. A forced second helping of a cold dish that few people enjoyed to begin with, this sequel re-heats and adds more of the Z-grade shtick that made 2009s Paul Blart: Mall Cop so utterly painful to watch.\n\nIn this PG-rated comedy, mall cop Paul Blart (James) heads to Las Vegas for a Security Guard Expo with his teenage daughter (Rodriguez), only to discover a heist that hes intent on foiling. \n\nA poor man's Chris Farley, Kevin James fills the fat funny man vacancy in Adam Sandler's stable of stars. A frequent Sand-man collaborator, this former star of CBS's King of Queens realized this lovable lunk role again (I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry) and again (The Zookeeper). In fact, with Grown Ups, which was filled with just about ONLY ex-SNL castmates (Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Chris Nealon), he took on a role that would've been Farley's for the taking had he lived (unlike James, Farley was an SNL cast member from the same period as the aforementioned). The difference? Farley killed both slapstick and cerebral comic patter. James nails only the former...and barely. Relegated to PG-rated buffoonish clowning thats not entertaining to neither children NOR adults, his Paul Blart: Mall Cop is an unfunny failure as both a character and as a comedy.\n\nBottom line: Mall Rots",

And the only other movie available was \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,\" with which I was entirely unfamiliar. But it was rated a mere PG, the equivalent of a G rating back in my day, so I figured what the heck. Coming out of the theater, I realized the banality of \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,\" had rendered me senseless. My niece Francesca looked up at me, and she said, and I'll never forget this, I even wrote it down so I would remember, \"out of the mouths of babes\" and all that, she said simply: \"Uncle Bill, that festering pile of cow dung was so rancid, I hope to Christ I never hear the name Paul Blart again. Ever! This film has scarred me for life. And who is this fat f*ck Kevin James? He thinks he's funny?! I've had bowel movements that have elicited more laughs than anything that came out of that fat f*ck's mouth the entire film. And the makers of this wretched filth are so desperate that they have to dig up the likes of a D-lister like former SNL star-and mind you, I'm using the term 'star' loosely-Molly Shannon? F*ck me. Arguably the only way Molly Shannon ever could be funny would be if she were forced to sit in a hot-tub with Rob Schneider and Ving Rhames, who both were suffering from acute irritable bowel syndrome. What did 'Paul Blart 2' cost to make? 20 mill? 30 mill? Why not just skip making the movie, write a check for $30 million, send it to an irritable bowel syndrome charity, and call it a day?! F*ck this sh*t. Just gimme my binky and let's go home.\" I must say I pretty much agreed with her take. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" essentially is the apex of American mediocrity.

            "content": "From the people that gave us the first Paul Blart film gives us a second with the plainly titled Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, a movie that is here and I honestly have no idea why. The first film wasn't a good film as it was just a very kid freindly version of Die Hard and while it's appeal was limited there was a level of heart that came with it. This second movie falls into the same situation but it still falls short of even the first film's low standards. The story this time revolves around Paul Blart going to Las Vegas for a security convention but a villainous thief tries to steal all of the hotel's art and it is up to Paul Blart to save the day. I am not exaggerating any of this, that is actually the story. The film obviously struggles from the very beginning but let's talk about the very few thing's that work here. The main thing that works in the film is actually Kevin James in the title role. James does deliver a very heartfelt performance and actually makes the movie a little bit more tolerable. Neil McDonough plays the villain and he gives it his all but the script is so bad it undermines everything. The script here is filled to the brim with jokes that aren't funny and throwaway characters that you will never remember after you see the movie. The comedy the script throws at us is mainly fat jokes. One or two would have been funny, but every scene has a fat joke and then they follow it up with a poor attempt at physical comedy. The best of these are actually seen in the trailer and even those aren't very appealing. Director Andy Fickman drops the ball here in more ways than agreeing to make this movie. His editing here is just shoddy to say the least and the use of CGI in some scenes is so obvious that the SyFy channel wouldn't even use it. To top it all off the ending of this film is just so cheesy you actually hate the film a bit more. Overall there is no use in dragging this review out longer than it has to be. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is just a extremely bad movie that we didn't even want to be made. James and McDonough try to make this work but this is just a terrible film that nothing could have saved it. Skip Paul Blart 2 and watch something else on Netflix instead.",

The television show King of the Hill. Paul and Hank Hill are exactly alike and have barely any differences in appearance and most of all personality. They are both stupid and could not be funny if they wanted to be funny. Bobby from King of the Hill and Maya Blart (Paul's daughter) have a shocking resemblance. They are both very stupid and count on their dad for everything despite their fathers being big, dumb, ugly, poop-inducing idiots. Finally the similarity between the Mom who did not get much screen time in the movie and Peggy Hill. You see the Mom nags Paul and Maya and does not shut up and let me try to enjoy this shitfest. Much like in King of the Hill when she is annoying and does not pertain at all to the non-existent plot or Hank's crappy adventures. I play the Tenor Saxophone and I know when I see a bad horn.

Starring Kevin James as our Christ and Saviour, we pray that he one day will release Paul Blart 3: Reveng of Jamal to the general public, but for now only Shaq and Gandhi are allowed to watch it for now. Blart's struggle with diabetes is very relatable to many people around the world, with Blart having a sugar induced seizure being a climatic scene. The setting of Jamal is very enticing, with Jamal playing the token black guy that eats fried chicken, drinks watermelons, plays basketball, and starts riots in Baltimore. In fact, Paul rides into Baltimore on his baller segway in a crucial scene in which he says to the rioters: Get out of my mall, jamal. In a mass suicide never seen before, the entire city commited sudoku on the spot (spoilers!). It really defines Blart as an american hero, destined to kill the army of negroes created by Jamal. Before this movie, I have stage 5 terminal brain cancer, but now I am on the list of the world's top ten healthiest people, tied with Robin Williams for number one (Paul Blart is ommitted from the list since he is too pure.). The movie ends with Blart going 88 miles per hour on his segway, taking Michael Fox to 1966 and destroying the 3rd Reich in an epic knife fight against mein glorious fuhrer, Mohammad Ali himself. After winning in a homage to the first movie, Blart frees all of the jews from their cages so they can once again work minimum wage at the local costco.  This movie is literally god itself. You will laugh. You will cry. You will ejaculate all over the child in front of you as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2: Return to Jamal starts playing. Jesus Christ died for this movie, if he were alive today he would kill himself so they could make another, thats how good this fuckin movie is. You are literal shit scum if you dont watch this movie, and you will die a horrible, painful death, knowing you couldn't watch this masterpiece. I was homeless, now Im not. Thats how good this movie was. This has been Paul Blart with your Channel 7 news, stay safe, and stay in the theaters, watching Paul Blart 2: Revenge of Jamal.",

            "content": "As a whole this film fails at reaching the very low mark of its predecessor in almost every way possible. This Die Hard-inspired comedy \"franchise\" has now just added a very pointless sequel. \n\nTaking place in Las Vegas, Nevada, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 stars Kevin James as Paul--a bumbling mall cop who takes his job way too seriously. Now he's in Vegas for a security convention where he must stop a heist of the casino.\n\nThe entire film takes place within the confines of the Wynn Resort and Casino. There is no galavanting around the strip or hopping from casino to casino--so the should-be glamorous Vegas element is very glamourless.\n\nAs flippant as the first film is, this one adds insensitivity to the equation. The movie starts out by picking up where we left Blart last in his life--when he gets married. But we find out that his wife leaves him after 6 days. This is a character we really grow to like in the previous film and love the fact that she seems to adore Paul regardless of his clumsy ways. And then Paul's mom--whom he lives with--dies by getting run over by a milk truck. This is all supposed to be funny, but instead it's a jarring beginning for the few fans of the first film. \n\nOverall, it's much of the same criticisms from the its predecessor, except more. There are maybe 3 solid laughs in the whole movie--but the rest of the jokes fall flat and are yawn-worthy. However, those 3 laughs may be bigger than the biggest laughs from the first film. Although in the first film there were way more of them. In this one, the highlight may be the bird-attack scene--which is played off to its brightest potential and gets the biggest laugh. One of Paul's cohorts is a security guard named Khan (Shelly Desai) who had most of the other laughs, but was grossly underutilized in this movie.\n\nAt least, in the end, there is a redeeming value to all of this. But then again, we could've just watched the first film twice.\n\nTwizard Rating: 59",

He arrives at the hotel and is ready for the meeting - only to find out his daughter is getting cozy with one of the hotel's younger employees.  This is something he tries to put a stop to.\n\tBut while those odd things are going on, a group of thieves are trying to replace original artwork in several hotels and casinos with fakes.  The thieves intend to sell the original artwork for a lot of money.\n\tAnd you guess it - it's up to Paul Blart - along with several fellow mall cops - to stop the heists.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tPaul Blart really gives it his all.  He's the one that drives the movie (as a comedy).  As for his daughter, she does have a few good moments, but she really doesn't shine as well as he does.  SCORE: 7\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe only member of the rest of the cast that's noteworthy is the worker in the hotel who slowly falls for Paul Blart.  \n\tHowever, the bad guys are really bland, and I felt like a lot of them were taken from you typical James Bond film (including their inability to hit where they are aiming.)  SCORE: 4\n\nPlot\n\tThe plot is okay, but there are far too many points where the characters overhear a critical piece of information (in other words, it's really contrived.)  SCORE: 4\n\nOriginality\n\tPaul Blart's giving it is all, but the rest of the film feels like your average heist film gone wrong.  SCORE: 4\n\nViolence Factor\n\tOne moment Paul Blart can't this a target from five feet away, and the next he's a perfect shot with that weapon (really).\n\tBesides, there are too many moments where the bad guys could've shot a good guy - and miss because they're such bad shots.  SCORE: 4\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is supposed to be about how one average man can make a huge difference in the security business.  It's too bad the rest of the cast just don't hold up their end of the bargain.  SCORE: 4\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 27\t\t\t% Score: 45%\nPaul Blart makes the film fun - everyone else makes this film forgettable.",

But nothing can be easy and when Blart learns about a heist about to go down, he does everything in his power to stop it.\n\nThe first Paul Blart: Mall Cop I thought was pretty terrible and not that funny, I haven't spoke to anyone who liked the first film so why the hell is they a squeal? maybe for money well if that's the case that back fired as this movie failed at the box office so that's money down the f**king drain. Damn you HollyWood for producing movies like this only for money and nothing else just to insult your auditions who went out of they way to pay and see your movie.\n\nThe whole running joke in the movie is fat Kevin James falling over or getting hurt by many different things around him and my god dose this movie repeat it. That is bad and lazy writing right there when your only joke is that. Is that what you could think of seriously?.\n\nThe acting from everyone was bad even Kevin James just did the stick in the mood \"Hey I'm Kevin James\", acting like in every movie he's been in. I know Kevin James is better than this and I actually like the guy in real life and I'm not here wanting him to fail, no I want him to pick roles were he's not just playing Kevin James in his past movies.\n\nPaul Blart is a mall cop and you think his in the mall all through out the movie, nope most of the movie his far away from the mall and he's in Vegas and he still wears the uniform and drives around in that stupid electric mall cop scooter.

It's a Happy Madison productions and it's like someone is afraid to tell the emperor he is naked. Just because you think of something doesn't make it funny. These Segway sight gags and a few more like scenes that let Kevin James \"act up\" really look like they were one take events. Sorry, no matter how effortless good comedy looks it takes some planning and practice, too many of these scenes just look like the stage directions were...fling your arms around for a while and then fall down.

In this sequel, Blart is invited as a distinguished guest to a conference of security officers in an upscale hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada and as chance would have it is the keynote speaker. In the background, a heist is being perpetrated by one of the hotel's guests to steal priceless art from its gallery and replace it with forgeries. Blart catches wind of this plot, and in John McClane style, takes down the villain's goons one-by-one, culminating in a zipline across the Las Vegas skyline. This movie has a 0% on rotten tomatoes from critic reviews. While I found the movie mostly dumb and inane, I certainly don't think it warrants a 0%. I at least found the movie passing, though admittedly not good. There are too many subplots in the movie, such as Blart's overprotective daddy issues and a family dynamic that feels out of place in a heist comedy. Smith does his best given the script, but it feels like he's there to be comic relief rather than a tangible, sympathetic lead. There were parts of the film I enjoyed, but some devolved into sheer idiocy. This is not a remarkable film but it has enough entertainment value to be a reasonable diversion from everyday life. Rather than spending full price in the theater, you may be better suited scoping this out on Red Box and having a nice laugh with the kids. I feel Kevin Smith deserves better than being typecasted as comic relief fodder ------------------------------------------------------------------ C",

Upon rediscovery, I gave it an astounding four stars. Indeed there are aspects in the first that make it more enjoyable than its sequel, which got a whopping 0% from critics. Seeing it out of both irony and to see if it was really that bad, yep, it was. It's overall boring, with so many jokes that fall flat and James falling on his ass and swerving around with segways.\nThe bumbling mall cop Paul Blart goes to Las Vegas to receive an award for his \"brave efforts\" - his teenage daughter is once again kidnapped by a group of art thieves, posing as hotel employees. Blart attempts to thwart them, it works unrealistically, it goes along so predictably.\nThe overexaggeration of Blart falling, being hit or kicked by animals, and his especially dull group of fellow cops in town for a convention makes the movie so boring. What makes it especially boring is it's like an hour and a half long tourism ad for a Vegas hotel, Blart is only in a mall for around 4 minutes in the beginning, seeing the same interiors over and over gets so dull. Blart's fat jokes and awkward laughs fall short, he tries to prove himself to be more fatherly in the sequel, looking back at the first he was a cliched but likable character in some aspects. Here, he's such a painful \"heroic\" fat cop stereotype. Paul Blart rightfully earns the title of the worst movie in the past 5 years that I've seen, out of Sandler films and Parental Guidance, Blart conquers only in making viewers cringe.",

It had some laughs, but it definitely did NOT deserve a sequel. The character of Paul Blart IS funny and a GOOD character. But the script and the writing are so bad, that people end up thinking the worst of him. They should have stayed in the Mall, because having Blart at the hotel just is not right. The film could give you some chuckles, but you will never DIE laughing. This film proves that the Film Green-Lighters have no idea what they are doing. For Example: There is going to be a TRILOGY on the Pitch Perfect series. And a Transformers Marvel-Inspired-Universe. People in a few years will be sick of Hollywood.\n\nOverall: Paul Blart 2 is what people thought it was going to be. As there is just NOTHING good in this movie. It is basically the first one, just in a Hotel in Vegas. Definitely one of the year's worst.\n\nRating: 11% and a D-",

Frankly, I hated the the first installment, it was loud & overbearing, in other words just too Kevin James aka filled with just fat jokes! Another film that released the same here with a very similar concept Observe & Report (starring Seth Rogen) was a way better film in my opinion. However, after the genre trappings of the first film, it's only logical that the sequel turns out to be a family-friendly Die Hard 2. That is to say, it's basically the first one, all over again, in a different location and somehow better. The story follows six years after the event of the 1st film, as the over-zealous mall security guard Blart (Kevin James) is afraid that he has peaked personally - his wife (Jayma Mays) left him six days into the marriage & his mother (Shirley Knight) gets hit by a milk truck . An invite to a prestigious security convention in Las Vegas, all expenses paid, cheers him up a little, and he takes his long-suffering daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) along for the ride. However, dastardly high roller Vincent (Neal McDonough) is planning to put Vegas' world-famous security to the test by robbing the hotel where the convention is being held. Though racked by his own ego, Blart stumbles upon their plot and teams up with fellow convention delegates to save the day. Having started on awkward form, the film sets itself into old school physical humor, which Kevin James is actually good at -  Repeated auto-accidents, running into clear glass windows and getting beat up by a peacock are just par for the course. Aside from all the \"fat man fall down\" jokes that persist throughout James' filmography, the sequel also reprises the previous film's  running joke, about Blart's hypoglycemia. Yes, Paul Blart is an idiot. He's also gluttonous, clumsy, overbearing, self-deluded, and obnoxious. He's a veritable personification of the seven dullest sins, which the movie celebrates, inviting us to laugh at Blart as he stuffs his face, trips over things, and generally behaves like a buffoon. Blart is the protagonist as punching bag. No, wait, he's the protagonist as misunderstood everyman: Lonely. Hard-working. Just trying to do his best in an unfriendly world. All he does is to earn the love in order to avoid being lonely. Like from his daughter, Maya, who is willing to sacrifice everything for him and forgo acceptance at UCLA because she cannot bear to leave her childlike father alone. Like from the hotel manager (Daniella Alonso) and head of security (Eduardo Ver√°stegui), whose rightful disdain for Blart as he blunders onto their turf and acts like an entitled moron will inevitably morph into literal adoration. If director Andy Fickman initially cannot decide if he wants us to laugh at Blart or cheer him on, he eventually comes down on the side of Blart Is Awesome! While the film may receive some harsh comments about the humor, I beg to say what do you expect from a film produced by Adam Sandler? It is going to find ways to make you laugh with its ridiculous gags, which may not be everyone's cup of tea! In the original 2009 film, Kevin James stepped out of Adam Sandler's shadow for the role of a lifetime, something which he is clearly good at! Neal McDonough as the film's villain has some funny moments as well! Especially his conversations with Blart on who is more crazier! James, who again co-writes the sequel with Nick Bakay, clearly has aimed at an audience even lower than producer Adam Sandler does in his own movies - the kids! On the whole, Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 may not be the best comedy out there, nor is it the worst! For people who enjoy physical comedies & don't mind films from Happy Madision (Adam Sandler films), will surely be entertained by this sequel, while the rest can avoid!",

            "content": "The first Paul Blart: Mall Cop was a pleasant surprise, it was an ode/homage to films like Die Hard. It had humour and heart, and solid acting all round. What it truly lacked was a villain.\n\nSo roll around the sequel, unfortunately what worked in the first Mall Cop is taken to the extreme and doesn't come off as charming as it did first time around.\n\nThe fact is this film is a mess in terms of storylines and at times appears it's an ode to Kevin James' ego which at times is jarring considering how much this sweet sensitive guy in the first one has become bigger bafoon than before. The rebellious daughter/overbearing father storyline is dragged to it's obvious conclusion.\n\nThe villains in this movie outwith the main two characters are just as interchangeable as they were in the first film. Though the plus side is Neal McDonough (TVs Justified Season 3) is particularly amusing when he gets flustered. Another storyline involves Danielle Alonso's hotel manager who on upon meeting Paul is told that she is attracted to Paul, and she is told this by Paul himself (ode to ego?) and by the end she is enamoured by Paul, which was a very cringeworthy storyline.\n\nNow there are two genuinely hilarious scenes in this film, the first scene is when Blart comes face to face with some sort of bird (possibly an osterich) in the hotel greenery area as he and the bird duke it out, the bird gets some good pecks and kicks in which offers genuine hilarity. The second genuine scene which made me laugh out loud was when Neal McDonough's character and Kevin James' character come face to face in a hilarious dialogue scene where they try to say how crazy they are compared to each other.\n\nOverall for me this film was a big disappointment, outwith those two scenes described above the laughs for the most part were cringeworthy, the story wasn't particularly engaging and it lacked the charm of the original. One to watch if you love Kevin James films otherwise you won't be missing anything special.",

Paul blart's mom died because she got hit by a milk truck while trying to reach the newspaper *spoiler alert, wife divorces paul after 6 days.* He plays becomes the super hero and saves the day at a Las vegas hotel. alot of talking, unfunny humor. not enough action. ends with his daughter maya going off to UCLA. Paul gets the medal of honor for saving the day at the hotel & painting. it's a painting not crime prevention like the previous movie. critics on rotten tomatoes rating was 0 % 40 % audience liked it. that's how bad the movie is.",

            "content": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is an action comedy that is neither entertaining nor funny. There were not many expectations to be looking forward too, especially from the Happy Madison production company that Adam Sandler usually produces. Most of their films are going downhill with their lackluster comedy films. Mall Cop 2 is one of them; it carries the same humor that was in the 2009 predecessor. Yes, the first movie was fair and had some comical moments. The sequel is redoing the same humor, and it is rather eye rolling annoying than funny. Kevin James produces, wrote, and stars again in his film and the movie is filled with same repetitive fat jokes, redundant slapstick humor, and cringing bad one-liners.\n\n The plot takes place six years after the first movie; Paul Blart (Kevin James) is trying recover from some unexpected events. He goes on a trip with his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) to a security officer convention in Las Vegas. Then, a gang lead by Vincent (Neal McDonough) is plotting to steal the artwork in that hotel. Paul has taken to his responsibility to stop them.\n\n\n The plot is ridiculous, and filled with the repetitive clich√É (C)s that we all have seen before. Paul and Maya are now struggling with the father and daughter relationship, as Maya is growing up and trying to live a life of her own by making new friends and her protective father is restricting her. There are other characters that are also introduced in the movie, but are written one-dimensional which makes it forgettable. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is a horrible film; it does show Kevin James and his lack of creativity in bringing new humor to the sequel but ends up falling back to a repeat of the original movie.",

            "content": "\"John Wick, shoot me now! \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" has stabbed film criticism in the heart\"\nMovie Review: Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\nDate Viewed: May 7 2015\nRating: Zero stars out of Five (No Half-star, it's really awful)\nDirected By Andy Fickman (She's the Man, Parental Guidance, Race to Witch Mountain and You Again)\nWritten By Kevin James and Nick Bakay\nStarring: Kevin James, Neal McDonough, Raini Rodriguez, David Henrie, Loni Love, \nDaniella Alonso, D.B. Woodside, Eduardo Verastegui, Gary Valentine, Vic Dibitetto, Nicholas Turturro, Ana Gasteyer, Geovanni Gopradi and Shirley Knight.\n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" has stabbed film criticism in the heart. It is soulless, lifeless, unfunny, putrid and worthless. It's one of the worst movies of this or any other year. Is this finally it for Kevin James? Has he run out of jokes? You're the King of Queens! You should know better. The only joke James can think of is the \"fat man falling down\" joke. He has repeated this joke to death. Apparently, James never met a \"fat man falling down\" joke he didn't like. Anyways, back to the larger point, why does \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" even exist? Why did it take James and Sony Pictures six years to make a sequel? Why should we even care about Paul Blart anyway? He's like Homer Simpson if he had hair, a badge and a police scooter. These two guys may not have a brain in their heads but Homer at least had memorable catchphrases and a decent job, Paul Blart is barely anything at all.\n\nThe first \"Paul Blart\" movie (which grossed an astonishing $186 million worldwide) was stupid and lazy but at least James was hard-working. Believe it or not the sequel is even worse than I thought it was going to be. There's barely a plot here, it's just Kevin James taking a nice vacation to Las Vegas and falling down over and over and over again. After the events of the first film, Paul (James) gets a notice in the mail saying his wife, Amy (Jayma Mays) has left him after just six days of marriage. To make matters worse for Blart, his mother (Shirley Knight) gets run over by a milk truck. Paul's long-suffering daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez) just got accepted to UCLA but she doesn't know how to tell her father because he is damaged and lonely. Paul also gets a letter in the mail, it's an invitation to go to a security officers convention in Las Vegas. WOW! Mr. James you won a free trip to Las Vegas! Did you win the trip by going on Wheel of Fortune or was it payed for by Columbia Pictures? \n\nMeanwhile, a group of art thieves led by Vincent (Neal McDonough) want to steal priceless paintings from the Wynn hotel. While his daughter hangs out with a young parking attendant (David Henrie), Paul is led to believe that he is the key note speaker of the security convention. When Maya gets kidnapped by Vincent, it is up to John McClane, I mean Paul Blart to save the day.\nHow did Paul Blart drained my soul away from my body? He has a fight with an angry peacock, he stumbles into a production of \"Le Reve\", the big Cirque du Soleli water show, he encounters a Mini KISS tribute band on an elevator, and he takes out the bad guys by shooting bean bags and marbles at them. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the filmmakers are still mining this material as if \"Home Alone\" never happened. \n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is like a lot of other Happy Madison productions, it has weak slapstick, annoying characters, product placement, a fake heart at the end and it's essentially a vacation disguised as a movie. The direction by Andy Fickman (Parental Guidance, You Again and She's the Man) is so lazy, I'll bet he walked away from the camera to either play poker or hit the slot machines in a casino somewhere. The sequel was written by James and Nick Bakay (who is capable doing better work as well). \n\nSince he thought making \"Paul Blart 2\" was so much fun, James dragged genuinely funny people like Loni Love, Nicholas Turturro, former \"SNL\" cast member Ana Gasteyer and even his own brother, Gary Valentine into this mess as well. James has taken the word obnoxious to a whole new level because he transforms Paul Blart into a rude, self-absorbed, over-protective idiot of a father to his daughter. Naturally, his wild behavior makes the beautiful general manager of the hotel fall in love with him. Okay?... Why do you think Paul Blart is so attractive?\n\nWhen you're watching an awful comedy like this, you expect to groan or roll your eyes but here, the jokes don't fly at all, James just assumes that these situations are going to be funny of themselves. Since the movie was mostly shot at the Wynn hotel, Steve Wynn has an awkward cameo at the end with a speech balloon on his head that reads: \"Why did I contribute money to this piece of $&@?\"\nSeveral days after it was released, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" scored a perfect 0% at Rotten Tomatoes but the rating was increased to just 6%. Let's just pretend that \"Paul Blart 2\" still has a 0% rating because the three critics who gave it a positive review are completely out of touch with the film world. Bruce Bennett, Jim Schembri and Simon Weaving should be ashamed of themselves for giving this awful movie a thumbs up. \n\nAmong the jokes that don't work in this movie, when Blart is lying face-down on the floor, he crawls underneath a child's dripping ice cream cone just to increase his blood sugar and when Blart runs into a production assistant of \"Le Reve\", a disturbing scene happens, he eats a brown banana. Neal McDonough isn't given anything to do either, we learn that his character is allergic to oatmeal. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen to him at the end? When Blart finally encounters Vincent, they scream silly lines to each other. Here's one of them: \"I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!\". Finally what is up with the young hotel valet who has all day to hang out with the daughter? Do you even work at the Wynn hotel? \n\nWhat happened to you Kevin James? You were a likable person, you were funny on TV and in \"Hitch\" but here you only managed to make \"Zookeeper\" look like \"Boyhood\". Placing itself as one of the worst sequels of all time, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" officially marks the death of film criticism as we know it.",

            "content": "With Paul Blart: Mall Cop effectively getting worse with every year of age that passed me and Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 being more critically panned than its predecessor, I felt like I needed to see just how low the film could sink.\n\nTo my surprise, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 was actually a significant improvement over its predecessor. That isn't necessarily the biggest piece of credibility due to the fact that Paul Blart: Mall Cop was simply dreadful.\nThe intro to Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is just dark. The titular character gets dumped by his wife six days into marriage, slapped by a child who won't hug him and then his mother is killed by a milk truck which is shown on screen. The humour is oddly dark for the mere intro to the film, and it doesn't precisely set the film up to be funny. If anything, I was laughing because the general idea of it all was just so stupid that I couldn't believe someone actually considered it a good idea. In actual fact, the level of ridiculousness in the film actually achieves humourous results because the entire thing is so damned stupid that the very idea of it actually being produced is able to create comedic results. Aside from the tedious character subplots, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 genuinely had a better story to it than its predecessor. Part of this is because Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 at least has better villains. The first one had a bunch of MTV stunt performers pretending to be criminals, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 attempts to be slightly more serious with the use of familiar yet more believable antagonists. The story is certainly far from ground breaking, but it at least puts more focus into delivering on its generic contract in terms of cheap gags and random sketches.\nWhat Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 calls character building is actually just an extended period of generic plot points which are short on genuine dramatic strength, rarely funny and rather familiar. But since the film paces itself more energetically, it doesn't focus on this too much. The budget of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a meager $4 million larger than its predecessor, yet the money is distributed more evenly this time around. Instead of the film relying too heavily on slow character building, the nature of everyone has already been established by the first film and this sequel just attempts to build off it. The budget is spent more on lively scenery and ridiculous stunts than anything, though the film manages to keep itself on a low budget the entire time. Admittedly, one of the negative results of this is the second-rate visual effects, but it is merely one of the flawed technical elements in a film which has a steady amount of colourful imagery. The change of setting is nice because the natural life of the hotel from all its glamourous lights to sparkling pools certainly lights up the screen, and it is all captured with nice cinematography.\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is intended to be an action comedy like its predecessor, but due to a story that takes itself slightly more seriously than the significantly more childish nature of the first one, there is a greater use of action this time around. Spread out sensibly over the short 90 minute running time, the pace of the film is made better by a greater moderation between over the top stunt gags and other attempts at humour. Sometimes, the over the top energy of the film actually proves entertaining, and the fast pace of it all keeps some level of consistent movement going on, effectively ensuring that the film does not mess around with frustrating drama all that much. \nTo put it simply, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is obviously not a good film. It's story is generic, its humour is repetitive and there is a general feeling of predictability in it all. But thanks to a sporadic collection of unexpectedly over-the-top humour and an energetic effort from Kevin James, it isn't necessarily a boring one if viewed in the correct state of mind.\nThough I expected Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 to be unfunny, I did hold hopes that would find some level of enjoyment in the performance of Kevin James. And in all essence, I did. Kevin James' natural comedic energy makes him a genial presence in Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, and it elevates the thin writing of the film to some mild extent of comic success. The fact that Kevin James takes the role so seriously is entertaining because he manages to actually take a stand as a legitimate action hero while also keeping it at such a level where it remains within the confines of a juvenile comedy. The man's insistence on injecting all his energy into the physical humour of the film is actually admirable on some level as the jokes are extremely repetitive, but the sight of Kevin James doing all his stunts is good for a sporadic laugh. Kevin James has a certain level of charm about him when it comes to line delivery and a massive load of physical energy which he empties into Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 without remorse, so his leading effort should appeal to his fans on some level.\nThere aren't really any other cast members that end up making much of an impact though. I didn't really expect many to make much of a difference, but the presence of Gary Valentine was something I hoped would be bring more laughter into it. When there was ultimately nothing funny about him being in the film, I'll admit to being disappointed. \n\nSo Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is precisely as ludicrous and derivative as you would expect, but its overtly ridiculous nature and the energetic leading effort of Kevin James manages to keep a sense of consistent energy in the sporadic laughs of the film.",
