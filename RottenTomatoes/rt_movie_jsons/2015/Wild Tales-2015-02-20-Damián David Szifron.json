These aren't your typical stories of betrayal, anger and revenge, though.  They are barbaric and violent and, more than anything else, ingenious.  The writing is absolutely brilliant, the acting is superb throughout, and the stories are absolutely jaw-dropping at times, horrifying but hilarious.  Filled with sardonic black humor, it's hard to find laughter in bombings, plane crashes, murder, road rage and a myriad of other bleak subjects, but Wild Tales succeeds.  It is a surprisingly refreshing film that anyone who has ever clenched their teeth at the actions of others will appreciate and embrace.",

Divided into six pieces, all of them increasing in lenght, we meet people in distress or in vivid situations, but most importantly they are done in a very realistic and somewhat relatable manner.\n\nThe first one is about people on a plane, with a mutual friend. The next one has a douche ordering some night food at a diner. Then there's the guy with the troubled car and his follower. The fourth one is about a man with explosives and a hatred towards a car parking company. The fith one involves a DUI-murder and the final, and sixth piece of this film is involving a wedding. I like all of the stories and I tend to dig films like this. They have nothing connected accept the people in some sort of crisis. I think I like number three or five the most and my least favorite may be the sixth or the fourth.\n\nMany faces here, some of them are pretty known faces for fans of world cinema.\nFirst and foremost an entertaining and smart piece of work. Humor filled, laced with dark episodes that are far out - not especially realistic to take place in real life, but still these are things that might actually happen.\n\nI can't understand why this stayed unheard of be me for such a long time, being on IMDB's top 250 list and everything. It worked out well for me and is a fresh, entertaining piece, with smart moves and neat photography.\n\n8.5 out of 10 cameras stuck to moving things.",

            "content": "It‚Äôs always tough reviewing and rating anthology films, because each piece of the film has its own merits and flaws in different quantities. I‚Äôm not going to break down Wild Tales and review each short independently, because there‚Äôs not much to say without spoiling what happens in them. So keeping my thoughts general about the entire film, my biggest complaint with this movie as a whole is that the shorts got progressively worse and less engaging as the movie progressed. Literally, my favorite one was before the title card. Personally I would have liked to see it structured differently so that there was more of a build towards the truly powerful ones. The theme seemed to be simply about reaching your breaking point and how different people behave when their anger becomes too much to hold inside. I thought the cast was strong in all the shorts and they were filmed well also. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think this is a type of movie that I latch onto all that well. I find it thoroughly unsatisfying, particularly when I‚Äôm fully engaged in a story and want it to continue, but then it ends unceremoniously. While there was nothing deeply flawed in Wild Tales, there also wasn‚Äôt enough to make me care about it either. If this is a style of movie you enjoy, then it‚Äôs definitely a good example of an anthology film without any truly bad shorts in it, but if you‚Äôre like me it will prove OK at best.",

What will be his decision?\n\n(6) \"Until Death Do Us Apart\": During the wedding party, the wife discovers that her husband has cheated her with one of the guests and decides to payback. \n\n\"Wild Tales\" (Spanish: Relatos salvajes) is a 2014 Argentine-Spanish black comedy anthology film composed of six standalone shorts, all written and directed by Dami√°n Szifron, united by a common theme of violence and vengeance. The film received considerable acclaim, particularly in South America where it won many accolades, as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language in the United Kingdom and the Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film in Spain. Additionally, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, and for the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Despite the clear common theme of violence and vengeance, what connects the accounts, according to the director, is \"the fuzzy boundary that separates civilization from barbarism, the vertigo of losing your temper, and the undeniable pleasure of losing control\". This is explored through the concept that human beings have animalistic features. Szifron considers the main difference between human and animals is the capacity one has to restrain oneself as opposed to animals who are guided by their instincts. Humans \"have a fight or flee mechanism, but it comes with a very high cost. Most of us live with the frustration of having to repress oneself, but some people explode. This is a movie about those who explode\". It deals with \"daily life\" aspects and \"is a movie about the desire for freedom, and how this lack of freedom, and the rage and anguish it produces, can cause us to run off the rails.\" The main issue, according to Szifron, \"is the pleasure of reacting, the pleasure of reacting toward injustice.\"\n\nThe film is said to feature a \"political anger\" and \"political subversiveness,\" and, according to La Capital, it has sparked debates about its \"sociological and political side.\" As such, the newspaper promoted a debate about the film with social security specialist Mart√≠n Appiolaza and sociologist Daniel Cholakian. Appiolaza said the film shows both structural violence and specific violences on school, work, among couples, as well as different types of discrimination. He concluded, \"the theme of the film is the inequality that arouses violent reactions\". In contrast, Cholakian stated it depicted a particular form of violence; the violence that involves upper middle class urban people. He affirmed that in reality the main victims of social violence are the poorest people, \"So the film is light years from reflecting the universality of that theme\". Cholakian went further, commenting he refused to discuss violence from Wild Tales and dared to think that Szifron would agree with him. However, Szifron believed it had a universal range \"in a world where power is concentrated in the hands of a small group of wealthy and powerful individuals.\" Several reviewers interpreted the film as a critic of the \"21st-century Argentinean daily life\" or \"a backdrop of 20th century Argentine oppression\". However, Szifron said it could be set \"in any other country and in any other period of time\". He declared the central theme is universal: \"man versus a system that's designed against him, not to facilitate life, but to take things out of you.\" As such, it criticises several problems and \"frustrations of contemporary life\", including government and corporate corruption, bureaucratic malfeasance, economic and social inequality, injustice, emotional and physical abuse, class and gender bias, macho culture, and need for revenge. It deals with money, power and elitism, and depicts people as selfish, betrayer, and materialistic. In such \"social Darwinian world\", the acts of vengeance are usually motivated by class or economic conflicts, and underlying them is a desire to break free from what Szifron refers to as the \"capitalist cage\". Claudia Puig of USA Today said it explores \"the dark side of humanity and the dehumanization of society\", while Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post felt it was \"a sharply observed case study in human nature.\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire affirmed the last segment alters the overall meaning of the film: \"The bizarrely touching conclusion is a cynical take on the ups and downs of a relationship, hinting at the idea that even a mad world divided against itself thrives on the need for companionship.\" On the other hand, Ty Burr from Boston Globe concluded, \"there is no lasting meaning, other than that people are funny, nasty animals when pushed to their limits.\" Burr stated it has a \"masterful sense of cinematic storytelling\", while O'Sullivan affirmed \"Szifr√≥n handles the tone and presentation masterfully\". Ariston Anderson from Filmmaker commented, \"There is truly never a dull moment ... Wild Tales is a laugh-out-loud riot from start to finish\", and Mar Diestro-D√≥pido of Sight & Sound said, \"Each morsel of well-rounded, perfectly structured storytelling becomes part of a coherent, exuberant whole\". Clar√≠n film critic, Pablo O. Scholz, said \"The film pulls us in from the start until the end\". Although he commented each story tone is different, Scholz stated the \"tension ... never decays, and keeps the viewer with a knot in the stomatch for two hours\". In opposition, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times was critical of its pace: \"Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Dami√°n Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology Wild Tales.\" Robert Horton from Seattle Weekly further criticized it for relying on twists, \"a technique that doesn't quite disguise how in-your-face the lessons are\", and ultimately dubbed the film \"a scattering of gotchas\". The humor was called \"a subversive [one] that manages to be both psychologically astute and all-out outrageous\" by Jay Weissberg of Variety. Diestro-D√≥pido said \"The humour of Wild Tales is pitch-black, its irony razor-sharp, its sarcasm painfully perverse and its unpredictability ludicrous, violent but also bitingly funny\". Manohla Dargis from The New York Times compared its use of humor and coincidence to O. Henry's work, as well as did Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly because of its \"ironic twist endings\". The cast was deemed consistent through the episodes by The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, and said to be \"superb\" by Diestro-D√≥pido. √ârica Rivas received particular appraisal for her \"star-making performance\", as dubbed by Bruce Ingram of Chicago Sun-Times.[49] While David Edelstein of Vulture.com said the cast is \"incredibly credible given the characters' outlandish behavior,\" Horton was critical of the characterization, stating characters have \"illogical behavior\", mostly in the last segment. Similarly, Richard Brody of The New Yorker said it \"offers little in the way of context or characterization\" and then \"characters behave so rudely and crudely, there's no reason to care about what happens to them.\" On the other hand, O'Sullivan declared, \"The protagonists are exaggerated without being caricatures\", and Jordan Hoffman of the New York Daily News affirmed, \"All are funny because all feel true\".Puig, Steven Rea of Philly.com and Diestro-D√≥pido also felt the characters are believable and relatable because most viewers would feel familiar with the situations or frustrations characters go through. \"Visuals are flawless\", stated Weissberg, who praised both its special effects and its cinematography by Javier Julia, who has \"a lean sense of irony that adds to the general pleasure\". The reason it is a \"good-looking film ... crafted in high style\" is, in Rooney's opinion, credited to \"lots of eye-catching touches from production designer Clara Notari and unconventional camera angles from cinematographer Javier Julia.\" For Peter Howell of Toronto Star, Julia \"imparts a visual appreciation of the absurd that's somewhere between a Looney Tunes cartoon and Grand Guignol theatre.\" The music by Gustavo Santaollala was deemed \"a terrific spaghetti Western-flavored score\" by Rooney. Weissberg affirmed the soundtrack \"fits the tone without pushing any wink-wink superiority\". Weissberg commented that while \"the overall enjoyment rarely flags\", \"not all the episodes are equally successful\". For example, Weissberg and O'Sullivan said \"The Bill\" felt displaced within the film because of its \"darker tone\", and its \"mood of bitter cynicism. According to Howell, \"It lacks the manic love of the ridiculous that runs through other sketches\", and Puig affirmed it \"borders on melodrama.\" Rooney further considered it and \"Bombita\" had \"a more sober tone that lets the air out of the balloon of delirious mayhem created by the opening three episodes.\" In fact, the first segment was said to be \"a perfect starter\" by Puig, and Horton said \"the rest of this anthology feature doesn't live up to the wicked curtain-raiser\". Also, Rea considered it to the best segment along with the last one. While Hoffman commented, \"The final set piece is the most outrageous\", Nashawaty deemed \"The Bill\" the best segment, and David Edelstein of Vulture.com considered \"Bombita\" \"the purest of all the tales, the one that distills the mad-as-hell vigilante\". Nashawaty criticized \"Road to Hell\" because it \"feel[s] like cheeky [a] one-joke setup in search of a second or third joke\". In opposition, Weissberg affirmed \"Szifron's consummate skill at narration and setup, combined with inventive absurdity, makes it fresh and thoroughly entertaining.\" Both in Europe and Latin America film critics dubbed it \"Characters on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\", alluding to Almod√≥var's Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, which Almod√≥var himself considered a fair comparison. For example, on Almodovar influence, Rooney said \"It's there in the off-kilter humor, in the stylish visuals and bold use of music, and in the affection for ordinary people pushed to extraordinary extremes.\" Bob Mondello of NPR said the last segment \"is weird, sexy and violent enough to make you think of the wild tales of director Pedro Almod√≥var\". Other similarities were noted, including to Pulp Fiction, Steven Spielberg's Duel, Michael Douglas-featuring Falling Down, and Emir Kusturica. While \"Pasternak\" was often compared to The Twilight Zone because of its series of revelations, the third segment was often compared to a cartoon, especifically to a Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoon, and was said to have slapstick touches and to be \"Tarantino-esque\". It was also labeled \"a cross between Steven Spielberg's Duel and a violent Tom and Jerry cartoon\" by Nashawaty, and \"a combination of Deliverance and an R-rated Wile E. Coyote cartoon\" by Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail.\n\nRevenge is of course a topic all of us have thought of in many ways, but most likely never really executed, not at least the way the characters execute revenge in \"Wild Tales\". A film containing of  6 different stories with revenge as the common theme in one way or another. It¬¥s dark, funny, terrifying, brutal and thrilling. Not all six stories are great, but most of them are engaging and disturbing. It¬¥s about the pleasure of losing control and giving in to unrestrained strong passions no matter how violent the result might be. Civilization is supposed to free us from savagery, but in this case savagery free the characters from civilization. The tension we are building up in life via work, relationships, friendships etc etc might never be taken cared of. We do need to get rid of all that tension. \"Wild Tales\" show us how it might be done. Not maybe in a safe or consequence free sort of way. But, still how it might be done. As Rotten Tomatoes says it¬¥s \"Wickedly hilarious and delightfully deranged\". Yes, it is, but it¬¥s also a bit scattered in it¬¥s format and a bit unbalanced between the stories. \"Wild Tales\" is still a strange and rememberable ride.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Episodenfilme geniessen nicht den besten Ruf. Immer wird man aus dem Fluss der Erz√§hlung gerissen, wenn wieder etwas Neues beginnt und ausserdem k√∂nnen die einzelnen Geschichten oft nicht ein Niveau halten. Man f√ºhre sich all diese Nachteile vor Augen, um die sch√∂ne √úberraschung zu begreifen, die Wild Tales darstellt: Es ist vermutlich der beste Episodenfilm, den ich bis dahin gesehen habe! Gross ist die Fertigkeit der Macher, die Defizite des Episodenfilms zu √ºberbr√ºcken und uns ein Werk wie aus einem Guss zu schenken. Ich denke, der Vorteil von Wild Tales ist der, dass sich nur ein Regisseur daf√ºr verantwortlich zeichnet: Damian Szifron. Szifron hat grosse Qualit√§ten, nicht nur als Regisseur, sondern auch als Geschichtenerz√§hler: Jedes der sechs Kapitel (keines ist l√§nger als 20 Minuten) ist spannend und von √§tzendem schwarzen Humor gepr√§gt. Zorn ist die Triebfeder der sechs Episoden. Am Ende stehen Rache und Vergeltung - wohl aber mit unvohersehbarer Wendung, um der moralischen Gewissheit den Boden unter den F√ºssen zu entziehen. In der ersten Geschichten befinden sich Flugzeugg√§ste in der Maschine eines Mannes, dem sie in der Vergangenheit alle √ºbel mitgespielt haben. Sodann erkennt eine Kellnerin einen ihrer G√§ste: Es ist der Kredithai, der ihren Vater in den Selbstmord trieb. Die dritte Episode handelt von der Eskalation eines √úberholman√∂vers. Der vierte Abschnitt zeigt einen Sprengmeister, der gegen die Beh√∂rden k√§mpft, im f√ºnften gehts um Korruption und die sechste Geschichte schliesslich handelt von einer entfesselten Hochzeit. Ich denke, jedes der sechs Kapitel hat an sich die Qualit√§t, ein Kurzfilm-Festival abzur√§umen. Zusammen haben sie die mitreissende Energie einer wahrhaft k√ºnstlerischen Vision! Wir werden bestimmt noch von ihm h√∂hren, denn f√ºr mich besitzt Szifron Format! Weitere schwarze Kom√∂dien gibts in unserer Film List auf cinegeek.de",

They're staples of cinema, from Once Upon a\nTime in the West, Oldboy through to what Dami√°n Szifr√≥n's multiple\nstory filled saga Wild Tales could compare itself to most, Falling\nDown.\n\nIn Joel Schumacher's well liked and remembered Michael Douglas starrer\nfrom 1993 where Douglas's William Foster had finally had enough and\ntook his anger out on a city (and its poor fast food workers) audiences\ngot to live viscerally through scenarios that our wildest imaginations\nhave perhaps at times wandered off to and it's in this unlikely yet\nsomehow relatable subconscious that Szifron makes Wild Tales work as\nsome form of distant cousin to Schumacher's anti-establishment flick.\n\nBacked by famed director Pedro Almodovar, Szifron's Argentinian film\n(which was nominated for Best Foreign Film at last year's Academy\nAwards) is a well shot and highly dark collection of stories that all\nin some way, shape or form centre around revenge.\n\nAs with all such films that feature a mishmash of stories, Szifron\nfinds himself succeeding at some (a highway set piece and a hit and run\ncover up are highlights) whilst other scenarios like a diner scene or\nthe films wedding finale feel a tad underwhelming but Wild Tales\nconstantly engages the audience with its for lack of better word \"wild\"\ntone and lack of political correctness that would not be found in a\nHollywood production of a similar ilk.\n\nBlood is spilled, explosions are ignited and rat poison is used in but\na few of Wild Tales scenes and the film has an air of unpredictability\nabout it that will often have you on tenterhooks even if the film\ncould've lost 15 - 20 minutes in the editing suite thanks to a few\nsegments that seem a little flabby around the edges, with drawn out\nsituations and scenes, but there's little doubting the originality of\nmuch of what Wild Tales brings to the table.\n\nFor fans of dark comedy not unlike early Coen Brother films or even a\nTarantino creation, Wild Tales could just well become a new favourite\nand while some segments fall a little flat, Wild Tales is certainly one\nheck of a ride and the perfect antidote for those seeking a break from\nthe usual Hollywood fair.\n\n3  1/2 angry chefs out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

The premise of the movie is six short stories, each darker than the last, about injustice, poverty, and violence that grip much of the world. Each story is simple: one is a wedding, one is a business trip, and one is even a visit to a local diner. And each is immensely bloody, like a long, chopped up spaghetti western. \"Wild Tales\" is massively funny, yet scary, all at the same time. It was acted beautifully and, despite having to read subtitles, it was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year.",

One of the major reasons most anthology films don't work for me is that most of the time, even if there's a few good sequences, there's usually one or two weaker stories that are there to just pad the time. Wild Tales luckily isn't like that, while one or two of the stories may feel \"lesser\" than the others, they are still good on their own and because of either runtime or subject they just may feel a little slighter.",

            "content": "With the name of Pedro Almodovar tagged to the film, Wild Tales instantly made it clear that talented people were involved in the production.\n\nOf all the films to be nominated for the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film, Wild Tales proves to be best option on the list. I've never seen an anthology film with quite as many contrasting stories that all maintain such striking dramtatic strength yet little minimal relevance to each other. The only thing consistent over the course of the narratives in Wild Tales is the general mood of things as there is always a sense of tenacious drama with underlying dark humour. I found myself consistently embracing the intense drama presented by the stories and laughing pretty hard as well, meaning that Wild Tales was indeed an extremely powerful as an experience. This is easy to understand from the first moment in the film where Wild Tales unveils one of the most unconventional short stories I've ever seen depicted on screen. That was the first big surprise of the film, and from there on they just kept coming.\nThe only down point for the film would be the third story in the anthology entitled \"The Strongest\" which chronicles two men fighting frantically over a masculine dispute of agression in driving. It's not a bad segment, it's just overly simplistic and lacks the entertaining edge and characters that the rest of them maintain. This is because the segment is bereft of character and is constructed solely out of deadpan slapstick comedy in a heavily western setting and does not have that much of a story, making it a rather slow and long stretch for a story which does not have much to substantiate it. Luckily the film is an anthology film which means it has more stories that come after it instead of following the blank style of this one segment for the entire feature.And also, it gets it out of the way soon into the film proceeds back to better narratives.\nWith the exception of The Strongest, each narrative in Wild Tales contains strong characters who are all scripted to be of extensive levels of depth. Nobody is really an archetype, and every single character is of absolute importance to their respective stories which means that the extensive cast of the film really need to dedicate themselves. There is not a single cast member who falters as all the performances are rock solid and captivating, in particular the efforts of Ricardo Darin whose restrained yet occasionally striking dramatic efforts give a thoroughly sympathetic protagonist to the story \"Little Bomb\" while Erica Rivas' beautiful ability to capture an innocent and beautiful bride driven insane by her husband's infidelity in \"Until Death Do Us Part\" is as explosive as the bomb from Little Bomb. However, in a case where The Strongest is not an exception, every single story in Wild Tales is rich with tone. As well as dramatic strength and dark humour, the narratives in Wild Tales work out a sense of social commentary to make about edgy topics and social situations which are approached in a manner so blunt by director Damian Szifron that there is nothing to hide. The viewer is forced to confront the brutal reality of these situations and question the world around them as a means of establishing their stance on the events that occur. \nThe screenplay in Wild Tales is of absolute brilliance because the stories are so intriguing, the characters are so deep and the language is so insightful. But most importantly, the film is the furthest things from predictable. There is no telling what could come next, and that makes the intense experience of the film exciting because the unpredictability in Wild Tales ensures that it lives up to the promises presented by its title. The stories develop at their own natural pace which means the experience is a slow one, but I treasured every second of the film with the exception of The Strongest which I remain somewhat indifferent to. And yet even though there is so much complicated subtext in the themes of the film, the stories are simple on the surface which means they are easy to understand while the extent that the viewer is willing to think about them proves to be the source of thought provocation. And the entire time, there is always a sense of style in the film. The narratives are largely about how grim our world is in various fashions, and this feeling is ultimately reflected through the style of Wild Tales as the colour scheme is rather monochromatic. It presents a grim feel to the story which matches the intense atmosphere, and the cinematography always matches the drama through either capturing everything up close with claustrophobic intensity or from a distance to show just how empty the cold and dark world around the characters truly is. The style of the film is a subtle element, and yet it captures the manic mood of the story very nicely. \nLastly, the film is made more atmospheric by its use of sound. The rare use of diegetic music in Wild Tales adds tension to it, but most of the time the drama is flourishing so much that the intensity develops when there is just silence and occasional subtle sound effects. The sound, or lack thereof in Wild Tales is truly an understated yet powerful dramatic asset to the success of the film, and it just goes to show how well the story develops its drama on its own and doesn't need Hollywood dramatization conventions to levate it any further.\n\nSo Wild Tales is a brilliantly written collection of stories with tenacious directorial work from Damian Szifron who grips the dark comedy and intense drama of the story all while the cast deliver performances as strong as the characters given to them.",

My personal favorite is the last one set in a lavish wedding. It is difficult to find fault with anything about this movie. My reason for not fully enjoying this unique film is it left me unsatisfied. Each story is so well made, I think I would have enjoyed it more if had been one Wild Tale instead several short ones. At least three of the tales had enough substance to have been developed into a feature length film. But that is not the point Of Szifron's film. He is interested in creating a film that hints at societal/cultural satire, but is fully vested in exploring how \"normal\" people can be pushed to the brink of insanity when realty takes a sharp and unexpected turn. Sometimes those turns are slower -- pressure builds. Other times, it assaults the characters all at once. I get it. I just wanted more.",

It is good entertainment, but the technique weakens when the characters and stories do. The \"gay\" corpses were a bit trite. The father would have been better off stopping at his second-last negotiating position. The wedding should have ended in violence. Why do these filmmakers, who are so au fait with rage and retribution, look for resolution and even a happy ending? Granted that is what sells films. But this package was better as a dark comedy, so long as the farce continued, and when that was drawn back into a downbeat, it lost its power. Someone said that Tarantino should learn from this film - he knows better how to drive the violence to its destination. But don't let that deter you. Not many films are prepared to go as far as this; and it is far more political than anything he has done. It joins an increasing chorus of people having had it up to here. Plenty of flesh on the bone; plenty of material for discussion over a plate of something piquant.",

            "content": "This is one of the best anthology films in recent memory.  Hell, it might be one of the best anthology films that has ever been made.  Part of the problem, particularly in a lot of recent anthology films, is that it's a collaboration between different filmmakers ala ABCs Of Death, the VHS series, among others.  And I don't think there's a problem with that at all, but that's where a lot of the inconsistency in quality comes in.  You bring in more chefs to the kitchen and the higher the chances are you get an ingredient that just doesn't mix.  VHS: Viral proved this.  Though, to be fair, the quality of the shorts themselves were considerably lower than both films in that series, though there was one excellent short in there.  I think this film's strength lies in the fact that, despite it being various stories of different people from different societal backgrounds, there's only one person handling the creative aspect of it.  While they're all very different shorts, ranging from a flight attendant poisoning the pilot and co-pilot of a plane that's carrying all the people who treated him negatively during his life and forcing it to crash, to a very extreme example of road rage, to poisoning the man who forced a waitress' father's suicide, to being fed up with the injustices of the government, extortion and blackmail and, finally, a wedding from hell.  All very different types of stories, but all offering up their own little slice of dark and twisted entertainment.  You cannot say this about a lot of anthology films, but every segment is, at worst, good.  And more than several of them are actually really fucking great.  The first segment, with the plane crash is short and to the point, but absolutely excellent.  The second short, the one in the diner, is probably the 'weakest' of them all.  This isn't a complaint in the least, as this is one also really fucking good, but it just doesn't reach the levels of insanity the other segments reached.  The third short, the one about the road rage, is another excellent short.  The fourth one, the one about the car being towed away is probably my personal favorite.  It just has a great narrative with an incredibly satisfying conclusion.  It's probably the one that most people will relate to, since it focuses more on the little bullshit ways the government tries to fuck you over.  The fifth one, about the blackmail, is also a really good one.  It's probably, out of all of them, the best written and the best acted.  Of course, when your cast is as stacked as this film is, any victory in terms of acting quality is won by inches and not by miles, but the penultimate one, still, in my mind, is the best in terms of quality.  The wedding from hell, which is the last short, starts off a little slowly but, once again, builds to an excellent conclusion about the ups and downs a new married couple faces during their own wedding.  Fuck me sideways, this film is fantastic.  It's ridiculously funny, in a dark and twisted way of course.  I cannot say enough good about this film.  I don't think I can honestly do this film justice.  It's something that has to be seen.  It's one of the few anthology films that I can say is entertaining from beginning to end, instead of it hitting peaks and valleys.  Incredible anthology, incredible film.  I absolutely loved this.

Barring the shared themes, there is no narrative link between the six stories, Szifron quite literally spliced together six short films and called it a day. He could've easily coasted on the coattails of the unique structure and made something admirable, but he injected every atom of black humor and twisted sociological expose that the script could contain without imploding, and hired what seems like every great actor in Argentina.

Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.\n\nBesides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!\n\nRATING: [4/5]",

            "content": "Truth is stranger than fiction. Or so they say. \"Wild Tales\" (R, 2:02) is complete fiction, but is strange enough to compete with any truth you may have seen portrayed on film. Still, the word \"strange\" doesn't adequately describe the things that happen in this movie. \"Wild\" really is the best adjective for the film's content. The wildest part of the whole thing is that anything and everything portrayed on the screen could actually happen. In fact, some of it did. The film's opening scenes depict a scenario that is uncomfortably similar to an infamous real-life tragedy that took place in early 2015. \"Too soon,\" is the phrase I heard one woman whisper to her companion after the movie's opening sequence. It may seem that way, but this film was released in Argentina and shown at several film festivals around the world well before the tragedy to which I am referring. This just goes to show the plausibility, if not the truth, behind the stories in this film. Yes, that's \"stories\" - plural.\n\n\"Wild Tales\" is an anthology of six stories with no relation to each other, except that they all portray violent revenge. I think it's also worth noting that, on the Rotten Tomatoes website, this film received a positive rating of over 90% of critics AND moviegoers - and lead to Argentina being represented in the 2014-2015 Oscar race for Best Foreign Language Film. (The movie's Spanish language title is \"Relatos salvajes\".) Yes, that means hearing the dialog in Spanish and reading it in English, but these six tales are wild enough that most people probably won't mind the subtitles:\n\nA group of seemingly unrelated people gathered together in one place discover that they have something in common. Is it a cosmic-level coincidence or is there something else going on?\n\nA waitress in a diner is forced to serve a gangster whose actions basically destroyed the waitress' family and he doesn't even recognize her. Upon hearing her story, the cook suggests putting rat poison in the man's food, but can the waitress bring herself to be that ruthless?\n\nThen, a road rage incident near a bridge on a deserted stretch of road escalates to disgusting and dangerous levels and neither driver gets away unscathed. Karma can really be a bitch!\n\nAn ordinary man (who happens to have an extraordinarily dangerous occupation) has his car towed while picking up his daughter's birthday cake. This frustrating situation sets off a chain of events that ruins the man's life. He falls down so far that he has nothing to lose by taking his revenge on a corrupt and uncaring system.\n\nWhen the son of a rich man is involved in a hit-and-run, the rich man offers to pay his groundskeeper to take the rap. The groundskeeper agrees, but enacting this plan is not nearly as simple as it sounds and this story ends in a way none of the players expected.\n\nAn attractive young couple are enjoying their wedding reception when the bride makes a discovery that shakes her to her core. She chooses the bridal dance as the time to tell her new husband what she has learned. Without spilling the specifics, I can say that all this leads to a dramatic rooftop scene, tension  and tempers rising to a fever pitch, blood on the bride's dress, paramedics treating multiple people with a variety of conditions and a cutting-the-cake scene that you won't soon forget. Suffice it to say that producers Pedro and Agust√≠n Almod√≥var and writer/director Dami√°n Szifron saved the wildest (and possibly the best) wild tale for last. \n\nIn \"Wild Tales\", you get a series of revenge fantasies that may make you feel guilty for allowing them to entertain you. But it will probably be a pleasurable guilt. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, \"I can't believe they did that,\" immediately followed by, \"I wonder if I would do that.\" Even with real-world events tinging the first story with an unintended pathos, this film gives us six tales that represent the best in dark comedy. The situations showcased are generally relatable and seem uncomfortably possible. The many movies I've seen over the years have left me with just about every conceivable emotion upon leaving the theater, but this is the first one that left me feeling... naughty. For lack of a better word, I felt naughty for secretly rooting for people doing bad things in this movie - and for enjoying the outcome of each story as much as I did. I've never seen a movie like this before, never felt the way this movie made me feel and never enjoyed dark comedy so much. This is going to make me feel naughty all over again, but I'm giving \"Wild Tales\" an \"A\". I'm sorry. No, I'm not.",

I found the film exceptionally entertaining because the fast moving shorts ranged from crazy and absurd to darkly comedic and tragic, and each had its own excellent plot twist.\n\"Pasternak\" - the laughable loser Mr. Pasternak collectively settled his scores with all that he perceived had done him wrong by orchestrating a well-timed and crafty (albeit absurd) revenge scheme involving an airplane.   Less funny in light of Germanwings flight 9525.\n\"The Rats \" - An interesting case of sympathetic revenge in which the female cook defiantly tackles the task of murderous revenge on behalf of the wronged waitress, against the waitress's strenuous and continuous objections.  Puzzling to me why the cook would go berserk against someone that, as far as the viewer knows, did her no direct harm.\n\"The Strongest\" - This short was riveting as we observe rich-snob vs. redneck machismo taken to the level of mutual self-destruction on a desolate desert road.  Cross words on a highway deteriorated into road rage that ultimately escalated into a full-fledged dual to the death.   \n\"Little Bomb\" -  Is a case of hero revenge to which we can relate.  Don't we all feel like exploding with frustration at times when we find ourselves powerless and up against an organization, whether it is a towing company, DMV or heavy traffic?  Well, this guy took it a little further, almost becoming a folk hero with his bombing antics.\n\"The Proposal\" -  A rich man's cynical bribery negotiations between him and a corrupt and greedy triad (a cop, his lawyer and his gardener) initially congeals then goes awry.  Immoral schemes are debated and over a million are on the table in order to save his cowardly son, who had committed a fatal hit-and-run of a pregnant woman.  The poor gardener, in the role of the fall guy, never saw a penny when he unexpectedly paid the ultimate price.  Where did this get left?  Was the case neatly closed or would loose ends fester?\n\"Till Death Do Us Part\" - This is a cautionary tale for guys to not invite their gorgeous current lover to their wedding reception, as she will be found out and the bride will exact her revenge.  Once that cat was out of the bag then it was too late to stop the bride from her nasty nonstop plot twists that left my stomach in knots.   Better to have R.S.V.P.ed 'will not attend' and send a gift to that wedding.",

Six short stories - each running about twenty minutes - show characters in contemporary Argentina overcome by revenge and retribution. Some stories work better than others, but there are no lulls or uneven segments, and a few could be short form classics. It's also beneficial to have one filmmaker preside over the material. Writer-director Damian Szifron's raucous humor and exuberant energy mark him as a major international filmmaker. Each episode takes a simple conflict that builds into a comic opera of vengeance. In the prologue, \"Pasternak,\" a model chats with fellow passengers and discovers everyone on the flight wronged her ex-boyfriend, and the cockpit is locked. \"The Rats,\" features a waitress serving a customer whose actions led her father to suicide; she wants revenge but is morally torn, so the cook suggests rat poison. In \"Road to Hell,\" a patrician man and a proletariat man turn road rage into a Road Runner cartoon as if conceived by Rod Serling. \"Bombita\" is about a demolitions expert confronted by government bureaucracy over parking violations that boils over. \"The Deal,\" involves a hit-and-run accident that leads to bribery and extortion among the accused's father, gardener, attorney, and prosecutor that results in an ironic, if predictable, resolution. The final story, \"'Till Death Us Do Part,\" is the best. It begins as a celebratory wedding reception until the bride discovers the groom had an affair with a guest. The bride turns the tables on the groom until the reception becomes a comic orgy of marital turmoil that ends in libidinal bliss. As the bride, Erica Rivas gives an expansive comic performance of hysteria that is peerless. The festival audience I saw this with was rapturous. Pedro Almodovar is one of the producers. With Ricardo Darin, Oscar Martinez, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Rita Cortese, Julieta Zylberberg, Dario Grandinetti. In Spanish with English subtitles.",

It then makes you question why you are laughing? Each story stands by itself. They aren't connected in any way.

            "content": "\"Wild Tales\" is a montage of six individual short stories, all set in Argentina, with the common theme of \"revenge\". The first, and shortest, of the tales, takes place in the cabin of a commercial jetliner. It begins benignly enough, but by the time it reaches its \"holy crap\" resolution, the tone is set for the rest of the film.\n\nThe stories are both violent and darkly funny, starting with believable situations and extending them bit by bit into absurdity. My favorite is about a man who believes his car was unfairly towed. Another features a jealous bride. A third involves a serious case of road rage.\n\nThe road rage story reminds me of a recurring \"Family Guy\" sketch in which Peter has long, drawn-out death matches with a giant chicken. And like the chicken-fight sketches, though I was somewhat amused by the over-the-top escalation of violence, I was also more than ready for it to end before it actually did. That's part of the beauty of the film's short story format. Just when you start to tire of one bit, it's on to the next. \n\nDespite all of the violence, it's interesting to note that none of the characters ever uses a gun. People are stabbed, poisoned, strangled, hit on the head with blunt objects, and flung into mirrors. Fire extinguishers are used to bludgeon, blind, and break glass. There are several big explosions. But not a single bullet is ever fired.\n\nMost of the characters in this film are in uncomfortable situations, and watching them made ME feel uncomfortable also. This is entertainment at its squirmiest. And though it's not always easy to watch, I feel like I definitely got my money's worth.",

The stories mind-blowingly effective and powerful. A work of genius, if there ever was one. Bravo to all involved. This should have been a HUGE hit in the US, but for some reason it didn't get the attention it deserves. But who cares. I've never seen anything quite like it.

Instead, there are cars, with three of the segments being centered around them, an Audi, Chevy and BMW respectively.  For the record, that's not product placement.  Rather, it represents different economic strata of society.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fourth and fifth segments do not work as well as the rest.

            "content": "DON'T CRY FOR ME, ANTOLOG√çA - My Review of WILD TALES (4 Stars)\n\nArgentina's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee for 2014 is an audacious, edgy, hilarious collection of 6 short films by writer/director Dami√°n Szifron called WILD TALES.  While none are directly linked to each other, this group of short stories seems to share similar themes of rage and revenge and of people caught during their most stressful moments.  Its opening credits alone, a series of wildlife stills indicates we're about to experience behavior of the basest levels. We follow people on a plane, in a diner, on the road, at a towing facility, after an accidental hit & run, and at the world's most insane wedding reception ever and I spent a good half of the time with my hand over my mouth trying to suppress either laughter or an \"Oh no they didn't!\".  It's almost impossible to discuss this film without mild spoilers, but I'll do my best not to reveal anything too specifically.\n\nThe film opens with its shortest tale, a group of passengers on board a plane who quickly discover something diabolical is afoot.  It ends with a gasp-inducing freeze frame you won't soon forget.  It deftly sets the stage for the sick and twisted stories to follow, all displaying varying degrees of anger at the world and the terrible luck so many suffer.  Shot with great muscularity by cinematographer Javier Julia, and infused with a wonderful nihilistic sensibility, each segment has its own style, and I felt like I was experiencing a great Coen Brothers film at every assured turn. \n\nIn a secluded diner on a rainy night, a server finds her sole customer to be an arch enemy from her past.  Goaded on by her increasingly sadistic co-worker (memorably and hilariously played by Rita Cortese), this revenge fantasy simultaneously raises the dramatic stakes while playing off our distaste for awful, entitled customers and slow-moving service people.  I loved how quickly one character wanted to murder another simply based on another person's recounting of past events, a perfect encapsulation of our too-quick-to-judge, don't believe everything you read on Facebook culture.  \n\nFrom there we're racing along a desert road as a handsome, well-to-do driver (Leonardo Sbaraglia, who first came to my attention in the film BURNT MONEY) gets stuck behind a slow-moving and weaving vehicle.  His ill-advised choice to yell at the man leads to a face-off which redefines taking things too far even by Tex Avery standards.  Imagine Steven Spielberg's DUEL cranked up to mythical proportions.  It's in this segment where every single shot meant something, with the camera put in just the right place, and the editing and writing ratcheting up the tension with perfect, inevitable ease.  Clearly final shots mean something to Szifron, and it's in this story where his last moment adds an extra, juicy layer to the storytelling.  \n\nNext, one of Argentina's most famous actors, Ricardo Dar√≠n (THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES), expertly mines every moment of his put-upon sad sack who naively takes on the system after getting towed.  What makes this segment sing is the fact that his character is set-up as a man addicted to causing drama.  I found my loyalties shifting constantly from his p.o.v. to those of the bureaucrats he torments.  Again, every moment counts, from the initial set-up at a construction site to its homage to TAXI DRIVER.  \n\nThe film continues with an unfortunate hit-and-run accident perpetrated by the son of a wealthy man (a great slow-burn by Oscar Mart√≠nez), who keeps making one ill-advised decision after another in an attempt to make the situation go away.  This story exposes the never-ending levels of corruption and greed, placing a sad, lower class patsy into the mix (a terrific Germ√°n de Silva) to remind us how stuck the 99% often feel in their lives.  Knowing full well that no good can come from this situation, Szifron ends this tale with abrupt and off-camera sounds, putting just the right capper on its hopelessness.  \n\nFinally, a wedding reception from hell ends the film on a funny yet disturbing note as a cheating groom played by Diego Gentile (clearly Argentina's answer to Bradley Cooper) faces off against his distraught bride (Erica Rivas, explosively going past any semblance of sanity).  Their performances are electric, and I wasn't surprised to discover that nearly the entire cast received nominations from Argentina's version of the Oscars.  The jealously and rage of our newlyweds keeps boiling over, ending (here we are again with Szifron's mastery of final shots) on an image combining sex and messiness. It's a perfect way to summarize the experience of this thoroughly entertaining, not-to-be-missed film.",

Pero...porque todo tiene un pero...no hace falta exterminar, al contrario, este filme expresa justo lo que quise siempre ver expuesto en una pelicula y me agrado el guion, las actuaciones y hasta la preciosa edicion/continuidad del mismo. La humanidad es la criatura mas increible que existe, se enoja con una facilidad sorprendente, toma todo a pecho y la verdad siempre le duele. Son animales inigualables que todo lo quieren, todo lo desean y al final cuando mueren...todo lo pierden. Me encanta la peli enserio! Brutal! Majestuosa! Me acabo de desahogar por si no lo habian notado! Me siento super mejor ahora. El director Damian es impecable! Jamas habia visto un filme tocandome la fibra y los temas que mas me agradan de esta singular creacion (porque todo lo que el humano crea justo crea eso: discordia, ira y bipolaridad sin fin). Son unos seres extraordinarios. En fin, la recomiendo para que se identifiquen con las INJUSTICIAS creadas por nosotros, las IRAS ABSURDAS que hacemos por idioteces y claro, somos unos animales que aun con educacion, con una simple pizca de absurditis aguda, nos volvemos seres con RELATOS....SALVAJES.

Stunning cinematography by Javier Juli√° gives these dark comedies a picturesque quality that lightens the mood. A memorable score by Gustavo Santaolalla beautifully complements the production. Occasionally the tone gets nasty. There is a delicate balance between comedy and ugliness. It's the twisted humor that redeems these misanthropic sagas. More often than not, the strength of the composition outweighs the occasional lapse. I didn't expect the \"Love Theme From Flashdance\" to pop up in one segment but its playful moments like that which uplift a gloomy narrative. Those lighthearted touches keep these 6 unexpected tales of retribution consistently entertaining.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

Not that I always agree with the Academy's (collective) decision in this category, far from that - there have been many films that I love dearly but miss out the golden statue to much lesser contestants (\"Le fabuleux destin d'Am√©lie Poulain\" in 2001 or \"Farewell My Concubine\" in 1993). But I always respect, and love, this category for pointing out many films that without their nomination in this category, I might have never got chance to watch them, from \"Okuribito\" to \"El secreto de sus ojos\", to this year's \"Relatos salvajes\". Despite its anthology form (in which the film is segmented into six disconnected part with only a common theme - the wildness of humanity in extreme situations), the film has a very coherent style - beautiful cinematography, excellent cast, strange yet utterly attractive stories, and crazy script - exactly like the film's title. In fact, the six parts are not equally strong (I love the first part the most - strong, tight, quick, and full of metaphoric images, the third part is another excellent action-packed piece of cinema) but they are all full of surprises, twist-and-turns, and well-meaning stories about humanity. Well, some of those stories are not really \"well-meaning\" but they are nonetheless powerful and force the audience to think about themselves, think about what would they do if they were in those characters' situation, whether they would be as crazy, as wild, as those characters once being cornered in such emotionally horrible situations. I respect this film even more considering the fact that this comedy is always sincere to its comedic by trying its best to entertain the audience (and give them some slices of wild humanity, when necessary) instead of trying to be something pretentiously \"noble\", \"high-concept\". Rarely a film can be all entertaining, surprising, and thought-provoking at the same time like this one. Thank you , AMPAS, for give me another excellent film from Argentina.",

To give this film the title \"Wild Tales\" is entirely appropriate here as well.

            "content": "Frankly, its really hard to pin down your thoughts about unconventional Argentine-Spanish black comedy-drama film, mainly because the film is compiled of six short stories into one. This short films follow a common theme - the limit of our patience, or like it's tagline says...\"All may lose control\". This is probably the darkest and most hilarious film I have seen in years! NO! Its not a comedy! Just that the segments are so hilarious and over the top, you cant help but smile, but at the same time satirical and somehow realistic, it's almost impossible not to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of their situations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in some passages make us feel uncomfortable. Talking about each tale in detail will cut the impact and somewhat surprise of each one. Let's just say that the outcomes of each tale are far from being predictable, completely driven by logic not cliches. Based on the shock value & hilarity I would rank the films in this way: 1. \"El m√°s fuerte\" (The Strongest): about two men going wild on the road trying to kill each other. 2. \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" (Until Death Do Us Part): It's about what is likely the craziest wedding party in movie history.3. \"Bombita\" (Little Bomb): about an engineer who sees his life ruined by bureaucracy regarding his repetitively towed car & how he plans his wicked vengeance masterfully.4. \"Pasternak\": How all the passengers in a plane are related to a common man.5. \"Las ratas\" (The Rats): two waitresses plan to kill a customer with rat poison due to personal reasons.6. \"La propuesta\" (The Proposal): a wealthy business man finds himself at the crossroads when his son runs over and kills a pregnant woman with his car. In each story a modern frustration wells up until the character erupts. All the stories involve a furious revenge, with a broadening range of characters. To convey the tensions in modern life, ordinary sounds are amplified, like the luggage wheels in the opening shot. Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn't look for, and that's the beauty of this movie. It works very well like that, lasting close to 120 minutes that go by quickly. It feels very fluid. And the merit of director Dami√°n Szifr√≥n is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination of intrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor. The acting, editing, photography and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla are all ingredients that give extra points. On the whole, Divided into six chapters with technically no direct interrelation but with a compelling thematic cohesion, Wild Tales (original Spanish title, Relatos salvajes) is a masterfully crafted dark comedy of incredible shrewdness and wit. It can be hilarious, fascinatingly demented, awesomely violent, and more often than not just plain weird. The segments had in common the themes of revenge and the loss of control, and the inner longing we all have for letting ourselves be carried away by our deepest and most violent impulses but we never let that happen. This leads me to conclude that in many ways, this film might as well be a sort of twisted psychological fantasy as well as a sharp social satire. This film is a perfect example of what we call enthralling piece of cinema. Must Watch!",

Satire and humor often misfire when shown in other countries, which is a reason American comedies rarely do as well as action films and big visual FX films as the most successful film exports.  So \"Wild Tales,\" with its 6 short films about revenge by people who cross the line from rational to madness, could easily go off the rails and seem overdone.  Instead, the sure hand of new world class filmmaker, Damian Szifron, provides first rate and confident control with great visual style.  Often omnibus films cobbled together with short films by different directors are very uneven, but in this case, because the six short stories are all written and directed by the same person, there are overall themes and consistent stylistic choices which tie the whole film together and make the collection work.  Several of the stories are dark, violent and macabre, while others are laugh out loud farces.  All are skillfully acted and written, with social commentary specific to Argentina, but universal enough to be understood worldwide.  Definitely a funny and provocative examination of ordinary people pushed to breaking points in the modern world, often with unexpected results.  Szifron is a filmmaker to watch and if brought to America with an increased scale and budget, could soon follow Cuaron and Inarritu to even greater success.",

The point is you will see this look again in all of the characters who decide during the course of the film they've had enough. You will recognize the shocked look of prey in their victims.\n\nThe stories - divine. Each one wrapped up neatly in it's own little packaging, bite size for those with short attention span. \n\nThe acting - superb. Everyone is well cast and you see the darkness coming across their eyes forecasting the  trouble ahead. \n\nThe cinematography - sprawling. Each setting is beautifully thought out and sets a different mood for it's dark tale.\n\nThe score - impactful. From the first note to the last you feel like you're falling into this film. The sound is so beautiful; no 3D glasses are required. You already feel like you're right there.\n\nThe verdict - Go see this film. Even if you don't like subtitles, go see this film. You know I typically don't ask my husband to go with me to see subtitled films, but I did this time (he loves some revenge too) and there was only one story he took a bit of a nod in. I won't take off for it though, because even that story he was able to repeat back to me after we left (It was the one where the son comes home with the wrecked car - sorry if that was your favorite). \n\nDo I still feel the same way about revenge now as I did when I entered the theater? Does it seem as much fun and gratifying - I don't know. But I will leave it at this, one of the most enduring quotes of all time is \"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves\" (Confucius).\n\n100% wakefulness\n\nRemember, films are expensive, take a nap before it starts,\nWife of the sleepy husband.",

Five of the six tales are raucously funny, while the sixth is far more serious in tone, creating something of a disconnect with its companion pieces, despite its thematic link to the others. This picture is definitely not for the squeamish or overly sensitive.

This wicked and funny farce about revenge and the extremes of human behavior is fierce and ferocious. Writer-director Damian Szifron has not made one single film. Wild Tales is six films, all stitched together under one title. Some audiences may not be able to handle it. Oh well.\n\nTake the opening vignette, 'Pasternak', set on a jet in which the passengers all realize they've wronged the same man, named Pasternak, in one way or another. No fair spoiling the surprise, but it's a story as gonzo-crazy as anything ever dreamed up by Pedro Almodovar, who serves as a co-producer.\n\nThings get darker in 'The Rats' where a waitress (Julietta Zylberberg) finds herself serving the criminal who drove her father to suicide. In 'Road To Hell', a stuffy driver insults a redneck. And then there's 'Bombita' starring Ricardo Darin, Argentina's biggest star, is a demolition engineer who must contend with a towing service and the DMV. It's a lot more riveting and wild than it sounds.\n\n'The Deal' has fewer laughs, a story in which a rich man attempts to pay off a gardener to take the fall for his hit-and-run on his own bratty son. But it's the final story that really ignites. That would be 'Till Death Do Us Part', set at a Jewish wedding where the bride (Erica Rivas, amazing) takes revenge on her cheating groom (Diego Gentile), turning the whole party into a gladiator match. You'll be laughing till it hurts, which is of course the point. Filmmaking is seldom such a breath of fresh air like Wild Tales.",

The musical score and set design are also all perfect. \n\nThe only complaint I have with Wild Tales is that there was one specific story that I didn't have as much fun with as the others.

            "content": "Dami√°n Szifron's Wild Tales is a six film anthology connected through the underlying insanity of the human race. One its most remarkable achievements is that it feels like one film, even though it isn't. It's darkly funny with superbly crafted dialogue and unpredictable story. A wild ride, and more.\nIt might not be worth going into each individual story. I found it fun not knowing exactly what to expect, but with each, you can expect to be surprised. Each story seems to start with characters pretending to be regular members of society, and this mask tears away as the story develops tension and eventually implodes or explodes on itself; often both. \nThe movie has a damn clever screenplay that deserved more Oscar consideration last year. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with tons of purposeful black comedy. The characters all feel dimensional despite the short running time of the stories. Even when a character doesn't have a ton of personality, they never succumb to stereotypes and are played by the wonderful cast with hidden depth. When there seems to be a villain or hero in a story, Szifron blurs this line. The protagonists and antagonists in each film are brilliantly given equal weight, and we understand both sides. This gets across the idea that everybody in the film is crazy in some way or another. \nThe ensemble cast is excellent here. The actors nail Szifron's sometimes complicated tone, where the characters need to feel realistic, take themselves seriously, and still be funny. \nThere is not a weak link in the cast, just as there is no weak link in the stories. Each short feels perfectly placed and compliments its surrounding shorts, with drama taking over a bit in a welcome way by the fifth story. The shorts have lots of variety in both character and story, and feel connected and progressive in structure and theme. The final short ends as a celebration of all the craziness before it, embracing the inner animal in us all.\nSzifron's direction is just stylish enough and tonally precise. Some individual shots fit impressively well, like the final shot of the first film, which I won't spoil, but it's incredible.\nThe movie's a whole lot of fun and I think anyone will enjoy it. Fans of Tarantino or Almodovar in particular may find pleasure, but even if you hate those guys, you'll still like Wild Tales because it's a work of its own. It's a romp, for sure, but it's unexpectedly more. Think of the title sequence, which is an African safari slideshow of animals. That's what the movie is. It's a wild safari with humans on display.",

To be honest, I'm kind of surprised that a movie this dark and cynical got an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film (although I doubt that the Academy members really watch all of the movies). Anyways, Wild Tales is a really entertaining and quite twisted batch of fun. Five out of its six vignettes work, and those that do work really well, ranging from solid to hilarious. The average short is about twenty minutes and despite their simplistic setups, writer/director Damian Szifron's creative edge keeps a majority of the content fresh and pleasantly ridiculous. The only real issue is that second-to-last short is underwhelming in edge and execution, slightly hindering the overall pacing. Once the film's first short begins--a prologue of sorts--you know that this is going to be bonkers. To avoid spoilers, all I'll say is that it involves a plane full of strangers that are all traveling together due to a mutual peer of theirs. The next involves a waitress at diner that is forced to serve a man that ruined her family's life, leading her co-worker to try to poison him. The third story (and the most hilarious) involves a rich man that insults a \"fucking redneck,\" and as he gets a flat tire on the highway, he starts to get attacked by the man he previously offended. The brilliance of this story is its endless energy and creativity, morphing set pieces into plot pieces and continually upping the ante both in terms of slapstick and \"WTF\"-ness. I can assure you that no one in my audience would have predicted what happens. The next involves a man's relentless quest to overturn his parking ticket, and the next involves a rich father trying to hide his son's involvement in a drunk hit-and-run accident that killed a pregnant woman. That second one is the closest that the film goes to mean-spiritedness, but it just barely avoids it. However, it's the one that isn't quite that interesting and ends up hurting the pace of the overall movie. It maybe has a giggle or two but is the only one that I kind of wanted to speed through. The final short tells the tale of a wedding where the bride learns of the groom's infidelity, leading to chaos. This is possibly the darkest, but its cartoonishness works in its favor. If you like messed up humor with an acerbic edge, then Wild Tales is definitely worth checking out. Your having to read subtitles throughout doesn't at all interfere with its physical or visual comedy, and if you know the type of odd content that its 122-minute runtime fills, you'll likely know just enough about it to enjoy it without spoiling the fun. 8/10, really good, one thumb up, above average, etc.",

Wild is just one word to describe this film that is sort of a collection of short films and many of the shorts were better than the nominees for Best Short Film this year. To break them down individually, the opening short takes place on a plane and sets the tone for this movie beautifully that it is going to be odd, crazy, and in a sick way funny. The second short is one of the strongest following a waitress that recognizes a mobster and plots his demise with a fry cook. The third is probably the best in my opinion showing the consequences of being an asshole on the road. It's brutal but really jaw dropping in a good way. The fourth short goes on for a little to long about a regular man's frustration with the traffic laws in his town and his whole life crumbling just for sticking it to the man but it is still solid. The fifth one was the problematic one. Not that it was bad or anything it just didn't fit the overall tone of this film. It didn't have any menacing or sick humor to it it was full drama. The final short ends this movie with a great bang (literally actually) following the events of a happy new couple and the gradual decline of a marriage in only minutes. The performances that stood out the most were the fry cook from 2, the man in the suit in 3, and the bride in 6. I see why this movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars and I also see why people think it should have won (I do really like Ida but I actually do think this one was the movie that struck out at me the most). This is a great time and I was worried a little at the beginning but once this movie starts showing you its tone, you'll be in for the ride and have the time of your life. Definitely seek this one out.",

All of them were one in saying that it was perhaps the best film this year.\n\nAnd after watching a screening the other night, all i can say is, I agree.\n\nAll the buzz was warranted. All the great reviews were earned. All the superlatives heaped on the film were absolutely well deserved. \"Wild Tales\" is incredibly great and, if not for Richard Linklater's cinematic masterpiece \"Boyhood\", I would easily declare the film my favorite this year. But it is my second favorite now and i don't think its place in my ranking is in any danger of ever being dislodged.\n\nThe movie is an anthology of six short stories that share a common theme: Violence and Vengeance. If you are in the mood for some wicked time at the movies, this movie is perfect. But even if you want to just have a good fun at the movies, to be entertained without being dumbed down by poor writing, this is the perfect movie for you. It's the kind of film that successfully mixes high art with commercial filmmaking!\n\nWritten and directed by Argentine filmmaker Dami√°n Szifr√≥n and co-produced by the award-winning Agust√≠n Almod√≥var and Pedro Almod√≥var, \"Wild Tales\" take the audience through a literal wild ride when men and women have finally succumbed to their desire for vengeance without regard of what the outcome might be. The satisfaction is in carrying out the plan notwithstanding the end results and that frees the movie from ever having to drag itself by tidying up each of the short stories weaved in this monumental film.\n\nThe formula is simple. Get angry, get back. The end. And you get six of these stories in one!\n\nThe film begins with a panicked passengers on an airplane who discovers that they were duped into flying on the plane by a common man whom they all committed some form of bad act at some point before. When they finally came to realize all these, it was already a minute too late. This happens even before the opening credits roll and if you don't find yourself howling and applauding something is wrong with you.\n\nFive more stories will be introduced after the opening credits. The stories are independent of each other but each story contributes to make the entire movie an experience something movie buffs and ordinary moviegoers will collectively enjoy.\n\nEach short story is presented as a provocation and I tremendously enjoyed what each one of them had to offer. My favorite though was the final story about a bride discovering on her wedding day, during the reception mind you, that her groom has been carrying on an affair with a woman co-worker who happened to be present at their wedding. This discovery sets off a wild roller-coaster chase of who gets to ruin who in front of their unknowing but shocked guests. This last piece confirmed for me what i have believed all along: That the depth of one's love for another is in equal measure to the depth of hate the same person can have for someone they purport to love. The final story ends differently from the previous five and it somehow offers a collective redemption for all of them.\n\n\"Wild Tales\" is the official submission of Argentina to the Oscars. It could win!\n\nhttp://raymonddeasislo.blogspot.com/2014/12/oscars-2015-wild-tales.html",

Per questo, in fondo, gli episodi potrebbero essere ambientati in qualsiasi luogo e non obbligatoriamente nel Paese sudamericano - uno sfondo analogo si pu√≤ trovare anche per gli affascinanti paesaggi che accompagnano 'Il pi√π forte' - dato che l'attenzione √® posta pi√π che altro sulle psicologie dei personaggi che appartengono, per la gran parte, a una borghesia medio-alta. Un elemento comune alle sei storie che si aggiunge all'altro, ancor pi√π netto, della vendetta che viene declinata in varie forme, ma sempre con un sorriso sardonico sullo sfondo. A proposito di sorrisi, bench√® il film si iscriva senza problemi alla categoria della commedia, le situazioni e il modo di raccontarle non sfociano quasi mai in una risata liberatoria: nello spettatore resta pi√π impressa una sensazione di fastidioso malessere accentuata dai colpi bassi in cui sfociano talvolta le vicende . Per quanto riguarda l'ispirazione, i modelli possono essere i pi√π vari a partire da quello, inevitabile, dell'ironia acre di Almodovar: in ogni caso, da una parte non pu√≤ mancare la commedia all'italiana nella sua versione pi√π cattiva - in 'Bombetta' un ingegnere si vendica in maniera 'esplosiva' della societ√† che si occupa di rimozioni forzate diventando un piccolo eroe - e dall'altra si guarda con occhio deferente a Bu√±uel - il matrimonio da incubo di 'Finch√® morte non ci separi' che vira dalla festa alla tragedia riporta alla memoria echi de 'L'angelo sterminatore' (peccato solo per una conclusione che non trae fino in fondo le conseguenze dalla tensione accumulata in precedenza). Gli episodi ora citati fanno parte del secondo gruppo in cui lo scontro √® soprattutto psicologico, come dimostra anche 'La trattativa', un tremendo apologo sulla cupidigia umana in cui si contratta il cartellino del prezzo di chiunque venga a contatto con il problema di un giovane bene che ha investito e uscciso una donna incinta: si tratta per√≤ dei segmenti che, nel complesso, risultano meno riusciti forse anche a causa di un'eccessiva lunghezza. Assai pi√π lucidi e stringati sono invece i primi tre, che si evolvono da premesse banali in situazioni in cui ha la meglio una violenza fisica a volte di una brutalit√† tarantiniana: il pilota d'aereo che sistema in modo definitivo i conti della sua vita in 'Pasternak' (prima dei titoli di testa, avvio fulminante la cui efficacia purtroppo non √® pi√π eguagliata), la camerirera de 'I ratti' che reincontra un vecchio nemico di famiglia nello sperduto ristorante in cui lavora e trova nella cuoca un'aiutante fin troppo volonterosa, i due automobilisti che danno vita a una sorta di 'Duel' sanguinoso e demente su una strada sperduta ne 'Il pi√π forte' - qui, sullo sfondone finale della polizia, si ride davvero. Alla fine, il succedersi di queste storie - alle quali l'aggettivo 'selvagge' del titolo originale e di quello internazionale meglio si attaglia rispetto a 'pazzesche' - vanno a costituire un film assai godibile che, visto il momento in cui √® stato distribuito, pu√≤ anche servire da antidoto contro questo periodo di buonismo natalizio: il lavoro del neppure quarantenne regista Szifr√≥n non √® banale (la scelta di aprire alcune sezioni da un'inquadratura buia, la capacit√† di variare il tempo a seconda delle situazioni) e serve con gusto una sua sceneggiatura che, al dil√† di alcune battute a vuoto, funziona riuscendo benissimo a tenere agganciato lo spettatore. Certo, qualche scelta poteva essere pi√π coraggiosa o definitiva (a partire dalla fotografia ben pettinata di Javier Julia), ma sarebbe stato pretendere troppo da un film che ha anche ambizioni da prodotto medio e che comunque testimonia la valida qualit√† del cinema realizzato a Buenos Aires e dintorni: in questo quadro non stupisce che il cast includa una serie di attori di buon nome nel loro Paese, le cui interpretazioni quasi sempre misurate di personaggi quantomento stravaganti - un nome per tutti: Ricardo Dar√≠n in 'Bombetta' - contribuiscono di certo alla riuscita dell'operazione. L'eccezione a questa misura √® 'Finch√® morte non ci separi' dove tutto √® sopra le righe e anche la recitazione si adegua, come quella di Erica Rivas nella parte della sposina tradita e vendicativa in una festa di nozze in cui gli istinti pi√π bestiali vengono allo scoperto: in materia, del resto, sono gi√† ben chiari gli indovinati titoli di testa, in cui a ogni nome che compare sullo schermo √® associata (con un certo gusto) la foto di un animale.",

I find it hard to review these anthology films at times considering some of the short stories work really well while others don't. In Wild Tales, Szifron manages to structure the film beautifully into six stories with a great sense of pacing and storytelling. The two hours flew by and I never found any of the stories tedious or boring. When making an anthology it is important that you establish an important connection between each story, and Szifron manages to do just that.

Szifron manages to set a dark tone in each of his stories while keeping the audience in suspense during some scenes and exploding in laughter during others. It is a perfect example of a dark comedy that manages to maintain the thrills throughout the narrative. Szifron plays with the genre conventions and balances the different tones of the film very well. It's hard to point out a weak link because each story brings something different to the film, but at the same time they all feel connected.

He plays a disillusioned character who is tired of the bureaucracy in his country. It doesn't take much to see him explode and we see how one small incident escalates into an overblown reaction. As much as I enjoyed that segment, it wasn't the most memorable one. I was a huge fan of the road rage segment, which in my opinion was the highlight of this film. Juan Pablo Colombo and Walter Donado give terrific performances as they are placed on an everyday scenario in the road which very quickly escalates into cartoonish violence.

It presents several dysfunctional characters, so the audience can relate to any of them and feel some sort of empathy for the film as a whole. \n\nFor me, to exploit so directly these 'cliched' stories isn't that original and reduces the overall and potential impact.

            "content": "Wild Tales has been called both \"fun\" and \"funny,\" but it's neither of those things. It's a gnarly Argentine anthology film whose unconnected chapters straddle the line between black comedy and gruesome soap opera; it may appeal to those who found humor in Gone Girl or the Saw movies. Black comedies always run the risk of being too black to be comical, and I'd say director and writer Dami√°n Szifron is trying to find humor in things that aren't humorous, but his presence is apathetic and his writing is lazy...so is he even trying? Wild Tales is too focused on wallowing in its own awfulness to crack very many jokes, and when it does, they never register above cheap cynicism.",

            "content": "Relatos Salvajes fue una revelaci√≥n. Consiste de 5 historias cortas que hablan de la naturaleza humana en su forma m√°s oscura. Venganza, dolor, enga√±o son s√≥lo un peque√±o vistazo a la riqueza emocional de esta pel√≠cula, que adem√°s nos sirve de recordatorio que todas las personas al verse presionadas son capaces de cosas inimaginables. \n\nDos historias resaltaron para mi. La primera fue la de la familia que trata de encubrir a su hijo, que al estar borracho detr√°s del volante, asesin√≥ a una mujer embarazada. Sinti√©ndose acorralados, logran hacer un trato con el jardinero de la familia para que tome la culpa. Me impact√≥ al ver todas las medidas que tomaron para que la justicia no recayera sobre su hijo, y el √∫nico momento en el que el padre logr√≥ ver las cosas con claridad fue cuando sinti√≥ que estaba siendo estafado por su abogado. La segunda historia fue la de la boda, que fue la √∫ltima de la pel√≠cula. Dos j√≥venes se casan, y durante la fiesta ella se da cuenta que la amante de su marido fue invitada. Por supuesto que su reacci√≥n no fue favorable, y decide vengarse. Lo que sigue es una locura, donde realmente no se puede prevenir lo que va a suceder, especialmente la culminaci√≥n. Esta historia s√≥lo demuestra que a pesar de que al casarse se supone que conoces totalmente a la persona, realmente s√≥lo ves una parte de ella, y que te pueden sorprender en cualquier momento.\n\nRelatos Salvajes es una pel√≠cula ingeniosa donde todas las historias se entrelazan y el resultado es emocionante y que te sorprende a cada momento. Cuando piensas que las cosas no se pueden poner peor, o que las personas ya mostraron todas las cartas bajo la manga, te sorprende, y algunas veces te hace perder la fe en la humanidad pero de la manera m√°s humor√≠stica posible.",
