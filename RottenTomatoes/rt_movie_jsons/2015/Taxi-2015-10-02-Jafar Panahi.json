            "content": "This seemed to me more like a social documentary than a drama film as such. Its interesting, in terms of getting glimpses into different peoples lives in Iran and I appreciate that the filmmaker had to make it while being at risk of getting in trouble as filming is illegal (or it certainly was when the film was made) in Iran. Iran is somewhere I think of as being quite secretive and mysterious, which is why it interested me.\n\nI found the stories from individual customers (of the taxi where the filming takes place) interesting and thought it gave a decent insight into, as I say, Iranian society at the time it was filmed (2014). Its not a particularly exciting or memorable film but its worth a watch regardless, so I would recommend this to anyone interested in the setting.",

            "content": "The most appealing movie I have ever seen. It disgraces anything that makes a film a film. Lack of editing and the fact the who,e film has about 3 cuts, is really boring and engaging. The events that happen feel unscripted and boring and the only remotely amusing bit is the old women with the fish. I don't use the word hate very often, but I hate this movie with a passion. Don't get me wrong it's interesting in terms of Iran, but it could have been told so much better. After 10 minutes I felt like sleeping, because I had simply zoned out. I understand Panahi's circumstances effected this film, and appreciate his message but I could never watch this again.",
