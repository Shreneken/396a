This quiet, reflective film conveys the sense of helpless separation felt by parties on all sides of war. It also clearly casts aspersions of war in general and the vile absurdity of what it does to people who are so often really practically neighbors, geographically, culturally and even historically. \nThe four main characters are brought to life by astonishing performances. They are performances that could've been maudlin, overly melodramatic in the hands of lesser actors and a lesser director. Such wonderful economy of story telling and plot development. So glad I chose to watch this one tonight. 3.8 stars",

It can even be a great one in parts.  It's not what I would call a great movie from beginning to end, but I do think it offers a really compelling and satisfying story.  Part of it is the fact that the story really is very simple.  I don't mean that in a derogatory manner whatsoever, I just mean the fact that the story is simply told.  The film takes place during the Chechen-Georgian war and has two characters from each side injuring themselves after a small conflict with each other and being taken in Ivo into his house until they heal up accordingly.  The film deals with these two having to co-exist in the same house despite the fact that both want to kill each for, literally, no reason other than the fact that their respective sides are at war.  So it's an interesting, but not necessarily unique, approach.  I wouldn't say that this is so much an anti-war movie as much as it is accepting of the fact that these things will keep on happening until the end of time, but it explores simple themes about peace, conflict and how war doesn't really solve anything.  It only begets more and more violence.  The fact of the matter is that these two, Nika and Ahmed, the soldiers, would have kept at it if not for the fact that Ivo's wise ways got through to them.  The film isn't sentimental in any way whatsoever, so I do think that it reaches the natural conclusion of Nika and Ahmed gaining some small aspect of respect for each other despite their varying differences.  I like how despite the seriousness of the film, they do give you these little moments of calm and even comedy.  Those moments never last.  In fact, on almost every occasion, something worse happens.  So the movie keeps you on your toes, anything could happen at any time.  That's how volatile the situation the characters find themselves in.  The film definitely has a really strong message, but, the great thing about it is the fact that it doesn't force its message down on you.  It has its moral and all of that, but it never forces you to think alike.  You make your own conclusions.  I've always been anti-war, so the film provided a message I agree with, but not because it was forceful or heavy-handed in getting it across.  The film also benefits from some really strong performances.  Like all around.  Lembit Ulfsak, who plays Ivo, is phenomenal here.  He's understated yet powerful all at the same time.  Strong character development is also prevalent here.  So, really, not much to complain about when talking about this movie.  I felt there was something missing that would've pushed it into greatness, but this is still a really strong movie with a great performances and really good storytelling.  It's on Amazon Prime, so get to watching.",

The two farmers want to gather in their crop before returning to Estonia after war broke out between pro-Russian elements and Georgians. It's predictable as a tale about the insanity of war and those who do the fighting but it's well done and well acted. Looking on Rotten Tomatoes here I wonder some times about the US raters as most Americans rarely see foreign films and films like this get no promotion whatsoever----too much dialogue not enough car crashes and raping. The film is rated R according to RT and it says why: \"R (for strong and disturbing sexual content, graphic nudity, language throughout, and drug use)\" this description is completely inaccurate. There is no nudity except a mans chest, a few swear words that one would hear in high school playgrounds and I saw no drug use except one scene where they drank some vodka. It's a nice film worth seeing.",

Why? Because a movie should leave you with things to talk about and this movie didn't make me feel any emotions different than the ones I was experiencing while going to see the movie. I'm happy to say that it's well acted, but I also have to say that this movie is really boring, and it's actually the most boring movie that I've seen so far this year. On top of that, it's only 87 minutes including credits. I've said this before and I'll say it again: I have no problem with slow movies. Some of my favorite movies of recent years--Under the Skin, Foxcatcher, Somewhere, The Rover, etc.--are very slow movies where the progression of their stories aren't verbalized and instead focus on small, peculiar things that other movies don't. Tangerines, however, focuses on the same kind of stuff that we've seen before, but does it without ever fully engaging its audience. I'd be hard pressed to think of a full two minutes where I was fully involved in what was happening because the movie's themes aren't particularly unique. There are two characters that hate each other and a neutral third party that seems to bridge the gap between the two, and the movie examine their relationship from an anti-war angle. That's fine, but it becomes such a wasted concept in how uninteresting the entire movie is. Even the final ten minutes or so--the only part that really works--don't work like they should because the proceeding 75 minutes did nothing for me. When a movie makes absolutely no impact on you other than its solid performances, it's pretty clear that it didn't do its job. Instead of thinking about the movie while leaving the theater, I was wondering why The Academy nominated this for Best Foreign Language Film over Mommy or Two Days, One Night, and it in turn made those movies look even better in comparison. 4.3/10, bad, two thumbs down, below average, etc.",

Louis Proyect said: \"In an age of incestuous ties between the Pentagon and Hollywood that produces films like \"American Sniper\", thank god for the Estonians who remind us of what a horror war is.\" And I could not agree more. Tangerines is an Estonian film directed by Zaza Urushadze nominated this year for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It is, essentially, a film about the collateral damages and stupidity of war, shown in an extremely small scale.\n\nIvo, the protagonist, is just a person trying to keep his tangerine business in the midst of yet another pointless war. This time between the Abkhazians and the Georgians in 1992. Almost alone in the countryside, Ivo's family was forced to go back to Estonia but he remains there because he still believes there is some goodness in humans. Thanks to the war and some wounds, Ivo takes care of an Abkhazian militant and a Georgian soldier and makes sure they literally don't slaughter each other, striving for tolerance above all like a citizen of the world would do.\n\nI'm not Georgian, nor Estonian, nor Abkhazian. I'm not even European. However the beauty of Tangerines is that I can identify with the characters and at the same time, join the cause for tolerance, because that is supposed to be a universal value. As Ivo said, it does not matter that we come from different places. Characters like him should be celebrated worldwide because through him we can see global awareness, respect, and tolerance.  The world needs more movies like this, honestly, the world just keeps getting worse, but maybe art can make a difference. Tangerines is definitely one of the best films I have seen this year.",

I know the Academy doesn't always get it right, but at least it gives me a chance to check out films that I wouldn't have heard of otherwise. Urushadze's greatest strength as a director here comes from focusing on the story, which he also wrote. It is a simple anti-war film with a powerful narrative and strong performances that benefit from an interesting premise. Urushadze doesn't try to astonish the audience with great visuals or overload us with gruesome action scenes like most war films, but rather focuses on the humanity of each character and does so by centering the story in a small local community where only two men remain. He reduces the Civil War taking place in the Apkhazian region and focuses it on how it affects two local Estonians who have decided to stay in their farmland instead of seeking safety back in Estonia. Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) and Margus (Elmo Nuganen) are neighbors who work together. Margus has a tangerine plantation (which explains the somewhat terrible title) and Ivo is a carpenter who makes the boxes for their transportation so they collaborate together. Since the war broke out, everyone in the land has returned to Estonia, but these two men have decided to stay. Ivo is a determined and wise old man who doesn't take sides in the war. When a conflict breaks out in front of their home, two soldiers are seriously injured and Ivo takes them into his home. The soldiers (Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi) are enemies and we are expecting the tension to break out once they fully recover. Ivo knows this, but he also believes he can teach them a lesson through his acts of kindness during this terrible time of war. The film is effective and accomplishes its purpose of delivering its anti-war message by focusing on the humanity of each one of the characters. \n\nLembit Ulfsak delivers the best performance of the film. He gives a quiet and calmed performance. Despite all the hate and hurtful things the two soldiers say to each other, he is always the voice of reason reminding them that they all share the same land and have equal rights. Ulfsak expresses this inner peacefulness very well from the opening scene in which some local soldiers come searching for food. He is the kind of person that would help anyone, even those that consider him an enemy. Elmo Nuganen is also solid as Margus who has a strong relationship with Ivo and looks up to him. When the two injured soldiers appear at their doorsteps the balance is disrupted and the war comes knocking home. So we clearly see how war takes its toll on everyone, even those who have nothing to do with the fighting, affecting their business and their lifestyle. Giorgi Nakashidze and Misha Meskhi deliver solid roles as these enemies who call a truce out of respect for Ivo while they are in his home. I found the simple premise for this film as a strong way to carry out its message by reducing the big scale of the war to a small local village, but still portraying it as something terrible. Some might consider this too simple of a story or too  improbable, but I think it was a quite affecting way to deliver its message. I enjoyed how Zaza Urushadze decided to approach this material and would definitely recommend it.",
