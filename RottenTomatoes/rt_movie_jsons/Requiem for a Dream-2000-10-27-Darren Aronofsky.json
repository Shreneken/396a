    "summary": "Imaginatively evoking the inner landscape of human beings longing to connect, to love and feel loved, the film is a parable of happiness gloriously found and tragically lost. \"Requiem for a Dream\" tells parallel stories that are linked by the relationship between the lonely, widowed Sara Goldfarb and her sweet but aimless son, Harry. The plump Sara, galvanized by the prospect of appearing on a TV game show, has started on a dangerous diet regimen to beautify herself for a national audience.",

Sara Goldfarb's (Ellen Burstyn) universe exists primarily within her Brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television.  Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin.  It is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape.  While Aronofsky's outlandish style is sometimes unnecessarily distracting, the movie is buoyed by some stark and memorable imagery, a remarkable score by Aronofsky regular Clint Mansell, and what could just be Burstyn's career-defining performance.",

These four people end up in a worse and darker place by the time everything is said and done. This film takes us to a journey where we can see the addicts going from less to more, going to extreme extents to get their merchandise, and at the same time we are witnesses of their descent to insanity. \nAnother thing I want to point out is the photography. OUTSTANDING. The way this movie uses it's cameras is astonishing. Yet again, simple but incredibly effective shots result from this work of art. This movie will raise your tension and feel the desperation from the characters. It will amaze you with its beautiful scenes and unique atmosphere.\nIt is simple. It is intense. It is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, without a doubt.",

Sure yes,  other great masterpieces of cinema contained great portraits capture in motion, but rarely was the motion used to repeatedly tell the story.   This is where Requiem For A Dream shines, the use of the camera to tell the simplest of stories, one of vice, and pain and fear, and love and joy which barely slipped through our fingers.  Before the main characters have yet to live they are seeking death.  Their parents, and their parents parents doing the same, except not through existential foes, but actual others, looking to submit to existence with slow death.  Not by drugs, but by war, or the misery of the knowledge of what one could have been.  Don't could have been is the story of this movie, summarized by lifes transposed onto drugs and violence.

I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

American director Darren Aronofsky successfully portrays the drug addiction of the four protagonists and its consequences on their physical and emotional state. The interpretations of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are remarkable and, in particular, that of Burstyn, who manages to completely fit into her character. The film also features the extensive use of short cuts, split scenes, and very tight close-ups. Finally, the movie soundtrack composed by Clint Mansell, and which includes the famous track Lux Aeterna, is simply extraordinary and is a fundamental component of the film. One of the best movies about drug addiction.",

While it's supposed to be an emotional and psychological thriller, it didn't necessarily bring out those feelings in me. I felt bad for the characters and their decision making skills but the progression of the story moved too quickly at times for me to build strong connections with those involved. However, the performances are tragically beautiful and the story is tragically bleak. The portrayal of drugs and its effect on the lives of its users and others around them is the central point and in that sense the film succeeds. Nonetheless, this film will hit harder to those who've been affected by the subject matter or have knowledge on the topic.",

            "content": "\"Requiem for a Dream\" is an American psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2000. It is adapted from Hubert Selby Jr. in 1978. The film describes four characters affected by drug addiction and how it changes their physical and emotional states. Their addiction makes them imprisoned in a world of fantasy and despair. As the movie develops, each character will deteriorate and their reality will be replaced by fantasy, leading to disaster.\n\"Requiem for a Dream\" is a movie of four Americans who have fallen from power. They have no bright future but resort to stimulants. When Sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian and friend Tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother Sara Goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. At the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the TV he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted.\nThe movie focuses on the lives of the residents of Coney Island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. By playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. Just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters. \nJared Leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict Harry Goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. But money is a problem. He has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend Marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by Jennifer Connelly. His good friend Tyrone, played by Marlon Wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain.\nWhen friends were struggling with addiction, Harry's mother Sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite TV show. She is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. Her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. But the result was disastrous, and Sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. The exorcist actress Ellen Burstyn played a very good role.\n\"Requiem for a Dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. The film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. But also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. Requiem for a Dream is, for me, the example of a good film that I never need to see again. It made me quite depressed. With this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer.",

The acting is phenomenal. The editing, cinematography, and filming style is just amazing and innovative. The way he brings to life four different character arcs such that we care about each and everyone of them shows an artist who is a master at his craft.\n\nFor some reason I didn't have the passionate reaction to this as the many fans/critics that absolutely adore the movie. This may be a generational issue.\n\nTrainspotting was more to my personal liking which I think has to do with the soundtrack which for me really elevated it to a more re-watchable film. Trainspotting may have more comedy, but it can get super dark as well (the baby scene).\n\nUltimately, this is clearly a movie classic that will stand the test of time.",

Might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. The 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction. \nThe movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. Wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. Good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups. \nIt says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts.\nThe movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath.

Every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from Wayans (who I was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). The film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it I would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of Aronofsky). The film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on McGruff the Crime Dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them Requiem for a Dream. (4/5)",

            "content": "Requiem for a dream is written and directed by Darren Aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by Hurbert Shelby Jr. This film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. One of them played by Ellen Burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. Her son played by Jared Leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. And as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life. \n\nRequiem for a Dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film I guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. Through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. Once in a while I'd think to myself man I am really invested in this film. This film garners your attention and never lets up. Which is an aspect that I think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. From the incredible pacing I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. Requiem for a Dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. And it is by far one of the best films that I have ever seen. Now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but I don't know. Not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that I can't not stop thinking about. \n\nDarren Aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. The way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor Jay Rabinowitz. Including the shots and cinematography from director Darren Aronofsky and cinematography Matthew Libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. From the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. Also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from Clint Mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. This might be my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever and to be far I haven't seen all of his films yet but man I don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. He did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. It's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after I was halfway through it that I decided I can't predict anything out of this film which is something that I really enjoy from a film. You also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs. \n\nWhich leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. Right off the bat I'm debating if I like Jared Leto more in this or in Dallas Buyers Club. He was terrific in this film. Jennifer Connelly is an actress I'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of Jared Leto's character. Marlon Wayans as Jared Leto's best friend was also really great in the film which I didn't expect at all but he did really well. But my favorite performance throughout this film was Ellen Burstyn. Out of all of them I felt more for her than anyone. But not to say that I didn't really feel bad for anyone else, I most certainly felt bad for everyone but Ellen's performance I felt just more sympathetic for. From the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. There's also one scene where I just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes I have ever seen ever. She was freaking phenomenal in this film. Now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. A sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been. \n\nComing back to what I mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. Also it's aspect of claustrophobia. And I will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. I would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. Trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. Darren Aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. This is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. All in all if you can handle this subject matter I'd watch it for the experience and be done with it.  Or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. And another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. This is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. That's how terrifying this film is. \n\nRequiem for a Dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film I have ever seen in my life and I gonna give it a 10/10. \nThank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon.",

            "content": "The cinematic height of a health problematic film that health classes would present as clearly visualized warning about what would drugs do to you is no exaggeration as Darren Aronofsky was headstrong in his disturbingly honest approach that guarantees sickness, to a puking extent if never looked away, and apathy for the hopelessly unlikable characters sealing, or in their cases injecting, their fates from resulted downward spiral of addictions that disregard living. Even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. Only one communication found common sense through Leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings \u2013 and that shows how Aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. Fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? If you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted.

I've never been a fan of camera shots where the character's face is up close to the camera while they're walking.  All it does is induce nausea.  There's no real point to the movie other than characters who are addicted to drugs have bad things happen to them as their worlds crumble down more and more until the movie ends.  It's a series of events within these characters lives that we're watching unfold, but the characters don't have any real goals they're working towards.  Any obstacles they face are induced by themselves due to their poor decision making which I guess is the point.  Character development isn't a part of this since these characters start out lousy and end up lousier.  I'd put this on the same level as Trainspotting: interesting, bizarre, bleak, but ultimately not very sobering with little to no rewatch value.",

If you are currently an addict, it might just help you make the decision to get some help, or if you're strong enough, to quit on your own.  As many reviews warn, the imagery is graphic.

But, dear God, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. As a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. Many critics cite Aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. And though I might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. \"mother!\"), I think \"Requiem For A Dream\" might be that rare case where I couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. This is a movie that hits that \"best of both worlds\" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for. \n\nDo I ever want to see it again?

It is split into seasons starting with Summer, then Fall, Winter, and ends in Spring. I will be completely honest and say that it does have its faults. It can lack the subtlety of more mature films in its dialogue and appearance. However, this film is a collection of sequenced art scenes that are gorgeous in how haunting they become. In the end, you may be traumatized like so many that have viewed this film, but Requiem for a Dream will leave you thinking and disturbed. I can guarantee that much.\n\nJared Leto is a harrowing heroin addict. One of his best acting performances other than Dallas Buyer's Club. He oozes desperation for a fix exponentially throughout the film's duration. Jennifer Connelly is so sympathetic, you just feel worse and worse for her character for what she does for love, acceptance, and drugs. Marlon Wayans is more about making his place in the world with money and heroin dealing. You see his sad past lead to a broken future. Ellen Burstyn is perhaps the most underrated performance in Requiem for a Dream. Her addiction seems to be sugar, then you realize its television. Her obsession with watching leads her to ruination.\n\nIn short, Aronofsky demonizes substance abuse, but takes care in showing the downward spiral of addiction is the most exaggerated, but poignant way he knows. The cinematography will dazzle and terrify you. Clint Mansell's legendary and now infamous score will haunt you for the rest of your days. Darren Aronofsky's mad masterpiece is a demonstration of film making with innovative edits, cuts, synchronization, musical swells, and deranged sequencing. Nearly every scene is shot differently. It's a very interesting movie to look at in that I doubt you will be bored.\n\nCheck out Darren Aronofsky's unhinged film Requiem for a Dream if you dare. You have been warned.",

Due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies I've ever watched. \n\nThe problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down.\nIt's not the only or the major issue I've with this movie. The real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of Sara Goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of Harry and Marion. Also, the oscar-worthy performance by Ellen Burstyn (I really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, Sara Goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than Harry and Marion's. I really didn't found myself relate to the characters of Harry and Marion so much, despite the great performances that Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly gave.\nThe perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of Tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, Marlon Wayans was very good though.  \n\nI love Requiem for a Dream. It's a movie to experience not to watch. It really proves that Darren Aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind.\n\n(7.5/10)",

That piece of music is really overdone and it has dated a little.  Anyway setting that aside the central revolving story and the performances (Burstyn and Leto in particular) are brilliant.  I haven't read the book (yet) but this feels like a direct and successful translation from the page and the descent into misery for all involved has lost none of it's power.",

Incredible performances throughout (Ellen Burstyn delivering one of the most unforgettable performances ever put in history of cinema) and packed with some dark imagery that sticks with you long after you finish the film. It's not for everyone and calling it a drug movie is doing disservice to what the film is actually about. It's deeper and more complex than that. It grabs you by the wrist and never lets go.

It's perfect. the score and the events that take place keep ur heart pounding the whole time , this is not for the faint hearted as there are imagery and scenes that are very well done, so well done as it is a psychological horror that stick to ur mind, it's so friggin intense, this is not a heartwarming family movie at all , this is a film that challenges u and makes u sweat all over,every scene with Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb is so intense I don't even wanna see it, it's so effective it makes u scream from the insides,Ellen is so good u think of her character as the main one, although there should be no main character in this drama, The only flaws are the opening credits, and Marlon Wayans feel inferior as everyone is so good",

            "content": "Requiem for a Dream (2000), directed by Darren Aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. It practically screams \"Don't do drugs, kids!\" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction. \n\nRanging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. Obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest.\n\nAddiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through Aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. Throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. I can actually hear the Lux Aeterna melody as I write this, but that's probably because I'm listening to it right now.\n\nRequiem for a Dream hosts four main characters, Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, a more serious than normal Marlon Wayans as Tyrone, Jennifer Connelly as Marion, and Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). Each of them is or will become addicted. And each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end.\n\nEllen Burstyn brings the character of Sara Goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. Starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there.\n\nThis film is not for everyone. If you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. Everyone else - come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that Aronofsky is about to take you through.",

It follows them as they each build up their hopes and dreams, only to have it torn back down again by their own personal addictions. It's like Of Mice and Men on speed, literally, and good. \n\nI pitch this film to everyone as a must see, it's a film you should definitely see once, and then never again! It's based on a book by Hubert Selby Jr. who co-wrote the screenplay with Aronofsky, (Black Swan, The Wrestler), a writer famed for his understanding of that sort of low life New York culture and his skill in portraying it, and that really comes through in the film which is scuzzy beyond belief. The dialogue and syntax and slang of the characters really sell them as being in this world, an the grungy lighting, and subtly but meticulously crafted frames help. Subtle beauty, maybe Ang Lee can learn a thing or two. \n\nThe reason Requiem For A Dream works so well is that before it tears them down, it builds up your relationship with the characters, gets you to empathise with them and feel for them and like them, it builds up their hopes and makes their dreams seem wonderfully possible before their falls. In fact that's literally the structure of the film, which is simple but genius, the three acts are denoted by the seasons; summer, fall, and winter. Our associations with each word complimenting the acts. This character involvement would't work if it wasn't for a collection of quite outstanding performances. Leto's accent is a bit ropey but you get used to it and he does everything else really well. There's one scene with a phone call that I nearly cried watching. I wanted to. Wayans gives an uncharacteristically serious performance and he does it really well. When people were wondering why on earth the man behind all these shit parody movies was being invited to join the American Academy I remembered Requiem For A Dream in which he is charismatic and empathetic. The real stand out though, is Elen Burstyn, who was actually Oscar nominated for this movie and boy does she deserve it. By far the most complex character she gives a powerhouse performance in which she is believable but just extraordinarily brittle. Again, there's a scene where Leto comes to visit that's by far the most memorable scene in the film and again I nearly welled up. \n\nIn the end it's moments like those that are the key to understanding the hypnotic, mesmeric, enigmatic attraction of Requiem For A Dream, it has a lot of bleak imagery, and montages that will leave you traumatised but it's interspersed with moments of pathos and emotional sadness that are much more subtle and give the more traumatic sequences weight that without it would just seem gratuitous, and worse, slightly immature, using these images without any understanding of the weight they carry. However, luckily, Aronofsky and Selby Jr. know exactly what they're doing and they do it well. It's carried off with a style, professionalism and maturity that belies that this is only Aronofksy's second film, and first bigger budget one. \n\nAlso, I have to mention Clint Mansell's beautiful, melancholy but perversely techno-influenced score, it's truly amazing.",

The love between Harry and Marion is particularly exalted, like Sara's typical widow's way to live. All the main characters underestimate their addiction to drugs as they reach their top. \n-FALL, where everything start crumbling. Drugs take control over everyone's life. \n-WINTER, aka the saddest part of the movie. Not crying is a challenge at this point, as Arronofsky great technique to create a link to all the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives. \n\nThe movie is not perfect at all, as it features a really poor character's design, an overall repetitive pacing before the latter part, a sometimes confusing photography, but has a strong and perfect soundtrack (one of the most famous in the world), a great plot and is just so entertaining, you sometimes forget to be seeing a DVD.

However, when it does build up Burstyn delivers something memorable and fascinating. \n\nReally, it was Sara Goldfarb's story that kept me engaged and interested here and I think it easily made up for some of the film's weaker points. It would be very easy for a film taking itself this seriously to be nothing but a complete joke and whilst, this possibly comes somewhat close at times, it never actually ends up there and I think that's a credit to Aronofsky's direction- this isn't a film trying to be cool, it's just legitimately cool at times. The way he captures frantic addictive tendencies is a real technical achievement and it makes up for some of the script's, quite generic, interpretations of these same concepts.\n\nDeserving of its cult status but still just a little too nineties if we're being honest (though I believe it's technically a film of the noughties but, facts are irrelevant).",

            "content": "Watching Requiem For a Dream was an experience with lasting effects. It's the most hopeless film I've seen to date with a completely ruthless portrayal of drug addiction and the horrors associated. This is not as much due to the subject matter, but more so to how the characters' struggles are so sympathetic, and these struggles being presented with such scrutiny by Darren Aronofsky and the cast that is devastatingly painful to watch.\n\nThere is an unwavering sense of disgust from the opening scene, and it never lets up from there, making it the only film that I can confidently say I wanted to squirm in my seat while watching. It is an upsetting film in every sense of the word, made apparent by the emotional performances, the characters' goals in life slowly slipping through their fingers (hence the title) due to their use of drugs, and the uncomfortably close camera angles that give the viewer a cringe-inducing sense of entrapment. \n\nIt's easy to think of this film before seeing it and assume it is purely dependent on the significance of the subject matter with no substance from a filmmaking standpoint. However, if the film lacked in filmmaking, it would not be nearly as upsetting. Darren Aronofsky knows how to trap the viewers into the horrible events with a stellar cast, Clint Mansell's haunting score, and an unwavering sense of dread. This dread is made possible by how the characters are crafted. Watching them abandon dignity, hold onto false hope, and stomach such disturbing situations made me almost struggle to stay seated, a feat no other film has accomplished. \n\nOne cannot talk about this film without mentioning Ellen Burstyn's performance. She is tied with Essie Davis in The Babadook for my favorite performance by an actress. What they do so well is make the viewers feel such pity for their miserable lives with performances so convincing that it's easy to forget that they are actors. Although Burstyn outshines everyone else, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly are fantastic in their roles, doing what Aronofsky most definitely expected them to do: Make the audience feel their characters' pain.\n\nAs well as the performances, what Aronofsky does technically is equally astounding. Whether a director can add more layers to the story than what is on paper is what separates a mediocre director from a great one, and Aronofsky proves himself to be the latter. Aronofsky uses the same editing technique each time a specific character takes a specific drug, for instance. As the viewer counts the times the technique is used, they feel more and more despair as the characters addictions become gradually stronger. \n\n*****SPOILERS FOLLOW*****\n\nWhere his technical skills really shined for me was the final scene where he wraps up the film perfectly. He shows a montage of our characters laying down, and provides so much with this one directorial choice. All characters except that of Jared Leto assume the fetal position. My interpretation of this is that it's a gesture of despair, conveying a similarity between them.\n\nThe position also indicates that they are clutching the one thing that helps them take their mind off their new unbearable lives. The reason Harry (Jared Leto) does not assume the position is that he has nothing to hold on to. Every other character does, but the thing that gives them hope is what makes each character arc distinct from the others.\n\nTyrone (Marlon Wayans) clutches the thought of his mother, making him the most hopeful character since he is being forcefully held from his drugs and still has thoughts of a peaceful life. Although the movie shared a theme with Trainspotting in conveying the frightful easiness of slipping into addiction with the story of Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Darren Aronofsky himself said that Tyrone is the only character with hope of escape. \n\nMarion (Jennifer Connelly) is similar in that she has something that gives her hope, but different in that she has completely abandoned her life. She curls herself around the heroin she went to such desperate measures to get her hands on, showing how drugs are her salvation from her new life even though they are the cause.\n\nThe film concludes with perhaps the most depressing character arc in the movie, which is that of Sara Goldfarb. Solidifying the heart-breaking monologue she gives earlier, the thing she holds on to is the fantasy of appearing on television. She knows this will never happen, but the thought of it comforts her. Within this fantasy, her son Harry is implied to have married his girlfriend Marion and appears well-dressed and happy. Him and his mother tell each other they love each other, and the film fades to its end credits. What makes this character arc the most depressing out of all of the others is that her son's life and their relationship being healthy is within the fantasy of her appearing on television. This suggests that her son loving her and vice versa is just as outlandish as her television fantasy. That notion is emphasized further by Sara smiling, but tears running down her eyes can be seen. \n\nThe way Aronofsky presented the film's wrap-up is the major highlight of his directorial talents within this movie. He knew to convey more ideas visually than what is shown through dialogue and the actors' performances, making this movie's presentation of the subject matter all the more complex. Although it is a film that had me emotionally drained long after seeing it, I cannot deny that it is excellently crafted.",

All five of these elements were top notch.  Was the movie difficult to watch?   Yes.  Did I want to curl up into the fetal position and hug my mother afterwords?   Oh yes.   Ellen Burstyn's performance of an amphetamine-addicted middle aged single mother that degenerates into drug-fueled insanity is perhaps the greatest acting Performance I've ever witnessed and will haunt me forever.  The Academy robbed her at the Oscars by giving it to Julia Roberts for Erin Brokovitch. One of the worst Oscar snubs, in my opinion.  I'm sure the Oscar voters that year could have used a dose of objectivity themselves.",

It's certainly not easy going, but it's a remarkable adaptation of Selby's novel ... really capturing the sense that the seeds of these character's downfall have been planted even before the story begins.  It makes the small moments of hope all that more poignant.  I think there are really only three serious missteps.  It's a mistake to have nominally updated the story's setting to the present day since several aspects of the plot only really make sense in the context of the book's early 70's time frame. While the film is stylish, it's also generally realistic and believable in tone, which makes the excessiveness of the Ellen Burstyn's hallucinations in one key scene stand out as too much.  Finally, while Marlon Wayans is good in this (can that be said of ANY other movie he's in), his character is brutally underdeveloped.",

The acting was great, Marlon Wayans gives the best performance I've ever seen from him and Jared Leto was really good too. The director used a bunch of really cool camera effects that were fun to look at and didn't distract from the message the film was sending.

When talking amongst other addicts about movies on this subject, usually Requiem for a Dream is everyone's favorite, for being so realistic and in your face.  But just cause something is realistic does not mean it is automatically going to make a great feature length film.  Jared Leto is really good in this movie portraying the role of the drug addict very authentically.  Just his physical look alone. The soundtrack is downright disturbing and matches the subject matter perfectly. It is funny though, most people will say the standout performance in Requiem is from Ellen Burstyn, I disagree, I think Leto takes the cake for this movie.  The mother's descent into addiction due to a fascination that she is going to be on a television show and must lose weight becomes really disturbing and almost annoying by the end of the movie.  This is a movie that you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it, because you feel so dirty.  Yes it is a very authentic movie when it comes to addiction, but a tad over the top if you ask me, if they cut out some of the more disturbing things, I think this movie really would have been better, but that's just me.  I would not recommend this to the average movie fan.",

The best way to describe this movie is, you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it.  Being a former addict myself, someone who knows all too well about the depths addiction can take you to, I find the movie very realistic but also a bit overblown.  Some parts I feel like I can relate to and other parts I just feel are put in there for shock value.  It has a very dark and slow deliberate pace as do most of Aronofsk's films.

            "content": "Be prepared for one of the most violent nightmares imaginable, back in a time when, Aronofsky, was more than capable of smashing your teeth in with a hammer for over an hour. Requiem is the chilling tale that surrounds 4, drug addicted human beings, who are all connected. It  documents the progression of the rise and fall of drug addiction, showing the glamorous highs and the frightening lows, highlighting the extremes people will go to, in order to get their next fix. In Aronofsky's second outing, he manages to craft a film so unique and arresting, its almost impossible to look away, despite the horror unfolding on screen. Led by an all star cast, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes, Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, Aronofsky lobs his characters into the depths of hell and then for good measure throws us, the audience, in after them. Shot in a stylish but very rough looking demeanor, Requiem may fool you into thinking your about to witness the same old drug related tale, however the script soon pole vaults into another world, full of dreams and aspirations, demands and exceptions, Aronofsky isnt afraid to tackle some difficult subject matter here, really getting into the meat off all 4 characters downfalls and its harrowing to watch. His quick cut and ominous style becomes a staple of normality straight off the bat and paces the film wonderfully. Requiem doesnt feel bloated, nor does it ever grind to a halt, its constantly on the move, utilizing sound and a blistering soundtrack from Clint Mansell and The Kronos Quartet, to its full advantage. The film weaves in and out of normality, using a wide array of visual techniques, in order to disorientate the audience, which by the finale will have you feeling like you, yourself are coming off a year long drug binge. It's horrible and gritty, intense and creative, stylish and violent to such an extent, Requiem should come with a viewer discretion advised sticker. One of cinema's rare treats, that gets under your eyelids and stings for the duration of its stay, a must own, however approach with caution.",

It's the cinematic equivalent of an anti-drug PSA and has all the subtlety of Reefer Madness. But as someone who appreciates the art of downer cinema I give the movie credit for having some of the most distressing scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It didn't effect me emotionally because I just didn't care about the characters. It tries to pull a Martin Scorsese by showing us bad people who get it in the end, but Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are no Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. This might sound cruel, but the film kind of reminds me of an Itchy And Scratchy cartoon. Like I said, the exception are a few very pitiful scenes, but if you saw a real mouse chop up a real cat with a chainsaw you might find that a little more shocking. I think Aronofsky is overrated, but he's definitely a visionary. In the future I think he'll be more known for his impact on movies in general than the movies themselves.",

The cinemetography and scene editing is nice when it works, but its annoying, and unforgetable when it doesn't, but i understand why the filmmakers did some of these annoying things, and it really makes sence i just dont like it that much. most of the camera work is in the characters perspective and they are high most of the time, so its always kind of choppy, time-lapsed and fast motion blur, with weird sound effects and a boring score. the acting is pretty fuckin good, and thats what i really like about this movie, but almost every good thing in this movie was cancelled out by somthing bad, or somthing not good, or somthing that wasn't very entertaining. but as a whole i really dont think its that bad overall, i just think its a little over rated, and if it wasnt for the performances or casting and some of the disturbing imaginary scenes, and sometimes not imaginary scenes were very good, and some of the things written for the characters add alot of weight to the characters which made me want to watch more. this is not a thought provoking film which i wanted it to be, it is just plain, strait up weird and about drug addiction and what it is like to live in a world of coruption and drugs. the two best things about this movie, were the writing, and the strong performances from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely,Marlon Wayans surprisingly and Jared Leto's mother in the film that got nominated for an Oscar, which was definatly worthy. So, if you're bored and maybe considering having a movie marathon or somthing, because its definatly a film worth viewing. The positives are stronger than the negatives in this film.",

There are moments of the darkest of humour as the lives of the pair spiral out of control but the fates of both are dealt with in an unflinching and graphic manner that is cold and disturbing. Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto lead the cast and for me, Burstyn's story is probably the most heart-breaking as we see the lonely old widow become dependent on tranquillisers and slimming pills as she becomes obsessed with the chance of appearing on a low-budget TV game show. This is a hard-hitting and deeply uncomfortable movie that seems as brutally relevant today as it was when it was first made over a decade ago. The score by the brilliant Clint Mansell underpins the onscreen imagery perfectly and has rightly gone on to have a life of its own, being instantly recognisable. Not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, this is a powerful drama from a superb filmmaker.",

            "content": "Wow, Requiem for a Dream is so dark and depressing. It is easily one of the most detailed looks into how drug abuse can destroy your life. Aronofsky uses every trick in the director's playbook to give the audience the sensation of being affected by the addictions of the main characters. There is shaky camera work, there are dramatic focus shifts. Even the music is used to create an unsettling atmosphere. It puts you on edge as a viewer, and makes it utterly impossible to relax while watching the movie. Perhaps the most amazing thing to me was that the actors actually managed to make their characters sympathetic to me. There were moments where I actually wanted them to have a successful sale in order to dig themselves out of the pit they had fallen into. Typically it's hard for me to identify with a movie character who continues to make the wrong decisions, but some magical combination of the script and the acting had me rooting for these people.\n\nOne of the most effective techniques that Aronofsky used in this film are the repetitive smash-cut montages of each step that goes into taking drugs. It made for a really artistic way of showing how the drug abuse had become routine to the characters, and it also offered a great contrast when later Ellen Burstyn's character became addicted to her own drug of choice. I also enjoyed what this film had to say about people who struggle with a less toxic, but perhaps just as damaging, addiction like television. It makes you question your own life and look to see what you have grown overly attached to that might be getting in the way of more important things. The one thing about Requiem for a Dream that kind of holds me back from absolutely falling in love with it is that this film is exceedingly hard to watch. In fact I can't picture subjecting myself to it again, at least not for a really long time. While I do think it is amazingly well-constructed, and startlingly realistic, there's nothing that would prompt me to want to go through that again.",

            "content": "While most people see movies solely for entertainment value, several of us actually welcome a challenge. Requiem for a Dream is a graphic and often unpleasant movie, but it's evident that was the intention. Disney cartoons and comic-book blockbusters are all fine and good, but movies like this are the reason I'm a movie addict. Movies about young, strung-out junkies are not new. Movies like Another Day in Paradise, Rush, and Kids all addressed similar issues, to varying degrees of success. The tough part is not showing the ugliness of heroin addiction. Just watch someone shooting up and you're seeing a tragedy. What's difficult is presenting honest characters, and not apologizing for their actions. They're not heroes or villains in Aronofsky's hands, and how you feel about these characters lies with you. The screenplay doesn't guide you, and any movie that forces you to decide things for yourself is always a welcome change.\r\n\r\nEveryone has their addictions, right? For some, it's crack cocaine. Others can't function without their morning cup of coffee. Love, contentment, approval, happiness; Wish for any of them too hard, and you find yourself an addict. Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream displays how rampant addiction affects the lives of four interlocked characters, and it's not a pretty picture. But that's exactly why this is an excellent movie. While several scenes are of unnerving discomfort, the intention is never simply to shock. A filmmaker can \"stun\" an audience whenever he wants to; it's his party. The tough part is to tell a story and prove thematic points by using the shock value responsibly.\r\n\r\nHarry (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict. When we first meet him, he is appropriating his mother's television set to hock for his next \"fix\". Long-suffering mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn) screams with her son, but never really gets angry with him. Five minutes later, she's simply buying the TV back. Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) also participate in Harry's hypodermic activities, and the three eventually hatch a plan: To become dealers on their own and make thousands of bucks! Meanwhile, Sarah has received a strange phone call, promising her a spot as a TV contestant. Alone in her home, she quickly begins preparing for her night on TV by popping diet pills.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie of several excellent components, most notably a handful of excellent performances, a restrained yet visually stunning directorial style, and a hypnotic musical score. While a handful of scenes linger a bit too long, that's a nearly pointless complaint in a movie so strong on nearly every other level. Requiem for a Dream is not a \"fun\" movie, nor is it merely a drug-related melodrama. This is a smart movie about how addiction shackles people, for movie fans who can handle the heavy stuff.\r\n\r\nEllen Burstyn is remarkable in this movie. While she hasn't been seen in films too often lately, her performance simply should place her back in this should have placed her in the public eye. As a woman who becomes increasingly more unable to deal with reality, she is heart-breakingly believable, and the result is one of the best acting performances I have seen. Also quite surprising is the work of Jennifer Connelly, in a nearly impossible role. Her stunning beauty has somehow mislabeled her as a \"pin-up\" actress, as she's nearly always excellent, regardless of how small the role. She'll get a lot of attention for her courageous performance. Jared Leto is serviceable as the anti-hero Harry. Although it's easy to buy him as a junkie, he simply plays his role too clean-cut most of the time. Leto is tough to buy him as a sleazy addict when he looks like the cover of a Teen magazine. Director Aronofsky presents several unique sequences, and he offers several harsh and resonant montage sequences, some truly shocking visual sequences, and a wonderfully effective usage of sound effects. (Each moment of addiction satisfaction is presented in a rapid-fire display of color, light and sound.) Especially memorable is the use of the infectious score by Clint Mansell, which gives the movie a dark, desperate heartbeat.\r\n\r\nMuch has currently been made of the MPAA's decision to threaten this movie an NC-17 rating, thanks to a sequence near the end, which depicts some particularly unsavory acts. Apparently, The MPAA missed the point of this movie entirely. By deleting (or even editing) the scene in question would negate the entire point of the movie: That true addiction leads to true degradation. I was glad he didn't compromise.\r\n\r\nI can't promise that you'll love this movie, but you'll be able to see how censoring a movie can sometimes disembowel it. Requiem for a Dream is a tough movie to watch, but the film offers a lot to enjoy. Darren Aronofsky deftly avoids many of the \"drug-movie\" cliches so evident in other films of this style, and his film is a sobering and fascinating piece of work. While this movie is NOT for all tastes, I can recommend it as one of the best and bravest drug-movies ever made . Requiem for a Dream is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater, and it's a rare film that can do that.",

The message seems to be this: addiction is bad, drugs are bad, don't do them or they will destroy your lives, but too many extraneous variables are in the narrative. What is the film trying to say?

But then again, heroin is said to be quite addicting.\r\n\r\nHarry (Jared Leto), girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connolly) and friend and partner Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are good friends who like to do drugs. But they either do it to feel good in general or to stop themselves from feeling bad in a bad situation. This film gives a great look into how addicts do drugs and everything is all better to them. Harry and Tyrone get into a sticky situation when they are in need of more drugs so they take part in a drug lord's operation, making them eventually travel from their hometown of Brooklyn to Miami, where Harry is forcibly taken to the hospital by Tyrone so doctors can take a look at his dead arm. At the end of the film, the two of them end up going to prison and Harry's arm is amputated.\r\n\r\nMarion on the other hand continues to support her addiction by taking part in prostitution and sex rings.\r\n\r\nAs for another important character, Sara (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's mother who is widowed and stays home and watches her favorite infomercial/game show all day long. She gets a call one day saying that she has been chosen to appear on said show. To lose weight, she tries to go on a diet, failing, and then succumbing to horribly addicting diet pills.\r\n\r\nIt's a sad road Sara travels on. She becomes addicted to these pills and becomes mentally unstable, waiting to hear from the producers of the show to tell her when she can be on the show.\r\n\r\nIn the end, all four characters curl up in a fettle position.\r\nI cried deeply.\r\n\r\nThis film is so sad but also, so incredible well directed and edited with great camera work and great fast paced scenes (hip hop cuts), especially cuts on drug related items during at which time the audience assumes the characters are getting high.\r\n\r\nSuch a once in a lifetime film. Every mature minded individual should see it.\r\n\r\nRequiem for a Dream, I give you a 100%.",

The movie starts out on a frantic/sad/confusing/angry note, and spirals out of control so fast, you won't even know what hit you. From a non-drug addicts perspective, Requiem has you trying to relate to what everyone is feeling or going through, it's a roller coaster of back catalog memories. Requiem is a massive slap in the face to anyone that has a drug addiction, and if they continue to use after having seen this movie, well, may God have mercy on their soul. The editing and imagery was executed perfectly. At no point in the film did I feel lost (except the first 5 minutes, but then everything became VERY clear to me what was going on) or confused about the timeline of events taking place, it flowed exceedingly well. The amount of sorrow I felt for each character at certain points, summoned ol' Kermit to the back of my throat. When Kermit makes an appearance, I know the movie is a winner. Requiem for a Dream is extremely powerful and should not be taken with a grain of salt. Thanks to this recommendation, I could finally put a face to yet another favorite bastille cover song of mine. The song: What Would You Do -- fades out with the following quote, \"It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow all right.\" I never searched the quote or let it bother me too much that I didn't have the slightest clue what movie it came from, because it was too beautiful to want to google it. There was a certain air of mystery behind the voice that I loved hearing so much. However, the pictures in my mind will be that much more meaningful to these songs after having seen this movie. And yes, I have a terrible addiction to Bastille. Let's just hope it doesn't spiral out of control..",

To accomplish this goal, she starts taking amphetamine pills despite the warnings of her son Harry. Harry is a young junkie that hangs out with his junkie best friend Tyrone and his also junkie girlfriend, Marion. In order to support their habits and to accomplish their own individual dreams, they enter the drug market but as we all now, when you enter the drug world, there is no safe way out of it.\nWith the name \"Requiem for a Dream\" you know you are about to watch a depressive film, so if you like films that are funny and happy entertainment, I recommend that you skip this one. The story is not the typical \"drug story\", it has 4 perspectives of how drugs affect life, each with their story arc. The script makes you fell for this characters that are well developed. Aronofsky's direction is really what makes this film that memorable and efficient; the fast and short montages, the extreme closeups, the tracking shots and the use and timing of that phenomenal score (specially the use of Lux Aeterna) are what makes this film so effective. And of course, the acting is at the same level as the directing, with Ellen Burstyn stealing the show, the biggest surprise being Marlon Wayans giving a grounded and actually good performance (first and last, in my opinion).\nUndeniably one of the greatest film of the last decade, a must see, specially for teenagers (this is more effective than the \"antidrug campaigns\" the give in highschool)",

The first is Sara Goldfarb, an elderly lonely woman living in an apartment. She is obsessed with a game show, in which this is the only thing that makes her excited and seems to have a lot of value in her life. She gets a mysterious call saying that she will be on the show and because she is plump, she decides to lose weight to fit in a red dress in order to look nice. Sara constantly mentions her late husband Seymour, thinking he would be proud of her. She buys diet pills that seems to be working but she develops a terrifying obsession with them, becoming emaciated and eventually begins to lose her mind.\n\n The other three are Harry, Marion and Tyrone. Harry is Sara's young son who is a drug addict with his girlfriend Marion and best friend Tyrone. They have hopes and dreams of being successful and having a much better life, but their addictions are a large obstacle in life, causing them to do anything, including degrading sexual acts and imaginations of violence and thievery, to keep their habits. Sara has an unrequited affection for Harry and she knows their relationship is complicated and she hopes for him and Marion to have a great life, get married and have a grandchild, perhaps to fill the absent void and desire for comfort in her life. He wishes too, but doesnt wish to do it yet. \n  \n Basically, the film is about the downward spiral of four people who wish to achieve their goals in life, but ultimately suffer the unfortunate consequences of their addictions. The score is beautiful with a touch of chillingly disturbance. The film is a disturbing feat overall, but very necessary even though some might find it hard to stomach. The performances are one of the best things about this film.\n\n Ellen Burstyn, who plays Sara, gives an Oscar worthy performance (she was nominated, but lost to an equally deserving Julia Roberts), as is Jared Leto as Harry. Marlon Wayans gives his best performance ever and Jennifer Connelly is excellent as well. Each character is thorough and relatable.\n\n  Sara hopes to reach confidence and happiness, something to give her to live for besides her son. Harry and Marion hope to be a happy couple, to live the American Dream as anybody in love would. Tyrone hopes to keep the longtime promise he made to his mother years ago as a boy.  \n\n  Requiem for a Dream is not for the faint hearted, but it is an important film that will teach a valuable lesson in life.",

            "content": "At this point, it's safe to say that addiction truly is a disease. With heartbreaking news of deaths from overdose become a recurring part of our society, substance abuse has proved to be just as harmful as any other disease circulating Earth and infecting humanity. In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that there were approximately 29,000 unintentional drug overdose deaths in the United States alone. The harrowing results of such overdoses are the foundation of Darren Aronofsky's thrilling adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s Requiem for a Dream. And with phenomenal acting, a great script, and Aronofsky's spectacular visual style and directing, Requiem for a Dream couldn't be a better adaptation.\r\n\r\nRequiem for a Dream follows a short time span of the lives of four Coney Island residents: Sara Goldfarb, her estranged son Harry Goldfarb, Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver , and Harry's best friend Tyrone C. Love. Being a drama based around drugs, each of the four protagonists faces their own addiction. Sara becomes addicted to amphetamine pills upon receiving upon receiving a phone call telling her she will be invited to appear on the infomercials she watches regularly, an entirely separate addiction of sorts. Meanwhile, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone face heroin addictions, and illegally sell drugs to earn money to fuel their addictions.\r\n\r\nBut like any drug addiction, it doesn't take long for things to take a turn for the worse and slowly spiral out of control. Sara's intense desire to lose weight for her television appearance leads to severe overdosing of amphetamines. Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are forced to find new ways to get their fix upon losing their hard earned drug trade profits. Not to mention that Harry suffers physical harm from improper heroin injection techniques, Marion suffers under hellish conditions to get her fix, and Tyrone is caught and arrested for his drug use.\r\n\r\nAs an adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel, Requiem for a Dream is adapted phenomenally. This comes mostly in part due to the fantastic screenwriting collaboration between Selby himself and director Darren Aronofsky. The results of such a pair are astounding, resulting in a brutal, intense story full of characters that you hate to see face such downfalls. Each character comes off as memorable and fascinating in their own way, making each of their inevitable demises all the more heart-breaking and saddening in the film's tear-jerking climax.\r\n\r\nThe quartet of actors in Requiem for a Dream really sell the film. In an Oscar nominated performance (as well as one many people expected to be a winner), Ellen Burstyn is the star of the show. Burstyn undergoes extremely drastic physical changes and puts up a truly amazing performance for a role that required so much dedication and effort. Jared Leto shines as her son Harry as well, standing out as a quite sympathetic character. Leto really studied up on the personalities and mentalities of heroin addicts, making his performance all the more accurate. Jennifer Connelly, always one to take up risky roles, knocks it out of the park, especially in the physically and mentally strenuous scenes towards the end of the film. Marlon Wayans, known mostly for his comedic roles, makes a surprisingly outstanding dramatic performance, something many people didn't know he was capable of.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of Aronofsky's work, Requiem for a Dream benefits from his stunning directing style. To match the fast paced effects of drug use, Aronofsky uses quick montages that really bring out this concept. Just to get an idea of how fast paced the film is, consider this: the average movie contains 600 to 700 camera cuts; Requiem for a Dream contains well over 2000. Another effective technique Aronofsky uses regularly is a split-screen shot of two characters interacting within the same scene. Such a style often implies that even when the characters are side-by-side, they are still separated by their addictions. Not only is Requiem for a Dream thought-provoking, it's visually stunning as well. Paired with Clint Mansell's haunting score, Requiem for a Dream is quite a well-rounded piece of film.\r\n\r\nEverything about Requiem for a Dream is exhilirating, haunting, and thrilling. Never has any director handled the downward spiral associated with drug abuse as masterfully as Aronofsky does with Requiem for a Dream. The performances are absolutely astounding, making for a quartet of sympathetic characters and situations. The brisk pace and quick cut montage scenes truly embody the use of drugs in real life. Film in general doesn't get much better than Requiem for a Dream.",

            "content": "Requiem for a Dream - Night Sweats of the Bourgeois\r\n(Be advised - SPOILERS)\r\n\r\nLast weekend I watched Requiem for a Dream, having gotten on a kick with Darren Aronofsky's work (which includes Pi, and The Fountain), and whoa, boy, was it a punchy film. In the past, this is a film I would have sneered at for being what I might have termed, \"conveniently bleak,\" for being...tragedy. I still have little use for that form of art, as most of the time you get a thin cypher for author's own particular pain, but written large and definitive. The dark adolescent drama still makes me sigh.\r\n\r\nBut this movie was different. It struck me as a pretty true depiction or representation of the hell state, in this case in the form of addiction to heroine. Aronovsky and Selby (the writer of the novel and co-screen writer) gives us the image, but without saying that that's all there is in the world, that all endeavors turn to shit and all dreams lead to the flames. These are four particular stories that are given, four inflections of the same hell, but there are others in the film who are not either in or heading for that place. Nor does it seal the characters up in their suffering, denying them of some eventual redemption or salvation. It simply takes us from the anteroom of hell to its deep interiors, and leaves us there. Ok, I can accept that. And having had some experiences of feeling utterly trapped, I can feel the truthfulness of the depictions.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, though, I realized that it wasn't a film to watch right before going to bed. I woke with a screeching anxiety and sense of despair that didn't match up to anything going on in my life. After meditating for several hours, I think I understood what about the film crawled under my skin and opened up an abscess.\r\n\r\nI grew up in a pretty conventional household, lower and then middle middle class, tutored by my family and environs (the term \"community\" is much too strong for my suburban neighborhoods) in a certain imago of the world, that with its sixties overtones and colorings, was basically the classic bourgeois lens. Money and wealth were not ostensibly the uber-goals, but under the surface they were what defined safety and security. The neighborhoods we lived in were generally solid middle class, older track houses generally owned by your standard workers or small business owners. Money as status was not obvious; everyone was more or less at the same level economically, and outward appearances were not really stressed.\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be a chronic underlying anxiety about money, in my family and in my neighborhoods. Our family was scraping-by-poor at the beginning, as my parents were beginning to establish themselves in their work, and later became more financially stable. But there were little in the way of safety nets, either from other family or socially. We would never have starved, but with the whole extended family living at the same level, there was not a sense of being able to fall back in any substantive way on other family members. The stress, from what I remember, was intense at times, both because there was real financial struggle, and because of how my parents were trained up to think about money.\r\n\r\nI can remember my father going from job to job, either getting fired or quitting, till landing a position with a pest control company (where he still works). He and mom would fight about it, in the back room behind a closed but thin door, so we knew as kids that the ground under us was not stable. We also, in family stories, and in the popular media we were exposed to, taught about what was below us, what pit it was possible to fall into if we did not work hard enough or strayed too far out of the mainstream. The bums down on K St., the hookers on T St., the druggies and gangsters somewhere down in then unvisited depths of South Sacramento, all were object lessons in what happens to you if you fall. From relatively civilized to living with the animals, fighting for bones and carrion.\r\n\r\nWaking up the morning after Requiem was waking up into a terror of regression, what seems to me to be the night sweats of the bourgeois. Requiem follows the descent of four mostly middle class people as their social relationships and financial status crumble. Under the stress of addiction and impoverishment (the three addicts), and loneliness and despair (the mother), their families atomize and their access to resources dries up. They become gaping mouths without the ability to feed themselves. They become powerless and helpless, falling on the tender mercies of the state, which in the bourgeois mind, is good for the underclass, and appropriate punishment for the failings that their poverty demonstrates. But for the middle class, having climbed out of that fetid state, regression back to it is utter hell, truly terrifying, the funneling of anxieties around loss of a tenuous power, and recognition that the animal skills that are transmuted in being civilized, are no longer available when you lose your wings and fall back to the jungle floor.\r\n\r\nThat was a rough morning.\r\n\r\n(This review and more can be found at http://www.deepmoviereviews.blogspot.com)",

Portraying the effects of drug abuse, the lives of four individuals are changed as the story progresses. Most of what makes this movie so harrowing are not just in the performances but in the editing and pacing of the film as well. Rather than portraying the act of abusing drugs through the normal twenty-four frames a second, Aronofsky opts for a series of rapid cuts which represent the quick \"high\" of heroin. The length of the scenes change and grow shorter throughout the film as the addiction grows and consumes their lives and distancing the audience from empathy. And the music. The music is one of the elements that drive the film just as much as the actors. The sharp harping of the string instruments, usually used for warmth and softness, produce a cold and discomforting sound that continues during the length of the movie. All these elements together make a masterful film that will leave you chilled to the bone afterwards. I'm glad I watched this film, but it is one I don't know if I can watch again.",

            "content": "Drugs are bad, m'kay?\n\nThis might be the most visceral and intense movie about drug addiction ever made, and could definitely be used to ward people off of ever wanting to do drugs. However, that's about all it is: a painful, hard to watch portrait of degradation that, while exceedingly well-made and well-acted, doesn't say much beyond, \"Look how horrible this is!\" There's nothing wrong with the film being that simple in its intention, but I didn't find it quite as thought-provoking as some of Darren Aronofsky's later, somewhat more ambiguous films like The Wrestler and Black Swan.\n\nThe plot is simple: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) gets addicted to diet pills and to a horrible TV game show. Her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend (Marlon Wayans) are all addicted to heroin. Things are bad when the movie starts, and get progressively worse.\n\nEllen Burstyn is definitely astounding in this movie; her thoroughly vanity-free performance is one of the best and saddest I've seen in a long time. She was nominated for an Oscar for it, and probably should have won. Leto, Connelly, and Wayans are all really good too, each of them managing to convey a certain decency that would possibly give these characters happy lives were it not for their ruinous addictions. It's too bad Wayans has stuck to bottom-of-the-barrel comedies ever since this movie, as he really was decent here.\n\nDarren Aronofsky is a uniquely powerful filmmaker who knows, perhaps better than anyone else currently working, how to put you directly into the minds and subjective experiences of characters in desperate physical and psychological straits. He pulled back from this tactic slightly with The Wrestler to present a more objective view of that character, but in Pi, Black Swan, and this film, he's unbelievably good at conveying how the characters feel and think through his use of camera angles, camera movements, lenses, sound effects, and editing. This is one of the most thoroughly montage-oriented movies since Eisenstein. However, all of this extraordinary technique is ultimately put in service of a very simple message: drug addiction will ruin your life. That's really about all that the movie has to say, and while it says it clearly and forcefully, it isn't quite as complex or interesting as I perhaps hoped it would be.",

In fact, the entire cast produces award worthy performances, including a serious turn from Marlon Wayans and from Jennifer Connolly. But the Oscar nominated performance comes from Ellen Burstyn, who plays Harry's mother, as she battles with weight loss pill addiction and the paranoia and hallucinations that come with it. \"Requiem For A Dream\" is best described as an acid trip, bringing the genre of drug films to a head, with every single character showing signs of addiction towards something, and all leading to unhealthy choices and impossible lifestyles, despite their best intentions. Aronofsky's work has only gotten better, but this early film is the perfect stepping off point to capturing the essence of this film-maker.",

            "content": "Words do not accurately describe the feeling one gets while watching Requiem for a Dream, although the terms \"repulsed,\" \"confused,\" and \"bored\" do a pretty good job of covering it. This shock/drama load of crap from Darren Aronofsky (the failed abortion behind such atrocities as Pi) is a pointless, vapid, and absolutely empty piece of propaganda filmmaking that plays out like Reefer Madness crossed with Mr. Mackey from South Park. And believe me, after watching this movie, you'll be BEGGING to hear some \"Drugs are bad, m'kay?\" instead of sitting through this monotonous bore. \n\nRequiem for a Dream is a movie about drug use, both over-the-counter and illegal. It showcases how the spiral downwards for both kinds of drug users mirror each other, and goes into great detail showing how drugs can destroy people's lives. Wow, who made this movie, my middle-school guidance counselor? Sure, heroin isn't good for you. I think we get that. And yes, it's true that some legal drugs are also pretty bad for you, as it's easy to form addictions to them. But we get that as well. This movie has nothing new to say on the subject of drug use, and comes off as preachy, pretentious, and self-important. Aronofsky probably thought he was God's gift to humanity for delivering unto us this beautiful film about why drugs are bad for us. But what he failed to do was give us characters we cared about, good dialogue, or another take on the subject instead of presenting us with an utterly one-sided view of a serious issue. Fuck, this movie sucks.\n\nThe film stars Jared Leto as a young drug user who engages in several illicit skinnyings with his friends and girlfriend. That's all you'll really need to know. His entire story plays out like an extended version of Denny's drug use scene in The Room, where you feel like the director wanted to say something about the subject of drug use, but every line of dialogue is so laughable and the message is so concocted and contrived, you can't possibly take it seriously. Subtlety is not this film's strong suit, as over the course of its ridiculously long run time, it absolutely bludgeons the audience over their heads with its straightforward and preachy \"DON'T DO DRUGS, BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD\" message. Every moment is calculated and artificial, and the characters are equally hollow and soulless.\n\nLeto's mother is also suffering from a drug addiction of another kind. She starts out as a television junkie, then becomes a serious drug addict by getting over-the-counter drugs to help her diet. After this point, everything goes to shit for the characters (and the movie in general). At the beginning, it could have been a solid study of drug use in America, but it eventually morphs into a self-conscious, overly surreal, and sickeningly filmed load of manure that NEVER SEEMS TO END!!! Every five minutes while watching this, I paused it to check and see how much more I had to slog through. Individual scenes might be okay, but they are repeated almost word-for-word over and over and OVER AGAIN. With all the attention paid to the visuals, you'd think that some would at least be paid to the script. When the refrigerator started moving... that was it for me.\n\nThe problem with movies like this isn't just that they're bad-- it's that they think they're good (and that people buy into that). This movie never stopped for a second to consider what it was actually doing instead of barrelling forward to no avail. Not once does Aronofsky try to put an original idea up on the screen. He just assumes that audiences will eat this movie up because of its anti-drug use message, but it all seems too reactionary and hyperbolized. \"IF YOU TAKE DIET PILLS, YOU WILL END UP IN THE HOSPITAL ALONE, DYING, AND INSANE!!!\" Jesus, does this hack director understand that he's the laughingstock of cinema for this exact reason? A movie cannot ride on its cinematography and pathetically delivered message. Maybe this guy was just trying to work out some unresolved anger issues towards pharmaceutical companies. Because that's his only excuse.\n\nFinal Score for Requiem for a Dream: 3/10 stars. Not only is this movie a sloppily edited, poorly acted, badly written waste of a talented cast, it also has absolutely nothing new to contribute to the world of filmmaking. There is not an original idea to be found throughout this painful, preachy mess of a movie, and when it actually does try to be original, it fails on every other conceivable level. It also forces the audience to suffer through some seriously disgusting visuals with absolutely no dramatic payoff of any kind, throwing in random plot points (\"Ass to ass!\") right up until the very end that are unbelievable in the context of the movie and have no reason for being. In short, this is a movie for people who know very little about drug use-- so little, in fact, that they need it explained to them by a guy whose full analysis of the issue consists of \"IT'S BAD.\" This movie isn't just overrated. To call it a \"movie\" at all is an insult to the institution of filmmaking. It's mindless, vapid, and completely devoid of all purpose. In other words, it's a Darren Aronofsky movie.",

The only criticism I have of this movie is that it isn't as much a story as it is a cautionary tale. The characters start out as acceptable people, fall into addiction, are seen to have lost themselves, and the movies over. It's horrifying to watch, but very little story actually happens here.

Particularly stunning is Ellen Burstyn's performance as Sara Goldfarb, a naive older woman who takes a bullshit call to mean that she will be on television. Disgusted by her current weight and receiving no results from a terrible diet, she becomes addicted to diet pills. The imagery of her taunting refrigerator and doctor who might as well be a dealer, never looking at her even when her condition screams for medical attention, help make this movie about the destruction of the mind, body, and soul through addiction ring a bitter but true tone. \"Requiem for a Dream\" is anything but a fun movie-going experience but is a necessary one for those who like their horror to dig under their skin and dramas to be deeply moving.

            "content": "Scoring an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the lead performance of Ellen Burstyn, Requiem for a Dream sounded like an interesting film to check out.\n\nThere are many films in the world that feel like a drug trip, such as the British films Brazil or Trainspotting. Yet both of those films tie their story into the plot of a complicated story. Due to its low budget, there is not too much that it can really step into exploring. But by camparison to Trainspotting, it is an inferior film. Director Darren Aronofsky does not label the film as being a \"drug film\", but it has many of the same elements of the genre and so I would label it as such. But in comparison to the even lower budget Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream fails to achieve the same kind of effect.\nWhile Requiem for a Dream has the interesting characters, energy and intensity that Trainspotting had, it is a lot more of a scattered film. The problem is that the focus of the film really fails to justify its ambition because Darren Aronofsky crosses a line that he really was not yet ready for as a filmmaker. While without problem he manages to deliver a strong script to the film which gives the film a lot of strong material for its cast to be working with, he spends too much time attempting to walk before he can really run. To simplify it, Requiem for a Dream is an ambitious film but the plot attempts to follow the stories of four characters as their addictions cause their lives to spiral out of control and as they are faced with reality overtaking their attempts to escape. But the focus of the film is much more on style than it is on substance. Darren Aronofsky's handling of the visual style in Requiem for a Dream makes it an unforgettable experience, but the story really isn't all that much. In an attempt to focus on four characters and their own drug addictions as well as hour they are connected slightly, the story does not keep its focus right. Instead of maintaining focus on a single character while using the others as subplots like in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights or evenly balancing the story out so that each character gets equal importance like in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, Requiem for a Dream is so scattered in its focus that it is difficult to determine who the main character really is. It will depend on which character viewers find most interesting, but I personally did not really find them that interesting as they didn't have stories to them or all that much character depth written for them. Requiem for a Dream was a great depiction of the horrors of drug addiction, but as a story it simple lacks depth. As the story went on, I was consistently interested in Tyrone C. Love's story but he didn't get all that much screen time and it took me a while to find interest in Sara Goldfarb's life, while the story of Marion Silver simply did not interest me at all. I guess what I'm really saying is that Requiem for a Dream is more important for its depiction of drug addiction than it is for its story. Perhaps it isn't a drug film, maybe it's an \"illness film\" for its depiction of drug addiction, falling into the category of Memento for its depiction of anterograde amnesia and A Beautiful mind for its depiction of schizophrenia. So I guess Requiem for a Dream is both a drug film and an illness film, and it is good as an entry into both more so than as a form of storytelling.\nBut still, for what it's worth, Requiem for a Dream is an unforgettable film. Although it starts out slow, it gradually intensifies more and more due to its characters facing more and more of the horrors of reality as it clashes with their individual drug addictions. The style of the film becomes a lot more trippy and the grotesque imagery increases where it hits a perfect level of excess. Rarely can a film be excessive in its imagery to a point of being seriously beneficial, but Requiem for a Dream achieves that. Thanks to an excellent visual style which benefits from some ambitious cinematography which takes on a lot of creative and atmospheric angles, Requiem for a Dream is so powerful that it is claustrophobic. Viewers of Requiem for a Dream become trapped in the film, and some will find a need to escape it to get away from it all because it is not a film for the weak stomached viewers. Many viewers while find their stomachs churning and their minds collapsing at the effect of Requiem for a Dream because it is such a powerful film. Requiem for a Dream has a shocking strength to it, an unmatched brutality that shows off Darren Aronofsky's genius, and his handling of the nihilistic atmosphere is unforgettable.  Requiem for a Dream is a perfect film to depict the real horror of drugs, and if I watched this in my youth I would be so shocked that I would never get involved in any of it. Luckily for me I already don\u00e2(TM)t do drugs, but if I did I would be curious about what kind of effect this would have on me. Requiem for a Dream is arguably the second scariest film I have ever seen, not for its unexpected shocks, but its brutal realism in how it depicts the horrific nature of drug addiction and its consequences from many different characters\u00e2(TM) perspectives.\nPart of the strength in the atmosphere comes from the musical score. Clint Mansella's powerful composition of the music in Requiem for a Dream gives it the emotional edge it needs so that the visual strength of the film is further so that it is both a visual and auditory experience of strength. Requiem for a Dream makes extensive use of the memorable song Lux Aeterna which isn't even the slightest bit repetitive solely because of the kind of strength that the musical piece has. Requiem for a Dream is unforgettable also for its soundtrack, and Lux Aeterna is a musical piece which will fail to ever escape the walls of my mind.\nWhile Requiem for a Dream isn't the best front for Darren Aronofsky as a storyteller, as an example of his twisted genius as a filmmaker and just what kind of shocking effect a film can have when its style is powerful enough. Viewers are bound to walk away from Requiem for a Dream shocked and questioning reality for a time, and if the viewer finds that this constitutes entertainment and great filmmaking, then Requiem for a Dream is the film for them. The film left me crying inside while I could not cry on the surface as the film had been too shocking for me. I found myself shaking as the film trapped me within the mystery of reality, an effect I had not felt since seeing David Lynch's masterpiece Lost Highway, so Requiem for a Dream is the second time that I have walked away from a film with a huge distortion of reality which cannot be broken until I have woken up the next day, and is second in effect to Lost Highway. This is mostly because of the visual style of the film with its atmosphere that traps viewers within sad darkness thanks to its lean cinematography and well timed editing, but it is also because of just how talented the cast is.\nIn 1974, Ellen Burstyn was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress to Ellen Burstyn for her lead performance in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. They gave her the award for the wrong film because there is no possible way that any performance she has ever given is greater than her lead role in Requiem for a Dream. She starts out well as a simple woman, lonely and finding solace in whatever company she receives as well as her interest in infomercials hosted by Tappy Tibbons, and as she develops further into a methamphetamine addiction, audiences bear witness to the true endeavour of her skills as an actress. She becomes so intense in the distortion of her character's reality and her physical appearance weakens more and more while she develops with it in a further twist of fate. She slowly falls apart psychologically which begins to happen more rapidly towards the end of the film, and it becomes so brutal in its strength that audiences are likely to forget having ever seen Ellen Burstyn in any other film up until that point because her lead performance in Requiem for a Dream is a new rebirth for her career. She is shocking in her strength to the point that it is easy to forget that a film is going on, and she gives the finest performance of anyone I have ever seen playing somebody with a drug addiction. Ellen Burstyn lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Julia Roberts who should have won it in 2013 instead for her performance in August: Osage County over Lupita Nyong'o, and the final image of her in Requiem for a Dream is so brutally powerful that it will haunt me forever. The last shot of her in the film, the face of Sara Goldfarb as she sinks into a delusion forever is one of the most memorable aspects of Requiem for a Dream, and it is unbelievably strong.\nJared Leto's performance in Requiem for a Dream is remarkable. He is a really compelling presence because it is easy to get attached to his character as he expresses a caring nature for his mother, and so the audience is likely to feel the shock of his careless attitude towards drugs overtaking his appropriate sense of right and wrong. Things become more and more intense as the film progresses with Jared Leto's performance being one of the richest aspects of that because he without flinching he tackles the role of Harry Goldfarb and injects a fearless dedication to the character which is so powerful that it is easy to forget that he is actually acting. Jared Leto\u00e2(TM)s organic acting talent is impressive in Requiem for a Dream, and while his character isn\u00e2(TM)t too deep he makes the shocking brutality of the plot dynamics seem a lot more real by truly conveying the loss of reality and physical pain which comes from suffering at the hands of one\u00e2(TM)s own addiction.\nMarlon Wayans is an actor primarily known worldwide for his work in comedy films such as the Scary Movie series, and Requiem for a Dream is one of the rare cases where he steps out into dramatic work. And without a single problem, he makes it an incredible performance. Although his character is very interesting, he doesn't receive enough screen time. But what screen time he does have proves just what his true acting talents are. Marlon Wayans immediately steps out of any comedy association that viewers may have with him for his role in Requiem for a Dream, and he creates an ambitious performance. Although he isn't explored as deeply as the other characters, Marlon Wayans gives possibly the greatest performance of his career in Requiem for a Dream which is an expression of his true talent, and in the role of Tyrone C. Love he makes it seem painfully real with a shocking revelation of fear in his performance. Any fan of Marlon Wayans for his comedy work really needs to see Requiem for a Dream so that they can bear witness to his true acting talents.\nJennifer Connelly doesn't have the most interesting character in Requiem for a Dream because her character doesn't succumb to her addiction as negatively as the other characters, but her performance is great. Jennifer Connelly doesn't get involved in films that are this complex in material very often, and it is good to see her fearlessly stepping up and tackling the material as well as she does. Requiem for a Dream is a good front for her acting skills because her line delivery is intense without going over the top into melodramatic territory. It is constantly great in its restraint, and while she gets a bit much screen time for a character who isn't that interesting, Jennifer Connelly performs with dramatic grace and realism which gives the film the strength that it demands from its actors.\nChristopher McDonald also gives a strong supporting performance.\n\nSo although its story isn't that deep and its focus is scattered a lot mainly in the first half of the film, Requiem for a Dream is an unforgettable film. It is an example of a film which can leave a truly mesmerising effect on the viewer purely on the basis of its visual style which reminds us of the strength of films, as well as the talents of its cast, particularly Ellen Burstyn who gives one of the greatest and most intense performances of any actresses ever in my life.",

            "content": "This is one of those pictures I've meant to see for a long time, with many a film student to remind me. I didn't hear a single negative thing about it, so naturally I figured it would be overrated. Unanimous praise is a sign of either a movie of divine quality rarely achieved by man, or one that doesn't challenge its audience in any profound way (would Citizen Kane be a masterpiece if people didn't bitch about how boring it is?). Requiem for a Dream is one of those interesting cases that manages to be both, leaving me happy to see pure artistic vision executed with such finesse but also frustrated that its shining moments reveal the tarnishes. \n\nLike all complex story telling, its beauty isn't on the surface. Really, the synopsis sounds like something they'd show you in DARE. Various people try to find happiness in drugs but end up falling victim to them in different ways. But in no way do I see that as unintentional. It starts at a low point in the characters lives and knows damn well it only intends to go lower. The movie is more or less what the title says it is, a lyrical morning of the death of hope. In that sense, it succeeds historically. It's rare you see pain and misery stitched together this well. Every line of every character plays a part in the thesis, and their fates unfold with sobering believability. Every character has a different motivation for chasing their high, coupled with a different fate. Aronofsky pulls off a juggling act I rarely see in ensemble movies, making each character unique and valuable. Now that's not to say some characters are more unique and valuable than others, but we'll get to that.\n\nAnd perhaps I should specify that when I say \"unique\" I mean to the movie, not the genre. You can put lipstick on a pig but when it comes down to it, druggies falling victim to their fix is a story we've heard a thousand times and this doesn't offer a huge spin on the concept (with one exception, but we'll get to that!). Darren Aronofsky makes Disney movies for depressed people. Their execution is impeccable and their writing archetypal at its best, clich\u00e9 and down right silly at its worst. But for some reason it seems to be more hip to trip on Disney's shortcomings, like the preteen Power Ranger fan saying Barney sucks. But anyways, this is the best quintessential Aronofsky film I've seen. I prefer The Fighter, but I tend to prefer the results of artists with recognizable styles trying something different.\n\nThe movie is so cool that it often becomes too cool for the room and the misery stops falling victim to seemingly real people, but to characters. That's because its flourishes, such as its now iconic flashing imagery and breakneck editing, sometimes end up hogging the spotlight from those very characters. These little vignettes of stylish misery that make up the movie do a great job of creating a brand for itself, but do little for getting into the heads of these people, much less under their skin. I don't really know why Harry and Tyrone thought they could/wanted to make it as drug dealers, or why Harry and Marion loved each other. And when looking back on it their reasons for failure are pretty simple, because drugs and dummies don't mix. The film does wisely include elements of society as an additional culprit for perpetuating their misery, but this is where the seams of the picture start to show. The crooked doctor ignores Sara's worsening condition with just a little too much calculated apathy. The old white businessman yells \"ass to ass!\" with just a smidge too much maniacal glee. Every police officer with a line was either racist or an asshole. We're thrown the worst humanity has to offer at a recreational pace. \n\nHorror is the experienced emotion more so than sympathy, like watching a zeppelin crash down in glorious spectacle. I found myself searching for a \"so what\" after the movie took me through such a stressful journey. Drugs are bad? I already knew that. There's no shame in a simplistic message told profoundly, but to imply something is profound is to say it has the power of change, which I'm not sure Requiem has. As it stands, I see it as the Kids of the 2000's. It's a canvas painted brilliantly with black and grey that I wouldn't mind passing by in a museum.\n\nNow that all that's out of the way, lets talk Ellen Burnstyn. Her performance is so brilliant it'll make you want to call your mom, no matter how much you may hate that bitch. Every complaint I have about the movie being impersonal melts away when she's on screen. Every nuance of the performance reveals some vital detail about herself, from the tone she uses to talk with her son, to the sparkle in her eye when watching her favorite show, to the fetishistic attention she pays to each bite of food. She must've rubbed off on Aronofsky, because her segments also seem to contain the most compelling filmmaking the movie has to offer. Not only do we get an intimate view of a genuinely sympathetic person, but we are given a reason to truly mourn their downfall, by giving her hope. It's a hope we see blossom vibrantly and I'll be damned if my heart wasn't broken when she didn't get the dream she deserved. I felt I knew her better than anyone else on screen, and her spiral was the only I truly found devastating. If they released an \"only Ellen\" cut of Requiem, it would be the best short film on drug addiction ever made.",

It seems like crack, uppers and heroin are the focal point upon the lives of 4 people which the viewers get the chance to see from the perspective of the characters point-of-view upon taking these \"specific\" drugs and the extent they would go to keep their doses frequent since not all drugs react the same way- director Darren Aronofsky uses plenty of camera tricks/ angles from every camera trick in the book including close-ups, the use of split screens, blurry visions, hallucinations and fast- forwarding the characters in an attempt so that the audience can see what they're seeing upon taking certain drugs.   What several films such as \"Lost Weekend\", \"Barfly\" and \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" is to alcohol is \"Requiem For A Dream\" is to drugs, and while the audience are oblivious about how some of the characters got involved in drugs in the first place, we are wondering as we're watching this whether or not they can ever get out of it, and on what circumstances and to what cost. Courts are never shown here since the sentences are usually the same, and the characters motivations are understandable that is somewhat restrained so that viewers can identify with the characters drug addiction problems easier rather than hating them even more, because in real life, I've seen several crack addicts who steal and kill people to feed their habits and this film doesn't show that because it's not in any of the characters nature, for example- right at the beginning a son (Jared Leno) pawns his moms old TV set when he could've just go to thieving.  Anyways, to say anymore would ruin the experience and will say that besides Leno, the film also stars Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar winning performance which garner her a nomination as Best Actress.\r\n \r\nVery passable but a low 3 out of 4 stars",

Aronofsky just smashes this one, and the film looks and sounds just amazing, especially the editing is masterful. One might expect that a film so chopped up and disjointed would do the actors a disservice but they pull out amazing performances, of which, Jennifer Connelly stands out. She is so magnetic on screen that you can't take your eyes of her, but when her life takes a turn for the worse (it wasn't that great to begin with), the despair that fills the screen is overflowing. This is what cinema should be like, and I champion such power. Recommended, you might not thank me immediately, but in a couple of days when it sinks in you will.",

The cast was amazing and I think the performance I will remember the most will be Ellen Burnstyn, she was incredible. The cinematography was also a great importance, Aronofsky uses the camera to make us feel like how they feel, and it truly was some one of a kind camerawork. It was a total nightmare in the final scene of the movie, pure horror.

The similar \"Hip Hop Cuts\" from Pi become tired immediately if one has already seen Pi. Although I must say there was an effort to reflect the novel in the film but this may have been a pasted on interpretation by Aronofsky. On the positive side, the acting is superb. The tragic end demands the film be viewed. The film can be watched over and over and probably will not get old. Overall the film is incredible in its strengths and feels \"artsy fartsy\" where it possesses weaknesses.

Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb is a shining achievment in acting in the modern era. Bravo i say to her performance. And finally the score, which is the greatest i have ever heard.

Being the first Arronofsky film I ever saw, I was forcefully introduced to his harsh method of story telling through the likes of heavy music ensembles and dark-lit sequences the right way. Dealing with the subject matter of the film, I don't think it could have been done any better. Choppy, quick-framed shots become a common thing to help tell the story of 4 individuals struggling with drug addiction in the gritty setting of 70's NYC. Arguably the Wayans brother's finest performance (not saying much), coupled with a powerhouse performance from Ellen Burstyn as the lead characters mother. Jennifer Connelly, like usual, is alright at best, the role could have been cast better. Jared Leto is acceptable. Props to the editor and Arronofsky primarily though. I also can't forget to mention the deliciously sinister and ominous score crafted by Clint Massel.",

The film's editing is a little off-putting at first, but adds a layer of uniqueness to the film that few other films since have mimicked. I cannot emphasize enough how good the pacing is in this movie - the way this movie builds to its disturbing yet altogether heartbreaking conclusion is extremely powerful and shocking. The script is nothing to write home about, but when coupled with the all-too real performances from Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connolly, and Marlan Wayans as well as the editing, each scene becomes more captivating in a way I've never seen in film. My only real dislike of the film is that some of the images and scenes could be too much for me; while many felt essential, some sequences felt more forced for shock value rather than leaving an impression. Regardless, Requiem for a Dream is a beautiful and disturbing piece of film, and one that should not be missed - so long as you can take in the strangeness of it all.",

It pulls back the conventional layers of film making to reveal an unnervingly intense and perhaps deeply disturbing reality of the four out of control  characters that Requiem focusses on. Director Darren Aronofsky masterfully & without hesitation splays the guts of his characters depravity & despair out for us to see in such a raw and unapologetic way that viewers will not soon forget the experience they had watching this film.\r\n\r\nRequiem is one of the finest films I have ever experienced. Yes it is indeed an experience this film, one I will not soon forget.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend this masterful work from uber talented director Darren Aronofsky.",
