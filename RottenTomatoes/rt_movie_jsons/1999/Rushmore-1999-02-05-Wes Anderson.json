Something I'd rather not experience in any other film for as long as I live.\n\nThis film feels VERY Wes Anderson which is such a great thing. I've seen about 2/3 of his films/short films and some of them don't always feel like others\u2026 this one, however, is very pleasant and reminds me of Darjeeling Limited and Royal Tenenbaums. I love it. While it is confusing and dull at times, the filming is great and really tries to keep u engaged.\n\nThis has got to be Bill Murray's funniest performance, every action made me laugh and the fact that he just took off running at one part was hilarious. He's a great actor and this role was amazing.\n\nLet it be known that I did fall asleep at around the 1 hour mark. It's quite a boring storyline but the acting is great and idk I have mixed opinions. The third act is really really interesting so it saved the movie in my opinion. Like I REALLY enjoyed the third act but I'm not entirely sure why I was so intrigued the whole time. I would probably not rewatch this just for fun but it was a good watch on the first time.",

That is to say: entertaining, clever, quirky, unique... but ultimately not quite my thing. At the end of the day, I just wasn't sure what I was supposed to get out of this story. Perhaps that's the point, but that's just not good enough for me.\n\nWhat specifically bugged me was that Max never really atoned for his extreme behavior. They never hit on the head that he needs serious psychiatric help. He basically gets away with all of it and everyone just goes with it. Even getting kicked out of his school didn't phase him. We needed him to either have a moment of self-reflection OR hit on the head that he's incapable of self-reflection. As is, it felt like we're supposed to be ok with his antics just because he's funny.\n\nWith that said, you'll probably like it and be entertained by it. I just wish I'd loved it.",

Schwartzman really is superb if slightly implausible for his role (to be fair, plausibility shouldn't be a large barrier to enjoyment of this one). I can imagine Bill Murray's performance being divisive for some. The laughs that he produces could be chalked up to Anderson and Owen Wilson on the script because he appears restrained and a bit inanimate throughout. I think that it is key for his character to have vibrancy around, and that Murray's restraint or woodenness never impedes Rushmore's glorious, whimsical thrill ride. Olivia Williams also does really well, and shouldn't be forgotten in her role as an instructor attracting the attention of Schwartzman's Max almost from the beginning. I enjoy Rushmore most for its departure from convention and refusal to allow good nature to bury creativity. Most of the film is beautifully shot in its own right without being distracting, and I found this one to be a bit of a hidden surprise that isn't talked about enough.",

The film has all of the auteur stylings one has come to expect from an Anderson film, including quirky characters, quirkier dialogue, plenty of fast pans, long tracking shots, vibrant colors, and offbeat humor.   Like a lot of Anderson's movies, some of the jokes fall a bit flat, but it remains an entertaining look at teen angst featuring some outstanding performances and a refreshingly original script courtesy of Anderson and his longtime sidekick Owen Wilson.",

It also marks Schwartzman's first film, who plays Max Fischer, the lower-middle class student at a prestigious private school who compensates his status by joining and championing various clubs, sports teams, and educational groups, all to the detriment of his GPA. We all knew a Max Fischer, which is what makes him appealing, annoying, and even detestable at times. However, you can't help but root for the schmuck, even if it isn't for the ridiculous goal of scoring with the First-Grade teacher, Rosemary (Olivia Williams). I was pleasantly surprised with how good Bill Murray, as wealthy businessman and Rushmore graduate, Herman Blume, was in the film, as I likely hadn't viewed it since the early 2000s. He has a handful of great lines, which typed out wouldn't give them justice, and also swats a child's jump-shot \u2014 just good stuff. Wrapped together with an excellent soundtrack of \"British Invasion\" rock, Rushmore toes-the-line as a \"must-watch\".",

I didn't find this film really memorable, as I considered the jokes very dumb and the plot not being entertaining enough like all of his other movies. Whereas not comparing this film to other of Wes Anderson's -- it's a fine picture. Great style and color with amazing actors deliver a fantastic performance and aesthetic feeling.

As a coming-of-age story whose actual objective narrative is essentially completely unrelatable to anyone, the film relies predominantly on mood and emotion to convey a sense of empathy. While not as immediately 'fun' as some of Anderson's more recent works (the later addition of his characteristic narration, for instance), Rushmore is still a worthy addition to the director's output.

It doesn\u2019t matter how different the plots are, how diverse the characters are, or even if it\u2019s live action or animated...they all share the exact same tone. It\u2019s so pronounced that I swear you could shuffle scenes from all his movies together and it would take a long while before you would notice something was wrong. If you\u2019re a big fan of the Wes Anderson aesthetic, then I imagine none of this bothers you, and Rushmore is one more wonderful treat. However, I\u2019m not that enamored with it, and therefore I get somewhat bored with most of his movies (when I\u2019m not actively annoyed by them.) I\u2019ve said before that the style of his films make them feel like they were made by an alien who is trying to imitate their perception of life on Earth. It has the bones of a human story, but no one acts normal, and there are oddities in the way the movie world functions that don\u2019t quite line up with reality. Of course his movies look amazing, because Wes Anderson is all about painstakingly working out the details, but they lack humanity. Rushmore is more of the same, and doesn\u2019t bring anything new or interesting for me to enjoy. Thankfully, it\u2019s not one of the Wes Anderson movies that frustrates me, because most of the characters are pleasant enough and the plot is harmless. There are certainly moments where I find Jason Schwartzman to be irritating, but the story is presenting him in a negative fashion in those scenes, so that\u2019s acceptable. Bill Murray doesn\u2019t get enough to do in order to save the film. He has some moments of comedy that work, but this is more Schwartzman\u2019s movie. Rushmore is such a strange film because it never seems clear whether the main character is a good student or a bad one, all we know is he\u2019s overly ambitious and likes to organize extracurricular activities. When we see him getting a C- I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s good for him or terrible. I\u2019m also a bit puzzled by how he has avoided constant bullying since he is such a tedious know-it-all. As with many other Wes Anderson movies, I find Rushmore to be an acceptable way to pass the time and nothing more. It\u2019s certainly not a movie I\u2019d ever need to revisit since I\u2019ve seen plenty of his films before, and can get the same experience from any of them.",

He's a divisive filmmaker and it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground between those who love him and those who loathe him. Count me in the former camp. For what it's worth, Rushmore is probably Anderson at his most accessible. All the hallmarks are here - the cast is thoroughly quirky, the cinematography obsessively detail-focused, the soundtrack firmly planted in lyrically-appropriate 60s and 70s rock - but it's all somewhat toned down from his usual level; less in-your-face, take-it-or-leave-it.\n\nThe film's subject, an insular private school and the odd, hyper-focused youths who proudly call it home, lends itself to such idiosyncrasies. Here we find all manner of brilliant young minds, developed well past their years in some respects but stunted in many others. That essential duality is interesting, amusing, understandable. They've been taught to solve for x and y, to adapt mature films for the stage (example: Serpico for kids), but remain remedial students of human interaction.\n\nMax, the focus of this personality-driven black comedy, is a perfect exhibit. At fifteen, it looks like his best days are already behind him and he struggles to compensate with a flood of strangely specific extracurriculars and, later, a sadly misguided reach for forbidden fruit: a smart, attractive, widowed first-grade teacher. He's accompanied by a colorful fabric of supporting characters. Plenty of amusingly unbalanced students, sure, but also a curious batch of equally dysfunctional adults. Bill Murray works magic with one of these roles, a tough mix of frustrated parent, self-loathing businessman, unexpected mentor and hopeful suitor. He and Jason Schwartzman (Max) share instant chemistry and the film wisely sticks them together like glue, even when their characters are at each other's throats.\n\nIn all, Rushmore is a well-tuned, somewhat downplayed, dose of the Anderson style: funny, driven, melancholy and genuine. His films might not speak to everyone, but they usually hit the mark for me. This is one of the best.",

The only certain thing for me is that this is still the best of his filmography, even after more than 20 years from its released.\n\nThis film premiered in December 1998, so of course is not the same make a review nowadays  than then, this movie has become a classic for the director's fans and a favorite between the followers of this stylish comedy-drama movies. I can see today that in Rrushmore we find an entrance to Wes's World, a guide to his unique style and the beginning of a legacy.\n\nThe plot is about Max Fischer (preformed by Jason Schwartzman) an eccentric 15 year-old student of Rushmore Academy, an elite private school, in which he is one of the worst students due to his attention being more focus in extra-curricular activities than in the real subjects. He dreams with being a genius or someone special, and tries to show himself like one. As the story goes on we see how his behaviour makes him go through encouraging and difficult situations, sharing the screen with characters like Rosemary Cross, a teacher with whom Fischer develops an obsession; and Herman Blume, a disillusioned industrialist played by the legendary Bill Murray in one of his best roles. \n\nAll the characters in the movie have an important role, none of them is too bad or too good, neither too funny or too serious and that is what I found brilliant in this screenplay written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, every one of them have some line or situation that will be remember when the picture is over.\n\nYou may think this is only a characters driven story but is more than that, every frame works as a whole with that beautiful cinematography by Anderson's frequent collaborator Robert Yeoman, and that soft but interesting music composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. The formula give us a perfect result, funny, original, clever and lovely; I cannot wait to see this film again. 10/10",

            "content": "A delightful comedy of rare perspective.\n\nWes Anderson's indie coming of age comedy Rushmore (1998) is pure joy as Anderson's quirky style and riveting direction make you feel the warmth of friendship and love all over again. Anderson directs Rushmore with his usual sleek, symmetrical style and uplifting tone. Rushmore demonstrates how Wes has matured as a director since Bottle Rocket into a slickly creative auteur of refined sensibilities.  Rushmore delivers constant laughter, but I most appreciate the heartfelt character arcs and genuine empathy for his unique roles.Rushmore is a meticulously crafted art piece, but lovingly written with Wes Anderson's original vision.\n\nWes Anderson and Owen Wilson's script is remarkable as they create this horribly precocious and unlikable hero, make him sympathetic, then give him redemption in a very real and reflective way showing that people can change. All fluff transforms into sincere character interactions that make you feel like everything will alright. I love how Anderson forms these bonds between people that ensures humanity has more to offer than cynicism. \n\nDavid Moritz' snappy editing keeps Rushmore's brief 93 minutes a blissful viewing experience. Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is very naturalistic as to his backdrops of schoolyards and graveyards, but it's his cute square framing of every shot that keeps you smiling. Quick shots scattered everywhere work wonders as brief friendly visuals attract your eyes all over Rushmore. Mark Mothersbaugh's score is again neat indie rock, folk rock, and alternative rock like his sweet music for Bottle Rocket. His sound fits the adorable aesthetic of Wes Anderson's films aptly.\n\nI must say how much I like Karen Patch's costumes for Rushmore. She straight up dresses Jason Schwartzman like Wes Anderson himself and everyone else is in colorful, cute outfits that keep Rushmore a bright movie. She did a great job with all these neat threaded suit jackets.\n\nJason Schwartzman is incredible for such a young actor as the odd and too attached, near sociopathic, student Max Fischer. He's awkward with no understanding of normal social cues, so he's certainly a quirky Wes Anderson character. However, all his creepy, commanding, and forceful stalker behavior gets redeemed because Max is not a bad person, but a foolish kid. Schwartzman is so funny as Rushmore's lead, but also endearing as a young man looking for his place and purpose in the world. How can you not relate to a boy trying to find a girl to fall in love with really?\n\nBill Murray is hilarious as Max's older friend Mr. Herman Blume. His dejected state is funny to observe as Murray makes it clear his marriage is over, he hates his destructive sons, and doesn't relate to the world anymore despite all his wealth and luxury. He's a great foil and friend for Jason Schwartzman to act opposite. I also liked the child actor Mason Gamble as Max's young friend Dirk Calloway. Can you believe Wes Anderson got Connie Nielsen to cameo as Dirk's lovely mother?\n\nI adore Olivia Williams in Rushmore as the object of Max's desire named Miss Rosemary Cross. She's a strong character mourning her dead husband, looking for love, but uneasy at her new prospects. Williams is phenomenal in the confrontation scene with Schwartzman in the classroom. She's mesmerizing as you sympathize with all the trouble Max brings her, but Olivia Williams gets you to empathize with her depressed lady. Likewise, Sara Tanaka is excellent as the adorable Margaret Yang. She plays the nice nerdy love interest that fits Max's outlandish personality perfectly! I wish Wes gave her even more lines. She's that good.\n\nSeymour Cassel is wonderful as Max's kind barber father Bert Fischer. Brian Cox kills it as Max's frustrated principal Dr. Nelson Guggenheim. He endears you to his tough and angry supervisor figure in that gruff, yet likable fashion that Cox thrusts into existence for all his roles. Stephen McCole is hilarious as the defiant Scottish bully Magnus Buchan. \n\nNow for all the other cameos in Rushmore. Alexis Bledel apparently cameos as a student somewhere in Rushmore. I like Luke Wilson's carefree cameo as Dr. Peter Flynn. Andrew Wilson cameos as the disappointed Coach Beck. Dipak Pallana gets a return cameo after he got robbed in Bottle Rocket as Max's math teacher in Rushmore Mr. Adams. Kumar Pallana is back after committing the robbery in Bottle Rocket, now a landscaper named Kumar Littlejeans in Rushmore. It's so cute how Wes Anderson keeps casting all his favorite friends and great actors in little roles for his feature films. \n\nIn all, Rushmore is a remarkable picture full of hopeful optimism and playful maturity from the masterful movie maker Wes Anderson.",

He is both Rushmore's most extracurricularly active and least scholarly student. He spends nearly all of his time on elaborate extracurricular activities, dramatically affecting his grades. He also has a feud with the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim. At a school assembly, Max meets Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a disillusioned industrialist who finds his operation of a multimillion-dollar company to be tedious. He is upset that his marriage is failing and the two sons he's putting through Rushmore are impolite and obnoxious brats spoiled by their mother. Herman comes to like Max, and the two become good friends. Max is impressed by Herman's success, while Herman is interested in Max's confident persona. Max also develops an obsession with Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a new first grade instructor. She joined Rushmore after the death of her husband, who was a former student. While she initially tolerates Max and his attempts to pursue her, Rosemary becomes increasingly worried by his obvious infatuation. Along the way, Blume attempts to convince Max that Rosemary is not worth the trouble, only to fall for Rosemary himself. The two begin dating without Max's knowledge...\n\nThe film helped launch the careers of Anderson and Schwartzman while establishing a \"second career\" for Murray as a respected actor in independent cinema. At the 1999 Independent Spirit Awards, Anderson won Best Director award and Murray won Best Supporting Male award. Murray also earned a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. \"Rushmore\" is considered one of Anderson's finest works and was ranked one of the best films of the 1990s by several publications. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"This cult favorite is a quirky coming of age story, with fine, off-kilter performances from Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray.\" In his review for the Daily News, film critic Dave Kehr praised Rushmore as \"a magnificent work: the best and most beautiful movie of 1998\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that Bill Murray was \"at his off-kilter best\". Todd McCarthy, in his review for Variety, wrote, \"The deep-focus widescreen compositions possess an unusual clarity that adds details and endows the action and humor with exceptional vividness\". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel praised Rushmore as \"an often deft, frequently droll little movie turns into an increasingly desperate juggling act, first trying to keep too many dark and weighty emotional objects aloft, then trying to bring them back to hand in a graceful and satisfying way\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \"It's a particular treat for its skewed, hilarious memories of a cutthroat boyhood\". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn said of Schwartzman that \"he perfectly captures the poignancy of a character who understands his failings but hasn't yet the emotional resources to conquer them\". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley praised Schwartzman's performance for winning \"sympathy and a great deal of affection for Max, never mind that he could grow into Sidney Blumenthal\". Entertainment Weekly gave Rushmore an \"A\" rating and wrote, \"Anderson concentrates on beautifully disciplined filmmaking, employing 1960s British Invasion hits . . . to further define Max's adolescent dislocation\". Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, wrote, \"To their credit, Anderson and Wilson share none of the class snobbery that subtly infuses much of Salinger's work ... But like Salinger they harbor a protective gallantry toward their characters that becomes the film's greatest strength and its greatest weakness\". In Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston wrote: \"A breezy comedy about the grey area between adolescence and adulthood, Rushmore makes good on the promise of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket - and then some. Thanks to stellar performances and the director's original comic vision, it's easily one of the year's finest films. ... Rushmore is somewhat indebted to Harold and Maude and similar comedies of that era, but the complexity of Max and the audacity of the film's set pieces place it in a league of its own.\" However, some critics did not review the film so positively. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan criticized Max's overtly \"snooty\" personality as \"too off-putting to tolerate\" which could potentially discourage audiences when identifying with the film. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four citing an issue with the film's shift in tone in the final act, stating \"the air goes out of the movie\" in regards to \"stage-setting and character development\". He further wrote, \"Anderson and Wilson are good offbeat filmmakers ... But their film seems torn between conflicting possibilities: it's structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, and I almost wish they'd allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows\". A lifelong fan of film critic Pauline Kael, Anderson arranged a private screening of Rushmore for the retired writer. Afterwards, she told him, \"I genuinely don't know what to make of this movie\". It was a nerve-wracking experience for Anderson but Kael did like the film and told others to see it. Anderson and Jason Schwartzman traveled from Los Angeles to New York City and back on a touring bus to promote the film. The tour started on January 21, 1999 and went through 11 cities in the United States.\n\nWes Anderson\u00b4s coming of age film \"Rushmore\" with the young/old misfit Max as the lead character is slowpaced, indie quirky and a bit too much Anderson to be honest in my eyes. The character oddness move along in some sort of slapstick universe that is not really funny, but more weird/strange with Anderson trying to create something different from a normal narrative and character development. I will give him credit for that. We get great performances from Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and lovely Olivia Williams, but the fact remains that the main character Max is an obnoxious little know it all, who is hard to like or for that matter hard to cheer for. And even if Anderson wants to be indie quirky he still falls in many stereotypical holes in his storyline. \"Rushmore\" is ok, but not Wes Anderson\u00b4s best work if you ask me.",

            "content": "Quirky, offbeat, and clever; everything we like about director Wes Anderson.  We really don't know what's going to happen as the story plays out, in part because of how unique the characters are, and in part because the film plays as fantasy.  Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a teenage boy at Rushmore Academy, acts as though he's a worldly middle-aged man, pursuing an improbably large number of extracurricular activities, writing plays, and not caring all that much about his studies.  Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a wealthy businessman dissatisfied with his wife's adultery and his two boorish sons, is drawn to Max, and befriends him.  However, when the two of them begin vying for the same woman (Olivia Williams), a rivalry develops.  \n\nWhat's fascinating about the film is the interplay of these two characters.  Blume begins acting in all sorts of juvenile ways, which is an interesting mirror to how precocious Max is.  The disillusionment Blume is going through, hammered home with a scene at his dingy, suburban pool where he does a cannonball after downing his whiskey and then stays underwater as it to escape from it all, is similar to the angst we might associate with an adolescent.  The breadth of Max's interests, his higher-level thinking about the important things in life, his audacious schemes, and the confidence he exudes pursuing a romance with a teacher or breezing down the hallway in his blazer, is like a powerful movie mogul (or adolescent dream).  Anderson gives us a humanizing bridge here between people at the age of 15 and 50.\n\nMixed in to all of this are lots of little moments that are funny or touching.  I loved the message that's delivered in a subtle way amidst the fun of the film.  Dream big, it seems to tell us; be brave, and don't be afraid to be different.  Following the conventional path may lead to outward success, but unhappiness.  It's telling to me that Max's father, a humble barber, is the most content character of all.  I think the love triangle went on a little longer than it should have, and it would have been nice to see more of Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), but it was nice that the film never fell into predictability.  Very entertaining.",

Jason Schwartzman is flat out hilarious on his role as a protagonist and is supported thoroughly by Bill Murray and Olivia Williams.

It's undeniable when you see an Anderson film.  \"Rushmore\" opened the doors for Anderson with the critics, and it is a great film.  The only problems are that it's a bit uneven.  It tells the coming of age story of Max Fischer through roughly four to five months.  His loves, his triumphs, his failures.\nThe film opens with the math teacher being asked about a math question so impossible that if any one of his students were to solve it, they will never have to open another math book for the rest of their lives.  The teacher asks Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) to take a crack at it, he puts down his newspaper and walks up to the board and gets it right to tremendous applause by his classmates only to wake up.  This sets the audience up to believe he is one of the most intelligent kids at the prep school Rushmore only to find out that he is one of the worst students at the school.  He is at risk of being expelled.\nMax may be one of the worst students but he finds a lot of time for extracurricular studies as either presidents or founder.  His ambition far exceeds his actual intelligence.  He is only fifteen and comes from a modest background.  His father is a barber and his mother is dead.  He got a academic scholarship to the school for writing a play when he was 7.  He impresses everyone he meets, including the father of his classmates named Herman Bluthe (Bill Murray).  Blume and Max become friends.\nMax also meets new teacher Rosemary Cross, a widower whose husband went to Rushmore years ago before meeting her.  Max develops a crush on her and soon, so does Bluthe.  The two then fight for her affection before Max is kicked out of school and she dumps Bluthe.  The rest of the film involves Max making up with Bluthe and trying to win her back for him while trying to make public school a little more like Rushmore.\nSeymour Cassel plays Bert Fischer, Max's loving father who is such an absolutely wonderful man that it's a shame he wasn't in the film more.  He supports his son through every endeavor and imagines huge things for him.  Even when Max drops out of school and starts to apprentice with his Dad, Bert still wants the best, but on Max's terms.  He may be overwhelmed raising a kid on his own, but he is such a great guy.\nThis film works not only as a great introduction to Anderson's style, but the starting point for the Bill Murray/indie relationship that would eventually land him his only Oscar nomination to date.",

The film is constant flowing from one scene to the next, held tightly together by a great story and protagonist.\n\nHigh recommendation for people who are looking for a light-hearted comedy.",

            "content": "With Rushmore, writer/director Wes Anderson beelines it out of Wes Andersonville toward a place that resembles the world you and I inhabit. In Wes Andersonville, individuals are quirky beyond recognition-sometimes overwritten into oblivion. Rushmore's lead character, Max Fischer, is a proud citizen of Wes Andersonville, but unlike the director's other films, this one features a lead character forced to assimilate with normal people. The results are pretty fantastic.\n\nThe film's title refers to the elite private school Fischer (Jason Schwartzman, in his film debut) attends. Rushmore is the most important thing in the world to Max, and as such, he shirks his studies in favor of extracurriculars like the Stamp & Coin Club, Calligraphy Club, Astronomy Society, Fencing Team, and the Rushmore Beekeepers. He also writes, directs, and stars in intricate stage plays.\n\nHis grades, however, are truly unacceptable considering he's attending Rushmore on full scholarship. Rushmore's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox), informs him he's on \"sudden death academic probation.\" In other words, if he fails one more test, he's out. This doesn't deter Fischer in his continued quest to make Rushmore the best place on Earth; In fact, he becomes more resolute after meeting and falling in love with a Rushmore elementary school teacher (Olivia Williams' Ms. Cross). But it's an unrequited sort of love, sadly, and his grand gestures draw the ire of Dr. Guggenheim enough that he's expelled.\n\nIt isn't hard to watch this film now and understand why Schwartzman has become a sort of muse for Anderson. Of all Wes Anderson's characters, Fischer is arguably the most \"Anderson-ian.\" It's hard to imagine him truly belonging anywhere, yet, where you expect him to be the butt of certain ridicule, he always ends up ruling his proverbial roost. It's a little preposterous, but because Fischer is the film's protagonist, we accept it. It's what we want to happen. What's interesting about it-and what ultimately makes Rushmore a success-is that the other characters are (excepting a few kooky quirks) believable. It turns Rushmore into a parable of sorts. Anderson is the wacky Max Fischer, and we're the \"real people\" who're won over by him. If only real life always featured an \"Ooh La La\" dance party...\n\nThere's another essential character in the mix-Bill Murray's Herman Blume. A wealthy industrialist, Blume takes a liking first to Max, then to Ms. Cross. It's his relationship with the latter that drives the bulk of Rushmore's hilarious second half. To this point in his career, Murray hadn't successfully pulled off a role like this before. Now, it's his M.O.-especially when Anderson is behind the camera. Here, he's great. He and Schwartzman have particularly good chemistry.\n\nA lot of Rushmore's humor derives from Max's attempts to put on elaborate stage plays, including the Vietnam story he shares with an audience of all the film's principal characters during one of Rushmore's climactic sequences. To say it's a highlight within the film is an understatement. This scene is-in terms of craft as much as acting and writing-a highlight within Anderson's entire filmography. Just ask Mr. Littlejeans (\"Best play ever, man.\")\n\nRushmore ultimately encapsulates everything Anderson supporters love about his films, and his detractors have better things to say about it than any other Anderson effort. It's the way he mixes his standard stylistic impulses with things normal people say and do that puts it over the top. Is it the director's best film? Not for my money. But it's arguably his sweetest and definitely one of his most watchable.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/rushmore-review/",

Anderson's approach to a typical teenage coming-of-age story, which focuses just as much on supporting characters as it does its lead, is a fresh take on a character who, unlike many coming-of-age protagonists, needs to realize that maybe growing up isn't something to be rushed. While it's not Anderson's funniest film, it packs plenty of laughs without ever losing sight on its sense of heart, and it's a tale that'll resonate long after the curtains close and the credits roll.",

            "content": "Being the film which established the career of Wes Anderson and put Bill Murray in the dramatic spotlight, Rushmore sounded like an innovative journey.\n\nRushmore was quite a polarizing film. There is no denying that it had its own version of brilliance, but the extent that the viewer embraces that is all dependent on how much tolerance they have for the iconic directorial style of Wes Anderson. As someone who finds his style odd in the wrong narrative and brilliant in the right one, I am someone who deciphers that it has polarizing results at times. In the case of Rushmore, I could feel true brilliance afoot.\nRushmore comes from long before Wes Anderson's massive budget ensemble cast spectacle films, limiting itself two a budget of $20 million. As a result, the man attempts to build all the style he can with what limitations come his way. And as a result, it is difficult to see them. The premise is a very oddball one as is the case with all of his films, and the fact that Rushmore is rooted more in reality than some of his more fantastical later works means that it can be difficult to fully embrace at times, but it was consistently entertaining one way or another. The narrative can prove all over the place at times because the many supporting characters are only lightly expanded upon and there is a very heavy extent of subject matter coming in from all directions. There is no telling where the story will go next because it is so full of surprises, even if not all of them are good. Yet even if the story can't always be perfect, the screenplay is full of very strong characters. There are essentially three main characters at the heart of the story who all have their own tale to share, and they are given a grand extent of the narrative each. The genuine dialogue in the film is also great because there is brilliant insight, clever wit and a style of writing so intelligent that it almost seems as if Wes Anderson has created his own language for the film. It is a brilliant combination of insightful academia and genuine character insight, smoothed into the everyday dialogue of the characters easily.\nThe style in Rushmore still manages to reach true heights of brilliance. Embodying the Wes Anderson vision with such tenacity, for better and for worse, Rushmore delivers it brilliantly. The loose narrative is a trademark of the director, but so is the incredible style of it. With a highly skilled ability to turn anything into imagery, Wes Anderson's film makes use of remarkably artistic manipulation of simplistic cinematography and gentle editing to go along with it. It finds life in every little detail of the scenery which is most impressive during the more bleak scenes where he brings colour into frames that are very heavily dominated by grey lighting The man's eye for imagery and mind for a brilliant script is what ties Rushmore together and makes the experience unforgettable. \nThe musical score is also terrific, further mystifying the experience by reinforcing its somewhat surrealist mood.\nYet perhaps the most gripping thing about Rushmore was the leading performance from Jason Schwartzman. For an actor making his debut, Jason Schwartzmen is the flawless embodiment of a truly brilliant Wes Anderson creation. So tenaciously dedicated to capturing every inch of the character, everything from his perceived perfections to his insecurities. To balance them, he captures a personality which remains so relentlessly direct on delivering everything on his mind regardless of how intelligent or ignorant it could be. He is incredibly direct, and that headspace is so tenacious that after the film I was left in a state of mind where I frequently found myself speaking in the same manner as Jason Schwartzman with everything I said. I too found myself speaking swiftly and honestly in a manner which was clear without changing my tone of voice. In the most literal sense of the word, that means I could feel the character. Jason Schwartzman's performance resonated with me so heavily, and he was able to create a character who was both awkward and yet sympathetic as well as dramatic and hilarious at times. He oscillates between the tones of comedy and drama while bringing a flawless delivery of Wes Anderson's script into play, so his performance is truly remarkable.\nBill Murray is also great. Though I'm more accustomed to seeing him work with Wes Anderson and in dramatic material, I can imagine how wonderful it would have been to witness the man take such a career turn back in 1998. Bill Murray retains some understated comic elements for his effort in Rushmore which bring in the laughter, but they are played into the film very sporadically so that it comes as a surprise. More of the time, he plays a dramatic spirit to the viewer which breaks free of his comic archetype extremely well. He established his comic nature as being his natural persona in countless films, but he does the same with his dramatic effort in Rushmore. His natural charm is a very ligthearted drama with a natural ability to bring comic life into unexpected situations, capitalizing on his best talents and some never-before-seen ones. Bill Murray is brilliant, succesfully sharing an excellent chemistry with Jason Schwartzman which proves to deliver both an exchange of dramatic wisdom between the talented actors as well as creating a comic chemistry where the two are able to bounce off of each other. Bill Murray's work with Wes Anderson in Rushmore can only be characterized by the final line in Casablanca, as being \"the beginning of a beautiful friendship\".\nOlivia Williams is also great. Capturing a natural level of sophistication in her role, Olivia Williams' charms easily trick audiences into falling in love with her in the same way Max Fischer does. Her genuine passion and gentle nature is so intrinsic to her that she is able to effectively stir up one of the most sympathetic characters of the story. She presents the source of much emotional difficulties to the main two male characters even though it is through no fault of her own, and her ability to keep her charm present through the lighthearted drama and comedy in the film brings a stronger sense of reality to the slight edge of surrealism in Rushmore.\nLuke Wilson is also a genial presence, and Stephen McCole's natural comic charm makes the experience funnier.\n\nSo though Rushmore has the stereotypical loose story of a Wes Anderson film with a lot of ambition to take in, the man's ability to create brilliant style as a director while backing it up with an intelligent script provides the front for a brilliantly atmospheric comedy-drama with impeccable acting.",

Schwartzman completely owns the screen as a hilariously original character who excels at everything extra-curricular but absolutely fails when it comes to his academics and his quick-witted and pompous attitude lead to some of the funniest moments in the film. Bill Murray is also excellent here playing a varied and somewhat villainous role that reinvigorated his career and started a long-standing friendship with director Wes Anderson and subsequently appeared in every film he's made. The story is very simple with unattainable love being the big conflict, but with Anderson's brilliantly quirky style and hilarious brand of dark comedy the bigger moments are the exchanges between the characters with flawless dialogue. Schwartzman's character Max also writes and performs in elaborate plays that use as many special effects as an actual film and these are easily my favourite scenes in the film; the ending Vietnam play is outrageous! Wes Anderson films are one of a kind and if you're a fan of his work or off-beat films in general, this is a must-see.",

I still don't like it as much as the other Wes Anderson works I have seen, but it was an interesting film with a very strong ending.  The acting was good and, while the cinematography is always good in Anderson films I feel like the camerawork wasn't quite as strong or unique to his style in this movie.  Also, the \"stakes\" weren't all that high for the most part - the only one who really had something to lose was Bill Murray's character.  Nevertheless, it was well-written with a good mix of humor and strife.  Love the scale of the high school production at the end.   Lots of good stuff here, including a superb soundtrack; though it didn't feel as true to Wes Anderson's unique style as the other films of his I have seen and the dark moments that do pop up are quickly squelched where they possibly could have been investigated further.\n\nGrade = 7.5/10",

            "content": "The best part about Wes Anderson's filmmaking is that none of his films feel the same but have the same quality to them. In Rushmore he has his quirky characters and colors for sure, but the story isn't like anything I've seen before. It follows the story of really bright schoolboy, Max Fischer, who uses all his potential towards extracurricular activities. The headmaster of Rushmore tells him that if he doesn't get his grades up they will throw him out of the school. This is the film that really glorifies Anderson's unique style of writing. You'll never see a movie quite like this anytime soon, it's goofy, it's romantic, it's sometimes hard to bear, and it's very VERY intelligent. His dialogue he writes for the characters always sounds really interesting and I'm always on board with the story due to their convincing speech and tones. This is also giving credit to the great performances by the leading cast. Jason Schwartzman gives a great performance in his first ever role and it's sure as heck a memorable one. Bill Murray didn't feel like he phoned it in this time and really paid off because his character was very charismatic and fun to watch as he was pit against the pretentious Max. The supporting cast is just as fun as the main cast because since they don't play as big of a role they can be as kooky as they need to be and still make the story seem relevant and on point. The two sons of Herman, Dirk, and even Margaret were really fun characters despite their limited screen time. Anderson really shines when it comes to overall character buildup and their change throughout the film. The characters all learn something and it never felt forced. However some parts of the film were slower than others and I partly feel that was just because there were so many details that had to be addressed that it just took a few scenes to explain what really would go down. This movie was really entertaining when it wasn't slow and it was quick with the punches and it felt exciting for a majority of the film. The soundtrack was phenomenal given the independent film setting and the quirky scene transitions. It just felt fitting. Rushmore overall is a solid effort by awes Anderson. It has plenty of laughs, a great cast, a very original story, and lots of great visuals. B+",

He creates his films the way wants them and through that he is able to deliver stories and worlds that are original and most importantly entertaining. Bottle Rocket was Anderson putting his foot in the door, proving to not just his peers and his audiences, but also to himself. That debut film has given him the confidence in his ability to write original and risky materials. Many would consider his sophomore film, Rushmore, as his magnum opus; and I can completely empathise to those who feel this way, but since I was introduced to his works during the recent stages of his career, my standards were shaped from it, therefore looking back at Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, I could not help but feel underwhelmed by its restricted and small nature.\n\nWes Anderson and Owen Wilson collaborate once more after Bottle Rocket to create Rushmore; the story of a young man named Max Fischer and his pursue of winning the heart of a teacher in his prestigious school, Rushmore. The film's ground-shaking complication occurs more towards midway through the film and its best to come into it blind, as Anderson's films are always more effective when he surprises us with a reaction or a situation that would often leave its audience with instant laughter. In comparison to Anderson and Wilson's debut film, Rushmore shifts its priorities towards characterisation and wraps the film's incidents around it. Bottle Rocket felt like it was trying to capture a much bigger picture, and its characters act more as drivers or guide in helping us get to where we need to go. Rushmore does the opposite, demanding the audience to participate in Max's journey and find the film's purpose within it; in short, it is the ride, not the destination.\n\nRushmore is a film that explores the necessity for class and sophistication. Max is an individual who believes that it isn't the core and fundamentals that makes one significant, it\u00e2??s the extra aspects of one's personality and experience that makes one stand out from the rest; hence the attachments he has for his school campus and the \"extra-curricular\" activities he builds or signs himself up for. It could also be a subtle facade he creates in order to hide the simplicity of his home life. His obsession of sophistication has led him to pursue the perfect woman. A woman like her is clearly perfect for him but his love for her has deluded him from reality, dismissing logic and foregoing other potential candidates. Anderson handles it in such a way that certainly feels distant at first, as the quirkiness of his character makes it difficult to relate to his insecurities and vulnerabilities. It was also difficult at first to empathise towards his attraction for Rosemary as the film never provides any obvious exposition. My second viewing of the film, made it much easier as I was able to push past the character's disguise and see more of what makes him human.\n\nPaternal relationships are bread and butter in a Wes Anderson film. I cannot say whether or not these fictional relationships are autobiographically based, or he simply just has strong understanding of the issue? Rushmore, aside from Bottle Rocket, is the more subtle film from Anderson that deals with this type of dysfunction. Max is clearly disappointed with his home life and the career path that his father has chosen, but it never becomes the central problem of the film; it lurks on the back of Max's mind, subconsciously affecting the reactions and decisions he makes. The father-son relationship dynamic mainly grows from Max's relationship with Herman Blume, a rich but sad man due to the crumbling of his marriage. Max's fascination of Herman is due to the inspiring stature that he brings to his appearance; this is an individual that Max ambitiously wants to be. Herman's interest in Max is due to the fact that he is the only one that truly appreciates him, listening and finding value to the words that come of his mouth; and that is all he really wants anyway, but since his home and family life is not willing to provide that, he had to find alternative individuals who could meet his needs. Eventually the dynamic shifts and the two individuals become more like peers. From there, the relationship becomes more mature and hilarious but also emotional elements begin to surface. The film's latter half is certainly more effective because of this shift in dynamic, allowing the audience to see more behind the film's three central characters.\n\nRushmore is both a visual and audible delight. Anderson, with a higher budget, has improved the film's cinematography in order for the audience to gain a closer look to his intended vision. He and his long-time collaborator, Robert Yeoman, has opted to use wider lenses in order to fabricate that sense of oddness to its characters, making it easier for the audience to be accepting of their quirky personalities and the reactions they give to particular situations. It also allows Anderson's trademark symmetrical centred shots to be conveyed in a more effective way. The film's childlike and escaping musical score, composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, helps emphasise that sense of class that the film is trying to achieve in its protagonist and his environment. His score also helps in softening the film's themes, allowing them to come off as accessible and only with a hint of comedic darkness to them. The film's garage rock and folk inspired soundtrack were certainly more effective here than it was on Bottle Rocket. It gives the film that edge that would eventually be lost in Anderson's future films.\n\nThe performances in this film were enjoyable, but nothing spectacular or amazing. For a debut role, this was an impressive one by Jason Schwartzman. He was able to balance the character's child-like and adult tendencies, allowing the role to feel complex and human, but under Anderson's direction he allows the character's idiosyncrasies to be highlighted. It is always wonderful to see Bill Murray in a role that is outside of his trademarks. Murray allows his character to become vulnerable, which he does so well, and through that I was able to buy into the character during its emotional and thematically heavy moments that mainly takes place during the film's second-final act. I have already seen Murray at his peak, which was Lost in Translation, and what he brings in Rushmore only scratches the surface of what he could bring. Then again, his role here does possess more comedic qualities than his magnum opus role; and in Rushmore he is under the direction of Anderson who leans towards the deadpan sensibilities when shaping his characters. Therefore, I shouldn't complain too much.\n\nRushmore is an improvement in all aspects from his debut film, and provides a step closer to the director's full potential.",

I felt the comedy was maybe\nnot massively funny but when it is funny, it pretty much is laugh out\nloud and coupled with the more dramatic parts, it is very fun to watch.\nThe middle part of the movie is very fun, you will see what I mean if\nyou see it but it at times can be very enjoyable to see it all.\n\nThe main big performance here comes from Bill Murray and his very funny\nbut different than usual acting display. Murray seems to blend his\nqualities in humour with a way of acting like a slob to create a\nmemorable character who eclipses others in the film. Jason Schwartzman\nis the actual main actor here and he is pretty good to say he is so\nyoung and a crazy character who is unlikeable at times, Olivia Williams\nis also steady as the teacher in which she plays a pivotal role within\nthe film.\n\nWes Anderson's quality script is one of the shining lights of this film\nand his vision of this high school movie is seen out so well along with\nthe performances. I liked the directing also but another massive\npositive behind the cameras is well, the cameras themselves in the\ncinematography which is at times maybe a bit strange but mostly is\nbeautifully shot and just simple scenes without much meaning are done\nreally well to say this isn't a film that had to do such things.\n\nCriticisms wise it doesn't have loads but the lack of comedy I think\nhits it, as said it is hilarious at times but a few more strong jokes\ncould have and would have scored it higher. I wasn't too keen on the\nlapsing end of the movie where you can feel it has no ending in sight,\nit does finally end but it may make you slightly confused and possibly\neven bored with it. It could be said it is too short but it just about\nsqueezes out what it wants to get out.\n\nI think teens yes may like it but everyone can certainly love it, it\nhas that quirky style so many cult films seem to have and I believe\nthis can be just that. If you like Bill Murray's style of comedy then I\nwill actually say you could not appreciate him here but he brings\nsomething new and it really shows off by the end. It actually can be\npretty sweet as well at times so if you want a fun quirky and at times\na sweet film, this is exactly your type of film.\n\nOverall I give this a low 8/10 and it is Firmly Very Good movie, not quite\nGreat or Excellent but nevertheless very highly scored. With this you\njust have to sit back and enjoy the stuff going on throughout, couldn't\nrecommend it more to most film fans and I imagine some will love this\nmuch more than I did, and I enjoyed it. One more thing to add, it can\nget kind of busy in the middle and not confusing but mixed up so bare\nwith it and it will pay off for you in the end.",

It's in its own defining way a coming-of-age film for a little amount of time.\n\nThe film opens like it's behind the curtains, and we're at the titular private school. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman at his acting debut) is an eccentric student with a unique characteristic of being the school's smartest scholar by overdoing elaborate extracurricular activities as his main focus than his studies and caring a little about his grades for some reason. He soon goes downhill when he fell in love with a teacher Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams), and started doing everything he can to catch her heart. But before that major distraction from his usual stuff, he befriended a company owner Mr. Blume (Bill Murray).\n\nMr. Blume wasn't having a good time such as having dissatisfactions about his company, and having frustrations upon his wife and spoiled sons.  Max represents the positivity of Mr. Blume's life, until the two unfortunately started following this line against each other for the attraction of Ms. Cross: \"all fair in love and war.\" So Mr. Blume represents the man Ms. Cross prefer than a youngster - the negativity side of Max's life: rejection and no appreciation, next to distraction. But instead, they only sabotage each other's luck, which led to nothing.\n\nJason Schwartzman made a really good debut for an actor with such performance he'd done in this film. Next to him is Bill Murray who also performed well.\n\n\"Rushmore\" is a good treat like any other Wes Anderson films. (B+)",

When I first watched it I found it pretty irritating, but eventually it grew on me and it became my favorite movie. Don't believe? I got the movie poster on my wall to prove it. Now I love all of the movies of Wes Anderson.\n\nNow on to the actual review. Rushmore is a fantastic quirky, coming-of-age picture that has a good story and stars Jason Schwartzman in his film debut and the very funny Bill Murray. At first this movie irritated me because of its quirky, off-beat, dry, subtle humor that I just wasn't use to. Now I've got the whole concept of it and I love it. Wes Anderson creates something beautiful and special here with Rushmore. It's a wonderful comedy about Max Fisher who attends Rushmore Academy and loves to make up a new club practically each week. Until he is on sudden-death academic probation and if he doesn't shape up he'll be kicked out of school. He also befriends Herman Blume, a melancholy millionaire and father of twins who are in Max's class. They both share a mutual love for a first grade teacher, Ms. Cross (played by Olivia Williams) and fight for her affection. The whole concept of it is just like a Roald Dahl book that Roald Dahl never wrote. Rushmore is a wonderful dramedy with mighty fine performances from Schwartzman and Murray. Anderson and Wilson show that they have a knack for cockeyed humor. Rushmore is beautiful, funny movie about adolescence, betrayal, love, and disillusion.",

Jason Schwartzman plays Max Fischer, and over-involved prep student who falls in love with an elementary teacher named Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams).  Of course, this does not happen without controversy and the interactions between him and other characters are often hilarious.  Under the wing of Herman Blume (Bill Murray), Fischer tries to excel at love and life.

A 15-year-old boy without the slightest notion of proportionality supposed to measure the ways of a teenager in his age when getting along with other people. He treats old-timers and youths as if they were all his equals, endowed with fearless bravura and propelled by his creative and enterprising wits. His hyperbolic character leads him to casually spark a friendship with a much older industrial man who builds admiration for the boy's pseudo-adult attitude. Both of them eventually find their hearts beating for the same woman, a beautiful teacher in Rushmore school, where Max... doesn't study. Each one will try to win the teacher's love in his own way and naturally the romantic mechanics between a bold 15-year-old boy and a woman with the competition of an even older man mixed in is a recipe for bizarre and hilarious situations throughout. I enjoyed very much the theater play scenes, they gave another quality and vitality to \"Rushmore\". In a way, those scenes highlighted the evidence that there's a clear contrast between what can be real and what cannot, the difference between reality and fiction. Reality is not utopian like fiction, nothing happens out of pure will. Anything demands effort, patience and sense of proportionality. Everything comes in its right time and has its own place. A lesson that young Max Fischer has learned by the end of the film.\n\nWes Anderson likes to fantasize with people, seems like he is trying to capture some precious unobtainium underlying human relations and psyche. He plays with personal and social limits. There's usually a somewhat eccentric character, or group of characters, who have to endure against ordeals to reach the desired goal or redemption. Personal development is a common theme in Wes Cinema. Prominent attention is given to small gestures, either manifestations of affection or contempt. Younger people are an important part of the social mechanics and adults can't get away from giving satisfactions to youths when these so demand. In fact, children have almost adultlike maturity and social skill. This particular point is source of great amusement for me, but it's subtle. Max Fischer is that taken to the limit. So far, Wes movies have left me with the feeling of a bittersweet spell hovering over all human relations. They're sweet movies in an unreal way, but although it's artificially crafted sweetness, it feels natural and organic. Everything flows coherently in a mannerist way. The acting could be better, but it's not too distracting. \"Rushmore\" is smartly written, technically flawless, engaging, emotionally powerful and super fun! I burst into laughter on almost regular basis, I love the way how Wes constantly throws in snippets of humor to keep a smile on my face. Flavored and tasty Cinema. Wonderful cinematography and Olivia Williams is a goddess! I enjoyed \"Rushmore\" very much. Recommended!",

For me, it's going to Rushmore.\"\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums has always been my favorite Wes Anderson movie and I always thought it was because it was the first one of his that I had seen, but it can officially move over now because I have a new favorite: Rushmore. This film was so charming, the soundtrack so cool, and the characters so well developed that I was completely in love with it once the credits started rolling. Not only is it my favorite Wes Anderson film, but it also belongs on my all time favorite list as well. I am a sucker for coming of age stories and this was a great one with perhaps one of Anderson's best developed characters from all his filmography: Max Fischer. All of Anderson's films have a similar style with offbeat and quirky themes and a hyper reality where the characters sometimes resemble those we imagine in our heads when we are reading a fantasy book. At times they are hard to connect with because they seem to belong in another time and place, but Wes manages to draw us into his world kind of like in the same way we are drawn to a theater play. That is why I also loved the special touches from Anderson as he incorporates school plays with wonderful productions into his movies. I think Rushmore is his most complete film with a charming ending, a memorable odd couple pairing, and a weird love triangle that features some of Anderson's most romantic work (similar in that sense to Moonrise Kingdom). As much as I enjoyed his first film, Bottle Rocket, it was Rushmore where he truly defines and finds his style with those production designs that seem taken from a stage play or a colorful children's book (especially seen in the scenes where Max visits the principal's office). I absolutely fell in love with Rushmore and this will be the measuring stick for Wes Anderson's films from now on.\n\nThis wonderful and witty screenplay written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson begins with a dream sequence where Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is in math class solving an extremely difficult equation and thus saving his classmates from ever having to open a math book again. His friend, Dirk (Mason Gamble), awakes him just before a millionaire industrialist named Herman Blue (Bill Murray) is about to begin his chapel speech. He has two sons in Rushmore Academy, one of the most expensive and prestigious schools in the country. Max is fascinated by this man's speech and so at the end he introduces himself to Herman and the two form a special bond together. Max is in love with Rushmore and his entire life revolves around the school and he finds in Herman someone who has achieved the success he's aiming for, while Herman is a disillusioned man who has lost his purpose in life and sees in Max someone determined who enjoys life. Up to this point one would think Max is the perfect student, but the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox) explains to Herman that he actually is the worst scholarly student due to his involvement in dozens of extracurricular activities (such as being the editor of the school newspaper, president of the chess, astronomy, beekeeping, and French clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play). Unlike the rest of the students, Max isn't a wealthy kid, his father Bert (Seymour Cassel) is a barber, so he's a scholarship student that is about to lose it due to his bad grades. Max and Herman's friendship is tested when they both fall in love with the widowed first grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). This is were the thin line between friends and enemies begin as Max and Herman begin a feud over Miss Cross.\n\nWhat makes Rushmore stand out above other Wes Anderson films (I have liked all of them) is the great pairing of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray's characters. Both of them, despite having completely opposite personalities, complete each other because they see in each other what they want to become. Max aspires to be successful in life and doesn't want to become a barber like his father (that is why he always lies about his profession), while Herman despite having it all is completely disillusioned with his marriage and spoiled children. Max's passion for life is what captivates Herman because it is what he has lost. This bond is broken once Rosemary enters the picture and they both become infatuated with winning her love. Max will do anything for her, including building a giant aquarium in the school's baseball diamond or directing a successful play. Max is my favorite character despite not being entirely likable, while Murray's portrayal of Herman is sensational. He delivers one of his best and most memorable performances and shines in each scene he shares with Max or Rosemary. There are several hilarious lines and quirky moments that also balanced out perfectly with the more subtle emotional and romantic ones. This film has a lot of heart and Anderson really delivers here with his unique style (a lot of his trademarks can be found here like the slow-motion and wide angle shots, the inclusion of at least one Rolling Stones song on the soundtrack, the underwater shot, and the influence of the Charlie Brown cartoon). It's an inspired film and Anderson creates a unique world that at times seems distant from reality, but somehow he manages to create these rich characters that are easy to identify with or relate to in such a way that they manage to touch us without being overly sentimental.",

Wes Anderson is great in the director's chair, using his visual style to aid with the narrative in the story, and he and Wilson craft a hilarious and intelligent script that make this 100% entertaining.  The acting is great, and the debut of Jason Schwartzman is no exception, especially when alongside Bill Murray, another collaborator, and a comedy great that shows that he has a thing for independent films.  The chemistry between them is undeniable, and it proves to be a worthwhile \"bromance\" if you think about it (probably not though).  Bill Murray proves to be amazing in his role, and has an Independent Spirit Award, and a Golden Globe nod to prove it, even if it restrains him a little bit, although it does give audiences a more mature role for Murray.  A must-see, and proof that shows that independent films are in the rise, and that independent films could be better than mainstream films.",

            "content": "I simply had to see this 1998 comedy-drama directed by Wes Anderson about an eccentric teenager named Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman in his first film), his friendship with rich industrialist Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and their mutual love for elementary school teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). Somehow I missed it at the time (my life was crazy while I lived in Canberra) but after watching it today, I think that if I watched it at the time, I would love this piece co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson. And I loved the music - the soundtrack was scored by regular Anderson collaborator Mark Mothersbaugh and features several songs by bands associated with the British Invasion of the 1960s.\r\n\r\nWith this movie the careers of Anderson and Schwartzman were launched, while Bill Murray established a \"second career\" - as a respected actor of independent cinema. I liked his acting in this movie but I like Wes Anderson work even better. They both won Best Director and Best Supporting Male awards at the 1999 Independent Spirit Awards while Murray earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture. Anderson and Wilson wrote the role of Mr. Blume with Bill Murray in mind, but doubted they could get the script to him. Luckily, Murray's agent was a fan of Anderson's first film, Bottle Rocket, and urged the actor to read the script for Rushmore. Murray liked it so much that he agreed to work for scale, which Anderson estimated to be around $9,000. Murray liked the neat and precise writing and felt that a lot of the film was about the struggle to retain civility and kindness in the face of extraordinary pain. And he stated that he felt a lot of that in his life. Anderson created detailed storyboards for each scene but was open to Murray's knack for improvisation, and that is how the winning formula worked.\r\n\r\nAccording to ShortList, it is one of the 30 coolest films ever... but, I really had a problem with the unconvincing make up and costumes through the first two thirds of the movie, especially for the main character. Well, nothing is perfect... it is important that Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson successfully created their own slightly heightened reality... Like Max Fischer, Wilson was expelled from his prep school, St. Mark's School of Texas, in the tenth grade, while Anderson shared Max's ambition, lack of academic ability, and had a crush on an older woman ( just for record - Anderson and Wilson began writing the screenplay for Rushmore years before they made Bottle Rocket). For both of them the thing that was most appealing was the initial idea of a 15-year-old kid and a 50-year-old man becoming friends and equals. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's time for you, like it was for me, to check out this artwork with deep-focus widescreen compositions possessing an unusual clarity that adds details enhancing plenty of the action constantly developing and adding vividness to be remembered. Enjoy the humour as well!",

Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray give amazing performances. The script is well written. Wes Anderson did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the humor. Rushmore is a must see.",

            "content": "Rushmore is a flat out quirky, odd-ball comedy that people familiar with Wes Anderson should be familiar with and enjoy. Great performances from Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman help create great tension and subtle comedic moments between the two throughout the film. Anderson focuses on friendship on human relationships throughout this film as Murray's character is a disconnected and jaded character who is still likable and understandable to an extent. \n\nThe Camerawork is what one would expect from Anderson; Perfectly symmetrical and thoughtful which is incredibly artistic and a pleasure to view while not being overly pretentious in the overuse of these shots. \n\nThe end result of Rushmore is a feel good film that made me want to go out and watch more Anderson films as this film felt nostalgic for some odd reason.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson is one of those directors that you either love or hate. His style is very quirky and very kid-like. All of his movies in one way or another have a storybook feel to them, which is one way that makes his movies constantly watchable. I have noticed that the biggest turn off for people is the way how the dialogue/jokes are structured and the style of comedy and that is a shame because at the core of Wes Anderson's movies is something special but hard to explain. I personally can't see how Anderson's movies can't be enjoyed.\n\nAs for the acting, it is pretty good. Just about everyone in this movie are or still extremely popular today which helps this film age well, even though it isn't that old. Definitely worth it to watch.",

This film did not disappoint. Coming-of-age stories are pretty cliche, but this movie tells it in a whole new way. It's not always pretty, and you may not always be rooting for the protagonist, but that's what makes it interesting. On top of having a great story and direction, the acting and editing are superb. I really can't say much else about it. It's a solid comedy with fascinating characters and a lot of heart. If you're like me and have gone on too long without seeing it, make some time to give this one a watch.",
