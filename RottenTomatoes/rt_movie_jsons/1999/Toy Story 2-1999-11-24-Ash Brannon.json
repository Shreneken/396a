I could find nothing wrong with that. The script was just as irreverent and witty as the one in the first film, with jokes that adults will enjoy as well as kids. And the song When She Loved Me was beautiful and vital to the story.\n\nThe voice talents are also faultless. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are brilliant here as Woody and Buzz, but they were equally brilliant in the first too. Wayne Knight was also fine as Al, who kidnaps Woody to sell him to a museum. Joan Cusack was great as Jessie, though I do agree she has been better. Frasier's Kelsey Grammar is resoundingly entertaining as Stinky Pete(what a great name!). Solid support also from Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jodi Benson(Ariel from little Mermaid)and Annie Potts.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic film, that has enough visual jokes(like Wallace and Gromit) to satisfy adults and kids alike. Rock- solid entertainment that thoroughly deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox",

From what I said in the first two reviews, the biggest problem I had with both Toy Story and A Bugs Life is that the stories are a little too simple and there are no real emotional moments. This movie is where those moments finally come into play. I am of course talking about Jessie's backstory, which made a majority of kids cry, including me when I was younger. Speaking of Jessie, the new characters that are introduced in this movie are great, the highlight being of course Jessie and Bullseye. If I truly had to nic pic one problem, it's that the Prospector (Stinky Pete) feels like a really lousy excuse for a twist villain. It just felt like the people at Pixar and Disney (I think they bought Pixar at this point but I could be wrong) said \"so there's a villain in this story right?\" Basically, it felt last second. However, this doesn't hurt the quality of the film at all. I remember Stinky Pete as not being too annoying, which I can't say for future villains by this company (cough, Incredibles 2, cough). Anyway, I love this movie, and chances are, you do too. Is this possibly the best animated sequel ever? Go to Disney+ and see for yourself!",

The animation is an improvement from the first movie and the story is actually better than the first film. I just find this one a tad bit more engaging. This time Woody is apparently a rare collectors item. He had a Tv Show called Woody's Round Up Rodeo. And was a really hot toy at the time. He finds this out after trying to save an old penguin toy named Wheezy from a garage sale. When he saves him though he gets taken by a guy name Al. When he finds out about his show, two new characters Jessie, and Bullseye tell their story of why Woody should stay with them. But of course he wants to get back home to Andy so there's tension between all of the characters. Toy Story 2 is to me the best out of the four. As much as I enjoy the first one I just thought that this one had more character growth and a whole lot of depth. I just had a lot of fun with this movie and I honestly think that this is my favorite sequel out of the Toy Story franchise. 10/10",

The plot is really smart, the animation is brilliant and the humor...Oh man! The last 50 minutes must be the most fun 50 minutes I had in years and believe me, I'm NOT exaggerating. It seems impossible to imagine the fun the writers must have had, because this is a true film-fest whether you do like Disney-esque films or don't.\n\nHaving this fast-paced storyline, John Lasseter & Co. exploited it to a maximum. Cameo's from Pixar-characters (Geri's the coolest), unexpected and obliged references to other big films (really love the Jurrasic Park one), great new characters (Wheezy!!), and more jokes and gags rammed in an animated feature than you'll ever see and of course the out takes.\n\nThe action-department is also greatly represented in some astonishing sequences with great, original shots and angles. The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.\n\nO.K., I know I'm raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the \"Vote\" button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.\n\nA few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel. Second, the still somewhat jerky animation of the humans (I know they said it was supposed to be, but I disagree that). And third: the ratio, 1:1,85 (I thought it was the theater, but Pixar is forgiven, seen the quality of the film.) These are minors things and my decision is final, Toy Story 2 is certainly included in my top 20.\n\nO.K., now you may stand up and ring a friend to go and see it, come on!!",

            "content": "Find the love of playing with your childhood toys again.\n\nPixar's Toy Story 2 (1999) is a masterfully told children's film for kids and their parents alike. John Lasseter's direction is warm and nostalgic as he reminds you how you felt playing with your toys through the eyes of the toys themselves. It's a neat trick that works wonders with feelings of nostalgia, affection, and a carefree attitude that lets Toy Story 2 endure as the peak of this family franchise. Lee Unkrich's swift editing and steady pace make Toy Story 2's 92 minutes fly by like a passing memory. Sharon Calahan's cinematography matches emotional close-up with cute wide shots that allow the audience to better empathize with these toys from their viewpoints.\n\nAndrew Stanton and John Lasseter's script is full of hilarious jokes that kept me laughing loudly all the way through Toy Story 2 with adult humor, quaint references, and silly scenarios for the kids so that the entire family can laugh heartily along with their humor. I especially appreciate how heartfelt the story is with the narrative being about Andy the toy owner aging into a teenager growing up and making space for adult things in his room, so his toys go unplayed with suddenly. Toy Story 2 acknowledges the passage of time and how people just don't play with their childhood toys anymore at some point in their lives. I love how Woody gets abducted by the greedy and greasy Wayne Knight character Al the Chicken Man.\n\nRandy Newman's score is more mature and tender than his sentimental and slow music for Toy Story. He refines the sound here so that Toy Story 2's score is really memorable and affecting. I love the song that plays during Jessie's backstory flashback. I still tear up during that part. It's such a beautiful sequence that Toy Story's creators keep ripping it off for the sequels. That is riveting storytelling as you see Jessie's life as a beloved toy to a donated cowgirl doll all set to tear jerking music.\n\nTom Hanks has never been as thoughtful or as affectionate as Woody. Woody has to make a serious decision for himself and his friends and Hanks delivers a genuine voice acting performance that really holds up. I must mention Joan Cusack's performance as the adorable sounding voice actress for Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl. She is sweet, Southern, and devastating as the likable new love interest for Woody. She turns into more of Woody's companion, even though I think they should have made Jessie Woody's girlfriend as they have more in common compared to Woody and Bo Peep. Annie Potts' Bo Peep still sounds alluring, loyal, and affectionate towards Woody. Bo Peep is sadly mostly forgotten in Toy Story 2, but she's still a key character in Woody's life. I guess they thought it would be cute for Buzz to like Jessie. Tim Allen is still funny as Buzz Lightyear, as he even gets to show another side to Buzz that I like.\n\nKelsey Grammar kills it as Stinky Pete the Prospector and secret villain for Toy Story 2. His motivations to want to be seen by children in a museum is relatable enough, while Grammar's voice acting is deft and entertaining. He is a great foil for both Woody and Jessie. Wayne Knight's shady villain Al McWhiggin is so funny. I laugh at every single line of Knight's. Writer Andrew Stanton cameos as the voice of Buzz' archnemesis The Evil Emperor Zurg for a very funny Star Wars parody throughout Toy Story 2 as a running gag.\n\nDon Rickles is funny as the jaded and pessimistic Mr. Potato Head with the outrageous Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head. Jim Varney sounds adorable as the loyal dog Slinky Dog. Wallace Shawn is perfect as the paranoid and panicky Rex the Green Dinosaur as a parody of the ever growing gamer community who is socially inept. John Ratzenberger is hilarious as the meta humor loving Hamm the Piggy Bank. John Morris and Laurie Metcalf are excellent as Andy and his mother. R. Lee Ermey still cameos as the efficient and serious Army Sarge. \n\nJodi Benson, of Ariel in The Little Mermaid fame, is fantastic as Barbie! Jonathan Harris has a sweet cameo as Geri the Cleaner, who mends Woody in a cute scene tributing those that take care of their toys as well as Pixar's legendary animated short film Geri's Game. Lastly, Joe Ranft is so cute as the little helpless toy Wheezy the Penguin.\n\nIn short, Toy Story 2 is a wonderful childhood favorite of mine that truly holds up to this day.",

This time the roles of Woody and Buzz are switched. Buzz is on a mission to find his partner who was stolen by a toy owner, who is looking to make a big score off Woody.

The story is much richer and thematic as well, we learn more about Woody's past and he is challenged as he goes over whether he should go back to Andy or go to the museum. The movie pours a lot of thought into the dilemma and you start to believe he might be better in the museum due to the dark future he has ahead of him. It's just amazing.

The way that it is told is fantastic. This also includes one of the best songs ever in a animated film, Jessies' song \"when she loved me\" the way that story was told with that song almost brings tears to my eyes every time I watch this film. Again the voice acting is superb here, including Kelsey Grammer as Stinky Pete, man was born for that role. I just love spending time with these set of characters. Well done Pixar once again. \n ",

I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.\n\nTom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.\n\nThere are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.\n\nThe other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.",

Re-telling the first story, or teaming up the good guys and the bad guys from the first one to fight some new bad guy that no one cares about. The best sequels dig in to their source material, and ask tougher questions than the first did. And Toy Story 2 is one of the best sequels of all time. Pixar start a trend here, and continue it with their 3rd iteration, of seeing how far they can push the themes of the films and still have them qualify as family films. How much will kids ignore or overlook as long as there's Woody and Buzz and the gang on screen running around? Because this deals with some tough choices. Will Woody choose to go home with Andy and eventually be abandoned (as demonstrated by Jessie's incredible, achingly sad flashback), or will he go to Japan to be on display forever? Is it better to love someone knowing that you'll have to deal with lows as well as highs, or is it better to keep yourself on a shelf, avoiding the lows but never experiencing the highs? This is some heavy shit. But the tone remains because of the strong supporting cast getting more to do, the strong, characterful animation is just as characterful, and the comedy which continues to get laughs (having new Buzz join the team is a masterstroke). For me, it doesn't quite hit the highs of Toy Story 1, but that's no insult. As Woody learns, there's no shame in being number 2.",

Screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin and Chris Webb.\nStarring all the original cast alongside with Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Wayne Knight.\n\nThe movie takes a place after the landmark 1995 computer-animated blockbuster, but this time Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz and his friends set out on a rescue mission to save Woody before he becomes a museum toy property with his roundup gang Jessie, Prospector, and Bullseye.\n\nI loved the first TS movie, I think it's one of the best animated movies of all time, though I didn't give it an A+, but grade is not everything. Anyways TS2 is a very rare sequel that took the success of its predecessor and added something on it, yeah, it has the same pattern of the first one, a toy is lost and the others are looking for them, but as I said, they added something on it, and it definitely worked!\n\nTS2 is my least favorite of the franchise, though I think it's an amazing sequel to an amazing movie, and there are many reasons why this movie is so good, let's see:\n\nAs I said the movie was like the first one a little bit, the concept itself, but it added something more, every toy from the first one here was involved at the searching for Woody, they weren't just watching from the window. And they took their screentime, and they were hilarious. The movie has some very cool Easter Eggs, some are easy to notice and some aren't, but still hilarious.\n\nThe movie also has a more of a plot, not like its predecessor, only a couple of toys trying to find their way home, no! This time a character has a back story, that effects the whole movie, and adds more depth to it!\n\nIt also has an amazing animation, which is still, to this very day, timeless! IF you didn't like the animation in the first one, or you think it wasn't that great, you will definitely like this one! The movie also has a very sense of humor, but the first one was funnier to me. The characters are so charming once more, and there are some new characters, some don't have that much of screentime, but some has a lot.\nWoody and Buzz once more are the best part of this movie, their friendship inspired me as a kid, and it keeps inspiring me til now! And that's a great thing about this movie, it works, once again, for kids and adults.\n\nThe casting choices are once more, brilliant, all of them were so much alive, you never feel like they are just cartoon characters, the actors added so much live and depth to their characters!\n\nThe plot is so good, the first one was simple, but this one is a little bit deeper and with more storytelling, but still not perfect, some scenes didn't make sense. I know, it's a movie about talking toys, there's one scene in particular that didn't make sense at all, spoilers ahead, if you haven't watched TS2!\n\nAlright, the scene when Woody was trying to get his arm from Al, the Prospector turned on the TV and put the remote under Jessie's box, and she didn't notice AT ALL!\n\nBack to business, another flaw bugged me a little, is the Prospector's character, he didn't have any motivation to do what he did, I mean he hates humans and he doesn't want to me played with, he didn't get abandoned by someone before, he only saw Jessie and heard her story, and that's really it, I know he doesn't want to get abandoned, but it wasn't enough for me.\n\nThere are my only issues with this movie, otherwise that was great movie, and some said it improved on the first one, for me.. no, but I understand why do they think that.\n\nToy Story 2 is once again impressive and charming, with amazing animation and good sense of humor, and an entertaining adventure for all ages! I'm gonna give Toy Story 2 an A! If you haven't seen this one, go check it out, it definitely worth your time.\n\nThank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of Toy Story 3.

Do children become too old and grow out of playing with their toys, or do figurines like Woody grow too old to still be played with without their getting easily damaged?

            "content": "Creating a sequel to a successful and beloved film is hard enough at the best of times. It is even harder to do this when the film in question is not only groundbreaking as a children's film, but also a key pillar in the history of digital animation. In making a sequel to Toy Story, John Lasseter and his PIXAR team could neither just reproduce the same graphical quality with a different story, nor retell the same story with better production values, a la Evil Dead 2. Any sequel worth its salt would have to do both.\n\nThis in itself makes it impressive that Toy Story 2 ever got made at all; the original was such a high water mark in animation that it would not have been considered foolish if PIXAR had put up their hands and said \"we can't top this\". But when you take into account both the tortuous production saga before its release and the series' role as the jewel in PIXAR's crown, the idea of it being as good if not maybe better than Toy Story shifts from the impressive towards the inconceivable. But here we are, with a sequel which both improves on and compliments the first film, and which is a masterpiece of animation in its own right.\n\nI have continually stressed in my reviews the importance of not judging a film by its reputation - whether it comes to us with a bulging entourage of awards, or dragging behind it the stench of negative press. This is, admittedly, very difficult in the internet age, where the amount of information we have to process is inversely proportional to the time which we have to process it before forming opinions. But as I stated in my review of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the context under which a film was created cannot in and of itself determine whether the film is good or bad: \"arguments and constant pressure can produce great creativity, while bonhomie and relaxation can lead to disaster.\"\n\nToy Story 2 was originally conceived as a straight-to-video project. With the bulk of the company working on A Bug's Life, the film remained a small-scale side project for some time - until Disney's enthusiasm for early rushes in November 1997 led to it getting a theatrical release. What followed was an intense and back-breaking effort to not only finish A Bug's Life but to reshape and extend Toy Story 2 in time for its release in 1999. Numerous horrifying events befell the PIXAR staff as they raced to meet Disney's deadline; animators were diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome or repetitive strain injury, one animator's baby was left in the back seat of his car for a whole morning, and the film was almost lost when one employee accidentally deleted 90% of the files (fortunately, another employee had a backup).\n\nThe first thing that must be said about Toy Story 2 is that it had no right to be this great given the circumstances under which it was made. It is the animated equivalent of Apocalypse Now, in the sense of being able to pull something terrific out of what to outsiders would seem a total disaster. One could use it as an argument for quick production schedules: what Nicholas Meyer called \"short order cooking\", referring to his experience of rewriting Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home mere weeks ahead of shooting. But while the concept of fast production has demonstrated its benefits, this argument both supposes that this was always PIXAR's intention and implies that liking the film stems merely from admiration at its efficiency, when there is so much more to it than that.\n\nFor starters, the film's visual landscape is not only brighter but bigger in scope than the original. There's a real sense of world-building here, not just to show off the technology but to give a genuine sense of scale to the character's decisions and accomplishments. The opening sequence alone is sublime, with its deft nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey and 1950s B-movies, but every new location used is beautifully realised with distinctive colours, carefully planned geography and great lighting. This also means that the visual humour has more room to play out, such as the sequence with the traffic cones or the riff on The Empire Strikes Back in the lift.\n\nJust like Toy Story itself, the humour and bright visuals of Toy Story 2 serve as the perfect counterpoint to a story which is, if not dark, then very melancholy. Where Toy Story took the concept of toys coming to life and brought the issue of abandonment along for the ride, this is very much a story about fear of the abandonment, ageing and obsolescence. The characters are coming to terms with their own mortality - shelf life, if you will - and have to make difficult decisions about how they should be remembered, and about who has the right to make those decisions.\n\nIn this respect, there is a comparison with the Harry Potter series, with the outlooks of Harry and Voldemort mirroring those of Woody and Stinky Pete. The latter clings to a dream of immortality; his lack of love in early life leads him to avoid at all costs the long, slow 'death' of being in a box or on a shelf, just as Voldemort's loneliness and inability to love led him to see death as a weakness and cling onto life by any means necessary.\n\nWoody, like Harry, comes to accept his limited time on this Earth, saying that he \"wouldn't miss it for the world\", whatever may (or may not) be waiting for him after Andy is too old to play with him. These are deep existential questions to which the film is alluding, showing its different characters' responses as a way of exploring not just the nature of our masters but how we respond to our time and purpose in life, and who chooses that purpose. It it rare to find this level of intelligence in a children's film, and even rarer to find such issues approached so subtly through a great script.\n\nThe script also makes a good fist of 'the Buzz Lightyear issue'. The dynamic of Woody and Buzz in Toy Story worked, at least in part, because Buzz's delusion about his true nature was both funny and humanising; by the time he snapped out of it, they had become firm enough friends to hold the rest together. The problem is this: how do you replicate the stakes of the first film without simply retreading old ground? The two Buzz solution is a very neat way around it, allowing for humour while also spacing out the different parts of the action very nicely.\n\nThe voice cast in Toy Story 2 is all of the highest calibre. Buzz Lightyear remains the one bright spark in Tim Allen's largely disappointing filmography, and Tom Hanks is still the perfect match for him as Woody. Newcomers Kelsey Grammer and Joan Cusack are a great deal of fun, with the former drawing on the frustrations present in Frazier to bring a humane darkness to the character. And there's plenty of good work from John Ratzenberger, Wallace Shawn and the late Don Rickles as Hamm, Rex and Mr Potato Head respectively.\n\nToy Story 2 is a tremendous sequel which remains one of the finest achievements in Western animation, and may be the crowing glory of PIXAR as a studio. John Lasseter's direction is flawless, supported by a cracking cast, a beautifully written script and visuals which are gorgeous to behold. Whatever the future of the series holds, and whatever PIXAR do in the years to come, this will still stand as one of the best children's films ever, as well as one of the late-1990s' brightest gems.",

It's an absolute marvel from start to finish, a film that not only checks all the boxes but touches you on every level. I found myself laughing way harder than someone should've after multiple watches. Is it perfect? Maybe not, but it's damn close.\n\nIf the animation was groundbreaking in the original movie, Toy Story 2 surpasses that by taking it up to new heights. Spectacular doesn't even begin to define it. Colors are more vibrant. Movements are more crisp. The attention to detail in every single frame is unreal.\n\nSuccess also comes from a number of clever moments sprinkled throughout the film. In one scene, the gang is driving a toy car down an aisle being led by Barbie while Rex is chasing after them. He gets closer and closer to their rearview mirroring a very similar moment in Jurassic Park. It was terrifying in the dinosaur film, but hilarious in this context.\n\nWith such a fun film, you never expect your feelings to get caught up in it but they do. You feel heartbroken for Woody (Tom Hanks) when Andy feels he has to leave him behind while Andy goes to Cowboy Camp. Woody was so excited to be chosen to go and he's devastated when Andy decides to leave him.\n\nI can't think of anything to dislike about the film as a whole. It's a fun ride to remember about a toy trying to find himself and his place in the world. You'll love everything from the old characters to the new dog who is just plain adorable. Welcome to my All-Time Top Ten, Toy Story 2. Hope you enjoyed the stay, Safety Not Guaranteed.  We have another well-deserved 100.",

It all looks fantastic and better than some of what we're getting almost twenty years later. Again, the voice cast is all kinds of great, led by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. One thing a lot of sequels do is introduce new characters, which can be hit or miss. Well, they all hit in this film. Jessie (Joan Cusack) is one of my favorite characters in the franchise and the voice work on her is among the best. Plus, there's the incredible backstory we're given for her, which results in one of the most emotional moments in animated film history. I thought the natural progression of the story moving into what happens to toys when their owners get older was perfect. Jessie's story perfectly sets up what Woody decides to do, as well as what the eventual third film focused on.\n\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any.\n\nOverall: One of the hardest things to do is create a sequel to a great film. There's so much riding on living up to the original, yet Toy Story 2 knocks it out of the park by being another phenomenal movie. This is my favorite of the incredible trilogy.

            "content": "Ah, yes, the olden years. What can possibly go wrong? Okay, so after I reviewed A Bug's Life, now I guess it's now the time for me to review a sequel which is my second favourite Pixar film, Toy Story 2. Why? Because right after the olden years, I have been a huge fan of the first Toy Story. Now with the sequel though, me and my friend Harry Kingston have been quoting all the lines in one day. Much like I reviewed The Jungle Book though, we've been quoting all the lines from these two Disney films non-stop. Oh, boy, I really do love animation! Right then, Buzz Lightyear again played by Tim Allen, is on his mission to find the Emperor Zurg right in the fortress. Whilst he find a battery, he found Zurg and defeats him but didn't and you can see that it's only a video game that Rex is playing. Woody, once again played by Tom Hanks, has got a ripped arm which is about a couple of minutes cause Andy has been playing with his toys, so he got shelved and started having a bad dream. As he wakes up, he found Wheezy the squeaky penguin and found a yard sale outside but was interrupted because Andy's mum coming to pick some old toys and took Wheezy with her, so now Woody had to get him back and was taken away by Al who works at Al's Toy Barn. As Woody is in the room where the unexpected toys are in here. One is Bullseye, second is Jesse played by Joan Cusack and third is Stinky Pete. As Woody don't know them but they do because they knew him from the TV show. So Buzz and the other toys, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, and Slinky Dog, (which again portrayed by both actors) set off on the adventure to save Woody. Now as they're watching their TV show, Woody told them he has to get to home but Jesse got upset about it. As Al went to the room, he saw that Woody has lost his arm which is a funny scene. Now the funniest part though is that Woody tries to get his arm back but the TV is unexpectedly on. OK, there are some funny moments in this which I remember. Buzz and the gang found Al's Toy Barn and hide in the orange cones by walking the road and Buzz says ''Drop!'' and ''Go!'' everytime the car or truck gets by. The old man comes to fix Woody and his arm and like AL says ''It's just like new!'' As Buzz finding Woody, he saw a toyful of Buzz Lightyear's like himself and the other Buzz confronts him and drop him in the box and he gang comes across the Barbie store. As Woody know that Jesse is not happy after Woody is happy to get his arm back, Jesse remembers the flashback about that she was someone's favourite toy. As Woody go to leave, he decide to stay and Jesse is happy. So Buzz and the gang still looking for Woody, they heard Al coming, they went into Al's bag. Buzz had found the gang cause he saw Rex's tail and catches up with them but couldn't but did before Emperor Zurg is here. So as Al didn't take his bag, Buzz and the gang had to get out of the car and found an hole of the building and heard an earthquake which is an elevator and Buzz and the gang had to climb up to it. As they found Woody, they stop Jesse and the others and got Woody but was interrupted by the other Buzz Lightyear letting them reveal that he is the real Buzz Lightyear. Buzz told Woody to get back home but he didn't want to and decided to go with Jesse, Bullseye and Stinky Pete so they left. Woody watched the TV show and revealed that Andy is in it and changes his mind and decides to go with Buzz and the gang and told Jesse to go with them and Bullseye but Stinky Pete locks the thing and Woody found out that he is a baddie and got interrupted by Al who is late. So Buzz Lightyear and his gang were confronted by the Emperor Zurg and Buzz fights him and him and his gang go on the taxi where the alien from the first film is in and rides off. That's an awesome scene since I was a kid. As they're here they hide and go to the suitcase fortress to find Woody and Stinky Pete was defeated and now Woody, Buzz and Bullseye had to rescue Jesse. As Jesse is saved along with Woody, they go home and Andy is happy to be back home and find new toys. And now Woody and the gang are home and reunited to infinity and beyond Oh, and Wheezy has been fixed cause he got his squeaker back. Oh dear lord God. I have been watching loads of animation and this back in the older years and me and my old friends from old school had been non-stop quoting. That's what we all love to do. I have been watching Toy Story 2 on BBC 2 back at Grandad Bill's caravan after me and my parents been watching the first Toy Story back at Whitby. I think all the animated films are all on BBC 1 and 2 and I know all of the Disney classics and Pixar films by heart. Every scene, every quote and every song. There's also outtakes at the end of this film and they're are so funny I've been laughing at Stinky Pete farted in his box. This is an amazing movie. Really is just awesome all the way through. Much like Toy Story which is awesome, both films are really awesome and that is Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are all great films. Definitely good as each other. Yes, I know it's too much words and sentences to put out but that's just why I love watching animation and my friends quoting all the lines in every dialogue with me.",

The way I see it is a dull installment compared to the other two, but again, that doesn't mean it is bad. Just like all of the other Pixar movies, it has amazing visuals, very talented voice cast, and great story telling. Albeit not as great as Toy Story and Toy Story 3, but still is great nonetheless. Plus this movie certainly has its memorable moments such as Jessie's backstory. With that I give it 8.5 out of 10. Great movie, but compared to the other two movies, and also other Pixar movies, it is a bit dull.",

            "content": "Toy Story 2 (1999) - is not only just as enjoyable as it's predecessor, but I personally think it's even better. Everything that the first Toy story started has been brought up to the next level in this amazing sequel.\n The ideas and themes the concept tackles are done with great care and it perfectly balances the creative ideas with moments that really bring out the drama of what some of the characters go through. The many places our characters explore are made very grand and epic as this movie goes further with putting the toy's in many different scenarios that are fun and quite inventive. One second they might be cruising through Al's Toy Barn and another second they might be running through the baggage handling system at the Airport. Each scene is timed out perfectly and it gives us a lot of time to establish everything the movie throws at us. This is also the first time that I think Pixar really nailed the Blended effect of Creative fun and Impactful Heartfelt emotions. While their previous movie's sustained a number of elements to keep us coming back for more, I believe that this movie was the first time I felt that they perfected a formula that really emphasized what Pixar was really cable of. \nThe characters have still retained the charm that made them lovable in the first movie and the new characters work just as great with adding more layers to the world of Toys. Buzz and the rest of the Andy's Toys work on the comedic side of the adventure while Woody's side of the story is more down to earth and add some great world building when diving deep into how a toys feel about their owners. Jessie is a great example of this because her tragic backstory really shows the tragedy of being abandoned and what an effect it had on her. Other new characters like Al, Bullseye, the Prospect and even Emperor Zurg also bring their memorable mark in the movie and add more building blocks to the franchise. \nThe animation has noticeably improved from the first movie and it manages to improve many of the awkward bits that didn't look very appealing the last time. The textures feel more realistic and the animation on the humans is more natural and appealing. The environments feel more immersive and huge thanks to the update in technology and every place the toy's visit is always made adventurous and epic. The thing that captured my attention the most is the attention to detail they put into the woody's Roundup sequences. The look of the show really resembles the style of an old 50's show and the puppet animation is superb.  \nThe Music is once again helmed by Randy Newman. He uses the same style of Nostalgic like violin tunes while adding some new scores that really help drive the emotion of every scene regardless of the feeling. This is also the first time that Pixar hired an actual artists to record songs for their movie. \"Riders in the Sky\" sung a few songs for the movie, one of them being the theme for Woody's Roundup. It works well when combined with the style of the Tv show. \"Sarah McLachlan\" sang a song for Jessie's backstory called \"When she loved me\" which is done beautifully and really emphases the emotion of the tragedy of Jessie's owner growing up and moving on without her.\nAlthough the first movie was a great start for the series I think this movie really captivated The emotions and pathos of a toy's point of view with heartfelt moments, great new characters and a great blend of Creative ideas with relatable emotions. It's an outstanding movie that has everything I believe an animated movie should have and it's definitely one of Pixar's finest. (A+)",

The voice acting is great, each actor really shines in their roles. The \"When She Loved Me\" scene is pretty emotional. Perhaps it ain't got nothing on the Carl and Ellie's relationship but it's still sad. Hell, even Tom Hanks and Tim Allen admitted to crying to that scene. It also has more laughs than the first film with some enjoyable jokes and slapstick to go around for everyone. Hard to think that this was Pixar's first sequel from a time when they were known for making original, beautifully animated, stories that were critically lauded. Then Cars 2 came along and Pixar's perfect world came tumbling down. But anyway, Toy Story 2 is one of the rare sequels that lives up to its predecessor. Maybe one day, Pixar will make a sequel as good as this one. Hopefully, Incredibles 2 will be the one. Not that I think Toy Story 4's gonna suck, mind you.

This film takes the same amazing characters and throws them into new situations and makes them face new challenges. They also introduce new characters like Bullseye, Jessie, and Mrs. Potato Head. All serve as great comedy and Jessie's story provides a lot of heart. There was also a TON of Star Wars Easter Eggs with the Buzz Lightyear versus Emperor Zurg running gags. Just a little extra fun thing the film makers added. Not spoiling anything, but the climax had me on the edge of my seat. It was very thrilling and exciting.

Not only does this film up the ante in terms of plot and character, but it hits on a much more emotional level as well.\n\nWoody and Buzz are back, and Woody spends a large amount of the film dealing with the thought that Andy will grow up one day (hearing horror stories from newcomer Jessie). He is caught between two worlds; the temporary world of Andy, and the permanent world of being put on display. This is what makes the film better than its predecessor; its willingness to make the audience feel guilty about toys they used to play with.\n\nLet me reiterate: this movie mad me feel bad about not playing with toys more, and I'm in my late twenties!\n\nThe stellar voice cast from the previous film returns, along with some new faces. Joan Cusack really sells Cowgirl Jessie, playing a truly three-dimensional sidekick. Kelsey Grammer is great as Pete, and Wayne Knight is great as Al.\n\nThe movie is once again riddled with excellent humour, both verbal and physical. It also has a lot of Star Wars references, which cracks me up. There's even a bit of fourth wall leaning by Piggy Bank. Finally, the end credits do something I thought impossible: bloopers. For an animated film. Fully rendered. As though the toys themselves were actually acting. Sheer genius, Lasseter, sheer genius.",

(pro) in the first film Woody and Buzz where at Andy house, Sids, and Pizza Plant. Now that i fee was not even a world span. in Toy Story 2 we are all over the world which i like because we are not swished we are all over. we could of been to japan if i am right. \n\n2) Jessie (pro) ok we know the 2 main characters, but we meet Jessie i love Jessie but woody i could be with forever just to talk to him over Jessie. i do like Jessie style of outfit which makes her different form the other toys. \n\n3) the villain. we know the villain stinkey peit if i am spelling that right  SP was a hard villain to beat because he was very pervasive with woody.\n\n4) buzz. (Pro) buzz in this movie is one of my favorites in this one because he was trying to save woody from the salesman which risk his life on a road and buzz is very smart and woody too but i think they showed how buzz is smart and they did that very well \n\nToy Story 2 is getting 5\\5 stars because its has a better heart than the first one and a awesome villain and the new characters",

Woody and Buzz are still just as bright and intelligent as the first, with Buzz taking most of the stand with the intelligence. The new characters are of course instant memorable ones, and Andy still has his joyful and love-for-toys spirit. Pixar simply does it again with a very impressive storyline and creativity for a sequel (and also for their third full-length movie ever made).",

            "content": "Toy Story was a revelation. Despite being the first fully computer animated feature film, the movie refused to get bogged down in the technical innovations, preferring instead to create an amazing world with a fantastic story, memorable characters and challenging themes, especially for a children's film. So it's pretty easy to say that Toy Story 2 had quite something to live up to. \n\nDue to a mix-up/abduction at a yard sale, Woody is on his way to being sold to a museum in Japan with the rest of the Woody's Roundup gang. Buzz and the toys decide to get Woody back to Andy's room where he belongs but it's not going to be that easy. \n\nIt takes all of a few seconds to realise that the idea of this sequel flailing in its predecessor's shadow is patently ridiculous. The first scene alone has dozens of geeky in-joke references ranging from Star Wars to 2001 A Space Odyssey, brilliant animation and action sequences which rival anything that the first film had to offer. However, it was never a competition between the two, as they both work together perfectly, the second being a natural progression of the first as the toys come to terms with the fact that they are transitory; that one day, they will break. This grim reality doesn't so much dampen the mood of the film as much as it informs the atmosphere to a large extent and because of this undeniably darker focus, the film is able to connect emotionally even more than the first was able to do in some cases. \n\nDon't think that this tone robs the film of its joy, however. In fact, Toy Story 2 has all the self-referential, geeky asides that the first had and then some. Evil Emperor Zurg telling Buzz that he is his father? Check. Woody interpreting a ridiculously long and complicated message from the few squeaks of a woodland animal? Check and check. In fact, the jokes come thicker and faster than ever before, a lot of them whizzing by without pomp or circumstance, only really registering on the second or third viewing. Jokes like this are normally reserved for adult comedy movies, and even then they aren't usually as fast and furious as they are here, more proof that anyone saying that animation is for kids is a fool. \n\nThe character development on display here is simply fantastic. Where the first dealt with Woody's inability to be anything less than the most popular toy in the room, this film deals with his realisation of his own mortality; not dying specifically, more being used up or forgotten by his owner once Andy outgrows his sheriff. To showcase this point, Jessie the yodelling cowgirl is introduced as one of the members of the Roundup Gang. There is an inherit risk in introducing new characters who aren't villains, the problem being that they may not be as endearing as the creators hope they are or connect with the audience in a real way. Jessie begins as the tough-as-any-guy, outspoken one and at first there's the real risk that she won't progress any further than that. But there's a moment in the film which has a real case for being the most emotional of the entire series, the third instalment included, where Jessie tells Woody her life story. Cue the sprinklers. It's touching, tragic, but most upsetting of all, recognisable. The connection here isn't just Jessie's abandonment but the feeling that you may have been responsible for this as a kid. It's a heartrending moment and establishes Jessie's place in the audience's hearts forever. This boldness exhibited by the writers who clearly believe that children can handle the tough stuff is a belief which has become something of a trademark for the Pixar brand, tackling complex issues, themes and relationships in all of their movies with the simplicity and sincerity which is exemplified here. \n\nIt's this ability to both connect and communicate which sets the Toy Story series apart in the animation world. As well as having the claim of being the first CG animation ever, the Toy Story series has managed to consecutively outdistance its competitors with heart and emotion combined with a rapier wit. This is, of course, disregarding the astounding innovations in the technical side of the film which, despite being potentially mindblowing, are merely a medium for the story. What could have been an excuse to indulge a novelty has become an integral part of countless childhoods and a landmark in animation. \n\nDefining Scene: \nIt has to be Jessie's lament. Instructed by our brilliant narrator Randy Newman with the dulcet tones of Sarah McLachlan, the piece is as bold and earnest as any live-action movie has a right to be.",

            "content": "The first film that I remember watching in the cinema is toy story 2. We got the cinema late which meant that we had missed 10 minutes of the film. I was upset at the time but it didn't bother me that much because it was a toy story film that I had been a fan of for a long time. I love that the toys always have a plan to save one another no matter what the situation is. The scene that always gets me is the Jessie scene because it shows how a child could think that a toy is the best thing and then grow up so quickly that they forget about them. I know this may sound weird because I was only young then but that scene and the scene where woody says that we may not know how long we have with Andy but they don't want to miss his greatest moments showed me that I wasn't going to be playing with toys again and I would forget about them which made me not want to grow up but it was true that we all grow up and forget about the things that made us kids which is great to have a film like this to remind us that there is a kid in all of us.\n The scene that I remember the most from watching this film in the cinema for the first time is the scene where they are at the airport. I think mainly because it was always fascinating how they sort out baggage in airports for some reason and when I watch monsters inc, I think of this scene because the door scene is similar to the airport scene.",

            "content": "As most people have come to realize, movie sequels are usually inferior to their predecessor, especially for animated movies. And with a new animation studio doing a sequel to a film people enjoyed so much, I'm sure a lot of people were very skeptical about it, especially since this is only their third film that they've done. Thankfully, this film did just as well as the first one, both critically and financially. I'm sure we can all agree right now that it's on the same level as the original.\n\nBut from my standpoint, I think TOY STORY 2 is even better than the original! It does everything that made the first one so good and pushes it to the next level. A similar concept but with a whole new twist, very interesting dilemmas, more fun and memorable characters, better animation, a lot of great jokes, and a very fun adventure. And all of it seems to work perfectly. All of our favorite characters are back and they still have their charming personalities, but they also introduce new characters who are just as likable and even more interesting.\n\nAfter Woody gets stolen from a toy store owner, he meets and befriends a group of toys: Jessie, Bullseye, and the Prospector. They are a part of a collection that Woody is meant to be a part of. Learning about this, Woody is now in a predicament about whether he should return to his owner, or if he should be a part of the Roundup Gang and be displayed in a museum where children can adore him forever. That's a very tough decision. The Prospector makes valid points that he shouldn't go back to his owner because Andy is in fact growing up and will eventually stop playing with him and be forgotten. We also learn that Jessie as well had an owner who played with her all the time, just like Andy, and has forgotten about her overtime and was eventually donated. And this emotional scene is only done with visuals and music. The line that Jessie says after that scene really gets me, \"You never forget kids like Emily or Andy... but they forget you.\" I almost want to cry at that scene. By the way, it's very rare for me to cry in a movie.\n\nEven the surprise twist that (SPOILER ALERT) the Prospector is the villain isn't a needless plot device. Yeah, we've seen this cliché done a million times, but here, it makes sense. He doesn't know what it feels like to be played with, he never had that experience. So it makes perfect sense for him to enforce the other toys into going to the museum. That desire to be adored by children forever is so strong with him, and he's not going to let that taken away from him. I've been wondering why people see this movie as their least favorite of the franchise, the writing in here is absolutely ingenious.\n\nBut this is not just a character driven movie that deals with Woody's predicament, the adventure that all the toys go through is relentlessly entertaining. They have all of these creatively fun ways to find their way to Woody. They cross the street by hiding under traffic cones causing a traffic jam, going through various aisles is the toy store where Buzz meets another Buzz (everything with him is hilarious), climbing up the elevator shaft, going down the elevator shaft where they encounter the evil Emperor Zurg, driving in a Pizza Planet truck, going through a luggage handling system, and escaping a plane that's taking off. It's a ton of fun to watch. Also, the animation has already gotten a lot better since the last movie. Most of the textures and the movements work off really well and still look good to this day.\n\nReally, everything about this movie is done perfectly... literally up until the very last minute. It's not the moral they give, I love that. They say even though you will have to face the inevitable, just enjoy the fun while it lasts. That's a great message. What I don't love is why the little toy Wheezy sings \"You Got a Friend In Me\", and in a completely different voice. I mean, it's a nice way for them to end the film with a happy musical number for us to have a good feeling as we leave the theater. It just felt very contrived as this movie was in no way a musical. But it's a nitpick.\n\nThis movie could've easily been a cheap cash grab as we thought they couldn't possibly top the original. If you didn't know, this was originally meant to be a direct-to-video film, but then later decided to release it in theaters. But the creators knew people loved the first TOY STORY and they put all of their effort into this movie to make it as good as they can, and it really paid off. Another childhood favorite of mine and easily one of Pixar's best films.\n\nGrade: A+",

It had the charm and humor of the original, with the returning likes of all of the toys from the first, while introducing a lot of fun and new characters, including Pixar's first surprise villain character. It did a great job at picking up after the first movie. It's still hard to believe this was meant to be a straight to VHS movie back then, because it still feels like a theater quality movie in my eyes. This movie really expanded the toy's adventuring through a giant world they're not meant to adventure through. In the first, they mostly were in either a house, a house across the yard, or riding in a car, or on an RC car even. But this movie took it even further, this movie wasn't about 2 toys returning to their owner, it's about many toys trying to get back 1 toy, from locations they're not even aware of. In the first movie, their missions were pretty familiar, it's like they knew where they were, and where to go, the only problem was escaping from a mad kid's house. In Toy Story 2, they chased down a missing friend, while having no idea where the place they're looking for is, which causes them to travel through many bizarre places for a group of toys to encounter, like speeding highway traffic, a giant toy store, an elevator shaft of a giant apartment tower, and even an air port, and luggage cargo of an air plane. It did a great job at giving what made the first one special, and it managed to expand it, without going too far. It also through in some funny movie nods to the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jurassic Park, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and more.",

With even better animation, a much broader scope of adventure, funnier and memorable character moments, heart crushing themes, brilliant music score and one of the biggest emotional punches to the gut ever put to celluloid make Toy Story 2 not just a great sequel, but a great movie. Easily one of the best, nay, THE best animated movie, ever made.",

            "content": "After the success of Toy Story (1995), a sequel was inevitable, but it nearly went straight to video, yet Pixar decided there was enough interest to put it in cinemas. However, it was a troubled production, and the story didn't work originally, and despite Disney claiming there was nothing wrong, Pixar redeveloped the entire film in under a year. You'd think it would be a mess, it wasn't, it's a moving, funny and awe-inspiring sequel, showing Pixar at their most inventive. It's been a few years since the events of the first film, and after Woody (Tom Hanks) has his arm accidentally ripped by Andy (John Morris), Woody is left on a shelf, and when trying to save squeaky penguin Wheezy (Joe Ranft) from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is stolen by nasty, greedy toy collector Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight). Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) recruits Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) to rescue him. Meanwhile, Woody finds that he's a collectable toy from a TV show called Woody's Roundup, he meets fellow toys Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer). It's a brilliant film, and it's a sequel which, despite the rushed production, manages to care about it's characters, and even puts some thought into the story as well, which Pixar has always managed to do with their films.",
