            "content": "The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

From the setting (an idyllic coastal New England town literally named \"Rockwell\") to the messages (bombs are bad, you choose your destiny), there's so much for both children and adults to enjoy here. The dialogue is excellent \u2014 I especially enjoyed Mansley (Christopher McDonald) and his line concerning Hogarth's (Eli Marienthal) name. The \"duck and cover\" film in school is a nod to the absurdity of the time. The \"Space Age\" is one of my favorite motifs of American history, which the film showcases with the Giant's (Vin Diesel) pose in front of the burger-joint billboard, Hogarth's toy gun, with the character of Earl Stutz (M. Emmet Walsh), the fisherman who sees the Giant's descent from the sky, and, of course, Superman. The movie is paced phenomenally well, packing an exceptional story into 87 minutes. Nothing's wasted. Giant's \"attack mode\" is also completely badass. The ending is one of the greatest of all time, for any more genre, ever. I don't know if 1999 really was \"the best year for movies,\" but The Iron Giant is one of the statement's pillars, for sure. It had been a very long time since I last viewed it, and I still adore this movie.",

            "content": "The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films ever and holds up to this day. The storytelling in this movie is phenomenal with it tugging on your heart and knowing how to make small details feel powerful. Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies made an almost perfect script. Yes, there are few lines that don't hit and seem out of place, but the amount is very small compared to a lot of other films. It is such a simple story that anyone can connect with, yet the filmmakers take the film to such heights that there are a lot of deep emotions planted into it. The voice cast also does a very good job in the film with each person in the cast making the character their own. Eli Marienthal never gets annoying or feels like he needs to get everything his way like some other kids in animated films. Yes, Hogarth has wants, but he never comes off as whiny or annoying. Harry Connick Jr. also does a great job. At some points you can tell that it is Harry Connick Jr. voicing Dean, but his voice fits the character and the design of Dean so well that it doesn't really affect the viewing experience. James Gammon also really makes his character come alive which is accompanied by a great character design and fun animation. Speaking of the animation, it was quite good. I found all the character designs to be very nice with a lot of fun gags that were enjoyable to watch. There are some iffy shots mainly with The Iron Giant as sometimes he looks flat and not three dimensional. Plus, there are some blurry shots and some color issues. The only reason I point this out is that this film had a bigger budget than a lot of the other animated films that were released during its time which shows that it wasn't the best quality. While I am nitpicking, I do want to say that some scenes felt a tiny bit empty. I think the sound design and score were slightly off. The score from Michael Kamen falls a bit flat sometimes and doesn't quite capture the excitement and thrill of what is on screen. The sound design is also off in some scenes with certain sounds not sounding like what it should be which sometimes led to it drowning out the dialogue. Even with those nitpicks, the film can still stand greatly above a lot of other animated films. The script is so well-done and really makes a simple story have deep meanings that will surely leave an impact after the viewing is over. With some great character designs and a stellar voice cast to bring the script alive, The Iron Giant really is a piece of art that needs to be witnessed by everyone.

            "content": "The movie I'm reviewing is called \"The Iron Giant\". The movie came out in 1999 and written by Brad Bird.  The main actors in this movie are Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal, Harry Connick Jr, Jennifer Aniston, and Christopher McDonald. This movie is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.  \n\nThe movie takes place in a town called Rockwell. The key characters in the movie are Hogarth, The Giant, Kent, Dean, Annie. In the beginning of the movie, it shows a sailor in a storm and sees a lighthouse, the lighthouse turns and reveals a figure with to glowing eyes like lights. The next scene is our main character Hogarth going to the diner his mom Annie works at, Hogarth also meets Dean at the diner. Hogarth is at home watching a movie when his power goes out and decides to check it out, and he finds an electrical substation. The Giant almost steps on Hogarth and begins eating the metal and electrocutes itself but Hogarth shuts it down and saves him. Kent Mansley is an investigator that finds Hogarth's BB gun and tries to find enough evidence on The Giant to send the army after him. Hogarth hides The Giant at Dean's Junkyard. The Giant goes beast mode because he thought Hogarth died and begins fighting the army back. Kent launched nuke at giant directed at the town, and The Giant sacrifices himself to save everyone.  \n\nThis movie has a lot of good messages in it. You are who you choose to be. The whole movie shows us that The Giant was designed to be a planet destroying machine, but he slowly becomes more human like and understands emotions and, in the end, does the ultimate sacrifice for the ones he cares about. This is one of the reasons why I love this movie. \n\nThe only thing I disliked about the movie is Kent Mansley, Hes not a bad character but he's kind of like the antagonist of the movie and it does a good job to get the viewer to dislike him. \n\nThe movie is really good and I don't want to say much about it because I think you should watch it for yourself.",

I had no idea that a classic animated movie outside of Disney from the 90's would be so great, but this truly is Brad Bird's first and best movie he's ever directed! As a kid, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was my favorite movie of all time, but as an adult, The Iron Giant trumps any other movie in existence. This movie may not have a specific target audience, this movie may be way less popular than Wall-E, and this movie might have not been a box office hit, but easily anyone can enjoy this movie and just have the best time ever. My overall opinion: 10/10!",

I don't always agree with the viewpoints in Bird's movies but I wholeheartedly agree with his anti-gun violence rhetoric & the existentialism has a permanent place in my heart. Growing up I thought the sad part of the movie was that the boy was prevented from keeping his pet robot; as an adult I find it sad that the robot's willpower was not enough to avoid his true nature.

No movie has made as much of an impact on me as this one, and it truly is the only movie i know that absolutely deserves to be called a flawless masterpiece.

A 100-foot-tall robot crash lands on Earth and is discovered by a young boy (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who befriends him and teaches him to be good, not evil (\u00e2guns kills\u00e2?).  It is cute and often beautifully animated (taking place in Maine with lovely fall foliage).  When the robot gets hurt, his various parts are able to crawl back together to rebuild him. With the help of a beatnik artist (voiced by Harry Connick, Jr.), Hogarth (the boy) successfully hides the Iron Giant from the American authorities, specifically the CIA agent Kent Mansley (voiced by Christopher McDonald) ... for a time.  Soon they discover that the robot has been designed to defensively destroy anything that attacks it (with laser weapons of the future) and soon the US Army shows up to do just that (believing it may be a Russian attack).  In the end, for all its violence (including an atomic bomb which scared my 6-year-old), I felt a rather hard-to-miss Christian theme \u00e2\" after all, the robot dies for our sins (and may be resurrected, which reassured everyone).  Setting this aside, the film\u00e2(TM)s message that it is better to be good than evil and that guns/violence are horrible is worthwhile indeed.  Still, my 9-year-old gave it only 2 \u00c2 1/2 stars (\u00e2too boring\u00e2?) but the younger boy was much more impressed (4 stars).  I enjoyed it a lot, particularly for the early scenes where the robot is learning about its environment and some silly humour.  Yes, it brought a tear to my eye but I\u00e2(TM)m a pushover.",

It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds \"someone\" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English?

But the \"something extra\" that it has is that it is about more than the story.  Like all good sci-fi, it is not really about alien robots - it aims to tell us something about the human condition.  \n\nThis is a movie that exists for the denouement.  The whole movie sets you up so that you care about the characters and then at just the right moment, one word can have a powerful impact.  Like when the Farmer says \"that'll do, pig.\" in \"Babe\".   The whole movie existed to set up that wonderful moment.  \n\nIn \"The Iron Giant\", the word is \"Superman\".   It brings together a theme that runs through the movie - we all get to decide who we are going to be.  Our actions define us, not where we come from or anything else.  We get to choose.   So \"Superman\" hits like a ton of bricks when delivered at the perfect moment.\n\nThis movie is fantastic for the story telling, the characters and the wonderful message delivered so powerfully at the climax of the film.  The five critics who said that it isn't a good movie have got to be nuts.  If you don't like animation, or sci-fi, I can see how you might not enjoy this film. But if you are a reviewer of films, there is no rational excuse for failing to see the excellence on display.",

Such animation features are always a passion projects which is clearly visible in here and is also the primary reason why it creates the impact like on other usually does. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like cinematography, background score and editing. The animation speaks volume more than the words in here and as far as the script is concerned, it may follow a familiar format extracted from the textbook formula, but is undeniably an effective, impressive, charming and emotionally beautiful feature. \n\nTim McCanlies and Brad Bird; the screenwriters, have created a cozy and warm environment that is perfectly balanced on delivering the entertainment to both, its younger and older audience. Brad Bird; the director, is on his A game for the emotions projected in here creates a deeper impact on the viewers and connects with the frame to frame with his brilliant execution skill and a knack for pleasing the viewers through its amazing visuals and camera work. The voice given by the actors seems apt especially by Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, Jennifer Aniston and James Gammon. \n\nThe Iron Giant is giant at heart that resides within a childlike relationship among two individuals that just like the protagonist, seeks for its own parts in bits and pieces.",

            "content": "A Childhood Classic!\n\nBrad Bird directed an absolutely delightful children's movie. It has charm and character thanks to the clever writing and lovingly crafted. Even though The Iron Giant is from 1999, it holds up thanks to its hand drawn animation. Bird pays tribute to Richard Donner's Superman and Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial with The Iron Giant. It remains a wonderful watch for families everywhere. I recommend The Theatrical Version instead of The Signature Edition that only adds one unnecessary scene.\n\nThe casting is incredibly spot on for the voice actors. Eli Marienthal is believable as the thoughtful child hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is so sweet and real as the mother. Vin Diesel is so likable as The Iron Giant. Harry Connick Jr. plays the kindly Dean with a sincere care rare in voice acting. Finally, Christopher McDonald is perfectly hateful as the government agent Kent. I really think this vocal ensemble is some of the most apt voice casting ever.\n\nThis is a fast paced, short movie that will captivate you. It has a lot of laughs and sweet character moments. It builds a realistic world that you can believe as Maine in 1957. The themes of compassion and understanding are universally relatable. The moral parables of using empathy and choosing goodness are important to learn for any child. It even teaches children about death and mortality in a thoughtful and gentle manner. I implore parents to show The Iron Giant to their kids.\n\nI urge audiences to watch The Iron Giant. It is an animated classic.",

Because some things simply fly over the heads of the youth that's why it's so much fun to watch such films again a few years later when you can enjoy them again with a completely different look, but it was still presented interesting enough that he aroused the interest of one.\n(PS: For a change we have a movie without a villain but just people with different opinions and views) \n\nI'm pretty impressed with love, music and animation. I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different.\nThis topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days.\nIf you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a \"PG-13\"? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.\n\nBrad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher).\nAs a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *.\n(Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing\nbut not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)\n\nI have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.\n\nHowever, my heart always is.\n\nThis is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life.\nUnfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.\n\nI thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard.",

            "content": "A timely classic that'll resonate with kids and find a way into the hearts of adults. \n\n\"Iron Giant\" is based upon the 1968 story,'Iron Man,' by the British poet laureate Ted Hughes. The film is about a giant metal machine that drops from the sky and frightens a small town in Maine in 1958, only to find a friend named, Hogarth, that ultimately finds its humanity and saving the towns people of their fears and prejudices.\n\nI remember watching this as a kid and being in love with it. Its beautiful animation, its joyous laughs, the fun characters, and a big lovable giant. I feel like this was the \"Big Hero 6\" of the 1990's. What's not to like about this film? Not only is it a classic animation, but it's genuinely just an all around great film.\n\nBrad Bird has delivered plenty of great films throughout his lifetime. However, what we have here MIGHT be one of my favorite films that he's ever created. I don't know if it is, but it's damn near close. One of my favorite things about this story is honestly the simplicity of it. A young boy befriends an Iron Giant from outer space, wondering how he'll fit into society and how other people will view him. It's a simple, fun, adventurous premise that knows what it is and executes. It's a fun story that I think everyone can enjoy, but it has some really nice themes inside that I think are really beneficial for younger generations.\n\nI forgot just how funny this film was because I had some genuinely good laughs throughout. I was smiling for most the film and laughing throughout the rest. It's just fun and that's the best word I can use to describe it. One of my favorite feelings is to be able to watch a film from my childhood and still smile at just how much I love it. There was a lot of nostalgia in watching it and the fact that it also holds up really well is a pleasant aspect.\n\nPurchasing the newly released blu-ray for the re-release of this film, I've got to say that it looks pretty damn good. The animation looks like how it was back then (an older cartoon), but the animation is really fluid, the environments are well developed, and the characters look great. The film looks great and I feel like with all of these different aspects combined, it'll help this film last throughout the years. \n\nTalk about voice actors. I legitimately thought Eli Marienthal was phenomenal. He brought so much to his role and made his character so fun. His emotions and excitement made it seem like he was a real kid living out this scenario. Him, along with the rest of the talent all did great. They all bring so much fun and personality just with their voices and it makes the experience so much more fun.\n\nIn the end, \"The Iron Giant\" is a favorite and certainly a classic animation.",

It was an enjoyable film, however, I didn't feel as intrigued with the story as much as I would have liked to be. However, the film was insightful as to the fear and the threats that people experienced during the Cold War. The threat of nuclear bombing, and kids having to be taught how to protect themselves should a bombing occur was the reality then, and a scary one at that. \n\nThe film \"The Iron Giant\" fits into the animation genre in a different capacity. Nowadays, we are so used to the Disney/Pixar style of animation that is more vibrant and lively, where the style of animation that \"The Iron Giant\" employs is more of a classic animation. It reminds me of how movies like \"Lady and the Tramp\" and \"The Rescuers\" were animated. To me, I feel that the animation style used fits the tone of the movie, in that the movie isn't happy go lucky, so much as it is on the darker side with the subject matter that it explores.\n\nI feel that \"The Iron Giant\" could have done better with some sound editing changes. It might have just been my TV, but it felt like the dialogue of the movie and the sound effects of the movie were on two completely different levels and I had to constantly adjust my volume. I also felt that Kent the detective staying at Hogarth's house kind of came out of nowhere. It felt bizarre to me that a single mom would all of a sudden let this random man spend so much time in her house with her only child.\n\nI did appreciate the character evolution of the giant. It was great to see how he handled different situations. When Hogarth and the giant were playing in the metal yard, Hogarth points a toy gun at the giant and the giant reacts how he was programmed to, which is to destroy any threats. By the end of the movie, as the giant is flying in the sky trying to protect Hogarth from the army that is chasing them, one of the planes fires at the two of them and the giant's eyes start to narrow, as if to shoot his laser at the planes. Instead, the giant holds back, realizing that that isn't the way to handle the situation. I watched the film many times as a kid, and that was a piece that I had never noticed until now!",

Love the way your marketing schemes worked back in the 90's,Warner Bros. The Iron Giant is actually pretty good. The animation is nice to look at and manages to focus on themes of fear of the unknown and \"you are who you choose to be\". It gets emotional near the climax but I'm not spoiling anything, just guess and wonder if you're right. The film helped establish Brad Bird's cinematic gifts and boasts memorable moments especially when the robot says \"Superman\". I can understand why people jokingly call it the most underrated Superman movie of all time. It's funny, it's dramatic and there's also some great attention to detail. It feels accurate for a 1950s setting seeing as how the main villain most of the time smokes a cigarette, there are some 50s type comics and the army is shown to be paranoid true to a world still living in the Cold War. Heck, even the posters look 1950s-ish. Good job, Brad Bird. No wonder The Incredibles and Ratatouille are so good. I'd definitely want to be friends with this harmless albeit menacing-looking at first glance giant robot from outer space.",

Needless to say, as I watched the movie (I cannot recall what movie it was) I was more excited for the Iron Giant than the actual movie we were seeing. I remember opening up the wrapping paper and yelling with joy that I had gotten the movie. I ran around the living room holding out while laughing and shouting. I immediately popped the tape in to watch it after the unwrapping had finished. As a 5 year old, the actual impact of the movie was lost on me and it was merely an entertaining animated film. As I grew and watched the movie many more times it's true gravity began to dawn on me. This movie has gotten me threw many rough times as a very depressed and lonely teenager and has even gone to college with me. This one of my go to movies if I ever feel sad. The whole aspect of unconditional love for someone is beautiful and the ending (I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it the whole way through) is, frankly, heartbreaking. Fast forward to Christmas this year 2016. As I ripped open the wrapping paper, the now 22 year old me, smiled as I held the DVD of the Iron Giant in my hands. I didn't scream or yell this time, but it really touched me deep down that even today a whole 17 years later, this movie still moves me, sometimes to the point of tears. If you haven't watched this movie, I suggest it with my whole heart. It's truly a cinematic masterpiece.",

            "content": "How about I just cut to the chase? The Iron Giant is a nearly perfect animated film. Let's start with the setting. It's so wonderful to have the small-town 1950's vibe for the warm beginning that's all about making a new friend. But it also transitions well into the fear and paranoia that many felt at the time because of the Bomb and the Red Scare. Hogarth is a simple inquisitive kid, which is a good protagonist for our story, and it makes him easy to identify with. I have to say, the establishment of the friendship between Hogarth and the Giant is a little rushed, but I think it's justified because they set him up in the beginning as a boy who quickly grows attached to creatures. Speaking of setting things up, on a rewatch I was amazed how blatantly they foreshadow the climax of the film. I didn't see it coming the first time, but they start laying the groundwork for how the story will end 30 minutes or less into the movie. Some people might not like how obvious the foreshadowing is, but I think most of it is solidly built into the plot with appropriate setup and pay-off. And that pay-off is the kind that makes grown men weep. I don't just tear up or get a little misty-eyed with The Iron Giant, I have tears rolling down my face every time. Clearly the film connects with me in a deep way to elicit that kind of reaction. All this, and it has a good moral message as well, which both adults and children can learn from. I love this movie, and would highly recommend it to anyone.",

The film is also sort of anti-war in a way in the way that the film ends. I thought the film was visually stunning, I enjoyed all of the characters, and I thought the concept of the movie was genius. My only gripe with it was the final shot of the film which really takes the tragic ending and gives it a happy go lucky feel that doesn't do that anti-war, pro-acceptance message any justice.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial right? Yes, and no. Though very similar and a lot less content worries, The Iron Giant, set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space, distinguishes itself from E.T. by one, 100 ft. metal man.\nSent from outer space to be \"a weapon\" to destroy humans, the Iron Giant is remarkably friendly to humans. \n\nHe soon befriends an 11 year-old pet-addicted boy, Hogarth, who had saved him from a close-to-death electrocution during the Giant's feast on the metal of an electric station. Lonely for a companion, Hogarth visits the Giant and teaches him about the world. Thus begins the mental journey of the Iron Giant into the world of humans. \n\nMeanwhile, the government is called up about some weird discoveries. They send an agent by the name of Kent Mansley to investigate. He first dismisses the idea of a metal-eating Giant as too eccentric, but then after finding his car with a huge bite and a second later vanished completely, he calls the government which instructs him to find more evidence. Immediately, Kent suspects Hogarth and after many annoying and desperate inquiries he discovers a picture of Hogarth and the Giant. The next day, the army is in their backyard.\n\nThe Iron Giant, rated PG for some violence, some bathroom humor and a bunch too many mild swears and misuses of God's name, is both hilarious but also heartbreaking, yet unlike many animation films, viewers will find its message comparably heavy and touching deeply on the truth of death and souls. There is one thing I disliked though. All the scenes are straight to the point, but I hoped it could have added 15 minutes of fluff and still prove the important points without the blink-and-you-miss-it (you will see some in the re-release of it in theaters and and digital). Frankly, although the story is not new to most of us, The Iron Giant easily bests the others in creativity and spiritual truth (but not all on family-friendly content). Just as Hogarth says to the Giant, \"You don't have to be a gun. You are what you choose to be,\" we should not base ourselves on what others believe and want us to be. \"Superman...\"\n\nNote: The Iron Giant, the directorial debut for Brad Bird, will be re-released in theatres with new footage only on September 30 (too late by the time you read this article), an encore on October 4 and a release on DVD in the fall.",

This is the first Brad Bird film that didn't really grab me. I found the script lacklustre, and the plot predicatable.\n\nThe premise is simple: a space robot lands on earth and befriends the standard-issue precocious child. He behaves as a gentle giant, learning our Earth ways until threatened by the military, where he only starts hurting people in self-defense. When humanity uses unnecessarily strong force, he must revert to the kind soul that he truly is and sacrifice himself.\n\nIf the complexities of your plot can be boiled down to less than sixty words without losing the idea of the movie, I don't feel its complex enough to warrant a better rating. Yes, this will entertain kids, but grown-ups can't expect a lot of zippy one-liners or hidden references (unlike Brad Bird's other films).",

This is a fine piece of animation, a film that really is well done in the way they delivered its ideas, and it is an enthralling, wonderful movie that I recommend to any viewer that enjoys a solid animated feature. The Iron Giant boasts a great cast of varied voice talent, and they brilliantly bring these characters to life. The film isn't your typical animated features such as the computer animated ventures of Pixar, and this one venture more in the cartoon department, but it does it very well that it can appeal to any age group. The film is tailored to anyone that enjoys a fun, entertaining picture that is beautiful to look at and is engaging from start to finish. This is a great movie, one that should be enjoyed by anyone that loves a solid animated feature. The Iron Giant is terrific for what it does, and with its simple ideas, we have a film that accomplishes much more than what we would get than your usual film that overdoes everything in order to grab the viewer's attention.

An alien robot sent to destroy earth it lands in New England, but the landing damages its programming, and it has no memory. The 1950s setting is so great here, because it is the height of paranoia from the cold war and outer space invaders. A lonely boy discovers him, teaches him and forms a genuine friendship with the giant. Even though he is a walking weapon, the boy teaches him that who you are who you choose to be. Their interactions along with the animation style give the giant a soul and make him feel as lovable as a pet dog. It is a touching story with an emotional ending that resonates.

It makes you laugh, cry, it gets you on the edge of your seat, it hits every emotion it's supposed to hit and hits it hard. The characters are memorable and The Giant is one of the most iconic animated characters ever. The animation is fantastic and makes me realize how much I miss traditional animated movies nowadays. It's also pretty mature for a kids movie, touching on themes of existentialism, nuclear war, and death. I know it's probably not the first family movie to do that but I think this one does it better than most others, maybe even the best. And the last twenty minutes of the movie is one of the greatest climaxes to a movie I've ever seen, it is packed action, suspense, and emotion and brings the movie to an extremely satisfying end. I'm glad the movie is now considered a classic and is loved by many because I do think this is one of the greatest family movies of all-time and I'd recommend it to anyone.",

Little Mermaid just doesn't cut it after you've witnessed someone die or had a girlfriend tell you in a dead voice that she'd been raped.\n\nOr does it?\n\nThe best children's movies contain elements of both worlds: child-like wonder and a nod toward the sometimes harsh realities of life.  Despite the horrid stuff that you and I may have witnessed, we mustn't forget that life is also full of good stuff.\n\nIron Giant reminds us of just that.  It's about an earnest boy who likes comic-books, sci-fi horror movies, and bb-guns.  And a giant robot with huge glowing eyes and an honest face. It's hard not to like them both.  And impossible to not root against the long-faced (literally) government agent who can only believe that the Iron Giant can be a weapon.\n\nThe movie also has an awesome retro feel to it.  The film reel demonstrating the proper duck-and-cover response to a nuclear attack drill is especially hilarious.\n\nFinal Say: An absolute must-watch if you like animation or giant robots, if just for the scene when the Iron Giant gets angry.\n\nHow to Watch It: Just because there's a giant robot, don't go in expecting a ton of action/fighting.  You know any movie made today with a giant robot would have tons of that.  But this one isn't about explosions so much as... dare I say it? ... relationships.\n\nTrivia: The first film by Brad Bird, who later wrote/directed Pixar's The Incredibles and Ratatouille.",

Set in the year 1957, it is at bottom a touching story of a young boy and his heartfelt friendship with an extra-terrestrial space robot, but it also serves as a cold war parable, in which the fear of nuclear holocaust and a sense of paranoia is prevalent, and the robot must learn to transcend his assigned function as a lethal weapon. \r\nThe conception of the metallic space alien(voiced by Vin Diesel) is inspired. Somewhat reminiscent of E.T the iron giant is simple-natured and innocent with a very limited vocabulary. Despite being cautious at first a young boy named Hogarth Hughes(voiced by  Eli Marienthal)  befriends this creature and begins to think of his new robot alien pal as his equal, at once a larger species of a child and a faithful pet. A local junk dealer/beaknik artist(voice of Harry Connick Jr.) is also won over by the charms of the giant. The design of the robot is spot-on, expressive without ever being too cutesy. Hot on the trail of Hogarth and his giant is Kent Mansley, a malevolent 1950's version of special government agent(voiced by Christopher McDonald). Clad in the requisite trench-coat, Mansley makes for an interesting and comical villain, representing xenophobic authority and irrational paranoia. The animation is great, evoking classic Disney or studio Ghibli in its close attention to detail. The old-school design of the human characters, often with imperfect faces and big goofy ears, has a lot more charm than most modern computer-animated movies. This movie is genuinely touching and funny and doesn't really put a foot wrong throughout.",

The genre does interest me, but very rarely do I personally feel that its even taken advantage to its full potential. What's often categorize as a family friendly genre can visualize a greater connection to reality that wouldn't be captured the same way in a live action film. \"The Iron Giant\" is one of those films that in live action form special effects regardless of quality would have distracted from the true heart and power within its story and characters.\r\n\r\nThe Iron Giant is about a boy befriending an innocent giant robot that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy. Structurally \"The Iron Giant\" plays out similar to another classic \"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\"; in both a kid encounters a begin from space, befriends the space begin who is stranded on earth, takes it home and hides it from his mother (yet oddly in both film there's no father present), and the paranoid government come into play. While both films share similar plot threads and aside from sharing the same quality that's where the comparison between these two films end. Characters are sophisticated and their interactions with one another feels natural. Conversations never allude to anything specifically plot related every moment of humor and drama is a genuine occurrence in these characters everyday life. Both the human characters and our giant robot are treated as equal. Instead of seeing the iron giant as a piece of machinery we see the iron giant as a living being. Identifying with the iron giant as much as we do with the human characters. Giving events a greater sense of emotion, a greater sense of importance, and more involving seeing every outcome. \r\n\r\nPolitical commentary is risking especially in this film when the setting is just days after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite. The atmosphere is tense and paranoid in this time setting. What the iron giant metaphors is easy to grasp with scenes hinting perhaps this other worldly creation has a different function. Later on sending a message about being a weapon through key development scenes. Unlike the humans we never learn about the iron giant past or purpose. Like a weapon we presume the intention is a path of destruction. If the iron giant was never given any human traits this would have been a cautionary tale about humans thrive for creating weapons eventually killing them. In this film we have a giant robot who is programmed to do a specific function. However, his interactions define his decision and questions what he was program to do. It's as much the iron giant story to not follow a set path programmed for him as much as it is a our human character story on the escalation of fearing the unknown. \r\n\r\nAnimation mixes hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated iron giant. The title character is a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him. There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment with aura of an classic sci-fi feel surrounding him and his design. Detail is evident in the whole: the season subtly changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus; in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity. Character designs and voice actors who made them come to life verbally were perfect. Eli Marienthal fitted very well with the animated design of the character. Harry Connick Jr. was just as good at being humorous. Kent Mansley, our main antagonist, was very well designed and acted. Christopher McDonald relatively calm voice made the villain memorable. The Iron Giant himself is voiced by Vin Diesel. While Diesel says very little he sounds exactly like a robot, but hints slightly of perhaps adopting a speaking pattern to that of a human. \r\n\r\nThe Iron Giant is a masterpiece. Transcending beyond an hand drawn two dimensional plain to provide three dimensional characters whose interaction are so natural you don't feel like you're watching a piece of vividly drawn fiction.",

Set in 1957, a boy named Hogarth (voice of Eli marienthal), who daydreams of alien invasions and doing battle with communist agents. Then one day, this imaginative 9-year-old stumbles across a fifty to hundred foot iron giant from space crashing from his small town, and Hogarth and Iron Giant (voice of Vin Diesel) become best friends.\n\"The Iron Giant\" is like E.T. and Ironman put together, there's a few scenes of cues of E.T. while the ironman feel is mostly the part when the army shoots, bombs, and air attacks the giant, then the giant using his guns, lasers, and protection to stop the trouble. For being Bard Bird's first direct picture, \"The Iron Giant\" is a engaging, effecting, and charming animated adventure that animated pictures need to be a little more like this or at least once in a while.\nI never liked this movie before, I don't know why? But then me and friends were talking about it, so I decided to watch if again and enjoyed it. \"The Iron Giant\" is a must see, it's really funny especially the one water scene. The movie is complexed on relationship, where everyone has feeling and heart. \"The Iron Giant\" is in so far the best tradition of Warner Bros and it is a big heart movie that has likable characters, and easy to know voice work, and nice way to set it in the cold war to be a well and memorable film from Brad Bird.",

No heart prods here! My one problem would be the villain, who came close at times to be a true embodiment of the ultra-nationalist McCarthy Paranoid the era produced. No, he was there, and interesting for that. Then at the end they tried to distance him from that. (\"Screw America, I want to live!) A dding a little more gray to the character would have really captured the sort of people fostered by that time. If he had been a truly terrified individual, expecting the worse because of the extreme paranoia fostered by the Cold War, it would have complimented the story of the two 'enemies' reaching a friendship and understanding in Giant and Hogart. \n\nThe animation is of course Brad Bird Awesome.",

            "content": "One of the recent directors in Hollywood that I enjoy watching is the films of Brad Bird. Bird started out as a successful animation director with the acclaimed Pixar hits The Incredibles and Ratatouille, and then ventured into live-action territory by reviving the Mission Impossible franchise. His upcoming project, Tomorrowland, sounds like it's going to be another excellent masterpiece from Bird. But what shocks me is that before this review, I have never seen Bird's directorial debut, The Iron Giant. I had heard about it for quite some time. I knew it was a huge flop at the box-office, but gained massive acclaim from critics and gained a cult following from audiences after Bird became an acclaimed filmmaker. Now after watching The Iron Giant, I'm surprised that I didn't watch it sooner, cause it's incredible.\n\nSet in 50's Cold War America, shortly after the launch of Sputnik, we meet the child Hogarth, who longs for a pet. He soon finds a pet larger than expected when me discovers a 50-foot giant who came from space. Knowing that the world will panic when they discover its existence, Hogarth hides the robot in the junkyard of beatnik friend Dean. But of coarse, a 50-foot robot cannot hide forever, and soon enough, a government agent comes down to investigate weird occurrences, and believing it to be a threat caused by the Russians, sends the military to wipe the robot from existence. Hogarth, knowing that the robot is a friend, sets out to convince everyone that the creature is good, not bad.\n\nWhen watching The Iron Giant, I couldn't help but think of how similar this is to Spielberg's ET. Both films are about a lonely child, they both meet a creature from the unknown, they both develop a close bond, and both childs in the film have to protect the alien from government/military. While ET is far superior when it comes to raw emotions and depth, that doesn't mean that this film is a massive disaster. No, no, and no. In actuality, I found The Iron Giant to be an impressive feature as well.\n\nThe 2D animation here is not the greatest animation I've seen, I admit. You'd think that this film was actually made in the 1950\"s.  Looking at it, I think the producers were deliberately making the animation look like 50's animation in order to better suit the film. And with that being said, the retro look of the film is outstanding. The giant is clearly CG, but the retro 2D animation makes him look old-fashioned, and I'm wowed. It makes me wonder that if the film was a massive smash, then The Incredibles might have been in 2D animation. Would have been a whole different film, for good or bad reasons.\n\nFor a film about Cold War fears, this film is surprisingly funny. Scenes with the boy and the giant have a sense of childhood fun in them, and I couldn't help but reminisce about my childhood fun watching this. I laughed hysterically at a scene where the boy was about to pray for the food and yells at the giant's missing hand while attempting to pray in front of his mom. It's a riot. Another scene that got me going was a scene where the robot makes a cannonball in a large pond and all the water starts flying out. It's great humor.\n\nThe characters were also a highlight in this film. The boy, Hogarth, voiced by Eli Marienthal, is surprisingly not annoying. Generally in films, particularly cartoons, kids in these films are usually annoying or extremely obnoxious, but here, Marienthal makes the voice of the child be reminiscent of how we all were when we were kids. The producers picked a well-acted kid for this. Vin Diesel voices the giant, and is pretty memorable. Jennifer Anniston voices the mom, and is strong in the role. She makes a mom that makes me wish that all moms are like this in today's society. Harry Connick Jr. voices the beatnik junk dealer, and is very funny. And Christopher McDonald voices the hysterical government agent, and is also very funny, while also sinister in several places. In some moments, it sounds like McDonald was imitating Henry Fonda, but Fonda never played a government agent that goes crazy. He was always the honest man who saves the day in the end. This character is not him. Again, don't know why I made the Henry Fonda comparison, but it's just me.\n\nThe score is provided by Michael Kamen, and it's pretty impressive. It might not be a masterpiece score, but at least Kamen provides emotions that are not underused. The climax really delivers in emotions in the music, when the giant becomes his true potential.\n\nIf there was one thing that bothered me about the film, it would have to be the film's message about guns. If you know me well, I strongly believe that we all have the right to carry guns, as stated in the Second Amendment. In the film, there's a scene where a deer is killed by some hunters, and the boy then tells the giant, \"Guns kill. You are not a gun.\" It seems to me that the producers believe that killing deer is bad and guns are bad, period. I believe this gives kids a bad message that you shouldn't kill deer or even hunt in that matter. Even though I'm not a hunter, I believe that these people need to eat something, and deer is in fact good food. Maybe the producers were scarred by the death of Bambi's mother. That didn't bother me, and I still support the hunters.\n\nWhile I was a bit annoyed by the whole anti-gun hunting deer thing, The Iron Giant is actually a strong animated film. The retro look of 50's America is outstanding, the emotions are strong, the comedy is in fact funny, and I was still rooting for the giant even if he's against guns. Besides the whole gun thing, the other message, where \"you are who you choose to be\", is in fact one of the strongest positive messages I've seen in an animation film and because of this, I strongly recommend that you watch The Iron Giant at least once, even if the anti-gun message carries through the better message.",

It's a movie that stays in its own bubble for a non-Disney movie. It doesnt try to usher in the new gimmick of computer animation nor does it try to do everything Disney did before it. Heck, the only probable reason people dont talk about it much today is because its not from Disney. But I digress, it's still a complete masterpiece for what it is. The characters are all memorable, the dialogue is near perfect, and never really do you know where the story is going throughout, unless you're an expert on film. The only part I didn't like so much is the whole \"guns kill, you dont have to be a gun\" part which felt to me like it had a double meaning delving into politics that didnt really belong here. It's still one of the greatest usage of your time for animation and its so mature that it would probably work for live action as well. The plot is sort of similar to the latter Lilo and Stitch, but this works much better. It's mature, it's adult, it's funny, it's practically what it means to be a movie made for general audiences.",

THE IRON GIANT is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. While children (particularly boys) will appreciate the friendship of a boy with a giant robot, Brad Bird also manages to send up the Cold War era and provides a strong anti-gun message. For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",

            "content": "It was high time that I watched Brad Bird's directional debut. I have absolutely loved each and every one of his movies, but for some strange reason, I never saw The Iron Giant. After many recommendations, I decided to give it a shot. The Iron Giant is a very good movie. Not a great movie. In an odd way, the reason why the movie is good is because of Brad Bird; but the reason why it is slightly disappointing is because of...Brad Bird. With The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol, I became accustomed to an incredibly high level of filmmaking. Basically, Bird's last 3 movies have been nearly flawless. Which is what makes The Iron Giant somewhat disappointing, there are flaws.\r\n\r\nIt's 1957 in the sleepy town of Rockwell, Maine. A giant alien robot lands on Earth. The town's locals start perpetrating mysterious rumors about this giant machine. None of the townspeople have caught more than a glimpse of this robot, until adventurous Hogarth Hughes not only sees the robot, but befriends him. Everything is fine, but then the Feds show up. Kent Mansley (who works for the Government) is sent to Rockwell to investigate the strange happenings.\r\n\r\nThe cast is filled out with a likeable group of actors. Eli Marienthal voices Hogarth and gives him an energetic and inquisitive personality. His espresso fueled rant is without a doubt the funniest things in the movie! And for the most part he is a likable hero. Harry Connick, Jr. of Jazz music fame plays Dean, the main, adult protagonist. I think Dean is my favorite character in the movie, mostly because he reacts like how I would to the giant. And lastly, Christopher McDonald gives a very funny performance as Kent Mansley. I didn't like how the character was written towards the end, but he is still hilarious!\r\n\r\nNow on to what I didn't like about the movie. Number 1, and this is a big one, the movie makes no attempt to tell us why the Iron Giant was sent to earth. Was he sent to destroy the world? End violence? Obliterate all weapons? Or was he sent to earth for some completely different reason while still being equipped with heavy weaponry. The movie doesn't tell us, and therefore I couldn't root for the Giant as much as I wanted too. I personally wouldn't want a robot roaming around whose primary mission is to destroy the world or destroy weapons. But then, of course, the Iron Giant may or may not have disobeyed his mission when he decided that he didn't want to kill people. And right there we have another problem. Once the massive robot who could easily overpower us realizes his existence and gets a mind of his own, then there is immense danger there as well. As much as I hated to admit, if I were in the government's shoes, it would be very hard not to admit the obvious danger of keeping the giant around.\r\n\r\nI also wasn't a big fan of the visual style of the movie. In all fairness, if Brad Bird wasn't the guy directing this, then the visuals wouldn't even be an issue. I guess I was completely spoiled by Bird's other two animated efforts, The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Both of those movies had extremely strong visuals. Whether it was the super stylish look of Paris in Ratatouille, or the 'future as seen from the 1960s' from The Incredibles; both of these movies packed a strong visual punch. By comparison, the visual feel of The Iron Giant boarders on dull. It's not very colorful. It stays rather standard from start to finish. Based on the setting and the characters, I guess this movie simply didn't afford Bird the creative freedom of his later efforts.\r\n\r\nAnother big thing I didn't like was the theme of the movie, i.e. the anti-gun message. The movie heavy-handedly points out that, \"Guns kill,\" \"You don't have to be a gun.\" As if guns are the worst things in the world. I firmly believe that if you take guns out of the hands of the citizens, then the worst people will still manage to get their hands on firearms. I believe in Second Amendment rights. Still, I was happy with the way the movie didn't depict the military as the villains. General Rogard is even shown as smart and rational guy.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other odds and ends that I wasn't a fan of. I believe the movie alienates some of the younger audience members with the fact that there is mild language in the movie. It's nothing that a 10 year old couldn't handle, but I'm sure that a lot of parents wouldn't want their 5 and 6 year olds exposed to it. Another thing I didn't like was the lack of personality given to Hogarth's mom. She is a completely typical character.\r\n\r\nWith all this negative talk about the movie, I don't want to make it seem like I don't like it. I just feel that I have to explain why I'm giving a movie with a 97% approval rating, a movie considered one of the best animated movies of all time, a lowered rating. Even with the elements that I didn't like, The Iron Giant is still a highly entertaining, endearing, mature, and largely well made animated movie. I like it, but I don't love it. Compared to your average animated fare, this is definitely above average. Compared to your average Brad Bird fare, this is definitely below average.\r\n\r\n\"You know, this sort of thing is why it's important to always chew your food.\" 7.5/10",

            "content": "Cold War Paranoia For Children  \r\n\r\nYou know how, sometimes, you've been meaning to get to something for just years and you don't?  Not for any good reason, mind.  Not because you're dreading it.  Just because you mean to and somehow don't.  This isn't \"oh, I heard that was terrible\" or \"well, I hear good things, but it doesn't sound like my deal.\"  This is \"yeah, I'll get to it.\"  The thing people don't seem to realize is that there are a lot of movies out there.  There are even a lot of good movies out there.  In genres I like.  And okay, I still spend a certain amount of time watching bad movies.  Even [i]re[/i]watching bad movies, which is a whole other issue that I'm vaguely embarrassed about.  However, the more I heard about this movie, the more I figured I'd probably like it.  So okay, it has been sitting on our shelf for I don't actually know how long.  Years, probably.  And since I've basically run out of library DVDs and can't find the two I have from Netflix, here we were.\r\n\r\nHogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) is a relatively ordinary kid growing up in a small town in Maine.  His father was a fighter pilot and is dead; he lives alone with his mother, Annie (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress in a diner.  One day, as Sputnik orbits the Earth, he is sitting up watching TV while his mother is at work.  The TV stops working.  The power goes all wonky.  And Hogarth goes out into the night to find out what's going on, because he's an intrepid kid that way.  And what he sees is, well, an Iron Giant (Vin Diesel).  He befriends it, as kids in this setting are wont to do, and but he quickly realizes that he needs to hide his new friend from, like, everyone.  Someone, however, has seen it and has summoned The Government, in the person of Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald).  Kent wants the recognition that finding an alien invader would bring.  Meanwhile, Hogarth enlists the help of local metal artist Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick, Jr.) to hide his friend.\r\n\r\nDirector Brad Bird also made my favourite Pixar film (if not actually the best), [i]The Incredibles[/i].  There are some distinct similarities between the two films; both draw on a certain retro-futuristic feel.  While both have a lot of science fiction trappings, both are really more about the people than the tech.  Even the eponymous giant is really more developed as a character than just treated as Technology.  Yes, okay, there are those drones in [i]The Incredibles[/i], but they're a product of a certain pattern of thought and can be seen, in an odd way, as an insight into the mind of the villain.  Still, we don't even have that distance here.  There are a bunch of townspeople who are mostly there to make the town picturesque and period, but any time we interact with one of them, they have at least the glimmering of personality.  We don't know how the Giant works, but we don't have to; the point is not what he is but who he is.\r\n\r\nYeah, okay, there are also a few anachronisms, such as the idea that the Giant might be a \"downed satellite,\" given that there was, at the time, only one satellite and everyone would know if it were down.  Okay.  Most of the anachronisms would have been pretty easy to fix, too.  However, some of them were \"this car is from the wrong year,\" which I must confess I would not have noticed on my own, not being a car person.  (Actually, the word \"beatnik\" is apparently an anachronism, which I should have noticed and wouldn't have.)  However, there were none that I found particularly glaring, which is unusual for a movie of this sort.  It feels as though they were actually trying; after all, they made the cars recognizable sorts, which there is really no need to do.  I think most of us, including the film's target audience of, you know, children, would have been okay with \"generic '50s-looking car.\"  As it turns out, it probably would have been better if they'd left it that way, but whatever.\r\n\r\nMy plan for when my kid gets old enough to put DVDs in the player and watch them on his own is to put together all the ones he's allowed to watch without us on a separate shelf.  I don't know if this one will make it onto that shelf; there's some moderately scary stuff to it.  (The full version of the fake \"duck and cover\" cartoon is pretty horrific, actually.)  This is a decision you'd have to make on a kid-by-kid basis.  The film is rated PG, and for a reason.  When I was fairly young, this actually would have terrified me, but I am of an age where I was scared of nuclear war as a small child.  (That my parents watched a lot of news didn't much help with that.)  I can't say that children today (who don't see as much of the news) would feel that way.  Still, there's some sad stuff, some scary stuff, and some really unpleasant characters.  I really do feel that watching it first, or at bare minimum watching it with your kid, is a wise idea before letting your child see it alone.  Remember, not all animation is G-rated--or should be.",

Back when VCR still reigned supreme over home media, I'd see trailers of this film, and I was hesitant. I thought it looked uninteresting and it seemed as though everything you had to see was already in the trailer. Even if that's true, there's no denying that 'The Iron Giant' is unforgettable. Nice going, Warner Bros. for not realizing that you had pure gold in your hands. Another highlight would be the film's orchestral score and the work of the voice-actors--it was all well done, actually. I wish I could say that this film was part of my childhood but I didn't watch it until I was a bit older (6th grade-ish).",

What would you do if you found him? And I simply love comic-book villains, where you don't have to feel guilty about hating their guts. It was also refreshing that no part of the army was characterized as hellbent on destruction; the psycho-general plot device goes stagnant after a bit.\n\nLet's not forget the star of the show: a robot who mysteriously appears on earth and befriends the first creature he sees. He learns of life and death, and struggles with his place in the universe-especially as one capable, from bulk alone, of great destruction. He characterized Kirk's closing speech from Star Trek II: \"Of all the characters in this story, he was the most human.\" And that's the essence of sci-fi, isn't it; to remove us from ourselves so that we can better understand us.\n\nI lopped off a half-star because I thought the epilogue detracted from the point of the story, but I can appreciate the reason it was put in, especially in a children's movie. Overall, this was a better-than-excellent film, on par with anything Pixar's ever done, and I heartily recommend it.",

The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot.

This film captures some compelling emotion from films like ET and Terminator 2 in ways I didn't imagine before. Everything in this film is done just right, and it's almost too big for me to even review. But to list an example, what stood out to me about this film was the reaction of the government, especially in this era. From an artistic point of view, this is EXACTLY how the government would react if an incident like this were to happen. Because we would naturally be afraid. Blinded by overwhelming size and power, they were unable to see the heart and innocence of the giant robot. Everything about this film worked, there was much character development and growth, all leading to a powerful ending. The animation was beautiful, the plot was excellent, and the scope was intriguing. There is more than one moral to to this story, and they are all important. And those morals are ones you must learn by watching the film yourself, there really isn't any other way to get it. One can't watch this film without at least getting one of them. It's not what I would call a kids movie, it works for just about everyone. If you like sci-fi and deep emotional conflicts, you will like this movie.

            "content": "The Iron Giant has got to be one of Brad Bird's timeless masterpiece. People who didn't like this movie are wrong. This film deserves every praise it's given. It was funny and has a good chemistry between Hogarth and Giant. What makes this so unique is that it wasn't too kid friendly at all. Instead, it appeals to everyone from young and old. \n\nThe story was pretty fun and had a heart. It flowed pretty well from start to finish without being cheesy. However, it had an ending where it makes you think that it should have a sequel, which it didn't. It's kinda similar to the way The Incredibles ended, except it ended differently. I love that movie as well. The humor was smart and imaginative. \n\nThe voice actors did pretty well, and I didn't know, at first, that the well-known cast voiced these memorable characters. Even though I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, I thought he did a brilliant job with his character. Eli Marienthal was outstanding with his main character, and I think he should be in more movies. It's been a long time since I've heard from his projects. I was surprised about Christopher McDonald being one of the voice actors in this movie. He was funny in Happy Gilmore, and he made his character, Kent Mansley memorable here. Kent may be a jerk, but he had me laughing whenever he appears.\n\nThis is one of the animated films that should be appreciated by everyone. This movie is underrated, and it would have been better if enough people would like it for what it is. The ending could have been a little better, but it was brilliant for what it was. The Iron Giant will always be one of my favorite movies ever.",

Tackling heavy subjects such as death and nuclear warfare with a steady hand and heavy heart, but also featuring the humor needed to make a film of this style work. The animation is beautiful, with special mention going to the portrayal of the giant himself. It would have been simple to just animate a CG robot and plop it down into scenes with the characters, but the way the robot moves and is animated blends near-flawlessly with the hand-drawn animation surrounding it, so much so that I completely forgot that he was CG until after the film was over. And speaking of the giant, Vin Diesel does a spectacular job of bringing the character to life. While the giant has very few lines, they are delivered flawlessly, encompassing emotions ranging from happiness and wonder to sorrow and even anger. If you haven't seen The Iron Giant yet, then you are doing yourself a disservice by not doing so. It's some of the best that animation has to offer, on the same league as films such as Disney's Beauty and the Beast and Studio Ghibli's My Neighbor Totoro. \n\nThis film also features some of the earliest work of Lauren Faust, wife of Craig McCracken and creator of the mega-hit animated series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.

Before long, however, a government agent is on their trail -- and he's intent on destroying the automaton.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1999, The Iron Giant couldn't have had worse timing.  After the rousing success of Toy Story just four years prior, as well as Pixar's equally exciting \"A Bug's Life\" follow up in 1998, animation's audience was eager to embrace computer generated images and must have looked at The Iron Giant as some form of regression.  The film bombed at the box office, failing to recoup even half of what it cost to produce; and the film quitely slipped into oblivion. \r\n\r\nThank goodness for the miracle of home video such as dvd.  As a result, the sins of the past need not be repeated and more and more people can discover this great animated film for themselves.  Pixar was wise to stand up and take notice of the film's quality by absorbing the competition and making Brad Bird (director of The Iron Giant) a part of Pixar.  The picture has stellar character development, surprisingly powerful images, and a script that tackles some oddball subjects such as gun control.\r\n\r\nIf the film has a downside it is it's relatively straightforward structure, making it somewhat predictable.  But such a flaw is rendered mute as we are treated to The Iron Giant's evocative period ambiance, great vocal talent, and heartfelt narrative.  \r\n\r\nThough the film is held back by it's typical structuring, The Iron Giant is a smart, earthbound, and warm family film.",

Brad crafts a world that is definatly animated, but doesn't rely on the typical animated trops of the time, such as strechy characters and fart jokes, and makes characters that you care about, even so to the giant CG......giant! The story is perfectly crafted to leave you with tears in your eyes, no matter the age. No where does it stall and it even slightly pushes the boundaries of family entertainment a little further. The animated classics touch on themes like friendship and love, and this also does, but even more so by showing that just because others do, doesn't mean we have to fight. And that we could give ourselves up to help others. To simply put it, 'Iron Giant' is a giant, and one filled with heart and love. It teaches kids that friendship has no boundaries and that just how far you can go to protect the innocent. It will capture your heart, and while it has as big of an action scene as any trandformer movie, this robot has a lot more love. And you'll love him to. 5/5",
