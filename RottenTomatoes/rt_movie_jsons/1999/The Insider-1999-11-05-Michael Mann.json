    "summary": "After seeking the expertise of former \"Big Tobacco\" executive Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), seasoned TV producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) suspects a story lies behind Wigand's reluctance to speak. As Bergman persuades Wigand to share his knowledge of industry secrets, the two must contend with the courts and the corporations that stand between them and exposing the truth. All the while, Wigand must struggle to maintain his family life amidst lawsuits and death threats.",

            "content": "Michael Mann was a skillful director. This is a great true life story. It's well acted and directed, well edited, good music. It has a 96% score on RT. Will it be an all time classic? No, just for the simple reason that this is a movie made by boys, with boys and for boys. It is pretty much a kind of male fantasy. Apart from the true story of how American tobacco was exposed, the main concern of the movie is male friendship. The film miserably fails the Bechdel test - there is not a single scene in the movie with two women having any kind of conversation. Well there are a couple of very brief scenes with Russell Crowe's wife and daughters talking to each other, but guess what, they're literally muted - you can't hear what they're saying. There are actually only a few minutes in a nearly 3 hour long film where you even have women at all on screen and talking. Crowe's wife is portrayed as a whining ungrateful housewife.  There's an attractive young woman working at CBS, who appears to be nothing more than Pacino's flunky. She has no character to speak of, and all she does is follow Pacino's barked instructions, even when he phones her up in the middle of the night. But I suppose she does provide a bit of eye candy here and there (she is wearing full make up and deshabille when Pacino's call wakes her in the middle of the night). Pacino's wife, again a very tiny part, is the only sympathetic female in the movie, and all she does is basically look adoringly at him and support him when things are going wrong.  She does seem to have a job, though it's not revealed what she does. I am sure there were women involved in all sorts of ways in the original true story, and there could have been all sorts of ways of bringing them into the story, but Mann (appropriate name, btw), chooses not to. As, I say, it's a boys' story. I am looking back on this from 23 years on, and some might say, oh, that's just how things were in Hollywood back then, and there is a smidgeon of truth in that, but really not that much. A quick google shows 1999 movies like The Virgin Suicides, Girl Interrupted, Boys Don't Cry, Election. Even in 1999 Mann was a bit of a dinosaur. I also just rewatched Heat, which is also regarded as a great classic, and I really don't know why. It's just the same: blokes, blokes and more blokes, shouting at each other, bromancing, fighting and punching, making phone calls, giving long brooding looks.",

            "content": "This is one of those films that really means something, and so important that it stands its ground and the test of time, even more than 20 years after its release. Very few films fit that discription. The true story and the article that The Insider is based on is so fundamental that it has lead to a radical worldwide change in how a certain product is produced, or at least distributed, and even the film alone made its contribution in this matter. In addition the plot is a dive into the ruthlessness of big business and media corporations, where the situation has become even worse since then. This makes it not just a film drama, but also a historical document. Regardless of this, when the performances from top and well known actors are at such a level that you forget that its not reality you're watching, but actualy just a fictiionalized version of it, that's when film making is where it ideally should be. Then it becomes magic, and director Michael Mann and his crew must certainly have felt this during the rehersals and shootings. Main role holder Russell Crowe probably does his best ever performance, so credible that we forget that he is acting. He truly becomes the character, something that always is prior for making the best films. Even Al Pacino, who usually delivers some ultimate version of himself, steps out and into this bubble, and the interaction between him and Crowe is outstanding. It's all so convincing that the late Christopher Plummer just might fool you to believe that it really is Mike Wallace playing himself. On top of that Bruce McGill has a verbal anger outburst so convincing that the actors receiving it literally get scared. Also Mike Moore becomes a good actor by playing himself. All in all there is nothing negative to say about this film, and it gets even better the second time around.",

            "content": "Based on the way they set up the plot of The Insider, I was expecting more of a man-on-the-run type of story. They certainly make it seem like there\u2019s some significant danger for the main characters. I think the primary reason that I found the film a bit underwhelming was simply because it didn\u2019t feel like the stakes were as high as the movie was implying. Yes, the men involved faced severe opposition and standing up to the tobacco industry caused them great personal frustration. But it never seemed their lives were in danger. Likewise, the content of their \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d story is such old news to me, and I struggle to understand why it mattered so much. Was it really that shocking to people in 1996 that cigarette corporations knew their products were life-threatening and that they actively worked to make them more addictive? I was in my late teens at that time, and I\u2019m pretty sure that I assumed all of this was true. Despite all of my issues, when I was able to go with the flow and accept the story of The Insider as a high stakes endeavor, I found some enjoyment from it. The tone and atmosphere is excellent and offers plenty of nervous tension throughout. I appreciated the performance of Al Pacino, because he isn\u2019t over-the-top and crazy like he has become in many modern movies. I do wish they had cast someone more charismatic and interesting than Russell Crowe to play the lead role. However after watching the actual interview, it doesn\u2019t seem like Wigand is all that exciting, so perhaps Crowe was delivering the performance just right. Which brings me to my other important positive about The Insider. It was not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it did interest me enough that I made a point of seeking out the original video of WIgand\u2019s 60 Minutes interview. I suppose, for a movie based on a true story, that\u2019s a big win. The Insider might have lacked something for me, but at least I was intrigued.",

This movie is of major interest because Pacino plays a News producer for 60 minutes trying to expose the tobacco industry. Funny, because tobacco is probably what made Pacino's voice so gravelly! That's cool he could separate his work from his personal habits. Crowe was nominated for best actor, didn't win-though I hear he's good in Unhinged, we'll see if they nominate him.

While the movie undoubtedly has an important message and story to share, it is hindered by its length, clocking in at twenty minutes shy of three hours. It could have been trimmed significantly (the first fifteen minutes or so add nothing to the story, for example) without decreasing the impact.  There are also several odd directorial decisions by Mann.  In one scene, litigators approach the courthouse, but a quarter of the screen is obscured by an out of focus newspaper box.

            "content": "Michael Mann in full command of his directorial craft.\n\nMichael Mann's political legal drama The Insider (1999) is a testament to Mann's skillful prowess as an American auteur. Mann directs The Insider with an inspiring sense of justice and sensitivity towards his subject Jeffrey Wigand. Mann's riveting direction keeps you stunned, shocked, nervous, and furious at how big tobacco companies operate and intimate witnesses testifying against their unethical behaviors that kill people. The Insider will surely be remembered alongside other phenomenal classics of the investigative, legal drama and paranoia thriller genres like All the President's Men, Zodiac, Spotlight, or Dark Waters. \n\nRussell Crowe is sympathetic and powerful playing a middle aged man in his youth with neat grey hair dye. Crowe conveys his paranoia, frustration, rage, warmth, intelligence, and fear with equal sincerity and kindness towards the patriotic hero and tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand. Crowe is at the top of his game in a peak performance from this acting legend.\n\nAl Pacino is outstanding as Lowell Bergman, a fierce CBS producer for 60 minutes, who bravely stands behind Wigand and against CBS' cowardly tactics to bury an imperative story for the safety of Americans everywhere. Pacino's persistent rage and righteous indignation admirably defends the virtues of the media as the protectors of American society in their role as the fourth estate. On the other hand, Christopher Plummer adeptly portrays Mike Wallace in his straightforward journalism and cowardice in not defending Wigand when he needed him. The Insider makes Wallace look terribly selfish and only concerned with his career legacy, now tarnished by his own miserable choices.\n\nDiane Venora is hurtful as Liane Wigand, who cannot bring herself to stop acting like an entitled rich housewife long enough to support her husband during his time of need. Venora perfectly captures her selfish decisions. Opposite, we have Lindsay Crouse as Pacino's steadfast and supportive wife, desperately trying to contend with his stubborn ways and searing situation. I liked Debi Mazar as Debbie De Luca the researcher for Pacino. I wish she was in The Insider more as she's hauntingly beautiful and commands your attention any time she speaks or glances over.\n\nBruce McGill is poignant as Ron Motley in a sturdy role of robust accusatory speeches. On the other side of journalism, Philip Baker Hall depicts CBS' boss Don Hewitt as a cowardly traitor taking money from big tobacco in unethical conduct. Stephen Tobolowsky, Gina Gershon, Michael Gambon, Rip Torn, and Cliff Curtis all have memorable cameos that leave a mark in your brain. \n\nEric Roth and Michael Mann's script is poignant, well researched, mature, and informative with a deep empathy for the victims of big tobacco's endless campaign to stop whistleblowers. Dante Spinotti's cinematography is gorgeous and breathtaking, whether shooting a blue ocean or black night in a parking lot. You are held in silent suspense by his isolating shot framing. Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke's score is chilling with ambient noises, holy choirs, and soft acoustic melodies. Bill Myer's realistic make-up goes a long way for The Insider's verisimilitude. \n\nIn all, The Insider will stay in my mind forever as an important film and special classic drama from Michael Mann.",

The story focuses less on documenting a grand conspiracy to suppress a larger truth from an omniscient perspective, but instead allows its story to be told through the eyes of 'boots-on-the-ground' characters, allowing the twists of the narrative to impact the viewer more personally. Having coincidentally also recently seen Mann's Public Enemies, on which he shares a similar combination role of director, producer, and writer, there is a unique element to his filmmaking that deserves mention: his willingness to introduce characters, provide development to them, and give them an impactful role in the story, and then to allow them to fall away without any grand resolution to their particular arc, which I feel is more representative of reality than giving every John and Jane some sort of bow-on-top independent story. He's not afraid to recruit quality talent for these roles, either. For an example of this type of character, look no further than Bruce McGill, who delivers one of the most dramatically constructed speeches of the film, but probably sees less than 30 or 40 minutes of screentime elapse between his first and last appearance. Gambon arguably serves as the most prominent antagonist in the film, but is shown sparingly and his ultimate fate is never commented on. Great performance from Crowe, but I'm less confident that Pacino really embraces his characters as much as he just alters the volume of his voice once in a while. Given that the era of corporate deception, whistleblowers, and gag orders has persisted without flagging to the present day, The Insider still feels fresh and relevant. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Possibly the most famous modern film to explore journalistic ethics is All the President's Men (1976) a stolid attempt at a thriller that never quite convinces it's audiences of it's convictions. I personally did not like the film and when I chose to watch this film, aware that it had many similarities to that film, I hoped to see Michael Mann put his own unique spin on ground covered in many other Hollywood films. Fortunately I was not disappointed as while the film is slow, contemplative and deathly serious it gives you a sense of the impact that whistleblowing can have on both journalists and the whistleblowers themselves much better than the more staid Alan J. Pakula did. This may be Mann's best film as he wrestles with serious themes while making a seriously entertaining and consistently tense film.\n\nScientist Jeffrey Wigand, Russell Crowe, was employed as an executive at Big Tobacco corporation Brown & Williamson and is now willing to reveal information that would force the CEOs of the major tobacco companies to admit that they know the negative effect that cigarettes have on people. Lowell Bergman, Al Pacino, who serves as the producer of 60 Minutes attempts to coax this information out of him as Wigand's difficult personality and the breakup of his marriage complicate their interactions. A further issue is the fact that Wigand had signed a confidentiality agreement which would legally prevent him from revealing the information to the public. A segment with popular news presenter Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer, is taped but CBS refuses to run the segment under the guise of concern about the legal repercussions they could face but most likely because they want to be bought by Westinghouse, who own Brown & Williamson, in a corporate merger. In the aftermath of this event Wigand spirals out of control while Bergman desperately tries to contact him and have the information released to the public.\n\nThe film pulls the risky move of having it's perspective shift midway through the film as it turns from being a Wigand-centric film to a movie primarily concerned with journalistic ethics and Bergman's fight to have them upheld. This is where the film becomes most interesting as while the first half engages you with it's tale of Bergman slowly extracting information from an emotionally fraught Wigand the threats do not really come into play until the second act. It is there that we get a wonderful sequence that is able to plunge into the depths of despair and loss as Wigand's sacrifices have seemingly amounted to nothing while he stands alone. These are the sort of scenes we never got in similarly themed journalism movies as there is plenty of ranting and raving about the fear of losing money and the stresses it places on family members but the impact of this loss is rarely captured so closely. Mann intelligently throws all the facts that we need to know at us in the first half and then leaves us with the characters that have been slowly built up with their tensions boiling over and conflicts coming to play.\n\nMann also has the benefit of working with a stellar cast as Crowe and Pacino are reliably magnetic but Diane Venora and Plummer steal scenes in the background and add depth to characters that need to be more than plain caricature. Pacino, who I believe to be the true lead of the film, could be accused of going too far but it is fun to watch him chew scenery and here he works with a part that asks him to hold real convictions and provides him with lines worthy of an actor of his stature. Crowe is well cast as a tortured, obsessive man as he plays socially inept and volatile much better than he would in A Beautiful Mind (2001). Here he feels like a man who has lived a regular life for a long time with his personality defects only really causing problems every now and then but creating a sudden implosion for him now. One has to wonder how Plummer, a highly respected actor who would eventually get his due, was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor with competition as weak as Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999).\n\nThis isn't necessarily a film that will have fans of Miami Vice excited but for those who enjoy thrillers and films with something to say about the state of news media this will be a wholly satisfying experience.",

            "content": "As a film maker and huge mega fan of the industry, I am gobsmacked at what I just witnessed. The fact that it took me this long to even hear about, let alone witness a film of this calibre is baffling. I've loved pretty much everything Michael Mann has ever achieved with his directorial career, but here, he just creates this piece of entertainment that is raw and calculated and all sorts of grandiose that, I can confidently say, I've never ever seen anything quite like The Insider. Instead of his usual crime or thriller genre pick, Mann here decides to go for a true life story and biopic of fresh and epic proportions. Lowell Berman, is a CBS producer, on one of Americas biggest news shows, 60 Minutes. After returning from Tehran on a recent story, he stumbles across an obscure story of a man name Jeff Wigand, a former scientist and consultant for a massive tobacco company, who recently has just been fired, on false terms and he has some very big news. However when the tobacco company find out that their reputation and lively hoods are on the line, with Wigands secrets, not only can CBS not get enough of his story, but his life becomes threatened and family life destroyed, as the whistle blower, tries to do whats right. This film is a masterpiece, on so many levels. The cast, what a cast, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Rip Torn, Christopher Plummer and Michael Gambon make up just a portion of raw talent in this film and every single one of them are completely on top form, all off them, not a bad apple in the bunch. Every actor in the film lives their character and being a strong minded director about character and visualisation, Mann orchestrates this ensemble wonderfully, with time and consideration. Pacino is on fire as CBS producer Lowell, his drive, his motivation to get the truth out there is overwhelming, he delivers such a sense of emotion and passion, I actually think, this could be one of Pacino's finest moments. Crowe is just outstanding as Wigand, the man with everything to lose, his multi layered character is a sight to behold, as his family life is turned upside down and his past trudged through the mood. Equally Michael Gambon as the head of the large tobacco company, regardless of his limited screen time, is just out of this universe, he emits so much threat, so much evil and snide intentions, that his entire scene is edge of your seat, jaw dropping. And Christopher Plumber, oh my god, he just steals the screen, every single moment he is on it, literally chews it up and spits it out. He revels in every moment and his chemistry with Pacino is awe inspiring. The script is so well written, its engaging, thematic, arcing, tension filled,dialogue is real and passionate. There isnt a single flaw in any of it, its all required, it gives just the right amount of exposition, when it needs to and never more, leaving the story building and building, till our hearts cant take it any more. The actors deliver their characters and dialogue flawlessly and extra gratitude to Mann for clearly allowing these guys to go the full mile, it pays off in  every respect. The visual element, although not quite as flashy as his other work, is expertly crafted, with a wide range of colour palette and lighting. The way in which the sequences are crafted and edited together are kinetic and hypnotising, every single conversation, and there are a lot of them, just brings something new and stylistic to the table. The look and feel consistantly follow the themes and tones of whats going on, extreme close ups are used to wonderful effect, making us feel claustrophobic at times, putting us right where we want to be in the film. I havent seen this kind of cinematography ever and its wonderful, seemless and downright admirable. The use of music and choice of music is spot on, the soundtrack and score just resonate with your emotions, they pull even more out of the content, giving you a real sense of threat and helplessness as this entire debacle explodes over everyones face. Its polished, well directed, acted, producer, edited, filmed, the story is so rich with content and an utter joy to watch unravel. I literally fell deeper and deeper into every second of this film, torn apart by what was happening and transfixed on the screen, all the time. How often do you get that in a film? Not often enough, and missing this film, if you have any remote interest in the art form is a collosal mistake. It has such much texture, so much style and finesse, that it has now became one of my all time favorite films. I have nothing bad to say, its not over bloated, despite glancing over its run time, it doesnt bore, it never takes its foot of the pedal and it hits every mark it sets out to. I cant think of one thing at all to critize, and at is an achievement. If you havent seen this film, get on it right now.",

It's a thriller that relies on silence, paranoia and tension above anything else to create thrills.\n\nWhat makes this such a special thriller, to me, is the fact that Mann has shown multiple times that he can work in violent cinema to thrill, the most prominent being the legendary shootout in Heat. But this film shows that he doesn't have to.\n\nOne of the most exciting scenes of the film is two actors simply faxing back and forth. There's no dialogue, little music, and no complex editing. But the tension created by Mann keeps your eyes glued to the screen.\n\nCrowe, Pacino, Plummer, and Gambon are all brilliant in their roles, but a good actor isn't worth much without a good film to act in, and this is most certainly a film that goes above and beyond good.\n\nThis is a master class thriller that I've put off seeing for far too long. And it is now one of the finest thrillers I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.",

Even at over 150 minutes this portrait of moral courage and its heavy price never loses its grip. Pacino and Crowe are wonderful in the main roles, but the fine performances also include Christopher Plummer and Philip Baker Hall. Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke's ominous underscore and Dante Spinotti's darting camerawork are major plusses. As good as All The President's Men, Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, The Conversation etc",

            "content": "The epic rise of Russell Crowe in his winning streak of Oscar nominated films begins in this expertly crafted and intelligently directed thriller. Michael Mann directs an excellent, very urgent and powerful thriller that has a lot on its mind and is filled with excellent performances from a very expansive and brilliant cast. The way everything develops in this paranoid thriller is excellent and it all moves at a fiery pace, the script is excellent at being intelligent whilst also developing its characters very well, which is the one element most films of this type seem to forget. It's scary to see how far a business will go to protect its secrets, which is why it is probably easier to just keep them hired.\n\nThe acting in this film is outstanding with everyone giving it their all. I'm a little surprised by the amount of awards Crowe was nominated for, not because he was bad, on the contrary, he gave a very realistic performance, but it's just that he was in the film for what felt like considerably less time than Al Pacino. Then again, it's hardly like he was in a supporting role, so it makes sense. Al Pacino gave a very passionate performance and felt like he was very involved with what was going on, as did veteran Christopher Plummer and wow, speaking of Plummer, he is amazing, give that guy a great script and he does absolute wonders with it, he was very exciting to watch, even if Pacino and Plummer didn't have accents but maybe they weren't supposed to, I'm not sure, another veteran actor Phillip Baker Hall does a good job as well. The only real problem I had with the acting was Michael Gambon, while he is an excellent character actor and still did a good job here, I can't ignore his dreadful accent in this film, if it's what's the real person is reported to have sounded like, then fine, but any time he spoke it just sounded like he was drunk.\n\nThe script is, like I said, excellent and develops the story in a very realistic way but I really loved how they developed the characters. Crowe's character, Jeffery Wigand, is given so many little nuances and little remarks when he talks to his daughters or students that it just makes it so real and really, really likeable. I really felt for his character and he was immediately sympathetic, thanks in part, again, to an excellent performance from Russell Crowe. Looking at the poster, I thought Pacino would be going against Crowe and would be trying to stop him and I am very surprised with what happened; it's refreshing to see something so different- showcasing people fighting for the truth. I also thought that in the interview they would hide his face behind a bug sheet of cardboard like I have seen in other films. As is the norm for a Michael Mann film, the technicals are all amazing, the film looked and sounded excellent; the soundtrack is very varied and excellent to listen to and the film looks absolutely amazing. I could watch Russell Crowe play in the driving range all night because of how beautiful that scene looked and if Michael Mann is the director, there is no question about it and it's certainly one of the best films he has directed, it's a very different style of film for him as well. This film was also made very quickly after the real event and I bet Michael Mann was pleased when he got the rights to make this, the TV version of the film is longer than the theatrical one, too, not all that sure why though. 'The Insider', or the more fitting originally titled, 'Man Of The People', the other title is still great as well, is smart, intense, thoughtful, political and all without firing a gun, now that's the way to do a thriller.",

The film's got fine performances from it's lead actors and Russel Crowe did go through a lot of hardships to play a character far older than his real age and also to gain 35 pounds. It's cinematography is great and there's no dull moment, not to mention the style involved( if you disbelieve, then watch the final walkout scene of Pacino).",

A few scenes that really stood out. Of course, Russell Crowe & Al Pacino both did very well. Too bad this film didn't get enough commercial recognition that it deserved, but it was amongst many other great films of 1999 then.

Russell Crowe is Jeffrey Wigand; the whistleblower for a major tobacco company, who appears on the CBS investigative news program \"60 Minutes,\" to detail how chemicals are used in the product to enhance a nicotine addiction. Corporate pressure, as the result of possible litigation, forces the segment to air in modified form. Al Pacino is the news producer Lowell Bergman, who repeatedly informs his sources that they have his word that he will protect them. Michael Mann directed and co-wrote the script with Eric Roth. This is among the most intelligent depictions of journalism since \"All the President's Men.\" In the first hour, the story revolves around Crowe's hesitation about whether or not to do the interview, but in the second hour it shifts to focus on how financial implications can affect journalistic integrity. Bergman is credited as a consultant on the movie, so it is slanted to give him a favorable portrayal as the only journalist with integrity, while his colleagues are portrayed as sell-outs. It appears to be a somewhat distorted view that is hard to accept. Crowe is less physically imposing here, but he is just as commanding and more subtle than usual. He often presses his forefinger against his nose to adjust his glasses. Pacino is forceful without the histrionics. Christopher Plummer is masterly as an arrogant Mike Wallace.

The film has a sweaty paranoia throughout and the cast clearly realise that they are onto a good thing here. Crowe really digs in here and portrays Jeff Wigand with all of his contradictions, he is so good here. Then we have Pacino at his shouty best (fav scene has to be Pacino unloading at the hotel guy on the phone) who lays out cold the complex and corrupted corporate worlds that the story is based around. Christopher Plummer is awesome, making the most of the time that he has on camera, his showdown with Gina Gershon's character in particular is pure gold.\n\nFilms like this very rarely come along which is a real shame.",

            "content": "The Insider sounded great on the surface simply because it is an Al Pacino film, and finding out that it was Russell Crowe's international breakthrough performance which scored him an Academy Award nomination was just a perfect touch.\n\nAs well as being a long film, The Insider also maintains a rather slow pace over the course of its 157 minute running time which many audiences may find alienates them from maintaining interest constantly for so long. It is the serious audiences that can really appreciate it the whole time, and so if you are serious about good cinema then you should most definitely view The Insider.\nI am extremely happy that I did, because I found the film to be excellent. I did find it long and relatively slow, but I found that these elements were overshadowed by the significantly more positive elements of the film.\nMichael Mann's directional skill is at some of his best in The Insider. He goes deep inside the story and harnesses the true nature of its dramatics, excellently conveying just what enables the story to be such a thrilling one. It examines the events in the story from various perspectives, such as how it affects its characters directly has humans, the outcry that it causes on the world and just how it changes the perception of living in a universe that always favours having its people speak out against crimes. It reveals the big hypocrisy of free speech and makes audiences question if there really even is such as thing. The Insider is an incredibly intelligent drama which takes full advantage of its excellent script and turns it into the compelling and inspirational film that it deserves to be. Michael Mann manages to keep the theme of tobacco on a professional level without turning The Insider into some self-indulgent excuse for him to make a personal criticism of it, something that Oliver Stone could never do. So if Oliver Stone has two Academy Awards and Michael Mann has none, that is just ridiculous.\nThe Insider captures the true drama that it reaches for and becomes so realistic that I naturally forgot that I was watching a film as the experience unfolded before my eyes. And at the same time, I felt all the thrills of the situation. The Insider is an incredibly thrilling film and it captures the essence of drama that comes with facing massive corporations in a world dominated mostly by such corporations. And honestly, it is easy for The Insider to appeal to viewers because we have all felt at times like we have wanted to change the world but like there is someone or something out there that refuses to let us, and the true story roots behind The Insider make it all the more compelling. The true cheering inspiration behind The Insider is undeniable, and since it is a story that truly needed to be told it is excellent that Michael Mann is the man for the job. He gives it the treatment it truly deserves and intensifies it to points you would not expect. The drama in the story will seep into you and tug you from the inside, and it is a hell of a feeling. The experience of watching The Insider is one that everyone should really feel, and the kind of dramatic power that Michael Mann hands over is just incredible. His direction is at an all time best on The Insider, and he proves once again to be able to bring out the best in his cast.\nThe Insider provides a serious opportunity for Russell Crowe, because it puts him in the role of the history changing hero Jeffrey Wigand despite being not such a well known actor at the time. The man who would win the Academy Award for Best Actor the following year for his lead performance in Gladiator takes the chance and runs with it, giving it his all and making it one of his most brilliant performances to date. Instead of characterising Jeffrey Wigand as a man who won't back down, he characterises him as the realistic person that he was, and he does this through incorporating in the humanistic elements of the character which include his fear and anxiety. You can see the tension in his mind gradually develop as the story becomes more and more dramatic, and there is not a second that his dramatic talents as an actor fail to deliver on their powerful strength, and The Insider proves to the world what so many Australians knew years ago when they saw his incredible lead performance in Romper Stomper. The Insider features some of his surely greatest skills as an actor, and his lead performance is an undeniably stunning and ambitious lead which is captivating to everyone when he is on the screen. Anyone unsure of Russell Crowe's talents as an actor can look at him in The Insider and be sure that he knows what he is doing.\nAl Pacino gives a brilliant performance in The Insider. He is one of my all time favourite actors so I expected no less from him, and he completely delivered on that promised because in The Outsider he gives it his all and delivers one of his most undoubtedly excellent performances to never have nominated for an Academy Award which is crap because he really deserved a nomination for Best Supporting actor for his performance in The Insider. Despite being up against an exceptional performance by Russell Crowe, Al Pacino's many decades of acting have been building up his skills more and more. And he proves it that in his role in The Insider he refuses to back down. His performance is a restrained one which doesn't go over the top so that he uses intimidation as a tactic, when in actual fact he keeps a simple humanity and realism in his characterisation of Lowell Bergman. It is a role not too much like anything he has faced before, and it proves to be the furthest thing from a challenge for him because Al Pacino's exceptional acting talent and natural charisma make him flawless in The Insider. He really deserved an Academy Award nomination for his performance.\nThe supporting performances of Phillip Baker Hall and Christopher Plummer also provide excellent support to the film, and Diane Venora makes a dramatic impact as well. The small role portrayed by Renee Olstead is a nice touch as well.\nLastly, the visual style of the film makes it more intense because it has a lot of claustrophobic cinematography which captures the flawlessly convincing production design very nicely, and combined with a powerful musical score, The Insider is an atmospheric experience in every angle.\n\nSo in the end, The Insider has a hell of a story which is told through a combination of excellent script, powerful acting and the greatest skills as a director that Michael Mann can offer.",

            "content": "Not a Movie For Smokers\ntrevsreviews.wordpress.com\n\nMichael Mann's The Insider (1999) follows the story of Jeffery Wigand, a research chemist who has just been fired from a major tobacco company, and 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman, who is driven to release the truth about the tobacco company's \"hidden agendas.\" Al Pacino is great as always playing the producer, but it's Russell Crowe who really shines. The 35 year old actor (at the time) plays 50+ year old Jeffery Wigand in a transformational performance that's been easily over looked with credits such as Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World following it. Playing the late 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace is the terrific Christopher Plummer (who surprising looks a lot like the real person).\n\nGoing into the film, I had my reservations. Even though Michael Mann has been adored by critics, I've only been exposed to the lack luster Miami Vice and the disappointing Public Enemies which tarnished my opinion of him (I've also seen Mann's Collateral which I thoroughly enjoyed). However, The Insider changed my view of the director. This film is gripping, thought provoking, and uniquely suspenseful.\n\nNot only are the performances strong, but the muted cinematography is brilliant. The film is in color, but, as I look back on it, I see the film in black and white oddly enough. (or I just might be going crazy). The desaturated images creatively coincide with the dark, eerie tone of the film. In relation with the cinematography, the lighting is beautiful. I distinctly remember the key interview Jeffery Wigand has with Mike Wallace where Wigand's face is half in the light and half in the dark. This intriguing lighting choice effectively portrays the emotional uncertainty behind Jeffery Wigand; half of him wants to stay in the dark and not break his confidentiality agreement and the other half wants to bring the truth to the light.\n\n   The Insider is very dialogue heavy which may turn off some viewers, and the pacing is long and slow at times. The film clocks in at 2 hours and 37 minutes, which towards the end feels like you've been sitting on your couch for days.\n\nDespite the minor flaws, The Insider succeeds in providing gritty insight into big, powerful tobacco companies and the measures they will go to keep their secrets from being exposed. I highly recommend this film if you've enjoyed the classic All the President's Men or the underrated Michael Clayton. The Insider is rather unknown after being nominated for seven Academy Awards and walking away with nothing once American Beauty took everything by storm. However, I encourage people to seek this film out and, if you have the patience, immerse yourself in this highly intelligent and well crafted film.",

The battlefield is the conscience. And the heroes put themselves on the front lines for the sake of the truth. Despite having no action scenes, a 2.5 hour running time, and based around the tired subject of tobacco, The Insider manages to be one of -- if not the best corporate thriller of all time. Fascinating whistleblower story for older teens. A sobering examination of corruption, courage, cowardice, and the sometimes catastrophic costs of telling the truth. Not only is the story fascinating and intelligent...and not only is Michael Mann's directing inventive and yet down to earth, but the performances by the cast are truly excellent. this is a excellent film i recommend everyone who have not watched this film please watch it.

It's always interesting to watch A-listers playing real people and not just a \"character\". The story was interesting, the intrigue was delicious and the struggle was just heart-breaking. Unfortunately, after all the heartache and their valiant efforts it just seems that it was all for naught because even though there was a posting after the  film *****SPOILER ALERT***** that the big tobacco companies were successfully sued and had to pay billions of dollars in class action law suits; it just doesn't seem to make a difference now, tobacco is still big business and I'm sure the companies are still setting record-profits, many people still smoke and at younger age.

Some would argue that Crowe's best performances can be seen in other films like \"Gladiator\" or \"A Beautiful Mind,\" but I would argue that his role in \"The Insider\" is his best thus far as his performance showcases the physical and emotional impact that Wigand goes through as the movie progresses. Plummer does a fantastic job by capturing the essence of \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Mike Wallace. Bruce McGill, Michael Gambon and Colm Feroe are good in small, but important supporting roles. The performances aren't the only thing that elevates \"The Insider.\" Mann brings his signature directional style to life thanks to cinematographer Dante Spinotti as this film is filled with a variety of effective camera angles complete with indirect focus and intense close-ups.",

It does take it's sweet time to get going, but once it does. it becomes quite gripping and it shows all the corruption at the top of big business. When Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is fired from his job at Brown & Williamson Tobacco, he is approached by CBS News producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) to help clarify information regarding tobacco company Philip Morris, Wigand refuses because of a confidentiality agreement. Smelling a rat, Bergman asks for Wigand to go on the record and expose what really goes on behind the scenes at the big tobacco companies, and to be interviewed for CBS's 60 Minutes by Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). Wigand is relucatant, and he and his family gets death threats, but the tobacco companies aren't happy, but Bergman won't give in. Once it gets to the interview and the chicanery to try and have it stopped, it perks up and becomes quite gripping, but it's quite a build up.

The initial reason for dismissal was because of poor communication between himself and others at his workplace, although it actually otherwise. It is actually due to him knowing the contents of the produced tobacco products which included a lethal chemical called \"coumarin\" which was neglected to be acknowledged from the company and telling his bosses about that. A reporter named Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) from the TV show \"60 Minutes\" approaches him to describe his findings and whistleblowing of the tobacco company and do on air interview with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). He reluctantly does, but it comes at many costs and puts his life surprisingly in danger and \"60 Minutes\" in hot water.\r\n\r\nFascinating drama that shows Wingand as one of the few prolific individuals to come and rat on a company who was doing dangerous things to make a buck and at the same time, putting people's lives at risk even further (not cigarettes were bad for you anyway). Everyone in their performances are good and so is the story, as it even has greater relevance to me since I learned a lot about this in university since I am a business graduate (integrity is a major player for those majoring in accounting). I do have a hard time believing that the actual players in this scandal were extensive users of profanities. That seemed over dramatized (and a bit indulgent). Other than that one minor deficiency, it is still really fine film. Nice parallel with the news story of the legendary criminal, \"The Unibomber.\"",

            "content": "Unconventional, suspenseful, and unflinching, \"The Insider\" is an unforgettable corporate drama that fleshes out Michael Mann's usually artistic directing style while reminding us why Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are such good actors.  This is a drama that takes its time, and gives us an ending that's up to the viewer to decide; it's either a big payoff, or a letdown.  For me, it doesn't matter.\n\tJeffrey Wigand (Crowe) is a tobacco scientist and researcher that is abruptly fired from his job at cigarette company, Brown and Williamson.  It's instantly impossible for his family to adjust, and Wigand takes up teaching chemistry and Japanese at his high school, though he's still confused and upset.  His inconclusive story comes into contact with \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who approaches Wigand to give the scoop on what the tobacco companies are keeping from their consumers.  Wigand agrees, but as soon as he films the interview, not only is it not able to air due to lawsuit, but there's even more than meets the eye.\n\tFilmed at the height of the paranoia of the dangers of cigarettes, \"The Insider\" is still relevant today, giving us an inside (and often ugly) look at office life, celebrity, and a faltering marriage.  It's often a lot to take, but it's simply impossible to look away.  Mann has created one of his best films here, and it's certainly deserving of its seven Oscar nominations.\n\tClaustrophobia is the key to making this film so great, and Mann flaunts it.  The story is told from Bergman's point of view; therefore, it's frustrating, suspenseful, and filled to the brim with anger.  At two-and-a-half hours, the film moves along with utter realism, and keeps the viewer trapped in this nightmare just as much as the suffering characters on the inside.\n\tCrowe is riveting; his character is supposedly supposed to be a hero, yet he's so flawed and has made so many mistakes in the past, it makes us wonder.  This is one of his best performances, not necessarily because it's showy, but because he's subdued and provides us with a main character in anguish.  Christopher Plummer as well, keeps our eyes glued to the screen, especially since he portrays Mike Wallace, a man we all know and admire, as a selfish and manipulative boss.  But the real treasure once again is Pacino, who plays a man under so much pressure, so wronged in his life, that you can't help but root for his character, even though he plays a character that we usually hates in movies.  The cast together is simply superb-- it would be even more fair to credit all of them with giving great performances.\n\t\"The Insider\" is compelling and constantly dramatic, the basic ingredients needed to make a great movie.
