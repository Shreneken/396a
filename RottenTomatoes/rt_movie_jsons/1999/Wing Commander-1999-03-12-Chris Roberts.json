            "content": "A fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie. This is one of the few movies I really like David Warner. When he is good, he is great. Although, this is not a big part for him, it suited him very well. I dont know what is up with Jürgen Prochnow. His best part was in Dune. I have not seen anything as good as that yet and this just takes away from his persona. David Suchat, hmmm, I did not like his part in this, but that might be a good thing for his character. I'm undecided since I really did not care for him in this movie. Freddie, Matthew, Saffron, and Tchéky with David, were a great mix that made this movie. I liked the background and interaction with the present in the movie. I have not seen the video game so my opinion might have been different otherwise, but as a new viewer to this movie, It was a refreshing change in Sci Fi that told a good story.",

            "content": "I spent several decades avoiding this film because I thought it would be horrible but it's actually not that bad! There are three major flaws that I'm guessing most people can't get over. The first is a handful of illogical moments that happen because the movie needs drama to occur. The second is the Kilrathi design. I get that they didn't want to make them cute-and-cuddly like in the video game - likely  because they didn't want the audience to empathize with them, so instead they made them \"scary generic\" - but it just sorta falls flat. The third is, of course, the  cast. I actually feel like most of the cast did a decent job here, but Freddy Prince Jr., who plays the lead...let's just say  that when you are being upstaged by Matthew Lillard, you probably shouldn't be the movies lead. To be fair, this would be the character that you play in the game, so he pulls off that bland \"every man\" type, but in the movie he comes off as TOO bland. Other than that, the plot to the movie is serviceable...if not slightly jumbled... and the film doesn't really overstay its welcome. There are some nice space-combat action scenes. Despite not using the theme from the game - which is a classic ;) - the David Arnold score is quite good and Arnold is exactly who you'd want to score to a sci-fi space move like this. I'm actually surprised at how competent this move is considering that it's Chris Robert's first movie and that Hollywood was actually willing to give some video game nerd money to make a movie in the late 90s (those experimental days are long gone, I'm afraid). I think perhaps people are disappointed because the writing and characters in the original games are much better than what's put on display here - hell, even the ship design and costumes were better in the games - but it's not a bad way to waste 90 minutes, so long as you know what you are getting into and aren't coming from the video games expecting some grand, elegant sci-fi epic. I think the movie's greatest fault is that, like most vg adaptations, it suffers from video game was better sydrome",

This film isn't very good, which is a shame since the series it's based on relied heavily on VAs and was about as film-like as it was possible for a game to be. And some of this does translate on screen with a somewhat developed backstory and naval structure. The problem is that they either introduce this material clumsily or omit to explain it altogether. For example, Blair, our lead, is discriminated against because of his race (being a white male sure is tough) and has been his whole life. And yet he seems surprised by it here, and even has to ask his boss what his people did that made them so disliked. That's better than the universe's backstory. All we really know is that mankind is at war.\n\nThe basic idea is cool: naval combat in space. This can be taken to stupid extremes (staying quiet so the enemy can't hear you? In space?) but it offers us a great chance for military scifi. Some of the space scenes are kinda cool. They actually reminded me of BSG in a way, which is quite a compliment. Unfortunately, the graphics, while sometimes pretty, never come close to being believable. And we're not given enough information to know how all this combat works. It's technical without being intuitive. The ships are also too similar and unimaginative. We can't tell hero from villain.\n\nThe film also has a terrible case of 90sitis. The lead characters are bland pretty boys and it's just filled with loud yet harmless testosterone. They also have the standard wild dog pilot, whose reckless behavior puts everyone in danger yet we're to accept as youthful good spirits. Yuck.

            "content": "Although its aliens resemble varmints, \"Wing Commander\" emerges as a predictable but entertaining \"Star War\" clone distinguished by Digital Anvil's dazzling special effects, Oscar winner Peter Lamont's atmospheric production designs, and a first-class supporting cast. While his directorial film debut lacks originality, director Chris Roberts shows adequate ingenuity in his treatment of venerable science-fiction clichÃ©s and conventions. \"Wing Commander\" recycles enough surefire elements from \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek 2,\" \"Top Gun,\" \"Starship Troopers,\" and \"The Hunt for Red October\" to satisfy hardcore sci-fi fans. Starring Freddie (\"She's All That\") Prinze Jr., and Matthew (\"Scream\") Lillard, \"Wing Commander\" charts the course of two audacious starship fighter pilots fresh out of the Confederation academy who find themselves thrown into the middle of an intergalactic war. The year is 2654. Earth is at war with the xenophobic Kilarthi, an ancient alien race of felines with retractable Freddy Krueger claws that resolve to obliterate the planet when diplomatic solutions fail.\n\nFreshman director Chris Roberts and scenarist Kevin (\"Mortal Combat\") Droney launch the action with a devastating Kilarthi surprise attack on Pegasus, a secret Confederation outpost in an asteroid chain. The attack resembles the Japanese 'sneak' attack on Pearl Harbor, only instead of the U.S. Pacific Fleet getting destroyed, the Confederation's Vega System Fleet gets wiped out while in dry dock. The bad guys secure a fabled navigational device which will enable them to attack Earth before the Confederation can stop them.\n\nMeanwhile, Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn (David Warner of \"Titanic\") relays a coded transmission to a freighter in route to the closest hope for Earth's survival: the aircraft carrier style starship Tiger Claw. Tolwyn entrusts the message to the son of a war hero, Chris 'Maverick' Blair. When he arrives aboard the Tiger Claw, Blair receives a chilly response from the second-in-command, Captain Gerald (Jurgen Prochnow of \"Beverly Hills Cop 2\"), who mistrusts the rookie pilot because he is a half-breed whose mother was an infamous Pilgrim.\n\nAccording to Droney's expository rich screenplay, the Pilgrims explored the far corners of the universe first and cultivated unique genetic powers which allowed them to navigate through space time anomalies without the aid of computers. The Pilgrims, however, grew proud and arrogant. Eventually, they revolted against their fellow Earthlings, fought a terrible war, and became hated until their race died out. The point is that speed matters in the story, and Chris Blair knows which short cuts to take through space to beat the Kilrathi before they reach Earth. Blair's identity crisis lies at the heart of the action. Until this predicament, Blair knew nothing about either his Pilgrim heritage or his special qualities.\n\nSadly, everything falls apart when the villain storm onto the screen. Adventure movies live and die on the strength of their villains. The Kilrathi qualify as the all-time worst science fiction villains since \"The Green Slime\" back in 1968. Resembling \"Karate Kid\" star Pat Morita from the neck up, they dress like the cast of the Broadway musical \"Cats\" in tacky Naugahyde green suits from the neck down. Prudently, Roberts and Droney have pared down the screen time devoted to the Kilrathi to the absolute minimum. One glimpse at these farcical foes is enough to undermine either any suspense or credibility that \"Wing Commander\" generates during its trim PG-13 rated running time of 100 minutes.\n\nQuestions left unanswered about the Kilrathi may annoy some audiences. Who are the Kilrathi? Where did they come from? Why are they so determined to destroy Earth? Practically the only thing intimidating about the Kilrathi is the way their name sounds when anybody utters it.\n\nWhat differentiates \"Wing Commander\" from the standard \"Star Wars\" clone is its anachronistic but novel hardware designs. Although its hackneyed story occurs in the 27th century, the Confederation deploys comparatively low-tech arsenals of bullets and torpedoes rather than high-tech lasers to battle the Kilrathi. Peter Lamont, who won an Oscar fro his production designs on \"Titanic,\" models the space fighters on the gull-wing Chance-Vought Corsairs of World War II rather than the Tie fighter or X-Wing craft of \"Star Wars.\" The space cruisers in \"Wing Commander\" have an antiquated but grungy look that links them with other notably grungy sci-fi thrillers such as \"Outland,\" the \"Alien\" franchise, and \"Event Horizon.\" Altogether, it is nothing new, but \"Wing Commander\" generates a lot of atmosphere with its retro-space look.\n\nSo obsessed is \"Wing Commander\" creator Chris Roberts with World War II technology that he shuns the usual Buck Rogers paraphernalia. An interstellar fight between the Tiger Claw and a Kilrathi vessel is staged like a confrontation between pirate ships.\n\nLike \"Starship Troopers,\" \"Wing Commander\" boasts independent, strong-willed female characters that don't flinch at the sight of blood and violence. Saffron (\"Circle of Friends\") Burrows is cast as the tight-lipped, dry ice title character, Jeanette 'Angel' Marshall who suffers nobody's insolence. She believes that they are all living on borrowed time, and the idealistic Blair does his best to refute that thinking. Burrows' sullen good looks and sexy Emma Peel presence make you forget about the laughable Kilrathi. Ginny Holden's daredevil fighter pilot make a memorable impression, too.\n\nTolerant sci-fi audiences will appreciate this serviceable sci-fi saga more than discriminating adults that expect more from Hollywood science fiction outings. \"Wing Commander\" has enough good things going for it so that its threadbare plot and enigmatic hairball villains don't sabotage it. Top lenser Thierry Arbogast, who filmed \"The Fifth Element,\" bolsters \"Wing Commander\" with his exhilarating widescreen cinematography. Arbogast's stirring long shots of space vehicles zipping past planets to vanish into the distant vistas of stars makes \"Wing Commander\" a treat for the eyes. Kevin Kiner's rousing orchestral score, that David \"Independence Day\" Arnold helped compose, give the action a dignity and stature that it otherwise would lack.\n\nSure, the dog-eared scenario of \"Wing Commander\" has been replicated ad nauseam, but director Chris Roberts' generally competent helming of this $27-million production makes it worth watching once.",

            "content": "\"Wing Commander\" is based on a popular computer game series from Origin Systems. Unfortunately, this film does not match the quality of the games. The problem is simple: the film did not include the elements that made the games successful. Rather than hiring the cast featured in the games led by Mark Hamill and featuring names such as John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm McDowell, the makers of the film opted to hire a completely separate cast. Freddie Prinze Jr. was sub-par in contrast to Mark Hamill's performance as Christopher Blair in the games. The character of Todd Marshall was brash in the game series, but Matthew Lillard's performance makes the character unbearably annoying and obtuse. However, Saffron Burrows actually gives a decent performance and is the best of the three leads. The best talent was in the supporting cast, with Jürgen Prochnow as Commander Gerard, David Suchet as Captain Sansky and David Warner as Admiral Tolwyn. Tchéky Karyo also does a decent job as James Taggart. Seeing the performances of the supporting cast was often more enjoyable than seeing the leads.\n\nThe plot of the film was extremely simplistic compared to the plots in the game series. The Kilrathi (who look no where near as majestic in the game series) are underdeveloped compared to the game series and no Kilrathi characters are featured in the film. The Kilrathi don't even engage in any sort of intrigue, the extent of their activity is to move toward Earth and attack human ships.\n\nThe main characters are developed, but most of their interactions seem juvenile. Another poor plot decision was the introduction of the \"Pilgrim\" subplot, where the lead character is a \"Pilgrim\", meaning he has special abilities in space navigation. It seems that the makers of the film thought that they needed to add this dimension because it would lead to drama in the film not in the game. Unfortunately, the \"Pilgrim\" subplot always seems contrived and the film would have been better simply focusing on what made the game series interesting: tactics and intrigues in the war between humans and Kilrathi.\n\nWhere this film is better is in its action scenes. These are actually well-shot and some nice space combat battles were developed as would be expected from a \"Wing Commander\" film. The battles around the \"Tiger Claw\" and the Kilrathi pursuit of Blair in his fighter were actually the best parts of the film. Overall, though, this film does not match the game series it purports to emulate.",

(Mark Hammill was even cast as the main character when they began incorporating live-action cut-scenes into the game, forever cementing the connection.)\r\n\r\nSo one can understand that when Chris Roberts decided to bring it to the big screen, he felt the need to make changes to the Wing Commander franchise to differentiate it more from the Star Wars franchise -- thus the clunky WW2 fighter designs and naval-style battles. Although this works fine on film, it really changes the look and feel of the franchise completely, giving nothing for fans of the amazing games to connect with... and lets face it, fans of the games were really the core target audience (or should have been!)\r\n\r\nThe whole added subplot about the \"Pilgrims\" -- something not found in the games -- felt a little bit like a rip-off of Star Wars' \"The Force\" in a way, too (that is, as we understood the Force before The Empire Strikes Back): a plot device to give the main character a special power to set him apart from the other characters. Again, it works okay, but I wish Roberts had taken all the time spent talking about the Pilgrims and used it instead to flesh out the enemy Kilrathi, who were much more interesting and fully-realized characters in the video games. (Though admittedly, the budget probably wouldn't have allowed that much time with the creature effects.)\r\n\r\nIt's bound to be a disappointment for fans of the video game franchise upon which it was based, simply because it had so little in common -- and because the video games themselves featured more well-known actors, such as Mark Hammill, Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies and Tom Wilson.\r\n\r\nBut in the end, it still makes a fine sci-fi film, well worth watching if you're flipping channels and find it on television, or renting if you are a fan of the sci-fi genre or any of the film's actors.",

            "content": "[font=Comic Sans MS]As a general rule, video game movies suck. Let's examine some examples; [i]BloodRayne[/i], [i]Resident Evil, Doom[/i], etc. The only clear exception is the [i]Tomb Raider[/i] films. Those were at least interesting, enjoyable action movies. For the most part people put 1999's [i]Wing Commander[/i] into the first category. While I agree the movie wasn't worthy of any awards, I at least found it enjoyable for its plot and special effects.\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr. plays Lieutenant (or Leftenant if you're like the bazillion Brits in the movie) Christopher Blair, a fighter pilot fresh out of the academy looking for his shot in the intergalactic war threatening mankind. Joined by his arrogant hotshot flying mate (Matt Lillard), the two are forced into high octane, intense battle sequences that, while fun to watch, try too hard to be [i]Star Wars[/i] when, let's face it, there's no comparison between the two. Overall the premise of the movie is clever and shows potential to be a truly good, if not great, science fiction film. And unlike with VG movies, even the bad or mediocre sci-fi movies are sometimes fun to watch.\n\nWhere this movie falters is its dialogue and the somewhat lack of connection to the characters. While it's easy to find Prinze Jr. as Blair likable and Lillard as \"Maniac\" Marshall is fun to watch for both his smartass antics and his obnoxious side, at no point in the movie do you really find yourself caring about their success. You might root for them as you would any \"good guy\", but because you expect them to succeed in the end anyway, you're never really concerned even when the characters are in \"grave\" danger. And as for the writing, at its high points its tolerable. At its low points it makes the dialogue in [i]Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith[/i] sound like [i]Casablanca[/i]. So while its true the movie will inevitably be relegated to the discount bins and high-triple-digit movie channels, [i]Wing Commander[/i] is at the very least a fun space shooter.\n\nFINAL GRADE: 6/10. There's stuff to like, but its not worth abandoning a trip to a galaxy far, far away.\n\n==TJ==\n[/font]",

Unfortunately, when a movie fails to hit the target this badly anythig good it might have done will get overlooked.  I thought the missile/torpedo special effects were fantastic.  Ya, I guess that's about it.[/size][/font]\n[font=Times New Roman][size=4][/size][/font] \n[font=Times New Roman][size=4]The script was bad, the directing was amateur and the Kilrathi make-up/effects were so lame it would have been better to just not show them.

            "content": "I love this movie. Its not a popular position to take but the movie is fun, funny and fresh. A realisticly looking SciFi unlike the Star Wars movies where even the dirt looks clean. The movie is the creation of a director outside the normal Hollywood group and it was easy for the critics to take pot shots at it without repercussions. Chris Roberts, the director, was the leading pioneer of CGI in the early 90s. It is based on the Wing Commander game that was played in DOS before the first Windows interface program was even created. He brought to his 'Wing Commander: Heart of the Tiger' game one of the first interactions and blending of Computer generated characters and backgrounds with live action actors. Two of the actors in the game were Mark Hamill and John Rys Davies. When movie producers and directors, such as Peter Jackson, saw Chris Roberts CGI for the first time they knew that stories could be told on film that were impossible to make before. Wing Commander fans are called 'Wingnuts' and that is what inspired 'Wingnut Films.'. Have some respect for this computer programmer, Chris Roberts, take a second look at this film. The flight scenes, much of the interiors and many special effects are the among the first movie computer generated graphics that have now brought to the public so many amazing films.",
