    "summary": "In this feature film based on the hit animated series, the third graders of South Park sneak into an R-rated film by ultra-vulgar Canadian television personalities Terrance (Matt Stone) and Phillip (Trey Parker), and emerge with expanded vocabularies that leave their parents and teachers scandalized. When outraged Americans try to censor the film, the controversy becomes a call to war with Canada, and Terrance and Phillip end up on death row -- with only the kids left to save them.",

That doesn't mean I can't have a good time with comedies though. I had a good time with this but I've seen better comedic movies. The jokes and the curse words were hilarious. Especially in the first half of the movie. Where it started to lose me was when it really started to drag out. It felt really long even for an hour and twenty minutes movie.

            "content": "Divertida y obscena, esta es m√°s que solo una de las mejores pel√≠culas animadas para adultos. Se siente como otro episodio de la serie, pero a un nivel m√°s alto en comparaci√≥n con las primeras temporadas. Esta pel√≠cula juega con la s√°tira y parodia tomando muchos elementos de las pel√≠culas animadas infantiles del momento dando como resultado una ingeniosa cinta que rompe la imagen de las pel√≠culas animadas como algo infantil aunque en el pasado han existido obras que hicieron lo mismo. Escuchar a los protagonistas putear mucho es un deleite y la banda sonora es muy linda. Lo mejor que m√°s se destaca de esta pel√≠cula es su concepto ya que refleja lo muy extremistas que pueden ser los padres de familia al querer censurar o boicotear algo creyendo que le hacen un bien a los ni√±os sin tener en cuenta que eso conlleva a la censurar la libertad de expresi√≥n y el arte. Es algo bastante reflexivo que se lo puede comparar con las quejas de los padres tanto en el pasado como en la actualidad al querer culpar a los artistas o creadores de dicho contenido cuando son los padres los que tienen que supervisar lo que los ni√±os consumen. Aqu√≠ todo es llevado a un nivel exagerado, pero tiene un punto muy claro. Es como si esta pel√≠cula ser parodiara a si misma al ser una cinta de aspecto infantil que puede llegar a ser controversial para los padres. Es una pel√≠cula muy ingeniosa en ese aspecto que supo jugar muy bien con la hipocres√≠a de los padres de familia y la censura en el arte cinematogr√°fico mezclado con el t√≠pico humor de South Park. No es descabellado pensar que esta pel√≠cula claramente transmite un mensaje ya que la censura y controversia extrema que refleja es algo que muchas veces ocurri√≥ antes y podr√≠a ocurrir de nuevo. Por todo ello, esta pel√≠cula es una de las mejores cosas que South Park ha tra√≠do para mostrar a trav√©s de su s√°tira y humor otra de las muchas cosas que suceden en nuestra realidad. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es 9/10.",

The jokes are continual and often very funny and the message, for those willing to listen to such a message, is crystal clear.

            "content": "The law requires that I begin this review by saying that South Park is an extremely hilarious and sharp satire. However, it's gratuitous violence and bold, inappropriate jokes might not appeal to everyone. Now, I am not a big fan of musicals, and at the time I was not a fan of South Park. I came across this little gem at my movie renting store and without previous knowledge of the show, I rented it. When I found out that the film was also a musical I thought I would cringe at the songs or the musical numbers. Turns out it was one of the most innovative (Guinness Record for most swearing in an animated movie), exhilarating and sharp animated satires I have ever seen. The plot is your typical South Park episode extended to an one and a half hour preposterous adventure. The main characters Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny sneak into an R rated Canadian movie. Their fragile little minds are exposed to swearing, toilet humor and offensive jokes that they spread all around the town. Their mothers, instead of punishing them, decide to start a war against Canada. The kids, with the help of their friends, form a team called The Resistance in order to save the Canadians responsible for the movie and stop the war while Kenny (Who dies in the middle of the movie, what a surprise) tries to stop a prophecy in which Satan and Saddam Hussein (???) will emerge from the dephts of Hell and rule the world. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS STUFF? It is so preposterous that every scene keeps you interested and invested (let's not forget the surprisingly touching ending). The obvious subjects that it satirizes are the Rating System, bad parenting and the Disney Renaissance, a time when Disney was productive and produced well known musicals and animated films, as well as some scenes from movies such as A Clockwork Orange. All of these subjects, some of which still relevant, are presented in the film with such skill that they can be comprehended by everyone and be funny to anyone. It probably goes without saying that the voice cast (mostly Trey Parker and Matt Stone) do an excellent job with impeccable voice over that conveys feelings to the viewer. All of these are topped by the movie's strongest asset: the music. Remember when I told you I would cringe at the songs? Well, I was wrong. They. Were. Glorious. The movie starts with Mountain Town, a very subtle and beautiful song, continues with Uncle Fucka, probably one of the best musical songs I have ever heard, Blame Canada which was nominated for a Best Song Academy Award, and others. The animation is fine, I guess, for South Park standards. Overall, this movie is a must for everyone who adores satires, South Park, good songs and bold jokes. The half star I cut will be for some gross out humor that didn't appeal to me and the animation that was a little crude for its time. 4.5/5",

Now over twenty years old, its full frontal assault somehow feels no less fresh and relevant than it did upon its release.\n\nAmong its many elite strengths, it's the debauched manipulation of the musical genre that distinguishes this \"South Park\" vehicle from other satires, parodies and spoofs, and even from the \"South Park\" TV series itself: Its songs are relentless, hysterical in bite, and enter the ear cloaked like wolves in sheep's clothing.\n\nWhile certainly arguable, \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" may have found its prolific creators at the absolute height of their powers.

            "content": "What little I‚Äôve seen of South Park has never made me laugh. Perhaps if I came across it when I was in middle school that kind of humor where the fact that there is a lot of foul language from kids would make me laugh. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was just taking the show concept to its ultimate conclusion without the restriction of censors, and even referencing itself. So it‚Äôs an inappropriate movie making fun of how inappropriate movies are treated as dangerous. It‚Äôs also a musical for some reason. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why it would break into song occasionally, but I guess the one compliment I can pay the movie is that the songs had catchy tunes which I could see becoming earworms. One thing that has always bugged me is that the art style is awful to a distracting degree. I know it‚Äôs all kind of intentional, but I don‚Äôt like looking at it and find it annoying that characters all look the same aside from their clothes. I know there are others who love this cartoon, and even think this film is brilliant, but I struggle to see why something like this is praised and The Happytime Murders crashed-and-burned critically and at the box office. In both cases it feels like the primary source of humor is just being crass, but because it comes from the innocent mouths of children in a cartoon (or puppets) we‚Äôre supposed to laugh. I think the self-referential nature of this movie might make it resonate more for people, and maybe they are bringing positive emotions from their enjoyment of the show to their opinion of this film as well. But this kind of comedy does nothing for me, so when I was watching South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut instead of enjoying myself I was mostly bored. It was kind of shocking to see the movie was only 80 minutes long, because I kept thinking it was dragging on too long, like a 30-minute episode of their show spread thin into a feature film.",

            "content": "South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut certainly lives up to its name. The famous television show hits the big screen with higher stakes, a feature length runtime, and a boatload of swearing and violence. While the high stakes introduce a few moments that feel one-note, and the runtime causes the film to drag by the third act, it's an enjoyable experience, especially for fans of the show.\n\nComing from show creators and satire masters Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the film appropriately places censorship, especially in Hollywood, as its main target: how fitting for a film that battled with the MPAA up until two weeks before its release. It's something that seems to work better as an idea than in the film's actual execution, but Parker and Stone take a lot of sharp jabs here: one particular joke about the MPAA not caring about gratuitous violence but being offended by foul language is bafflingly true (even if the film holds a world record for most foul language in an animated film) . Parker and Stone clearly knew this going into the film, and they push it to the limit. Characters are gratuitously killed, but it's only the language that offends, both within and outside the movie.\n\nCensorship is the main target, but not the only one. Parker and Stone are always up to tackle multiple ideas and themes, and they do so here. The film is full of musical sequences, clearly parodying not just the likes of Les Miserables and other classics, but also the Alan Menken animated musicals that dominated the 90s. From the intro song \"Mountain Town\" to the Oscar nominated \"Blame Canada\", the songs are all truly catchy. \"Blame Canada\" is particularly effective in that it's making jest of our instinctive nature to blame anyone but ourselves for problems that pop up in life. Even South Park itself gets a dig from Parker and Stone, as they pack in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the show's crude animation style.\n\nThere are things that don't work so well though. A subplot involving one character arriving in Hell and finding Satan and Suddam Hussain to be lovers is initially amusing, but loses its luster as Parker and Stone fail to do anything with it. The film also starts to drag towards the end, despite running just 81 minutes. There's a lot of filler here to push it to feature length, and it's very identifiable filler. These are just minor problems though: overall, the film is sure to entertain, whether it's for the satire or simply more shenanigans from these beloved characters, now in their first feature film.",

Sure, it's offensive, satirical, and has laughs throughout, but it's stretched out and can't maintain its hilarity. \n\nIf you are a fan of the show, you will like this movie. It's clever at points, has good laughs, and contains the happy, little, quiet mountain town we all know and love.\n\nIf you have never seen this show, well.... You might be surprised by all the offensive, vulgar things it contains. I recommend you give the show a chance to see if the humor is your cup of tea before you view this movie.\n\nThe plot is a bit clever. The 4 boys go see the new Terrance and Phillip movie (T & P is a Canadian cartoon in the show) and see all it's crude humor. The movie is R-rated so they had to sneak in with a homeless man that pretended to be their guardian. While everyone in the theater is repulsed, the boys adore it. They end up quoting the movie, telling their classmates, and buying the merchandise. One of the mother's hears these things and forms a group called \"Mothers Against Canada\" which leads to an all out war between the US and Canada.\n\nIt does play satire on censorship, freedom of speech,  and how kids mimic what they see and hear. The film does this great. In addition to this, they also have musical numbers. They have hilarious songs such as \"Kyle's Moms a Bitch\" and \"Blame Canada\". The cussing is off the charts and there is some clever writing.\n\nHowever, the film goes on for too long and has trouble filling up the time. It, surprisingly, gets old after a while. I probably would've liked it more if this was a 2 episode thing. I was actually getting bored watching it at points! There's all these cuss words, offensive jokes, racist jokes, and everything in the book and yet it got pretty old. This has happened with other TV shows jumping to the big screen. The problem is that it doesn't know how to sustain the laughs and plot throughout the movie. Yes, it's daring that they poked fun at a lot of things at the time, but that doesn't always make it entertaining enough. \n\nI love South Park and have watched every episode and catch the reruns often, but this movie isn't one I'd watch more than a couple of times. As I said in the beginning, it is like a \"just ok\" episode stretched into an 80 minute long film. \n\nI recommend a watch just to see the satire and some of the jokes, but I, as a die-hard fan of South Park, will understand if you don't like this film.",

In what category does \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut fall into?\nWhen the new Terrence & Philip movie arrives to South Park Stan, Kenny, Kyle and Cartman sneak into the theater to watch it. After seeing the film, the boys start to swear constantly thus worrying their parents. \nThe idea of making a feature film about one of the most controversial shows of recent times is ballsy and extremely risky, but fortunately Trey Parker and Matt Stone managed to make a film that captures the spirit of the show. \"Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" has that controversial raw and rude humor that characterizes the series, the creators knew that they needed to take advantage of the film¬¥s running time so they took the comedy to eleven, sure it is extremely dated but that doesn't means it's not funny, the film is hilarious if you like the show (otherwise why did you watch this film). It also has a gigantic amount of references/parodies of Les Mis√©rables and the majority of Disney¬¥s Renaissance, the story is exactly what you would expect from South Park (a dumb mess at first look but in reality a bold and rude satire of USA¬¥s society that just keeps getting sillier as the film goes on), and the songs are extremely catchy and hilarious (I was shock to learn that the Academy nominated \"Blame Canada\", it is a hilarious and unforgettable song)  . There really isn't a lot to say about this film, this is an extended South Park episode with a relevant message and hilarious moments/characters. \n\"South Park. Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" is a film that will satisfy the fans of Stone and Parker¬¥s creation (like myself). It is big, silly, the social commentary works, and it offers some of the most memorable moments in the entire franchise.",

This film is a great part of the series. This film is so funny. From beginning to end this film is absolutely hilarious, it's so funny, just like the show. The writing for this film is amazing, it's brilliant writing and suprisingly very smart. The animation for this film is great it's a very distinctive style and really good. This film also has a really good message about freedom of speech which is really great. There are quite a few songs in the TV show but in this movie it's full of songs. All the songs are great and very catchy especially Terrence and Phillip's song 'Uncle Fucker'. Just like the show this film is very offensive, there are some really racist moments which will offend some but it's South Park what do you expect. This film is really well paced, it's goes so quick however it still leaves a big impression. This film also has loads of great characters in it. Most of them get lots of great moments, however I wish characters like Butters, Token, Officer Barbrady, Randy and Principle Victoria had more to do. The mothers against Canada organisation is really funny and while you are rooting against them they are still funny to watch. If I had any problems with the film it's that it's really short. However that's my only problem really. Also this films jokes don't always hit bullseye but most of them do work. There are a few more minor problems but that's it really. Overall this is a great film and perfect for any South Park lovers, if you love the TV show you will love this movie. B+",

Having watched the show forever, South Park is a funny animated feature that packs plenty of crude gags, outstanding musical scores, and bitting political and social satire. What I love about this movie is that it doesn't have any restraints, it's not afraid to push the boundaries between suitable for theaters and making a well crafted comedy.

            "content": "This American animated musical comedy is really something else! Based on the animated television series South Park, it is produced and co-written by its creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are starring in it as well. The film was directed and co-scored by Parker and co-written by their South Park collaborator Pam Brady, and co-starred Mary Kay Bergman, and Isaac Hayes as Chef. It features twelve songs by Parker and Marc Shaiman with additional lyrics by Stone. There is so many things to enjoy, but I always like the best the satire of our society presented in the most politically incorrect way possible - real trademark for South Park!\r\n\r\nThis time film is largely concerned with the issues of censorship and freedom of speech and doesn't spare anyone - from Disney films released during the Disney Renaissance to musicals such as the West End's Les Mis√©rables... but the best part is when satirizes the controversy surrounding the show itself. The story of the four boys from South Park (Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski and Eric Cartman) who see a controversial R-rated movie featuring Canadians Terrance and Phillip and begin cursing incessantly as a result, was very funny. Escalated slowly, starting from their parents pressuring the United States to wage war against Canada for corrupting their children. The movie also heavily hits the Motion Picture Association of America, with a reason... Parker and Stone battled the MPAA throughout the production process and the movie received an R rating just two weeks prior to its release.\r\n\r\nThe song \"Blame Canada\" earned Parker and Marc Shaiman a 1999 nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Song. I have it imprinted in my head! And, can you believe it, Kenny's entire face was revealed for the first time. Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as \"the laughiest movie of the summer,\" and promoted it in such a way that South Park is completely against. Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. \"It was war,\" said Stone in 2000. \"They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is plenty of this in the movie. Don't miss it!",

            "content": "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is a film that I was quite nervous to see at first. I have seen the television series and I was expecting lots of funny stuff from Trey Parker and Matt Stone. To be completely honest, this movie was extremely funny, but there were a couple of things that made me stop the movie at first.\n\nLet's start with the animation. The animation is swell by South Park standards. The amount of detail put into the movie was phenomenal, and I thought it really set the mood for a true movie based on an awesome television series. I was also surprised by the occasional pop-ups of CGI because I have not seen a lot of CGI coming from the show itself, and I thought it made the movie even more special. But, that is not all that I have to say about this movie.\n\nThe songs. Holy cow, the songs. Not only were they incredibly catchy, but they really brought my attention back to the movie whenever I was losing focus. The songs really fit in at appropriate times, whether funny or emotional. My favorite song overall has to be \"What would Brian Boitano Do?\" because of the effort put into the lyrics and the singing. The singing was so spot-on that I could not even hear the lyrics because I was dancing along to the music itself.\n\nThe final thing I would like to touch upon is the story and characters. This is the part that I thought the movie lacked. I know that the moral of the story is to teach people that swearing is not the worst thing in the world, but it is not very cool to be promoting this to anyone at all. However, I will praise the creators for writing up a story that got me laughing for too long. The one thing I will say about the characters is that Kenny seemed out of character, but not in the actions he did, but in the stuff that happens to him. In the television series, he comes back to life the next episode after he dies in the previous episode, but it did not happen in the movie. He just up and died and became a side character. I think that Kenny should have had a bigger part in the movie because he was almost treated like a very important side character, and that is not what Kenny is. He's a main character, and he is my favorite South Park character so far (Next to Cartman).\n\nIn conclusion, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut may not teach a moral in a very proper way, but it has wonderful songs, a touching story, and the animation that makes it a true South Park film. If you are an adult, and you don't mind swearing every now and then, I would recommend giving this film a try. You will not be disappointed.",

Trey Parker and Matt Stone jumped on those opportunities and now we have this film. Surprisingly enough, the music is really, really awesome. Each song is both funny and pleasant to listen to.

Teachers and parents are outraged and Kyle's mom has even went so far to wage war against Canada. The kids must choose defending their comedy heroes or facing their mothers' wishes.\nThis movie is pretty good, it's got a good censorship message and there were a few parts I chuckled at, there were some smart moments in the film, but I've seen much better 30 minute episodes of the show than an hour and a half movie of it. One thing that annoyed me was the Satan/Saddam plotline that didn't feel needed or apply the storyline, but otherwise, it was good. I'd suggest skipping this one and watching a much funnier and short episode of the show, but for SP fans, definitely see it because regular fans will not be disappointed.",

Terrence and Phillip end up in jail for corrupting America's youth. In revenge, the Canadians kills the Baldwin brothers. This declares war between America and Canada.

It's crude and dark sense of humor aren't for everyone, however. \n\nPLOT:In the town of South Park, we focus on four good friends: Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski (Matt Stone), Eric Cartman (Trey Parker), and Kyle McCormick, whom you probably already know by now. These four friends sneak into the movie of their choice, the Terrance and Phillip movie. However, these four learn horrible language that infects their classmates and puts the parents of South Park into a raging fit. So, the parents of South Park go on a rampage to make sure Terrance and Phillip and their Canadian race are destroyed. However, a sinister plan is going into effect involving Satan and Saddam Hussein. It's a good plot for South Park executed fairly well. \n\nVOICES:The voice acting in this movie is the basic standard for South Park and it's pretty good and fitting. As usual, Trey Parker and Matt Stone do most of the voices for the characters in the film, including Kyle, Eric, Mr. Garrison, Kenny, and more. Aside these two, the movie has vocal appearances from George Clooney, Eric Idle, Dave Foley, and Mike Judge. The other shiners besides al these would be Mary Kay Bergman as a lot of the moms and Isaac Hayes as Chef. \n\nSCORE:The soundtrack of the movie is pretty funny and catchy. There are crude little songs laced all-throughout. Some are annoying, yet again, a lot of them are catchy and get stuck in your head. I liked a handful of them. \n\nANIMATION:The animation in here is the standard style of animation always used in South Park. It isn't the best anyone will ever see, but if you've seen South Park before, you'll know that the animation is a key part to how the show and movie work. The animation is actually pretty fun and detailed for this South Park adventure. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This movie was pretty funny, though very crude. There are many moments placed throughout that are gut-bustingly funny, as well as many actually good pop culture jokes. It also has a special brand of charm that appears to the fans of South Park that sets up a child-like innocence and then shatters it with a good joke. However, this one is pretty much for the fans of dirty, black comedy and the show of the same name. The crude and nasty style isn't appreciated by everybody. Also, there were a couple of jokes and running gags in here that really failed to make me laugh and actually kind of disturbed me. Overall, it's a pretty funny movie, but only for those who favor the humor style. \n\nOVERALL,a great movie with a good plot for the show, basic voice acting for the show, catchy and crude soundtrack songs, fun animation, lots of gut-bustingly funny moments and pop culture jokes, and a special brand of South Park charm, but not everybody will agree with the humor style and some jokes even disturbed me.",

Also, the Saddam Hussein subplot gets old, as it's the least character driven and the most \"jokey\" element of the film.

One because South Park is like marmite, you either love the humour or hate it with a passion, with the movie however it's a bit of both for me. On one hand some humour is controversial for controversy sake. Whereas it also has a handful of quirky humour, however in my opinion the two don't balance each other out. This isn't an amazing comedy by any stretch of the imagination, however if you're not into crude and outrageous humour that pokes fun at every religion and race under the sun this isn't the movie for you. The movie did surprise me though, how it is structured and the amount of musical numbers that are in this movie is a shock, even to the most passionate South Park fans.",

The musical score in this one is just fantastic. I saw this on comedy central as a kid back a long long time ago and I just fell in love with it and would always watch it when I could, South Park was a huge part of my childhood and I loved it and would imitate it so much, it wasn't until I grew up did I really appreciate this film. South Park the movie took a lot of bold moves with its material and it really went far in terms of content. It even holds a new record for most curse words in a movie ever.But the great thing about this movie is the fact that it just doesn't care what it says or does and I love that. Its totally over the top and wild and crazy and is guaranteed to make the most immature soul laugh the whole way through. Now the plot is not really going to make sense if you aren't a fan, but basically Terrence and Phillip are blamed for kids cursing worse than ever before, and the mothers of America want them dead but once their blood touches soil, Satan will rise up... \nPretty far-fetched but that's South Park for ya. If you are a loyal fan of the series then chances are you've already seen this one and enjoyed it. But if you aren't a fan of the series or immature humor at all then chances are you will probably not enjoy this so steer clear of it. But if you like stupid jokes, crude humor and violence well then look no further!",
