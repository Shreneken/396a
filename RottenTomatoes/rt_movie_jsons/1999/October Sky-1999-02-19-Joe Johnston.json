            "content": "October Sky is a heartwarming and inspiring movie that captures the essence of determination, passion, and perseverance. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a young boy from a small coal-mining town in West Virginia who dreams of building rockets and launching them into space.\n\nOne of the reasons why October Sky is such a great movie is its ability to draw the audience into the story and make them feel invested in the characters. The film portrays the struggles and challenges faced by Homer and his friends as they pursue their dream of building rockets, while also dealing with the expectations and limitations imposed by their families and community.\n\nThe performances of the cast are another standout feature of October Sky. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the lead role of Homer, delivers a nuanced and emotional performance that captures the character's determination and passion. The supporting cast, including Chris Cooper as Homer's father and Laura Dern as his teacher, also deliver memorable performances that bring depth and complexity to the story.\n\nThe movie also touches on several themes that resonate with audiences, such as the importance of following one's dreams and the power of education to change lives. These themes are woven into the fabric of the story and provide a sense of depth and meaning that elevates the film beyond a simple coming-of-age tale.\n\nOverall, October Sky is a heartwarming and inspiring movie that captures the essence of the American Dream. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of pursuing one's dreams and the impact that determination, passion, and perseverance can have in our lives. It is a movie that will leave you feeling uplifted, inspired, and grateful for the human spirit.",

The message of \"If you first don't succeed, try try again\" is firmly presented and that it provides a great reflection.

Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor that I admired from certain films, but so far, this one is my favorite of them all. He was able to portray Homer's character with tenacity and the blend between him and other fellow actors is worthwhile to acknowledge. A great film that I can see myself watching in the future.",

            "content": "Heartwarming and inspiring true story that'll have you seeing rockets!\n\nJoe Johnston's historical coming of age drama October Sky (1999) is a picture burning with passion for science, discovery, education, family, and fellowship among men. Joe Johnston's direction is as peerless and enjoyable as any iconic director's grounded style. October Sky is as much a coming of age drama story like Stand by Me or Lady Bird as it is a film about coal miners, unions, and small town mindsets like Matewan or Coal Miner's Daughter. \n\nI always find director Joe Johnston's films to be kind hearted and focused on inspiring kids to remember themselves, to seek higher education in life, understand their parents, and for parents to empathize with their children. Lewis Colick's writing understands how teenagers talk among each other, wanting their desires to be in life, while sympathizing with the perspective and struggles of both children and their parents. October Sky may just help you pick your path in life.\n\nI believe October Sky creates a passion for rocket science and mathematics, while also making you want to go out and make friends, find a hobby, pursue a career you love, find love, and rekindle the love in your family. October Sky is made with love and care like all great Joe Johnston films like The Rocketeer, Jumanji, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Captain America The First Avenger, or Hidalgo. October Sky is worth seeing for the rocket launches alone, let alone the life affirming true story about a boy wanting to leave his town to build rockets and gain his father's respect.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is so sensitive and compelling as Homer Hickam, who figures his chance out of town is in building rockets. His frustrations and fears are apparent on Gyllenhaal's face. He was a fine actor before Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, or Nightcrawler even. Laura Dern is so sweet and supportive as Homer's kind teacher Miss Riley. I don't know of a nicer performance in film from a lovelier actress than Laura Dern. \n\nChris Cooper is one mean, jaded, and reactionary father figure as Homer's tough father and mining boss John Hickam. It's cool to see Cooper do a mining picture after John Sayles' iconic Matewan with Cooper as the union creating leader, now an older man desperate to keep the livelihoods of his town in operation in a failing coal industry. Natalie Canerday is great as Homer's mother Elsie Hickam. Chris Owen is wonderful as the brainiac nerd Quentin Wilson alongside the other boys William Lee Scott and Chad Lindberg portray. I liked the nice girl Valentine Carmina as portrayed by Kaili Hollister. \n\nRobert Dalva's editing cuts quickly in montages of rocket building, launching, and exploding for a delightful series of training montages in rocket science. His sharp cuts make October Sky's 108 fly by like a rocket in the sky. Fred Murphy's cinematography uses natural scenery of forests in lush wide shots to deep and dark close-ups in the depths of the mines for a harsher effect. Jim Mitchell and Mark S. Miller's visual effects for the rocket launches are second to none and highly realistic. Mark Isham's score is lovely and definitely gets me emotional hearing his tender melodies. Betsy Cox' costumes look like the early 1950's and 1960's for sure.\n\nIn conclusion, October Sky delights me now as it did for me as a child. Any family should find a light of compassion and inspiration in watching it today.",

            "content": "\"October Sky\" is a pretty good movie with pretty good performances. Maybe even great, but I don't believe that it's one of the greatest family masterpieces it's often made out to be. The story was relatively interesting, starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal as real-life NASA engineer Homer Hickam. After the Soviet satellite Sputnik was sent into space, it instantly caught Hickam's interests and he knew that this was what he was going to do. His family doesn't believe in him, his town doesn't believe in him but one teacher does and it changes his life. I'm sorry, I know this is a true story and all but this movie is very predictable, around the half-way mark you know exactly what's going to happen almost in the order that it ends up doing. That makes the movie feel much longer than it is, probably didn't help that I was also watching it with my family very late at night. They frequently asked me \"how much longer?\" It's by no means a bad movie, not at all. It's average-length but just seems drawn out as the entire story could've easily been told in the span of 10 minutes. Ah, well. Still pretty good family movie, one of the better ones I think I've actually seen and I'd recommend it actually. I liked it, even though a lot of my sleepy siblings didn't. It's quite an inspiring tale of believing in yourself when no one else would but it just falls a little short for my personal tastes. It's still an excellent family movie though.",

            "content": "Can we all agree that any movie set in the 1950s should be directed by Joe Johnston? He has a magical way of capturing the nostalgic feel of that era. The way we are introduced to Coalwood, West Virginia makes you feel like this place has been around for generations. It‚Äôs a quaint small town where everyone knows everyone else, and there‚Äôs closeness throughout the entire community. The cast nailed the accents across the board (even if sometimes they look like they are doing a little extra work with their mouths to make it sound right.) The costume and set designers made everything look perfect. It all comes together to give October Sky an amazing sense of place and time that is authentic. You never get the sense that just off camera there is a studio or something, because the film takes you to Coalwood. I love the story of this rag-tag group of kids who work together to do something that seems improbable so that they can move on to bigger and better things. The scenes of them experimenting and figuring out all the little details they need to make a successful rocket were great. It helps that the cast of actors was excellent. However, I often have trouble with movies that include a character like the one Chris Cooper plays. He appears so unfeeling and insensitive throughout the film, that I find myself getting mad. It‚Äôs even more tragic because it is a father-son relationship, and I want him to show his love by supporting his son instead of cutting him down. I‚Äôm aware that the conflict is necessary to add drama to the story, and I imagine some of it was based in real events, but it‚Äôs hard for me to watch. That being said, the lows that the film reaches makes the highs seem more thrilling and exciting. Speaking of lows and highs, that‚Äôs one of the things I love about October Sky, the blatant symbolism of Homer Hickam‚Äôs life is astounding. If it wasn‚Äôt based on a true story, you‚Äôd want to chastise the author for making the story too good to be true. The idea that Homer doesn‚Äôt want to go down and be buried in the mine, but longs to soar into the heavens is delightful. Joe Johnston used that idea to full effect in this film, and there are a few shots that show the contrast of the two worlds so well I‚Äôll never forget them. While there were certain elements of October Sky that didn‚Äôt click for me, I still enjoyed the story a lot, and it is one film I expect to revisit and fall in love with more in the future. ",

It's no academy award winning movie, but it's very charming and so is Jake Gyllinhall. He's very young in it. The acting by everyone in it is adequate. Everything about it technically is adequate.  There's a fun little montage of them shooting, or trying to shoot of their rockets and failing over and over. The sound track was all 60's music which was enjoyable. Although a little predictable and a little derivative it was still pretty entertaining and enjoyable. Maybe because it's just so disgustingly feel good. I cried despite myself at the end. It's also just one of the most family oriented movies ever. If you have the whole family over and don't want to offend anyone, this is the perfect movie for that occasion.

It provides good life lessons on following your own footsteps and be ambitious of what you enjoy doing. Even if it makes you hardheaded, this movie shows how taking your own advice is never a bad thing. \n\nJake Gyllenhaal delivered a memorable performance, and he stood true to his role as the NASA Engineer, Homer Hickam, Chris Cooper delivered a solid performance as John Hickam who has a lot of pride of himself. Laura Dern is an underrated actress, and she gave a good performance since Jurassic Park. The rest of the cast played their part pretty well.\n\nThe storyline was fantastic, providing emotion, joyness, and sadness to appeal everyone, no matter how old you are. What made it better is that it's based on a true story, focusing solely on Homer Hickam's life as a teenager. \n\nHere's the website where you can read my full review for this movie: http://geodude91.blogspot.com/2013/07/october-sky-review.html#!/2013/07/october-sky-review.html",

The performances in this movie are first rate and there are brief moments of comedy as well as loss. Every time I re watch this movie I get the urge to go out and do something more. I feel this movie is entertaining, inspiring and just all around great.\nThis is on the Green Embers' Recommended List!",

October Sky is a film that captures the excitement and the imagination of four teenage boys who believed they could do anything. Director Joe Johnston perfectly recreates mid-century West Virginia in a way that only he could do, and allows his cast to do most of the leg work. Jake Gyllenhaal leads the amazing cast, which features Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, and Natalie Canerday, all of whom give powerful performances. A film that could have simply been about a journey to the stars actually becomes about a strained father-son relationship. If the conclusion of the film doesn't have you in tears, you don't have a soul.\n\nFor more movie reviews visit: www.reelfive.com",

My only knowledge of Joe Johnston's work was for his F/X summer popcorn movies (Jurassic Park 3, Jumanji) and if this was one of those it was sure to be terrible, and if it wasn't - did he have the ability to tell a story like this?  The answer is most definitely yes. The performances are solid, but some of the accents are a bit dodgy.  Chris Cooper plays much the same role he always plays. Gyllenhaal and the other young actors all manage to create unique characters (thanks in part to good writing).  The movie manages to tap into memories of looking to the skies and marveling at the stars with a skill that rarely is seen.  It evokes similar feelings to space as Field of Dreams or The Sandlot do for baseball, and the effect is powerful, moving, and well worth the time.",

            "content": "The Tragedy of Being Smarter Than Your Parents  \r\n\r\nIt can be hard to explain sometimes.  I am told that my father was incredibly intelligent, though I was too young at the time he died to have known.  My mother is not a stupid woman by any stretch of the imagination, but let us say that this is one of the many areas where I take after my father.  Mom was never anything but supportive, which may well have been in part because she had known my dad.  However, I never really felt that she understood.  How much worse would it have been if my mother had never had reason to understand or respect intelligence?  If she had seen my interest as betraying everything she stood for?  I don't know how many generations of this family worked in the mines, but it is true that the very idea of going to college meant Our Hero's turning his back on what his family stood for, what his father had done with his life.  It was intimidating to his father, and that's the great sorrow of the movie.\r\n\r\nOur Hero is Homer Hickham (Jake Gyllenhaal).  In October of 1957, he and his friends watched [i]Sputnik 1[/i] make its way across the sky, and they heard its beeping on the radio.  And Homer thought, \"That's my future.\"  He enlisted local nerd Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen) and Homer's friends Roy Lee Cooke (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), and together, they start building rockets.  The first ones aren't very good, but they get better and better.  However, Homer's father, John (Chris Cooper), isn't interested.  Homer's brother, Jim (Scott Miles), is a local football hero, and John respects that, but he doesn't respect the physics and trigonometry Homer is learning.  It only gets worse when the boys are accused of starting a forest fire with one of their rockets.  Homer has the support of the entire town, including teacher Freida J. Riley (Laura Dern), but not his father, despite the efforts of his mother, Elsie (Natalie Canerday).\r\n\r\nIt's sad, really.  The town was dying; there is no Coalwood, West Virginia anymore.  Traditionally, football was what let boys escape, when they could escape--football players got college scholarships.  Part of the conflict is that Homer is shown to know that, while his father did not.  His father is a coal miner, and that's all he knows.  He wants his boys to come and work in the coal mine, too; by turning his back on the mine, Homer is turning his back on his father.  (Though I can't help wondering what happened to girls who wanted to escape; they must have had even fewer options.)  The real-life Homer Hickham (who is a junior; his father's name is changed in this to avoid confusion) got out, but how many of his classmates went down into the mines when the mines closed?  How many died either in the mines or from mining-related causes?  It's still one of the most dangerous jobs in the US.  This country runs on coal still, and we need coal miners.  But coal mining is a hard life, and most of the boys in this movie never had any other choice.\r\n\r\nThe movie is sentimental almost to the point of syrup in places, but you know, it's good to see American ingenuity the focus of a family film.  For once, it isn't about the jocks, though the disc does come with a trailer for the movie of [i]Friday Night Lights[/i].  For once, it's the science fair that's what the town is cheering for.  And in many ways, that's how it should be; it's a lot easier to get out of a small town from being smart than being athletic.  There aren't enough spots on college football teams to take all the stars of the high school football teams, and there aren't enough spots in the pros to take all the stars of the college football teams.  If you can get an academic scholarship--and need-based grants--you've got a shot at a career that athletics can't necessarily provide.  We seem to spend too much screen time idolizing the careers that are hardest to get into, and while not everyone can be a rocket scientist, we do as a nation need to be training more engineers.\r\n\r\nI don't think everyone will understand the aspect of the movie which spoke most to me.  After all, the movie still does include Quentin to be mocked.  Even when the boys are the talk of the town, Homer assures Quentin that the girls still think he's weird.  Homer is expressly acknowledged to have difficulty with math.  However, if he's even of slightly above average intelligence, Homer is still smarter than most of the people around him, and his drive further sets him apart.  Heck, without him, Roy Lee and O'Dell would have gone down into the mines just like everyone else in town.  Leon Bolden (Randy Stripling) had been a Tuskegee Airman; while he works as an engineer, he still works for the mine.  Half the reason Homer goes down into the mine when he does is that the company owns their house and most of their furniture.  It doesn't seem to occur to his father that the kind of job Homer could get with an education would more than pay for their own house and furniture.",

But by October 4, 1957, when the Soviet satellite Sputnik flies overhead in the night sky, Homer Hickam Jr.'s life is changed forever. So with the help of his teacher, he and his three buddies start an amateur rocket program way out of the town limits. Even with his father's disapproval, a limited education, and a series of misfires that threaten his dreams and the town, Homer overcomes seemingly impossible odds to achieve his vision of earning his college scholarship and working in rocket science later in his lifetime. And he brought us this inspiring drama of his life, all immortalized on the screen.\n\nBased on the real Homer Hickam Jr.'s book 'Rocket Boys' and directed by Joe Johnston, 'October Sky' has good acting performances. I liked Jake Gyllenhaal's young Hickam character as well as his sense of individuality. Supporting Gyllenhaal includes Laura Dern (Ms. Riley) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam), both of which were very interesting characters. The film soundtrack is so inspiring for the 1950s setting; Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be The Day\" and sometimes the background instrumentals really sets me in a good mood.\n\nWhat can I say about 'October Sky'? It's a great historical drama for all audiences to enjoy, including the 1950s-era fans and the rocket scientists of the world.",

That, and it's got a notable cast including a young Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, and Laura Dern.\n\nHickam did eventually become a NASA engineer, but the film primarily focuses on the earliest leg of that journey, and the scenes of him and his friends trying to get into the rocket game for themselves are both funny and charming. \n\nThis is Joe Johnston making a nice drama and pulling it off pretty well. He's got a spotty record, but this is one of his better efforts, and one I find my self enjoying quite a bit each time I see it. Sure, there are shades of typical tropes like the father wanting the son to follow in his footsteps, and people interested in a subject that doesn't fit in with what everyone else in their locale appreciates, but it's handled decently, and the performances are nice, too.",

October Sky is based on the truly inspirational childhood story of NASA Engineer Homer Hickham Jr. and his journey through a tough adolescence.  Overcoming tough family, social and educational issues, Homer was able to conquer the impossible, and in doing so, inspired an entire town.  Homer, along with his childhood friends (nicknamed \"The Rocket Boys\") are all examples of pure determination and integrity.  It's just a towering film that does everything right, it's not overly dramatic, it's littered with humor and it captivates you with it's very intense emotional concepts.  I'm a sucker for true stories, when they're done right, they can be a vessel to endlessly amazing stories and people.  October Sky is a stirring and engaging piece of expert craftmanship from acclaimed director Joe Johnston, it's tremendously powerful, spectacularly inspirational, amazingly intriguing, emotionally gripping and undeniably superb.  A film that should be shown to every student in every school, a perfect example of the timeless saying...you can do anything you put your mind to.  This one will sear itself into your memory and stay with you forever.  A small town American story that will forever have a place in your heart.

October sky is an incredibly touching film that tells a wonderfull story about teens in a small forgotten town who want to do something more than just the expected. The movie really does an excellent job at recreating an old forgotten town and brings back the look and feel of the late 50s. This is essential as this helps set the tone and mood. But the anchor of the film is Jake Gyllenhaal. He gives a rich performance as the well meaning and somewhat spontaneous teenager who dreams of something more than what is expected of him. He is a very sympathetic character because he feels emotions and goes through things that many people can relate to. The other great performance is Chris Cooper as his strict and rahter unsupportive father. The drama between father and son is honest and touching and creates some very good tension. But above all October Sky is about chasing dreams and the determination to succeed despite what others may say or think and succeeds at being an authentic and honest tale of inspiration. Very highly recomended",

Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch \"October Sky\", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. \"October Sky\"¬ù also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that \"October Sky\"¬ù is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from. I know I did.",

I was amazed that he could go from directing a movie as mature as this, to a complety immature film - Jurassic Park 3. The Acting was pretty decent, and I thought Laura Dern in particular was great, she kind of reminded me of Sandra Bullock's character from The Blind Side. The main thing in the film that I found annoying was Homer's (the main character) relationship with his dad. We've seen this \"Dad-wants-his-son-to-follow-in his-footsteps-and son-wants-to-be-independent\" relationship so many times, I got bored with the father-son scenes, instead of being entertained.

            "content": "October Sky is a film heavy on the stereotypes and the clich√É (C)s of hard life in the south. It focuses on the life of a real person, Homer Hickham(played by Jake Gyllenhaal), and his struggle to fulfill his passion in a town where getting a scholarship is a million to one shot and mining coal is the only way of life. I had originally seen this movie when I was about 10, and it was always one of my favorites. I loved the violin music that complements the nice cinematography showcasing the grit of West Virginia in 1957. The acting was also very good, even though it may have been stereotyped a big, and the language slacked a little. Chris Cooper plays a convincing and frustrated father who works opposite Jake Gyllenhaal who is a bright young man with huge dreams. The story is something we've all seen before but just can't stop watching. Joe Johnston, the director, created a very well made movie that makes us feel good as others like \"Remember the Titans, \" or \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" did. But again, who can ever tire of that formula? So, looking back at it now, there are some spotty parts and the chances of the 4 \"Rocket-boys,\" actually winning the Science Fair is scarce, but what makes it all tie together is the fact that it was based on a true story. We can sympathize with the 4 boys because their life is so tough and realistic it's almost heart-breaking to imagine what would've happened if they hadn't won the Science Fair. The way the movie plays out is almost like a Stephen King type story, where there are 4 boys all in a hick town where nothing good ever happens. Well, this is what a Stephen King story would most likely look like if it had a happy ending. Which is common in a movie like this, and yeah, how often does your dad who hates you ever come to see you perform on your last show? In this movie it appears probable. For those who may not understand the film's intent, just get it cleared out of the way before you watch the movie, that it IS meant to be uplifting and some what inspirational. I know it was for me when I was 10, and I still look back on it fondly as a favorite.",

Director Joe Johnston handles this poetic examination of a teenage boy's unquenchable desire to cut his own path in life with a tenderness and affection for his subject. Gyllenhaal is extraordinary as the younger son of a West Virginia coal miner, determined to escape the gravitational pull of the coal mine while desperately trying to earn his father's understanding and respect. Chris Cooper shows he's one of the best actors working today with his gritty, totally genuine portrayal of John Hickam, the father struggling to come to terms with his son's maverick aspirations of a life far from the coal seams of Appalachia. The supporting cast is universally outstanding, particularly Laura Dern as Homer's inspirational high school teacher. Mark Isham's score, rich in bluegrass-y fiddle solos, beautifully captures the spiritual essence of the film. One of my top ten favorite films of all time.",

            "content": "October Sky ins the best feel good movie ever made. One of the things thats great about the film is the film doesn't go over board in it's sentimentality. Never does it feel overly sentimental, corny or embarrassing. This is the type of film that you will definitely feel good right after watching it.  You really sympathize with the characters because they are brilliantly played by the cast. I can't recall the number of times I've seen this film, but it's at least over a dozen times. Unlike other family films that try to be overly sentimental just for the sake of being family friendly and to appeal to a bigger audience. October Sky has something that separates it from other feel good films, and thats a very good story, and I mean good. October Sky is the true story of Homer Hickam a teenager who spots the Sputnik satellite and who decides to built his own rocket and enter the science fair. His dad is highly against it, and wants him to work in the mine. Homer has other ideas. October Sky is really a story about accomplishing your dreams, and achieving the impossible. This is simply an incredible story about perseverance and determination and unlike other feel good films, this is a true story, and the way it's told on film is beautiful. The film is brilliantly directed by Joe Johnson, director of Jumanji, and he crafts yet another great film. October Sky is a well acted film, the actors here are incredible and this was one of Jake Gyllenhaal's first staring roles, and is just the right person for this role.  Also a performance that is equally great is Chjris Cooper as Homer's father who opposes Homer's dreams. Both actors electrifying as they butt heads on screen as we see their conflicting ideas unfold. Chris Cooper is fine and underrated actor, and this is the first film that I've seen that exposed me to his work. October Sky is a solid feel good film and like I said, this is one of the best too. A fine cast upholds this film, and Johnson has got a fine script at hand. and because of that, the film works very well. The beauty part about this film is that this is the type of film that will stay with you long after you've seen it, and everyone can take something positive away from it. A fine film that in one word can be summarized as beautiful.",

First im going to give credit to the actors who all filled the roles of these historic characters perfectly. But most of all I would say it was a toss up between Chris Cooper and Jake Gyllenhaal for who did the best in the film. Cooper's character of Homer's father could be unlikeable at times but deep down you knew what kind of person he was and would do anything for his family. Gyllenhaal played Homer Hickman perfectly and is right next to his performance in Donnie Darko to be the best of his carrer which to some people isnt saying a lot but overall Gyllenhall is a pretty good actor. Also the other actors were good as well from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg were all great in this film. Besides the acting I would say the directing is the best part. Joe Jhonston really let us know how important  this story and these characters really are and made the actors fill their roles perfectly. The writing is also good but I woulden't call it great I felt some words were rushed and easily used. Also the film can be a little overly dramatic and will try hard to make you tear up but it doesn't try \"that\" hard. This is also one of the most inspiring films i've seen and will always be in the right mood to watch it again. If you haven't seen it than you need to see it. A great film. 90%",

So, I can't remember everything exactly, but what I really know is this:  I really liked the film.  I don't know a lot about the true story, but let's stick to the basics of the film.  \n     There was great acting, directing, and it was well written for the screen.  Everything seemed to flow smoothly from start to finish and the boys' in the film make you feel somewhat inspired.  I would also like to mention that there is a great score composed by Mark Isham accompanying the film.  \n     For the content, there is some language including a few profanities and vulgarities along with a briefly scene obscene hand gesture.  There are also a few mild swear words scattered throughout the film.  However, swearing is used infrequently.  Other than that, a few rockets blow up and almost injure some people, and we also see some injured coal miners and see the danger they face every day.\n     All that being said, \"October Sky\" is a great movie that I highly recommend!  4 1/2 stars.",

Homer, the main character is obsessed with launching rockets and with the inspiration of a schoolteacher comes from building rockets in the basement against his fathers will to designing components and showing them off in a national science fare. The film is a classic about a group of friends achieving something that wouldnt be impossible without each other.  In the film Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles to avoid the dead end life of a coal minor, that his father wants him to come and take over the coal mining business, which is not what he wants to become. \r\n\r\nThe Director Joe Johnston wittedly conjures up the 1950s teenage social order.  Johnston also places the town  out  of the way of anything that survives off mining where everybody belives that mining is the only way to survive and feed their families. During one school year, Homer and the rocket boys blast off into futures their parents didn't decide for them. Corny? Sure, but it is a movie that almost everybody will love.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the movie you see everybody that was once in his way step aside and help him to become a part of NASA, but that's another story. Personally I thought it was a great movie but I found the story very traditional, meaning that I found that it was about the same thing with nothing overly appealing. To me it was about love, friends, and reaching what appears to be the impossible that turns out to be not so impossible. Overall I loved it and would watch it again, as it was not painful to watch.\r\n\r\nHaving all this in mind, the film is a fine line between a classic story of friends and reaching your dreams. I found the movie a great movie for anyone looking for a movie that combines friends, love and fun.",

It's an inspiring, feel-good story about a son pursuing his dreams all the while trying desperately to earn the respect of a doubting father.  The only unfortunate aspect of the film is two unfathomable characters, one whose presence is critical to the plot.\r\n\r\nWas Homer Hickman Sr. really that opposed to his son pursuing rocketry?  In the world I come from, that is unimaginable.  Realizing this all takes place in the infancy of space exploration, it is reasonable to suspect a coal mining superintendent would encourage his son to follow him into the mines.  But the level of obsession written in for this character reeks of exaggeration.  It heightens the conflict, but I couldn't help but roll my eyes through some of those scenes shared by father and son.\r\n\r\nEven more perplexing was the school principal.  I found him to be a completely unrealistic character.\r\n\r\nBut enough with the negativity.  Anyone and everyone will enjoy this film.  The four youths, the \"Rocket Boys\", all bring something unique to the screen.  I always enjoy Natalie Canerday (Mrs. Hickam), mainly because I love that wonderful Sling Blade accent of hers. There is also an ample dose of humor to go along with the math and the various conflicts that arise.  And once the town gets behind these boys, it becomes quite a rollicking fun ride indeed.",

The post-Sputnik science-ed. sensation is certainly worthy of this fine treatment. I shared the pride that all of Coalwood felt when the \"rocket boys\" won the national science fair. The theme that hard work and dedication lead to success may seem old-fashioned, but here its done to perfection.

Not much more to say, really.\r\n\r\nTHE BAD\r\nOnly a couple of cast members (Canerday in particular) that let this film down slightly.\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\r\nIn the opinion of a person who enjoys movies, it's up there with my all-time favorites. Close to perfect and NEEDS SOME AWARDS!!!!!!!",

However, since most of the movie is verbatim from the true story, it's a fun little coming of age story about a boy who refuses to give up on his dream. Inspiring at all the right points and was made for all those who were bold enough to see an idea through no matter how many failures occurred. I'm still mad that they didn't use a line like \"come on kid it ain't rocket science\" \"well actually...\"",
