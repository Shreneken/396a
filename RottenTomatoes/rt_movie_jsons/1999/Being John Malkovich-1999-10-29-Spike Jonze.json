    "summary": "In this quirky cult-favorite comedy, unemployed New York City puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) reluctantly takes a temp job as a filing clerk for the eccentric Dr. Lester (Orson Bean). While at work, Craig discovers a portal that leads into the mind of renowned actor John Malkovich. When he lets his attractive co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) in on the secret, they begin both an unusual business scheme and an odd relationship that involves Craig's restless wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).",

            "content": "Though not my favorite work of his, \"Being John Malkovich\" is signature Charlie Kaufman, what with the rich philosophical underpinnings, the raucous absurdity and the mind-bending twists and turns. I will say, some of the characterizations in this were a tad uneven for my tastes, especially given the other project I've seen from this writer/director pairing. However, the premise alone is enough to keep you in your seat, not to mention the zany production design and completely game performances across the board. Still can't believe they managed to nab Malkovich to play himself in this, given some of the lunacy he's subjected to throughout.",

            "content": "Sometimes, a great and original screenplay is the only thing you need in order to create a little but shining masterpiece. Spike Jones does that by mixing real, fiction, supernatural, fantasy and oddity in a low-budget surrealistic comedy that breaks the fourth wall also due to the impressive performance to all the elements of the small but stellar cast: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, Orson Bean and, least but not least, a spectacular John Malkovich, very natural playing himself. The movie indeed is based on Craig Schwartz (Cusack), a poor puppeteer looking for a job, married to pet-obsessed Lotte (Diaz): he starts to work at the seven and a half floor (the ceilings are very low) in the Mertin Flemmer building as a file clerk for Dr. Lester (Bean). There he will find a tunnel which is connected to the mind of John Malkovich that allows to remain 15 minutes in his head, seeing through his eyes, while he lives unconsciously his life. After the discovery, the actor will start to host not just Craig and Lotte, but even strangers due to the business started by Craig and his beloved co-worker, Maxine (Keener). Meanwhile, she will start a relationship with Malkovich, who will become progressively more and more aware of the surreal situation.\nJones works perfectly with space (especially on the visual side) and, moreover, analyzes human mind in a different way by exploring the desire of normal people of becoming (in a moment), without effort, a rich, famous, public figure, in an attempt to escape from a meaningless and boring reality. It's the case of Lotte, undoubtedly the most interesting character of movie, broken between what she feels and what she actually is. The end, like many plot twists, is very surprising. Absolute must-see.",

            "content": "Possibly the weirdest film ever, executed wonderfully. Being John Malkovich has possibly the strangest plot of a film ever, but Spike Jonze has worked this plot into a masterpiece. I initially felt a bit off and weird about a few things in this film and sometimes the way it was going, but when you look past it literally and look into the meaning of this film, you allow yourself to have a fantastic time and appreciate the weirdness. This has got to be one of the most subjective films ever created, but to me, I took the meaning to be all about power and control. I believe this as the characters Craig and Lotte are always fighting to be with Maxine, who lusts for power. Maxine isn't really interested in either of them, only Lotte when she is in Malkovich.  Lotte and Craig then fight to control Malkovich, with Craig overpowering Lotte. Craig ends up controlling Malkovich, unknowingly to Maxine. Once Lotte tells Maxine what has been happening, Maxine is only interested in who she can control, as this is what she has always wanted. She decides to let go of Lotte and go for Craig's Malkovich. Maxine wins and has all this power and control over everything that's important to her. Maxine begins to become unhappy and stop showing any sort of interest in Craig's Malkovich. To me, this is a message of power and control isn't everything, it's not healthy and won't make you happy. In the end, Maxine and Lotte meet and they leave together, becoming a couple and being happy. To me, this is an extent to the message of power and control isn't everything and it won't make you happy. Maxine changes what she wants, she doesn't need or want power or control, she just needs love. Aside from the story, the way this film is shot is so fresh and something i've never seen before. I love Spike Jonze as a director, and this doesn't disappoint. Acting wise, stand out performances were John Malkovich, as himself. In the scenes where Craig has taken over Malkovich, I really believe that's Craig, and not John Malkovich playing Craig. It's a weird feeling to have, as I was really struggling to even see any John Malkovich in Craig's Malkovich. Also, Catherine Keener, as Maxine, she really took this role and went with it. She's extremely believable and convincing here, I enjoy seeing her play a slightly different character from what I know her from, in 40 year old virgin she plays quite a reclusive and easy going Mother, and in Where the Wild things are, she also plays a Mother. One final stand out performance was Cameron Diaz, as Lotte. Lotte was a great character, you really felt bad for her in parts, but you were also a little weirded out in other parts and then when she finally gets her way, you cheer for her. This is all down to Cameron Diaz's performance. All in all, Being John Malkovich was, although extremely strange, really really fantastic and breathtaking.",

Odd, dark and yet so funny, this movie got me on so many levels. It made me anxious, but so entertained. After all, it was a big drama about a men that wants to change is life because he is not good in his after finding a way to be John Malkovich but it turns out his wife and colleague/mistress also want that so because he doesn't care about his life he sees it being stolen. He lost his life to be someone else. That is the philosophy of Being John Malkovich. Being someone else isn't necessarily good. Be yourself just like her wife who just fell in love with an other woman.\n\nThe movie may be dramatic and full of questions but it is also funny and entertaining. That is why I said it caught me on a lot of levels. It's not only that I found the message good. I also liked the cinematography, the acting and the fact that this movie is completely weird. It is off the tracks but it is so good! It covers almost every genres of movie: Comedy, drama, fantasy (yes it has a bit of fantasy), romance, etc. I think I will never see John Malkovich the same way after seeing this.

            "content": "Despite Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) being a modern masterpiece, Being John Malkovich is probably my favourite film that has Charlie Kauffman involved. He's on writing duties this time (usually that tends to produce the best results), and  it's as mad as its title suggests. Whilst working on floor seven and a half (you read that correctly) of the Mertin-Flemmer building as a file clerk, John Cusack's Craig discovers a portal that leads into the  mind of actor John Malkovich. The film actually tackles issues that are extremely pertinent today; for example after going into the mind of Malkovich Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz in a career best role) claims she's never felt so right in the body of a man, and is considering becoming a transexual. These topics are beautifully written alongside some truly hilarious scripting, and Kauffman's insane screenplay is directed with panache by Spike Jonze. As well as Diaz, Cusack is fantastically weird as Craig, and John Malkovich pulls off what is without doubt the best display of someone playing both themselves (and several other people) I've ever seen. It's truly a masterpiece.",

Back when original movies were still being made \u2014 that magical cinematic year of 1999 \u2014 Kaufman wrote this jaw-droppingly interesting script that gives us the gem, Being John Malkovich. I first viewed it years ago, and remembered the main premise, but had completely forgotten about the love-triangle (quadrangle?) between the characters. Upon a 2020 viewing, it felt prescient in the commentary on the omnipresence of live-streaming and reality-TV \u2014 they even make a note of the experience being 15 minutes inside of Malkovich (John Malkovich), your 15 minutes of fame. But focusing only on this feels superficial, as Kaufman's work centers on deeper concepts, always, herein being consciousness, self-control, destiny, and reincarnation. What I love about BJM is that there's really no one to root for. Craig (John Cusack), Lotte (Cameron Diaz), and Maxine (Catherine Keener) are all pretty shitty in their own ways \u2014 Lotte being the least shitty, but not the most sympathetic either. There's a lot here to discuss for a pocket review, so I'll only address the reincarnation concept, which I actually think could've been expanded on more and introduced earlier. It's an area I've been super interested in recently, but here it felt sloppy; all of the sudden, a bunch of elderly individuals are going to live inside Malko's head\u2026 together? Will they control him, like Craig does? I also didn't completely understand how Craig stayed inside for months/years. I loved how the puppeteering became a larger part of the plot and not just a way to show Craig is unique. There's also commentary here on the privilege of the celebrity-class. As Craig is inside of Malko, his skills as a puppeteer have remained the same, but because he's now a well-known celebrity, he \"reinvents\" himself as a master puppeteer and given credit for reviving the art form \u2014 when Craig (inside Malko) tells his agent he wants to quit acting for puppeteering, his agent responds, \"Okay. Great. Fine. Poof! You're a puppeteer.\" (para.) Cannot help but compare it to the recent Chrissy Teigen-Alison Roman spat. Other notes: The \"Many Malkovichs\" scene is unforgettable, Keener was really good in her diabolical role, and John Cusack makes the same facial expressions as his sister, Joan. It's such an interesting and original film, I'd think any sort of cinephile has viewed it already, but Being John Malkovich is a must-see for pretty much anyone.",

Cameron Diaz as 'Lotte' is simply obnoxious in this role and her sudden obsession with becoming a male after vicariously being John Malkovich is just tonally bizarre.

The 1/2 floor idea, the tunnel, John Malkovich, puppets, the pet chimp, the jokes, the weird romance plot. It's too much. The film has an illogical plot, it's not that funny, and it's beyond bizarre. Some of the biggest problems with the writing are that the characters are all unlikeable, and the romance is completely nonsensical. Catherine is a horrible person, Lotte questions her sexuality because she experiences being John Malkovich, and somehow John Malkovich makes everyone in the world care about creepy puppets. However, the acting was solid, and the cinematography, soundtrack, and visual effects were fine but felt a bit dated. Arguably worth a watch once but not the type of film you ever want to rewatch.",

            "content": "A film about getting to be someone else for a little while? How could this not be a good time? Being John Malkovich exudes a quirky humor and light-hearted nature that meshes well with Kaufman's sharp writing and Jonze's excellent direction. Malkovich is excellent as himself, and John Cusack beautifully portrays a lost, desperate soul, clutching and grasping at what he believes is the life he needs. Cameron Diaz also shines as another desperate character, searching for the true meaning and purpose in her own life, albeit in a more endearing and sympathetic way.\n\tAt the heart of this enjoyable film is intriguing commentary on control, the ways in which we attempt to control our environments to get what we desire and also the ways in which those futile attempts are ultimately detrimental and leave us wanting more. It also explores the divided self; our fractured minds and how we are often affected (unknowingly) by those around us (both close and not). This play on identity poses a legitimate yet largely unasked question: Who are we really? We have two eyes, four limbs, a chest with a heart underneath, lungs, hands and feet, a nose, a mouth, ears, and many other features that are distinct in their appearance. However, that is merely our physical form. The bundle of energy that constitutes US, only exists temporally. Our bodies impermanence speaks not to what we truly represent within the Universe but the transient vehicle we inhabit for 80-100 years, if we are lucky. As we follow the character of Craig Schwartz, we see a desperate man, yearning for a place in the world that is narrowly defined within his own limited perception. He never seems to ask himself, what if my place in the world is not what I believe it to be? What if my incessant pursuit of external gain and appreciation is not the way to go about this temporary conscious blossoming that we call life? And sadly, by the end of the film, he has failed to learn the lesson so poignantly (yet humorously) exhibited through narrative construction.\n\tThe one relatively small flaw I had with this movie was Catherine Keener's character. She played the role of Maxine Lund well, but the character's motivations were not clear to me. Her actions seemed contradictory at times, almost like a plot device intended to further the story along. It did not compromise the film as a whole, but it left me pondering her character arc when the credits finally did role.\n\tOverall, Being John Malkovich is a film that will likely get better with multiple viewings. It is not for everyone, and I can certainly understand if some find it inane and ridiculous, but I found it to have more than a touch of metaphorical brilliance sprinkled throughout. As a fan of Charlie Kaufman, I can honestly say that it stands out as one of his best.",

            "content": "Being John Malkovich (9.5/10) is a thought-provoking comedy and fantasy film. This is a film about the struggles of living your own life and being yourself. The film features a puppeteer (played by John Cusack) who stumbles upon a strange portal in his new workplace. The portal leads him right into the back of the Hollywood actor John Malkovich's head, allowing him to see and feel the world as John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich) does.\n\nBeing John Malkovich is one of the most original films ever made. It is whimsical, spectacular and spellbinding all throughout. Rarely is there such a film which captivates its audience right from the start towards the very end. Every moment engages you as much as the previous moment does, and as you reach the end of the film, you will not even realise that almost two hours have passed. The originality of the screenplay by Charlie Kaufman feels like such a breeze and Spike Jonze's execution makes it all the better. It is honestly one of a kind: in the wrong hands it could easily end up becoming Scary-Movie level nonsense, but it fell into the arms of Bjork's frequent collaborator-director and his team. Therefore, a masterpiece was born.\n\nThe cast is splendid. One simply cannot understate the performance of the actors: John Cusack as the insecure and envious puppeteer Craig; John Malkovich as \"the guy in the jewel thief movie\", Catherine Keener as the manipulative yet loving Maxine; and Cameron Diaz as the adorable and kind-hearted zoophilist Lotte. So many notable performances and John Malkovich's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment is arguably the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me in the film. \n\nThe haunting music and visuals are definitely among the most crucial elements for the success of this film. Carter Burwell's melancholic score trickles through the most intricate moments of the film and plucks your heartstrings along to the rhythm of those moments. Bjork's Amphibian at the end is also a nice touch to cap off the story. The film is gorgeous, and the effects were really well-done. The Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich scene especially looks flawless.\n\nAll in all, Being John Malkovich is an almost perfect film. It takes the simplest message of all and wraps it around with an intriguing story, and in the rights hands with the right cast, the film is one hell of an experience to watch. Do not matter how much you heard the clich\u00e9d phrase \"be yourself\". Being John Malkovich tells you exactly how difficult it can be to do just that. If you have not watched this film, spare two hours of your life for it. You will never regret it.\n\n9.5/10",

            "content": "It's fair to say that when Being John Malkovich was released in 1999, very few people were even aware of the creative mind of Charlie Kaufman. In fact, he'd only really been working as a writer on Tv shows with Malkovich being his first feature film screenplay. When it hit, it was regarded as the most daringly original film of the year with a concept so bizarre that it's a wonder that it was even green-lit for production in the first place. Thankfully, director Spike Jonze had the chutzpah to take it on and in doing so, introduced us to one of cinema's truly subversive talents. Kaufman is a one-of-kind writer and Being John Malkovich alone is testament to his warped and offbeat imagination. It's darkly humorous and genuinely unique in its inventiveness but moreover, it has an intellectual depth that raises it beyond a mere gimmick. Fair play to John Malkovich himself for being a good sport throughout and it also boasts some career best work from John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and, especially, the wonderful Catherine Keener. Ultimately, though, this film put both Jonze and Kaufman on the map and it's a place they both rightfully deserve.",

Being John Malkovich follows a struggling puppeteer as he finds a portal that allows you to live inside of John Malkovich. If that is too weird for you already, I suggest you leave now. At the start, the seemingly dry yet, at the same time, over the top humor seemed to work. Everything was wonderfully different from anything I had seen before. There were quite a few similarities to Brazil at the beginning, in terms of how it dealt with the view of the modern workplace. As things go on, the movie gets even weirder, and, without spoiling anything, there is a lot of Malkovich. As the shift happens, the film also separates itself from the comedy at the beginning. It seemed surprisingly dark near the end, but not in a smart way similar to Jojo Rabbit. It felt incredibly shoehorned in, which was disappointing. Although it did keep some comedy, it just didn't work after everything changed near the end, including a lot of the visual style. For the most part, the shots are quite clever. The repetition allows the audience to know what's happening without seeing it, similar to the way Jaws worked. The characters in the film were also quite interesting. It truly felt that if there was indeed a portal into John Malkovich, this is how the events would play out. And I'm not sure how to feel about that. The standout character is John Cusak as the puppeteer. Near the end of his time as John Malkovich, that character really started working even better. Although it was quite endearing, there wasn't much of an arc though. Where the real depth came in was in John Cusak's two girlfriends. While I'm sure that their relationship was quite confusing at the time, it actually works as an emotional story beat in today's modern context. Even if that was unintentional, it works. While there were a couple of problems with the tonal and structural shifts near the end, the movie was a complete joy to watch, and there was no way you could tell exactly what was going to happen next. It's an incredibly unique, weird, and Malkovich movie.",

By day, he's a clerk for New York City's deceptively plain-wrappered LesterCorp, where he toils on the low-ceilinged 7-\u00bd floor. Craig gets the hots for coworker Maxine Lund (a remarkable Catherine Keener), who flatly can't be bothered. He soon finds a small door behind a filing cabinet, and into it \u2013 and into the mind of legendary thespian actor John Malkovich \u2013 he crawls. For fifteen minutes per session, Craig can see the world through Malkovich's eyes before being unceremoniously dumped roadside at the New Jersey Turnpike. He can't help but share the portal with Maxine, and together, they monetize the Malkovich experience like that of a $200 amusement park ride.\n \nMalkovich himself is plainly stunning in his straight-faced repurposing of his real-life self. And despite the onslaught of elite work that followed, director Spike Jonze has never been as magical as he is here in his feature film debut.

Although his film will always be effortless. Setting up the premise with an ease, is sugarcoated by sharp witty humor that does its own magic before the curtain drops too. What lies beneath is a thundering drama, zapping you with practically anyway, in any perspective you can see this head spinning concept explored with. But I don't want to just mention his contribution to what remains a story or a film that I do not understand to this date.\n\nThis is equally the writer, Charlie Kauffman's film. Coming from a comedic background, he can balance the humor with the drama- that he has worked exceptionally on- with his eyes closed. And it is also one of those rare screenplays that is considered to be the most unique in cinematic history and yet feels the most known and formidably a captivating show of a seen-this-seen-that humanization of the wooden faced puppets. Incredibly scary and achingly funny in what it has to procure.\n\nAnd you'd think that with such unique elements that the film is embedded with, the makers would be careful. But they are instead carelessly throwing, pitching ideas left and right in this battlefield. It is basically a football game. Chaotic chase, the last run, the last whistle that is always about to blow in this section of the game, the film is exhaustingly amped up in its speech throughout the course of the film. Being John Malkovich might start off as a social satire only to evolve into what you might think as a political statement before revealing into what we call, a human nature.",

Only a bit of a slog through the first portion of this movie hinders an otherwise masterpiece of a film. ",

Filled with a twist but smart dark humor, this film never had the slightest bit of boredom. The movie has a lot of ambiguity and theory but it's a sin if I spoil it.

Of course, Malkovich himself is perfectly game, mocking himself with glee (there is a great running gag about how everyone knows he's an actor but can't name a movie he was in).  Behind the camera, director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman craft a truly unique movie, with crazy rules that are so out there they kind of make sense (the fact Craig is a puppeteer does come into effect later).  Despite the initial craziness, the film does make nice commentary on celebrity worship and wishing to be someone other than yourself, even to your detriment.  Simply put, a true classic and a film that remains unique anything else made before or since.",

All of the performances here, including those of John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener, are solid, but the standout is, well, John Malkovich. The role seems clever enough at first, but ultimately gets deeper and more complex in rather unexpected ways as the film progresses. For a debut feature from both Kaufman and director Spike Jonze, Being John Malkovich is stunningly well done.

I understood it.

He and his discoverer try make a living off of others interests while his wife becomes jealous.\n\nCharlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze are the two people that can take a weird and strange story and make it amazingly well made and as a viewer you some how correct to it with no reason to it. I don't think I ever came across a bad movie from these genius of directing and writing and Being John Malkovich is another great film from them, they never disappoint me.\n\nThe one thing that I loved about this movie is how self aware it is. It knows it's weird with some of the scenes that will kind of question yourself for watching it but not in a horrible way more like \"I'm I weirdo for understanding this and also enjoying it?\", something like. The film has a sense of humor to itself and knows it' ridiculous but it goes along with it and man is it funny.\n\nThe director from Spike Jonze once again dose an amazing job directing this movie. He mix the humor, weird scenes and the fantasy element to it which perfectly came together so well and smoothly. Spike Jonze is fantastic director and in this he really dose shine with his talent of presenting story telling.     \n\nThe writing in this movie is probably hands down the best writing I've seen in a while. The way they pulled off this crazy story line and make it comedy gold is truly genius and worth bringing up because it's not a easy thing to do as it seems impossible for some writers out there and Kaufman makes it look easy.\n\nThe acting from everyone was excellent. John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz all three did brilliant in their roles. John Malkovich pretty much playing himself in this movie did a funny performance as himself has he get's taken over by pretty much everyone. I would pay good money to see John Malkovich been given the script for the first time to this movie while he knows nothing about it yet and him reading it and seeing his face has it probably went into WTF mode, but he said yes anywhere because the movie is about him and he give a outstanding performance.\n\nFor problems I don't really have any to be honest. I couldn't really find anything that I thought wasn't right. Well overall Being John Malkovich is smart, weirdly amazing movie with a fantastic script and outstanding directing.",

            "content": "In a year full of movies like Magnolia, American Beauty, O Brother, Where Art Thou, Gladiator, Toy Story 2, the list goes on, Being John Malkovich entered the fray relatively quietly. But that feeling of reservedness only lasts until you actually see the film.\u00a0\n\nThe first quarter seems like crazy on overload, then by the second half, you realise that this feeling is just the craziness straining to get off the leash. Our main Craig Schwartz is a puppeteer, specialising in, shall we say, more adult puppet shows than most streetgoers are used to catching glimpses of on a city street corner. After feeling the need to get a real job, he takes up a filing position at LesterCorp. After working on the 71/2 floor (a gag which needs to be seen to be understood) for a while, he finds something interesting about the building in which he works. Something interesting in the form of a small door which has some startling side effects upon entering. From there the film goes crackerdog with some ridiculous scenes and even more ridiculous plotlines with some great gags to boot.\u00a0\n\nAt the centre of the madness is Craig Schwartz, played by an on-top-of-his-game John Cusack. Cusack really is fantastic here were in some films he might feel forced or out of place. He plays the miserable straight man perfectly and leaves plenty of room to move with great use of restraint throughout the film. Cameron Diaz is similiarly refreshing in this and helps to make you realise that, despite the typical hollywood look and not the most consistent choice of roles, she is a fantastic actress, and one with a funnybone too. As the third side of the Diaz/Cuzack love triangle, Catherine Keener excels as Maxine Lund. She makes a true character out of what could have been your typical seductress: smart, strange, confident, all that jazz. And of course, the man in the title, John Malkovich, is brilliant, playing the whiny, paranoid, uppity actor, unafraid to send himself up so entirely and so committedly. He's often good at crazy and it shows in this.\u00a0\n\nSpike Jonze's direction in this is outstanding. He makes use of some very strange angles in order to position his audience perfectly, manipulating us like puppets who can't feel the strings. Never has a dancing puppet felt so real and emotional as it has with him at its helm.\u00a0\n\nBut it's the script that makes this movie so outstanding. Today, Kaufman scripts are well known to be amazing but it was this breakout screenplay that created the reputation and platform for such pieces as Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Synedoche, New York. The everyday language is something to behold; a curious blend of realism and biting comedy, it takes you by surprise every time. Scenes such as the job interview are just portions of the sparkling wit surrounded by utter ridiculousness which is the majority of the film. But possibly the best thing about the script is the fact that what could have become a one-trick-pony very easily is most definitely a complete work. It may limp across the finish line but there is no doubt that the film is resolved in those last chilling moments. And, in trend-setting for any Kaufman scripts which followed after, the underlying message behind all the crazy set pieces is the thing which will stay with you the longest.\u00a0\n\nBeing John Malkovich will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea. There are its lovers, and just as strong there are its haters. And even though there may be the odd misstep here and there, one thing's for sure: it's a movie experience you'll never forget. And if that's not what film is about, what is?\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nMalkovich. Malkovich Malkovich. Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nSpike Jonze has recently swept me away with his take on modern love, Her, and before that my experience with the director has been on the fence as the previous film that I watched from Jonze was his sophomore film Adaptation, which to me was one of the most confusing and challenging experiences that I ever had; though in saying this, I am not saying that I was completely disappointed with it, as it is one of the most original pieces of narrative that I have ever seen and the multi-layered execution by Jonze was ambitious, but far from flawless. Charlie Kaufman on the other hand, though has confused me with Adaptation, he has also spawned one of the most tender and honest films I have seen to date, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. So after seeing Being John Malkovich, I have seen both auteurs in their roots, and does the experience fair better than their second collaboration together? Most definitely, telling a story that is much simple but nevertheless ambitious and original, featuring complex but appealing characters and relationship dynamics that blend together well that bring in identifiable and fundamental drives or complications that balances out the film's complexities.\n\nBeing John Malkovich begins by showing its central protagonist, an unsuccessful but passionate puppeteer Craig Schwartz. As the film progresses, more characters are introduced and become much more important to the story, and Kaufman achieves this with such grace and beauty, just like the performances that Craig is able to bring with his puppets; this is where the film becomes somewhat meta, as though the film wraps the audience inside its plot, it manages to become self-aware of the artists behind it that pulls the strings, particularly Kaufman. It is almost as if he is controlling the film's characters and through that, he metaphorically moves our strings, allowing us to react the way he wants us to towards its characters and story. Sometimes we feel just like Malkovich, trying to understand what exactly is happening, but the longer we stare into the film's frame, the more we lose a sense of ourselves and see nothing but the characters right in front of us, observing them at their most vulnerable and most poignant of states.\n\nThe film's premise of a portal that allows other people to peer into the eyes/body/mind of another person does raise existential questions and the film no doubt dabs on it; but engaging the film on this level, is not required to find pleasure and empathy during the experience. For the bulk of the film, I was watching the film, focusing on the characters and the emotional and psychological struggles they go through, like what did this experience mean to Lotte and what are the reasoning behind Craig's lustful drive; as already on its surface, Kaufman has already brought something amazing, characters that are grounded enough that we are able to identify with their problems, and complex or unique just enough that we are intrigued by them and would want to learn more about them; it is through this balance that Kaufman has kept my attention throughout and it was the way Jonze handles these characters, does the film become more than just a playful fiction of our realities.\n\nBeing John Malkovich also delivers strongly in its ability to visually engage us, and achieves so without the usage of computer graphic imagery, or at least from what I could see. Jonze does not create mystery in Kaufman's vision, allowing us to see the insides of this portal, and lets the audience themselves see through Malkovich's eyes, without forgetting the fact that we are following a particular character's journey rather than creating one for our own; and by that I mean that when we look through his eyes, we are actually seeing it from another person's perspective and feeling the emotions that she is evoking at that moment rather than finding and manufacturing ones of our own. The film also lets us peer inside Craig Schwartz's mind but at a more symbolic level, through the art that he creates from his puppets; I felt every inch of sadness and disappointment that fills his body, and does so without having to take its audience in a literal journey. The film definitely takes its story and characters seriously but a layer of comedy runs through all aspects of its production, whether it may be the design of the office floor, or the reactions from its characters during particular situations, or it could be the first-person moments through Malkovich's eyes; all of this is done so without distracting the audience at all from the drama that drives it, and letting the characters become realistically dark when they need to.\n\nCatherine Keener's role is much subtler when regarding to its effect of the film, as many would simply see her as just this lustful object for its two central protagonists, but she actually is the key to the great performances that is delivered by both Diaz and Cusack, bringing out the deeper aspects of both of their characters. Her performance as Maxine Lund was definitely good, but to say it was the only performance in this deserving of an Academy Award is preposterous, as both Diaz and Cusack were also wonderful here. I would say John Malkovich is also deserving of this accolade, but due to the film's self-awareness and playful factor towards the character, probably lets viewers see him as more of an apparatus or driver for the film's plot.\n\nBeing John Malkovich, the film that showcased to the world the outstanding talents of both Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, is one of a kind; delivering originality that many products of contemporary cinema have been unable to remotely achieve. Jonze and Kaufman have brought something that is quite ahead of its time.",

The result of that made the ending unsatisfying when the characters changed to Malkovich's level of weirdness or a little of the same as his past film roles.\n\nThe cause of their change in character was they were being obsessed with Malkovich's head. John Cusack's unsuccessful puppeteer character became desperate and a little creep like Malkovich's role in \"Dangerous Liaisons.\" Cameron Diaz's pet-loving character had turned to obsessive and jealousy with some nastiness and stubbornness to annoy. Catherine Keener's character is the film's nasty side as she brought the nastiness to Diaz and how the film turned out to be since she's a more successful puppeteer without being one. Malkovich was the only innocent character as he was being used and tortured by the people getting in his head having their personality changed.\n\n\"It's my head!\" - John Malkovich\n\nBut the best part is how very original it is with the inventive ideas to the script and the story and the surprises.\n\n\"Being John Malkovich\" may have fell short under the expectancy of greatness I was expecting to enjoy out of this entertainment due to the unsatisfying end. But the originality kept this up at a 4-star level when the script and the story and a little of the performances helped. (B+)\n\nIf there's ever going to be a remake or reboot on another actor as the lab subject, Johnny Depp may be a good choice only if he receive more freedom and less torture than what Malkovich went through.",

Charlie Kaufman's strange yet bold story of an out-of-work puppeteer turned office temp worker who finds a door that leads into the mind of John Malkovich was a tough sell back in the 90's, even at a time when the indie film scene was burgeoning with new ideas and fresh approaches. It's one of those films that's almost impossible to explain to someone who hasn't seen it. Most would call it a romantic comedy with a twist, but it's more complicated than that, and it raises a few issues in your own mind about identity, love and loss, as well as making you think a lot more than you would in a traditional romantic comedy. It plays around with a lot conventions and turns them on their head. The cast is pretty interesting as well, including John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, and of course, John Malkovich himself. They all give terrific performances.

A film which consists of a portal which allows you to see what acclaimed actor John Malkovich sees is a unique premise. The script is inventive and is hilarious throughout. There are some really clever moments features which will never fit in with any other film.\nWhat makes this film successful is the fact that the actual John Malkovich is prepared to spoof himself. Malkovich naturally does not have the look of someone who would be so willing to parody himself, but he really lets go here. Seeing the actor jump around a room like a puppet is something you will have never seen him do before. When he decides to enter his own portal, you are presented with a scene which is unbelievable and a must-see.\nAway from Malkovich, the film showcases many great talents. John Cusack is excellent as the struggling puppeteer and Orson Bean is surprisingly funny. Catherine Keener was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, and whilst she can't be faulted, I believe that Cameron Diaz should have got the mention instead. Unrecognisable to her usual look, Diaz plays one of the more complex characters in a performance not normally seen from her. There are also many cameos from Hollywood Stars with Charlie Sheen providing some of the films best laughs.\nBeing John Malkovich should have gained more recognition as there are so many great things about it. Spike Jonze has really created something unique which is not seen very often on film.",

            "content": "What in the world did I just watch? Holy cow, this movie is insane. Even spelling out the premise is enough to make your head spin: A puppeteer is struggling for money so he gets a job for a filing company. While at this job he discovers a secret door that takes you into the mind of John Malkovich. You then experience life through Malkovich's body for 15 minutes after which you are dropped out onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike. WHAT?! And that's just the general synopsis, I didn't even touch on things like a couple who lives in an apartment full of disabled animals, or the office being on the seven and a half floor where the ceilings are only about 4-feet high, or a secretary who seemingly can't hear every fourth word you say and continues to miss the same word every time you repeat yourself. I mean this world that has been generated is so ludicrously off the wall that I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be laughing or just shaking my head in confusion. It's truly a fantasy film in many ways because all the characters (with the possible exception of John Malkovich) never act surprised by anything that is going on.\n\nI think I could accept the insanity of the world Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze created for me, but there are 2 big issues I have with the movie. First of all, I feel like they are trying to make some pretty interesting and serious points about discovering your own identity and sexuality. It's some powerful stuff that I think the cast could have handled relatively well. However, since the tone of the movie is downright farcical, it just feels out of place when they start hitting us with these heady concepts. Also when you're in a world where John Malkovich's agent has no issue with his client making a request to stop acting in order to put all his efforts into puppetry, or a coworker doesn't even question when someone suggests they've found a door into John Malkovich's mind, suddenly I feel like you're making these real world issues (like sexual orientation) seem just as fantastical. The movie raises interesting questions, but never really addresses them because it doesn't take place in reality.\n\nMy other big problem is one that is not unique to this film, but it always is difficult for me to accept. None of the characters are likable, and there is no real protagonist. For part of the movie you can kind of sympathize with John Cusack, but then he becomes unhinged. The same situation arises with Cameron Diaz, she starts off quite nice, but becomes overly whiny and eventually she also goes insane. Catherine Keener is detestable from the beginning, although I think the character she's portraying is intended that way. Even Malkovich kind of rubs me the wrong way. I sympathize with what is happening to him, but I can't say I got to know him well enough to get attached to him. (It is worth pointing out, though, that his acting is solid and you really see a difference in his performance when someone is controlling him.) Perhaps the only person I find tolerable is Orson Bean as Dr. Lester, and he's barely in the film. I can't say Being John Malkovich is a bad film, I'm just utterly puzzled by it and therefore found little enjoyment from watching it. It's definitely one I don't need to see again. Oh, and one final point that I couldn't figure out where else to work into this review, but it needed to be mentioned. The actual puppetry that is shown is PHENOMENAL. The movements of the puppets is so perfect and life-like, I think I could have watched a 90-minute movie of just that and probably would have enjoyed it more.",

When Kaufman rang and I began to say that I wasnt interested in the offer, he said, brightly, I'm calling to tell you that you won!\n\nThat set the tone for our conversation. Although Kaufman resists being pinned down about his life or work, I found him playful and accessible. His message is that he has no message. His movie has provoked comparisons to Franz Kafka and Lewis Carroll, but he reminds me more of Larry David, who with Seinfeld created a TV series - about nothing.\n\nI really dont have any solutions and I dont like movies that do, said Kaufman. I want to create situations that give people something to think about. I hate a movie that will end by telling you that the first thing you should do is learn to love yourself. That is so insulting and condescending, and so meaningless. My characters dont learn to love each other or themselves..\"\n\nI enjoyed the weirdest details and the realistic nonsense that plays so close to the truth - perfect pitched sarcasm mixed with desperation and all the awkward missteps John Cusack plays to the hilt.\n\nBrilliant cultural comments about getting a new job, being misunderstood in relationships, even acting your clumsy self then trying to make up for it. \nThe passionless marriage between Diaz and Cusack is seemingly reinvigorated, but rather morphed into something else - disturbing, unreal, wow.\nIt's all here.\nThe things we do to cope with our world, and the fantasy worlds we create to escape it. \nI didn't get it all at first, I initially liked it for the weirdness, but then it clicked - I saw the many parallels to my own weird existence & then I fell in Love..\n\nIt's a predecessor to Punch Drunk Love with the same feel and complex simplicity.\n\nThere's even a Cocoon omage at the end!

He then uses Malkovich to get with a girl for whom he has an extreme infatuation towards. The concept may be hard to take in at times but it is difficult not to appreciate it due to its sheer originality. One of the impressive features was the beginning which delicately introduces the audience to this unfulfilled puppeteer. Credit to John Malkovich who allowed himself to be the subject of such a storyline, while also putting in a good performance. While not off-the-scale hilarious, I love its odd sense of humour which caters to my laughing needs so I found it pretty funny. Furthermore, the questions it raises about our meta-physical being, the mind and identity are interesting to say the least. The explanation and the eventual revelations over potential problems of this mind-entering process are absurd but I'm glad they did not spend too much time trying to offer scientific explanations as this would only further undermine the plot in trying to explain something which was clearly unexplainable. I don't get why Cusack and Cameron Diaz's characters have such as wild lust for this 'Maxine' woman when she is clearly quite rude to Cusack; plus she isn't particularly good looking. This might have made the movie a little less realistic but with a story like this I doubt that was what they were going for. The ending, like the beginning, was a work of pure art, successfully evoking a range of emotions in the viewer while bringing the story arch into full circle. Understandably, a film involving people being able to go inside someone's head might go over some people's heads. However, I feel cinema success is not obtained through high budget action films or needless sequels but rather through adventurous and daring screenplays such as this which invites viewers into a new world of fantasy. If you have an open mind then I suggest you open your mind to 'Being John Malkovich'.",

It's oddball plot seems like its most obvious strong point but it also does a fine job at keeping a bleak and downtrodden atmosphere for its characters while being funny for the viewers. \n\nThe story also isn't just am endless stream of plot points that are there solely to be weird- the story actually goes somewhere and does something without ever taking itself serious.\n\nIt's brilliantly shot too and the emphasis on puppetry still feels fresh and underused today, despite the film being 13/14 years old now. It feels like the 90s but the film also feels ahead of its time and so it fits perfectly today- a sign of a great movie.\n\nIt tows a fine line between being genuinely funny and becoming another 'celebrities exist in the  film's world too!' movie with cameos from the likes of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn but it's originality keeps it on the good end of that line and I think that's the answer to the famous question of why John Malkovich and not Tom Cruise? Malkovich was the perfect in between and the film pokes fun at this throughout and it really begins to feel like no one else would have been right for the film (though I maintain that there should be a sequel starring Nicolas Cage, but alas.)\n\nIt's a very 'adult' film with its dark moments and heavy themes, not to mention all of the sex-talk and whatnot, but it stays lighthearted somehow and is always interesting and intriguing. What could have been juvenile comedy, actually feels very intelligent. \n\nIt's also a sign of things to come for Kaufman, with one scene in particular involving Malcovich's subconscious feeling very similar to 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' so if you enjoy that film, do check this one out.\n\nI'd recommend this one to you regardless because it's daring and has no right to be as good and as powerful as it actually is.",

            "content": "I would like to officially change the definition of weird to this movie, even though that might not work because this movie is beyond weird, and creepy, yet surprisingly still of good (but not great) quality. Being John Malkovich is very, very original and unique, but at times being as outrageously different as it was happened to be it's biggest weakness that caused this from being a film I could have loved (the basic premise is amazing) to a film I only slightly put over the edge for a \"Panda Approves\" seal. \n\nLet me start with what could have made this film fantastic, and that is the very unique and creative premise. *Slight spoilers ahead, but not major* The film has the premise that the characters find a door and small hallway that when they walk through it they go inside the brain of John Malkovich for 15 minutes. This premise brings forth very excellent scenes about Malkovich's subconscious and those are the scene's that honestly work the best and what bring the movie the most potential. However I did say potential so that means, yes, something crushes that potential, and that is the triangle between John Cusack, Camerine Diaz, and Catherine Keeper's characters. The triangle bloated the plot line and although it made it more complex and even more weird (and brought the creep factor in at many parts) it almost made it nonsensical at points. What's weird is John Cusack's character and his creepiness worked for the film, and Catherine Keeper's character (Maxine) would have worked if there wasn't Cameron Diaz's character within the movie. Just adding her character into the movie completely took away any motive behind Keeper's character, by complicating the story that much you saw no motivation in Keeper's actions or any believe-ability in them (and I think it may have worked without Camerine Diaz's character, because she was believable in the parts that did not have to do with her). This movie should have revolved around John Malkovich instead with how complicated the plot got it revolved around Catherine Keeper, and it should not have because the obsession with the character Maxine was not what drove the interest (although it could have worked if they cut the bloat Camerine Diaz's character pulled in the script, maybe not cut her character but remove her interest with Catherine Keeper). With all of this mess it also made John Malkovich's character the only one that had any relate-ability (which you don't necessarily need) and was also the most interesting. It would have worked much better if the film revolved around the title character and how people came inside him than the convoluted, confusing love triangle that script brought. So ultimately the film's greatest strength (the script) was also it's biggest flaw (again the script). \n\nThere were some very masterful moments within this movie, some that brought sheer disgust (like they should have) in the gross obsession people had at the chance to have another life, a better life. It brought out the insanity in very, very flawed characters (and aren't we all) however it fails at ever demonstrating the victim in the crime the movie portrays, and thusforth you never truly see the full impact of the situation. While the entire film had moments of genius within its script that often brought it to it's greatest fault where it becomes so messy and dark that it fails to reach its fullest potential. 6.5/10 for Being John Malkovich",

Finally I saw this inventive comedy-fantasy written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze.  And I simply loved it. I loved the stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich, I loved the story, I love the way everything was put together, I loved the feeling I had after watching the movie...  Craig Schwartz (Cusack), a puppeteer who finds a portal that leads into Malkovich's mind, and his \"adventures\" kept surprising me during the movie, from the start to the end - never stopping or slowing down. When Cusack asked his agent to present him with the \"craziest, most unproduceable script you can find\" he didn't know what was he getting involved in... but after reading it he was so impressed with the script, that he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, with which he won the role. Charlie Kaufman's idea of Being John Malkovich originated simply as \"a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife\" and he kept adding further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor 7 1/2 of the Mertin Flemmer building... actually at the first versions John Malkovich was nowhere to be seen! When all the studios in 1994 had an opportunity to read the final version - they all turned it down. Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Spike Jonze and he read it in 1996. In 1997 he accepted to direct the movie. \r\n\r\nThis outstandingly exciting movie full with surprises will keep you entertained with crazy story, excellent dialogues intelligently shortened to a bare minimum told by the variety of unique individuals who you'll remember long after watching this work of art: John Cusack stars as Craig, a street puppeteer with his dark and neurotic puppets; Cameron Diaz as Craig's wife, Lotte, running a pet store, and their home is overrun with animal boarders, most of them deeply disturbed; Catherine Keener is Craig's co-worker Maxine, and she has her way of listening with her lips slightly parted,  ready to interrupt by exposing you for the fool that you are; John Malkovich is imaginary version of himself and he becomes a part of a story when Craig finds a small doorway which is some kind of temporal-spatial portal, ending up inside the brain of the actor...\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of stories with a twist which can make funny serious and serious funny, which can balance perfectly sad with satirical, weird with touching, and keep you satisfied for almost two hours - there is one for you!",

Occupants observe Malkovich's actions for fifteen minutes before being ousted onto the New Jersey turnpike. Catherine Keener is the sexy, caustic office worker who becomes the object of affections; an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz is Cusak's frumpy wife; and John Malkovich is self-mockingly amiable as a fictionalized version of himself. This is the feature film debut of writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze. A subjective camera is used for Malkovich's perspective. There are ingenious sequences that suggest Fellini: Malkovich enters the portal where everyone looks like him and repetitiously utters his name; multiple characters simultaneously occupy the portal so that we view his subconscious. This is an ingenious satire on performance art, celebrity infatuation, and sexual identity. Had this been a sixty-minute short, this comedy may have been a minor classic, but during a two hour running time, the material begins to fade. With Orson Bean as the sexually obsessed 105-year-old boss, plus appearances by Charlie Sheen and Sean Penn.",

Is the movie as much fun? Yeah, but only when we are with John Malkovich. The fight over his body and mind -- i.e., who controls the body and who has sex with the body -- is a delight, and there is something so endearing and inspirational about *SPOILER* John Malkovich's career change into puppetry. Even though I know someone else is controlling the body, I sincerely believe it is Malkovich who wanted this. That goes to show how crafty of a puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is. Still, I feel like this movie gives far too much weight to its insipid love triang-- trapezoid(?) of unlikable characters. Except John Malkovich. There is something especially naked about the actor, to play himself, living his normal life, and, along with Spike Jonze's oddball touches (you have never seen enough Malkovich until he enters his own psyche), Being John Malkovich succeeds on craftsmanship.
