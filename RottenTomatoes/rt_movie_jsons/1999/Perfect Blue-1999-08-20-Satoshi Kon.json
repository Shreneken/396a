It took a little while to grow on me while watching it, but by the end, I was totally engrossed in the protagonist's story, her deteriorating mental state, the social commentary on the dark side of stardom, fandom, and the exploitative nature of show business.\n\nCheck this one out if you haven't. It's really good.",

This movie is disorienting and confusing to watch but is a movie I already want to revisit. It is a movie that is far from a casual watch, but film lovers should definitely check it out. The storytelling is unique and I enjoyed the themes and the way the story played out. It is one of those films that is a lot to take in but the more I thought about it the more I loved it. I can see this becoming a film I like more and more after multiple rewatched but as it stands it is still an outstanding and creative psychological thriller that I had a blast experiencing.",

I've always heard of Perfect Blue but never gave it an afterthought as it wasn't giant robots, giant transforming robots, ninjas, ninjas killing demons… you get the point. I rolled the dice and Perfect Blue is a legendary anime for a reason. It's a taut psychological thriller about a pop star who wants to break into acting… and what happens when it can't be tolerated. The ending was a twist - one I didn't see coming. And the entire time you aren't sure if it's real or not… but the ending is very satisfying. I'm shocked, absolutely shocked no Hollywood studio has tried to ruin this with an adaptation yet (looking at you Netflix). This is a perfect movie, regardless if you're an anime fan or not. It may be animated, but the story is every bit as dark as Black Swan with Natalie Portperson.",

            "content": "Satoshi's way of depicting and drawing characters in his movies is so weird and unique, it has a realistic style, opposite of what most anime movies do. There's a lot of emphasis on the eyes. You can tell whether a person is important, or incompetent, or smart or attractive or even shady with the way he draws eyes on the characters. Either making them look small, or putting them far apart, or making them big and beautiful. I can already tell this movie is going to be about fandom, obsessions over pop idols and the dangers that come with fame.\n\nThose lyrics the girls are singing on stage could definitely be taken the wrong way. They're basically saying be more aggressive towards finding love because in the end, you'll get a chance and you will be loved. This message is wrong, man. This kind of opens the door for creeps and perverts to interpret it in their own messed up way. I can already tell that creepy-looking security guard with the green/grey eyes is idolizes her and is obsessed with her, he looks kind of inbred lol. He's probably going to stalk her and record her when she's not looking.\n\nThat was so jarring how the tone of the movie completely changed once she received that fax that was calling her a traitor. The way the intense music creeps in and the lighting changes was beautifully done. It seems like Mima isn't cut out for the film industry. The way everything becomes overwhelming to her when she's getting ready to say her one line isn't a good sign. This movie just gets darker and more ominous doesn't it? Now the letter that was supposed to be for Mima explodes in her manager's hands when he opens it. He unknowingly saved her life. I don't like how calm and nonchalant Mima's agent is about the whole letter incident. It's almost like she doesn't care about Mima's wellbeing.\n\nReally cool to see the beginning stages of the Internet back in the late 90's and how they portray it in this animated movie. I remember like it was yesterday, I'll never forget that horrid dial up sound. Really great use of the red tapestry hanging on top of the computer, probably warning us about psychological harm it might cause to Mima. In a way, Mima does like the attention and the \"love\" she receives from fans, and this is what's going to get her in trouble. I bet the person who created the Mima's Room website was the creepy guy from the concert. I love how self-aware and meta that scene was when the guys at the video store are talking about how psychological thrillers are all the same and boring. I can't imagine what it must feel like to know that you're being stalked and followed. How darkly ironic how Cham is 83rd on the pop charts and is gaining popularity now that Mima is gone from the group. I can't imagine the amount of pressure Mima feels now that she has to prove herself as an actress and now that Cham is actually doing better without her.\n\nOk, I was wrong about Mima's agent. She is actually trying to protect her and her image, you can see how worried she is when Mima willfully agrees to doing the rape scene. It's really shocking how quickly she agrees to it without even putting up a fight or standing up for herself, especially a scene that's so dark. It seems like she's kind of desperate at his point, it also doesn't help that she's shy and lacks self esteem. I don't like how Mima is compromising herself to a rape scene just so she can make it as an actress. Darker and darker the further we go. It's like going down a rabbit hole of bad decisions lol. She's bringing herself to a new low and sexualizing herself in the worst way. It's absolutely ridiculous how they wrote the rape scene specifically for her character in the show. It's like they want to torture her psychologically and purposefully ruin her image, they're trying to see how far she's willing to go to get what she wants. I felt so uncomfortable watching that rape scene, I was grimacing the whole time, that was hard to watch. I like how the guy on top of her tells her, \"I'm so sorry\", which ended up being some well-needed comedic relief. I wonder if that guy was a fan of hers when she was in Cham. My god, I can't imagine the psychological torture that must be to go through, even if it is just acting. I don't think she was acting during certain parts though, she legitimately looked terrified. You can tell she lost a part of herself that made her innocent. This is quickly turning into a horror movie. I can see the writings on the wall and they don't look pretty for Mima. \n\nIt's so weird, I don't know what to make of this stalker guy yet. It seems like his intentions are good since he's trying to protect her and is acting like the voice of reason for Mima on his website. But idk just yet, it's still too early to completely tell. Is he actually her disfigured guardian angel or is he trying to steer her down a certain path while also twisting her thoughts? It's like he's living his life through hers while also wanting to control and manipulate it at the same time. This guy has a lot of time on his hands. This movie does a great job at showcasing how media can desensitize us to violence, sex and murder. It's interesting to see how her subconscious is battling with her in an illusory physical form, trying to coax her to go back into singing with Cham. It's kind of disturbing seeing how comfortable Mima seems to be posing nude. She's lost all innocence and is determined to get rid of her pop idol image. The creepy stalker guy isn't worried about protecting Mima, he's worried about protecting her image as a pop idol. Maybe the stalker guy is a metaphor that Mima is imagining. If only she had listened to her true self that was reaching out to her early on instead of ignore her, she probably would have been in a better situation. \n\nOk that third act made my brain hurt lol, it had my head spinning like a top. Even if one was prepared for it, I still think it would swipe you off your feet. Ok, that was an incredible twist with how she was the one that killed the screenwriter and photographer. Now the real question is, is it reality or is she imagining herself doing these killings? So basically Mima has dissociative identity disorder and her former pop idol self that kept visiting her and coaxing her to go back to being a singer was a metaphor of her innocent self. She tried preserving her former pop idol self but that innocent girl was long gone, ever since the strip club scene. It's a metaphor for her younger more innocent self who wants to come back. But the thing is that Mima is refusing her because she's moved on already. And then Rumi, her agent, also ended up having DID when we see her attacking Mima and then finally see her in the psychiatric ward imagining herself being the pop idol version of Mima. So I'm guessing it was Rumi and the stalker dude who committed the murders. That ending, although kind of obscure, I interpret it as a positive and hopeful one. Although Rumi is now forever in a psych ward stuck with the old Mima in her head, the real Mima seems to be in a better state of mind. She seems more in control now having merged both the old and the new Mima accepting them both equally and accepting herself as she is. She is one now, she is the real Mima. \n\nThe animations and art style are outdated since the movie came out in the 90's, but it still looks wonderful and beautiful. It's full of color and personality and the whole aesthetic is really pleasant and unique to look at. I love the way the movie intercuts going from present to past to future in the beginning. The foreshadowing in this movie is exceptional. My god, the way they can create and amplify tension and suspense is remarkable. It penetrates the soul. This movie was way ahead of its time. The way it portrays social media even in the 90's when social media wasn't even a thing back then is almost shaman-like, like a fortune teller looking into the future. It's actually kind of scary and haunting the way they able to foresee the negative psychological effects social media can have on people. And mind you, this is way before Facebook, Instagram and MySpace. The movie's also a compelling story about the inner workings of the movie industry and how the pressures of the film industry can make people lose their minds. \n\nPerfect Blue is an extraordinary masterpiece that serves as both a cautionary tale and a compelling about growing up. The movie brilliantly explores the fear of losing oneself or a part of oneself and the fear of people perceiving us in a way that we don't choose and even worse, that perception becoming a reality. Exceptionally paced, beautifully drawn/animated, masterfully edited and brilliantly written. This movie is an entertaining, enthralling, gripping and compelling cinematic experience unlike any other. It is an essential watch, an important watch that not only deals with values and ideals but also loneliness, the dangers of the Internet & social media, the perception of one's own image, obsessive behaviors and the importance of mental health. The music heightens the movies creepiness, tension and haunting elements to new levels. It helps to build the whole experience into a waking nightmare. The ideas and concepts are executed brilliantly with remarkable creativity. The way it blurs the line between reality and fantasy while also mirroring and merging the two simultaneously is amazing, it's like a magic trick you can't quite understand. Equal parts disturbing, hypnotic, disorienting, creepy, terrifying and suspenseful. Perfect Blue is a disorienting and hauntingly thrilling journey. An experience that grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go until the very end, and even after the credits roll, you'll probably still be thinking about it. The movie has so many layers and is so complex at times that it'll make your head spin. It's not for the faint of heart or the meek. But I do recommend for everyone and anyone to go watch it. This movie 100% deserves to be viewed multiple times. Masterpiece!",

            "content": "The unravel.  So this is about a pop star (Junko Iwao).  She is in a girl group but wants to leave that behind and get into acting.  Her sanity begins spiraling when a stalker does not approve of her recent career change and decides to do something about it.  The line between reality and dreaming begins to blur.  Now, I recognize this mostly in name only, and I didn't know a ton about it.  I've been more accepting of anime the more I get into Evangelion, and as I'm about to wrap up that superb show, I wanted to expand my palate even further.  There's no better place to look for a recommendation than the Letterboxd list of Top 250 Narrative films, and once again, it is a list that doesn't disappoint.  Now I did appreciate the fact that this movie doesn't spend a lot of time messing around, it gets you right into it almost immediately.  I mean it's only 81 minutes long, so it's not like they have much room for fat, but regardless.  They show you the mounting pressures this girl faces daily, and they spell out the gravity behind the risk she is taking by making this monumental change.  That also helps play into the overall story as well, which I did not realize was a psychosocial horror story beforehand.  Because this girl is carrying such an overwhelming burden, it would perfectly understandable if she were to have a mental breakdown.  This keeps you guessing in a good way; so much of what makes this movie engaging is that you're just trying to figure out what is actually happening.  Is she being aggressively stalked to the nth level?  Can her brain just not take the building stress?  Is this a schizophrenia situation?  Well, that's for you to find out, and this is the type of movie where you will want to revisit it from a different perspective.  I'm still making up my mind on how I ultimately feel about Perfect Blue.  I know I liked what I saw, and the fact that I am still thinking about it days after my viewing speaks volumes.  The biggest comparison that kept jumping out at me throughout was that this is strikingly similar to 2010's Black Swan.  There are many beats that are almost identical, so Darren Aronofsky can claim all he wants to that he wasn't influenced by this, but I'm not buying it.  The bathtub scene here is recreated second-for-second in his earlier movie Requiem for a Dream, so he is clearly a fan whether he admits it or not.  I reserve my right to change my rating later about this, but as it stands right now, I can give it a sizable thumb up.",

            "content": "While anime is often regarded as a cinematic and televisual medium geared mostly towards children, films like Perfect Blue come along to demonstrate that, while they might be bright and colourful, they can still deal with very dark, very adult themes. The movie plays out like a tale by Hitchcock, with elements of identity, voyeurism and paranoia playing a big part in the story. It's about a pop star who gives up her music career to try and make it as an actress, starring in a TV show while being stalked by a deformed assailant and having several of her colleagues turning up dead, which serves to slowly drive her insane. Satoshi Kon often dealt with the blurring of fiction and reality in his movies, and the film takes great advantage of this by never letting us know exactly which site of the line we're on. Many of the events later on feel utterly bizarre and nonsensical, but were looking at things from the perspective of a fragmented mind, so it makes sense for them to be like that. I'll admit I had a hard time keeping up with the plot towards the end, and when I looked up the plot summary on Wikipedia, I discovered there were parts that I completely misunderstood. It's a film that requires a lot of concentration and a willingness to indulge it during some of its stranger scenes, but it works so well because the protagonist is so likable, and you always want to see her come out safe. I can imagine the live action version of the film is pretty compelling too, but there's a lot more you can do with animation, so I reckon this is the version that people will enjoy the most. If you have time, definitely give it a look.",

Told largely from the perspective of a protagonist who begins to doubt her own hold on reality, Takeuchi's story brilliantly weaves fantasy and truth, but it's Kon as director who composes the visuals that tie everything together to make it not only genuinely suspenseful but totally immersive. Imagine the skill that it takes to make an audience resonate with a pop idol protagonist; Kon does so by making Mima's struggle seem terrifyingly poignant, if not outright relatable. Plenty of twists and a short runtime combined with a high level of quality at every level mean that Perfect Blue will be a film that you can't take your eyes from. \n\nAnd yes, Aronofsky lifted a lot from Kon, and in particular Perfect Blue.

It is visually magnificent, the cinematography is defining excellence, and the ending is a 7th fold. If you love movies that are cerebral, intelligent, and sociopolitical, and know what all these words mean in their entirety, you will love this film. If you don't like anime because it is anime, you're opinion is irrelevant for everything everywhere, because these Artists had to draw Every Frame, and you know that saying about 1000 words? This film, and films like it, are talking in the Billions. Every frame is art, and is on Every \"best anime's\" list since its' release. An excellent film, and you Must watch it 2 times. If you watch it 1 time, you just won't get it; like Inception that Requires 2 viewings. One of the best of it's kind and genre!",

Mima Kirigoe is a pop idol and a member of the girl group, Cham, who have a legion of (entirely male) followers.  When she decides to leave the group to become an actress,  one of her stalker-ish fans is not happy and creates a website (using Netscape Navigator) pretending to offer her daily diary (\"Mima's Room\").  This starts to create a breach between the real Mima and the fictional online Mima, at least in Mima's head.  The TV drama (about a serial killer) that she has a recurring bit part in doesn't help.  In order to drastically change her image, her agent okays a rape scene in a strip club (which is disturbingly recreated here, alternating between onscreen action and between takes reality â\" but Mima becomes lost in the mix).  As her career moves further from the innocent pop idol phase (next up, nude photos), Mima experiences more jarring breaks with reality.  She begins to be haunted by a spectral image of her former self â\" and also by her stalking fan.  Meanwhile, someone is killing the writer, director, and other members of the TV show cast.  Or are they?  It is definitely difficult to discern what is real, what is the TV program, and what is only in Mima's disoriented consciousness, thanks to the script and Satoshi Kon's direction.  So, yes, there is more than a little Hitchcock or De Palma here but the freedom of anime allows things to get much weirder than a real staging might allow.  And darker.  Sure, everything appears to be tied up with a bow by the end but the themes linger, echoing throughout our culture, perhaps even more prominently today. What will be done for fame?  And what are its consequences in our online/physical society?",

            "content": "The greatest anime film I have ever watched!\n\nPerfect Blue (1997) is a twisted and fascinating take on Japanese Idol culture, fandom, stardom, obsession, voyeurism, rape, murder, and paranoia. Perfect Blue is animated euphoria in an absolutely disturbing psychological horror film. I have never seen a movie more mature and profound in anime history. It looks deeply into how sleazy the acting world remains, how dangerous fandom can devolve, and how frighteningly lonely the idol world can feel. You will have never seen anything like Perfect Blue. The closest comparison would be to End of Evangelion, Requiem for a Dream, or Black Swan.\n\nPerfect Blue features stunning animation with vivid color and realistic detail. The backgrounds look like a real city in Tokyo, while the rooms replicate such grounded visions of real life that they could be the genuine thing. \n\nI must note the references to the burgeoning technological revolution in the 1990's feels quaint when you see fax machines, fat computers, old website designs, and older phones. On the other hand, Perfect Blue's use of technology reveals a scathing critique of how computers, e-mails, and the internet access has weaponized fan obsession. We bear witness to atrocity time and again in both Perfect Blue and real life when fans' obsession turns into derangement. Such violence is not solely to blame on technology, but we must acknowledge how mental illness has multiplied into public carnage in certain idol murders, attacks, and stalkers. Perfect Blue thus remains ever relevant to contemporary audiences.\n\nLastly, the score to Perfect Blue is a mixture of J-Pop style songs to synthesizer industrial music. The fading in of intense darker 1990's industrial textures Perfect Blue with nightmarish atmosphere. The tone is immediately switched from innocent idol dance numbers to heinous crimes underscored by demented clanging and sinister throbbing. The sonic vibe of Perfect Blue is truly a psychological horror melded with a noir crime thriller aesthetic.\n\nIn all, Perfect Blue will probably be burned into my memory forever. Director Satoshi Kon may rest in peace knowing he innovated the anime genre and directed a masterpiece of animation. Perfect Blue is a groundbreaking and breathtaking thriller that will shock you at every turn with its fast paced scares, clever edits, and complex narrative. Surrealism meets realism in Perfect Blue's haunting animated critique of society's obsession. Give it a watch if you dare.",

In order to salvage her career, she is advised to drop music and pursue acting. A soap opera role is offered but Mima's character is less clean cut than desired. Regardless, she agrees and events take a turn for the worse. She begins to feel reality slip, that her life is not her own. She discovers (imagines) her identical twin, a mirror image that hasn't given up singing. Internet sites appear describing every intimate detail of her life and a figure stalks her from the shadows. Her friends and associates are threatened (and killed) as Mima descends into a dangerous world of paranoid delusion. She fears for her life and must unravel fact from illusion in order to stay alive. Perfect Blue represents a major change from traditional anime subject matter, analysing the pop icon phenomenon, fame and its psychological impact on the performer.\n\nIt always shocks me how some people can dare to over look things, solid masterpieces out there but people still over look them and go see other films that are just stick in the mood basic films. I just adore the feeling of not knowing anything at the first then be amazed after wards and a film that get's you thinking as well, not like movies today that always play it save by doing the simple three act structure that I normally skip if I had the chance. Perfect Blue can be best described has a movie that you don't just put your feet up, sit back and have a delightful time, no in this you got to use your brain and try your best to piece it together to get the movie. Perfect Blue is Anime that got under my skin and drove the main character and me insane.\n\nA quick fun fact here but Black Swan is actually a remake of this movie, yes to those who didn't know that well you do now. If I have to compare what's the better movie I got to say that overall Black Swan is a great movie, but I liked Perfect Blue a lot more so Perfect Blue all the way.\n\nThe animation in this never looked so well done, so beautiful but also scary and so haunting to look at. At times I thought I was watching a Hayao Miyazaki movie or a Stanley Kubrick film at one point, just be the switch of the atmosphere like it's peacefulness and then a utterly insane feeling to the movie.\n\nFor problems: Without spoiling anything the ending to me didn't end on a good note in my opinion. It isn't terrible it's just that it left me there going \"Nah\".\n\nOverall Perfect Blue is an dark and twisted Anime movie with beautiful but haunting animation that sells the movie off has a deep thinking movie that you shouldn't get lost on track if you really want to understand the film. The film is a slow cult following that I will totally recommend to people who love Anime and analyzing films.",

The sequences in the film almost seamlessly blend into each other but much to the dismay of the audience because it makes the film more intertwined with the film that's going on inside- a ' Silence of the Lambs' remake- so much so that it completely turns the entire film upside down. This is a definitely a compliment. \n\nWith the final revelation everything seems to have been explained as we wind ourselves back withing that context, but it does suggest something more. Perhaps this is deliberately put there or is some bizarre consequences of the blurring of fantasy/fiction of the character. The films ends on a positive note but seemed underwhelming because it is abrupt, perhaps that's a Japanese trait and nevertheless the rest of the movie has done enough to make up for that making a delightful thriller.",

As this fan's actions escalate further and further, Mima becomes increasingly paranoid and delusional. Soon she can't differentiate between reality and fantasy, and contradicting events begin to blur together into a surreal exploration of Mima's subconsciousness. The film is told in a very interesting nonlinear way, in which (like Mima) the viewer is kept in the dark about what's real and what isn't. By the end of the movie, it's still not entirely clear which scenes were just the product of Mima's delusions and which scenes were not. The film was clearly a key influence on the more recent psychological thriller Black Swan, but despite their similarities Perfect Blue is very much a unique movie. Perfect Blue is heavy on style and indecipherable at times, but it's so consistently intense and thrilling that it's well-worth watching.",

This should not be anyone's first Satoshi Kon experience, but is a wonderful addition to his legacy; it is incredibly easy to see where the inspiration for Paranoia Agent and moments of Paprika came from after watching this film.  In my mind, I imagine a trilogy from Mr. Kon with Perfect Blue, then Paranoia Agent, and ending in Paprika.",

It's a Hitchockian showcase, where reality merges with fiction, just to create an astonishingly complex cat-and-mouse game, with proper amounts of blood and gore surrounding it the whole time.\n\nWhen a young and sweet retired pop-star, beloved by many die-hard fans, tries to shine in the film industry - sullying her own good name with atrocious TV-show roles and nude photo sessions - the past comes back to haunt her in the most expressive and frightening way possible - through confounding distortion of reality and many deceptive visions. There isn't a sense of tranquility - even though the main character might aspire to achieve it - as the audience isn't sure who is who in this surrealistic expression of a celebrity's worst nightmare.\n\nPerfect Blue plays some both astounding and discomforting visual tricks on the viewer's mind, dragging one deeper and deeper into the whole frightful intrigue. Although Perfect Blue goes too far and makes the whole storyline a bit overdone - slightly weakening the final effect - it still is a mesmerizing anime that might haunt with its strong attention to mind-boggling imagery and gruesome scenes of animated violence.",

Though it isn't anything too memorable, \"Perfect Blue\" is still a brisk, Hitchcock-ian experience that I was entertained by.  We're pulled into the life of Mima, a pop-idol who decides to take a different direction in life and become an actress (familiar, anyone?).  The change doesn't sit well with many fans, but after determination, she ends up getting an important role in a crime show, and eventually stars in a movie, that mirrors Jodie Foster's role in \"The Accused\".  After filming a brutal rape scene, suddenly Mima has visions of her former pop idol self, and after countless slashings of her colleagues, it seems as if she could be responsible.  \"Perfect Blue\" is sometimes a little much, with lots of bloody violence and uncomfortably risque scenes, but in the end, you feel rewarded.  The animation, ultra-stylized goes from sunny to dark within a matter of minutes, and the storyline is fast-paced and suspenseful.  We've seen many films like this one plenty of times, but they've never been animated, and certainly not this daring.  \"Perfect Blue\" is an oddball, but because it takes risks that most other anime films never take, I'd say it's worth a look.  Yet again, I'm going to stick with Hayao Miyazaki's work from now on.",

            "content": "If David Lynch, Dario Argento, and Alfred Hitchcock got together and directed a Japanese animated film, I imagine that 'Perfect Blue' would be the result. Based on Yoshikazu Takeuchi's novel by the same name, 'Perfect Blue' is a surreal and extremely stylized psychological thriller that takes plenty of cues from the Italian Giallo genre (if the use of 'Uchida's Theme' during the murder of a photographer doesn't recall Argento, then I don't know what does).  The film follows Mima, a pop idol who decides to quit singing, and take up acting instead. Shortly after her final concert, she is handed a pink, heart-sealed envelope from an adoring fan. She opens it, but its cryptic contents about a âlink to Mima's Roomâ? confuse her (her friend helps her later by realizing that it is a url to a website). Her agent lands her a small part in a crime-drama, but it soon expands in size and in content. Using the computer that her friend helped set up, Mima goes to the link found in the fan letter, and discovers a website that seems to contain the diaries of an identical twin living the life she used to live, but in parallel with her own. The line between reality and illusion starts to blur. I won't say anymore, but I will say that the viewers perception of what's real and what's not will begin to blur along with Mima's. 'Perfect Blue' was the directorial debut of the late Satoshi Kon ('Millenium Actress', 'Tokyo Godfathers', 'Paranoia Agent', 'Paprika'). It was originally supposed to be a live-action film, but thanks to an earthquake that damaged the production studios, their budget was reduced, and so they made it as an original video animation. It was also supposed to be a straight-to-video release, but the distributors saw a lot of potential with the finished product, and decided to release it theatrically instead. Since its debut in 1997 at the Fantasia Film Festival, it has become a cult classic. There has been some talk lately about the similarities between this film and Darren Aronofksy's 'Black Swan', which is in part due to the fact that he purchased the remake rights to 'Perfect Blue' so that he could recreate the bathtub sequence for 'Requiem for a Dream' (and to a smaller degree, it inspired a nasty scene near the end of 'Requiem'). The similarities are almost entirely incidental, but that still doesn't stop people from making a big to-do about it. In actuality though, it's just one big daisy chain of artistic influence (as both films equally owe their debts to Argento [who was inspired by both Alfred Hitchcock, and Mario Bava] and the giallo genre). Regardless of who borrowed from who, 'Perfect Blue' is not a film to be missed. Hopefully though, all of this talk will inspire people to take some time to expand their film vocabulary.",

In fact, the story of this film is oddly similar to that of Mulholland Drive, which was made four years after this film was. It's not the greatest anime film ever - the quality of the animation can be pretty shaky. But it definitely does have one of the most complex and mature stories you're likely to find in any animated film.\n\nThe story starts out simply enough, but gradually amps up the surrealism until you're not sure what's real and what's imagined any more. The movie begins with a young, minor pop singer changing her career track in an attempt to become an actress. This change appears to upset a stalker she has, who begins sending her creepy and threatening messages. She eventually begins to hallucinate visions of her former pop-singer self, or is she? Adding to the complexity is the film-within-the-film she's starring in, the story of which parallels and bounces off the actual story of Perfect Blue itself.\n\nIt all gets very confusing, and I'm not entirely sure I understood the entire plot. But I did understand the gist of it, and really enjoyed the feeling of uncertainty the film manages to evoke. The mix of Hitchcockian and Lynchian cinematic techniques the film uses to tell its story is effective, and the animation is mostly fluid and realistic (except for a few moments, mostly less important ones, where it falters). The movie is violent, sexual, and disturbing, so don't make the mistake of showing it to younger viewers. On a side note, the DVD has one of the cleverest, creepiest menu set-ups I've ever seen. It's a very good example of what animation for grown-ups can achieve.",

At times you forget that this is an animated film because of how well done this film is. Also at times the animation gives off a surreal feel which works to the movie's dark atmosphere.\n\nAnother thing to mention is the plot because it is so surreal and it takes the audience for a ride through so many twists and turns. Not to mention it begs the question of whats real and whats not in this film. Is Mima seeing things in her head or is sombody really out to get her. Think of it as Stanley Kuberick mixed with Alfred Hitchcock and you get this film.\n\nJunko Iwao does a great job voicing the main character Mima. She gives off an innocent feel in her voice and you really feel for her throughout the film.\n\nSatoshi Kon's direction is fantastic and manages to pull off a great psycological thriller. This film would later inspire Black Swan but like they always say \"The original is always the best and can never be topped.\" 4 1/2 of 5 stars. \n\nNote: Just because this film is animated doesnt mean that this is a children's or family movie.

Let's be honest, it'd be hard to improve upon Perfect Blue. I also think another director that was influenced by this was David Lynch, as evidenced in Mulholland Drive. There's a brilliant montage/dream sequence thing at the beginning of Perfect Blue that flashes from one point in time to another by cutting together Mima's head turning, much like Naomi Watts in the last half hour of Mulholland Drive. The story of this is really fucking cool and creepy, and constantly entertaining. Also weird. Really weird.

Although it may be over-the-top or silly at points, this is a memorable yet disturbing film which is definitely worth a watch for those interested in anime or psychological films.",

A soap opera role is offered but Mima's character is less clean cut than desired. Regardless, she agrees and events take a turn for the worse. She begins to feel reality slip, that her life is not her own. She discovers (imagines) her identical twin, a mirror image that hasn't given up singing. Internet sites appear describing every intimate detail of her life and a figure stalks her from the shadows. Her friends and associates are threatened (and killed) as Mima descends into a dangerous world of paranoid delusion. She fears for her life and must unravel fact from illusion in order to stay alive. Perfect Blue represents a major change from traditional anime subject matter, analysing the pop icon phenomenon, fame and its psychological impact on the performer.\nMy Review\njust weried.",

In Satoshi Kon's psychological horror film, the ideas of identity, acceptance, fame, recognition, and reality vs illusion are explored in a unique fashion, that may not answer the questions raised, however satisfy the need for an original animated film. \r\n\r\nThe story follows Mima who decides to quit her job as a pop singer and turn into an actress. Soon she realizes the transition is harder then she may have thought, she is asked to do a rape scene in the new episode of the hit TV show, Double Bind. Soon the plot starts, and we see how her mind deteriorating into a world of horror, guilt and blood. She finds a website called, Mima's Room, which seems to be posting the exact thoughts of her mind, the murder of the screenwriter, and a creepy illusion of herself, is what's making her world, a mental asylum. Now she must find who and what is setting her world upside down  \r\n\r\nRoger Corman quoted this movie as \"a movie made by Hitchcock and Disney\", and he is not wrong. On one hand we have a beautiful style of animation, filled with bright colors and serene visuals, and on other hand we have characters battling inner struggles and horrors of the outside world. One of the best part of this movie, is it' ability to go place, both psychologically and physically, to show us how we want to be recognized, the lengths we would go to in order to be famous, the two personalities we try to struggle and the motif of fame and happiness. \r\n\r\n9.7/10",

Or the bird with the Crystal Plumage how the \"killer\" tries to murder the witness by running him down with his car. It's all frighting stuff by what about this? As I stated it an animated Italian Giallo film how a famous singer is being stalked by a crazed fan. I myself am a big fan of \"Giallo films\" and Italian flicks in general not boring Asian cinema unleased the film interest me or I catch it on TV like a normal person. Now this is the kind of movie that I knew I was going to love I don't like anime that much but I just hate to view this.\r\n\r\nMima Kirigoe is an actress on  a long road to \"success\" she plays rape victim's and even works for a few dollars an hour but after a long time she hits her goal and becomes a hit with her music. But that's not the only thing she is being seeming stalked by a person in a rain coat who even tries to run her down in their car and they push one of her friends out a window, Her past is about to catch up to her as a private detective and her start to dig around and only find the guilt of her past and the ghost in her memory she tried to keep out.\r\n\r\nThe movie makes a lot of references to Dario Argneto's movies but overall I really liked the idea as Japanese's \"Giallo\" film.  So the references are obrevsly....\r\n*Like all Argento's movies Killers with black Gloves and in Rain coats. \r\n*Close up's of the killers hands.\r\n*A person remembering a memory and using it in the story. \r\n*Victims come crashing throw panes of glass.\r\n*The movie ends were the story starts.\r\nThe list can go on and on for any fan. So yes I loved the story okay.\r\n\r\nThe animation quality is just amazing you can see every amazing bit of detail object there in high quality. As well as the blood that \"splatters\" everywhere and on everything. And I really loved the trick with then camera to catch all the detail like in Dario's Suspira with the music simply just amazing.\r\n\r\nThe voice dubbing I am a bit mixed on but overall high stuff that everyone will love, never seen the English dub though. The characters are just your\" Dario Argneto\" people and there even muddled after some of his characters in his films. Our lead Female is model after Jessica from Suspira and her detective is after David Hemmings character in Deep Red.
