    "summary": "Based on the cartoon, this live-action comedy follows the adventures of Dudley Do-Right (Brendan Fraser), an enthusiastic, if somewhat dim, Canadian Mountie. When Dudley's childhood crush, Nell Fenwick (Sarah Jessica Parker), returns to their hometown in the mountains, he is eager to spend time with her, but his attempts at courting her are foiled by the villainous Snidely Whiplash (Alfred Molina), who is up to his usual schemes. Can Dudley win Nell's heart and curtail Snidely's wicked ways?",

            "content": "An odd choice for a live-action adaptation, Dudley Do-Right is clearly trying to recapture what worked in the George of the Jungle movie but, aside from a scene-stealing Alfred Molina and a cartoon preceding the movie that's much funnier, its humour trying too hard to appeal to both audiences, unfocused plot and the jokes falling flat most of the time - the very short runtime doesn't help - shows that not every cartoon that had 15 minutes of fame needs to turn their protagonists into real boys and girls (or alternatively, glorified cosplay)...Molina does give it some \"so bad, it's good\" entertainment value.",

Of course, it didn't help that Dudley Do-Right cartoons were invariably shorts, rather ones that beget complicated situations.\n\nThe cartoon had the premise of a strong and handsome but dense hero doing battle against the villain Snidely Whiplash, succeeding in the end when he finally uses his head. (One episode has him fooling Snidely into thinking some dynamite exploded when it didn't because he tricked him using a recording of an explosion-but Dudley had failed to defuse the real dynamite.) So what happens here? Snidely starts a fake gold rush, and Dudley eventually foils his plans. This could have been the basis of something good, but a confusing and unfunny story, ethnic stereotypes, and performers who don't correspond very well to their cartoon equivalents make this a bad movie. Even Dudley Do-Right completists should stay away.",

At no stage can you see the value on the screen, it looks like everybody loaded their pockets and phoned it in. The narration is utterly useless and uninspiring, why they kept this is beyond me. The whole idea of this film is crazy and you can see why this film failed. Who was the audience of this film? They don't appear to be aiming strictly at children but the humour is low brow, so immature that it's tough yo watch. They needed more pulp humour and a more focused director in charge, massive disappointment. 10-11-2017.",

The characters (save for Snidely Whiplash) are out of character, the plot is routine, the romance was cliche, and it wasn't sure it was trying to be a funny or serious movie when the cartoon was a parody of melodramas of the early 20th century. While it does have a few funny jokes like Snidely Whiplash convinces Dudley he was hunting for vampires as an excuse for shooting golden bullets in an abandon mine shaft to make money off of prospectors, most of the jokes and gags don't really work as most of it is either outdated slapstick, fart humor, and a reference to Pokemon (you hear right, a Pokemon reference).",

Dudley is a goofy, sincere, clumsy Mountie - fulfilling his childhood's destiny. \n\n He has a friend named Nell whom he comes to love even though she takes up with his enemy (formerly his childhood friend).  The evil friend succeeds in his schemes until Dudley is fired as a Mountie and forced to beat his foe at his own games (Dudley meets a man who mentors him - in the tradition of Karate Kid and similar films).  The Mounties come to his aid and the natives as they are attacked by the enemy and his gang.  Sarah Jessica Parker is surprising at times, even appealing, as Nell.  6/10",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser is a living cartoon character. In every film I've seen him in, he has zany characteristics and gives cheesy smiles at the camera. Even in \"The Mummy\", I feel like I'm watching an action-packed cartoon series. Universal tried to cash in on the success of Disney's \"George of the Jungle\" adaption with Brendan Fraser by putting him in a theatrical adaption of another Jay Ward (creator of \"George of the Jungle\") toon, \"Dudley Do-Right\".\r\n\r\nThe film felt like a quest to find a plot! The film is about a clumsy mountie named Dudley Do-Right (because he's always doing right!) who must stop his long time nemesis, Snidley Whiplash, from taking over Semi-Happy Valley. The rest is just a whole bunch of plot threads who were abused by hardly being developed.\r\n\r\nFraser is doing what he does best: acting weirdly. So I consider him to be the best actor in the film. Alfred Molina speaks in a annoying cartoonish voice. It worked sometimes at got out of hand for the remainder. Sarah Jessica Parker was acting terribly. She looked like the thought, \"I'm getting paid for this, right?\", ran through her head throughout her screen time. Supporting cast: LAME! Not even Eric Idle helped.\r\n\r\nThe humor is so flat! Eric Idle was not funny and so was Alfred Molina. Not even the \"Pokemon\" reference helped! When I did find something amusing, I replied with dry chcukles. I just wonder how much they paid the writer, Hugh Wilson. The other stupid thing was the opening credits. The titles, \"Written by Hugh Wilson\" and \"Directed by Hugh Wilson\", are seperate. Were they just too lazy to put \"Written for the screen and directed by Hugh Wilson\"? Laziness, people! Laziness! The film was even unsure of itself. It felt and anachronistic and bored of itself. The film was just lazy. It was flat, lazy, and supplied very little to children. Low on slapstick. What a shame. \"Dudley Do-Right\" is a do-wrong. The \"George of the Jungle\" movie was more butch and that live-action \"Flintstones\" movie had more dignity than this. Come on, Hollywood! Come on!",
