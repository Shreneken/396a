            "content": "This film has quite a laidback feel to it, with slow jazz type music playing in the background at times. Its an interesting, thoughtful perhaps watch. There are numerous sex references present, so unsurprisingly it isn't an ideal watch if your watching with your parents or similar but that's to be expected. It features a good cast (including Cecilia Roth and Penelope Cruz) and I liked the cinematography, showing the seedier sides of Barcelona. The plot intrigued me - its certainly a good bit of social commentary, Given the plot, it may have been, if only somewhat, controversial when it came out in the late 1990s and I respect that its a well liked and regarded films. As ever with Almodovar's films, bright colours plays a big part in this.\n\nI liked and respected that the women looked out for each other. I suppose it has the feel of a play about it - indeed a play is part of the storyline but the whole film could be a theatrical production, I feel. I thought it was at times poignant and also somewhat amusing, due to the sharp dialogue.\nI certainly enjoyed watching it, so yes, I'd recommend it.",

            "content": "Pedro Almodovar delivers, what he describes in his own words as, a screwball drama that features many uniquely captivating female characters in a film he dedicates to \"actresses who played actresses\".\n\nThe plot may prove too melodramatic for some but I am usually down for the big, loud, over the top plot devices and characters, especially when paired with such gorgeous cinematography and an eye dazzlingly stimulating color palette.\n\nCecilia Roth provides a solid foundation as most of the action and character introductions come about as a result of passing through her orbit. Penelope Cruz creates some impressively nuanced pathos in a role that became more interesting as the story progressed. It was Antonia San Juan however, who almost stole this show with her Algrado, as her performance offered the largest range, providing plenty of humorous banter interspersed between moments that felt far too genuine for a fictitious film plot.\n\nI had intended to dig into Almodovar's work much more quickly after Parallel Mothers, early this year, and Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown which I saw, and loved, shortly after. With yet another winner from him I know I will be actively seeking out more of his work in the future.\n\nOn a side note I got a kick out of the fact this was listed, as it is alphabetical, right behind All About Eve in the New York Times Book of Movies that I am currently working through. I would also recommend giving A Streetcar Named Desire a rewatch before this as that production is prominently featured in All About My Mother. 7.5/10\n\nNYT 1000 #277",

Deeply reverential of classic source material and using a Sirk film most prominently, Almod\u00f3var has no qualms about expressing his love for the melodramatic, but instead of leaning towards pulp he opts for a more humane interpretation that feels uplifting, particularly in the face of personal tragedy. Solid scriptwork and a constantly moving plot keep the audience attentive, and the color palette makes the visuals just as engrossing as the story. Not necessarily a film that speaks to my own experiences, but one that can be appreciated by many.  (3.5/5)",

Then, it seems to abandon what it set up and liberates itself, only to unveil, little by little, its rich and intricate tapestry of femininity and maternity. Through a growing web of female characters, All About My Mother celebrates female solidarity as we see each one shows right in time to rescue the other from the brink of collapse by creating emotional bonds between one another to fill in each other's gaps and get each others to complement their missing halves. Stupendous performances from all around, but I was struck, in particular, by Cecilia Roth's bravura performance as the lead character Manuela. The emotional range she shows is impressive and the entire movie she seems as if her eyes locked in tears, ready to fall anytime her son is brought up in any conversation. These scenes show how inextricably linked her complex feelings of haunting grief are, as she mourns Esteban's death and her being bereft of maternity at the same time. All About My Mother is also a panorama of vivid colours and moments of 'joie de vivre' that keep the film light on its feet while bolstering its tribute to actresses as well as its female spirit. Crazy how All About My Mother winds up giving perfect closure to the relationships between the characters and the themes it explores after getting carried away a bit too far now and then.",

The subject matter was excellent, the sympathetic treatment given to the trans characters was awesome and the allusions to All About Eve were appreciable. I did have some trouble with the subtitles, not because I wasn't paying attention but because HBO Max puts them in tiny un-adjustable font with a non-opaque background that made it nearly impossible to follow along when anything on the screen was white, like the hospital scenes & a few others.

            "content": "Pedro Almod\u00f3var's luscious, poignant, and humane film All About My Mother; sits as a vibrant ode to the classic women-led melodramatic films which flourished within the male-dominated period of Hollywood cinema. Though its connected nature works as a stylistic choice, the film still manages to \"wear it all on its sleeve.\" The female characters in All About My Mother not only have individual agency but also come together within a series of life-affirming circumstances like bonding, identity, loss, and grief -- all brought visually to life by Almod\u00f3var. His early filmography including Labyrinth of Passion (Almod\u00f3var, 1982), Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (Almod\u00f3var, 1988) and Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (Almod\u00f3var, 1990) tended to explore sexuality, drama, pop d\u00e9cor, and were all directed with a visually distinctive approach by their director. \n\nHowever, in comparison, Almod\u00f3var's most celebrated Oscar-winning feature acts as a mature steppingstone in his work. He approaches his subjects and themes previously with an almost comical sense of anarchy, which overall passes here for a reflective piece. The characters registered in Almod\u00f3var's unique mind are relatable, caring, flawed, powerful, but still delightfully quirky and real within the space of the film. The film begins with the central protagonist Manuela (Roth). She loses her son, Esteban (Azor\u00edn) in a tragic car accident after chasing down a taxi containing famed actress, Huma (Paredes) aiming to get her autograph after watching her in a stage play of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Subsequently, after the transplant of her son's heart, Manuela falls apart, leaving prostitution to find his estranged, trans father, Lola (Cant\u00f3). Along the way she reconnects with an old friend, another transgender prostitute named Agrado (Juan) and, Rosa (Cruz). Rosa, a Nun whose role is to shelter sex workers and has a crucial connection to Lola, and also to the actress Huma. Her story unfolds like that of a troubled friend to her co-star Nina (Pe\u00f1a) who has a dependency on heroin. \n\nAll the character strands that connect with Manuela work not only as a character drama but as a textual drama as well; the visual references to A Streetcar Named Desire, Manuela and Esteban sitting down to watch All About Eve (Mankiewicz, 1950) and its main story arc, evokes that heavily. Manuela relies on the kindness of friends and strangers, and they return this in turn too. Almod\u00f3var approaches the material with his emphatic and visceral directorial hand but allows these central characters to equally be funny and thought-provoking. It is primarily a caring film that actively refuses to pass judgement on these human frailties or view their consequences as cautionary tales but rather treats them with compassion. The character of Agrado, a transgender former truck driver-turned sex worker, is not solely defined here by her circumstances. Instead, Agrado sets out to deconstruct the prejudiced viewpoints of trans-identity, embracing the things which define her alone instead of by typically preconceived notions; a contemporary and daring feat of trans-positive identity representation by Almod\u00f3var.\n\nAlso, an actress that possesses comic chops that can rival that of the classic comedy stars like Gilda Radnor or Madeline Kahn. In a career-defining performance, Penelope Cruz's Rosa, who becomes HIV positive after a relationship with Manuela's former lover Lola \u2013 sees within Manuela, Agrado, and Huma, their humanity, and gains happiness in their respective companies.\nAlmod\u00f3var is showcased here as a director who has reached a peak of emotional heights. In a career that constructed film stories and featured subject matters which are tonally archaic, frank and button-pushing. All About My Mother wants its audience, to listen, to take in and to fully experience these characters occupying a space which feels authentic and true. It is a film that takes its time, relishes, and acknowledges its classic Hollywood genre label, but importantly, Almod\u00f3var has his particular voice to register. Within the movie works of Bette Davis, Huma considers her an inspiration; and it is Almod\u00f3var that clearly wishes not only to utilise and celebrate her wide and appreciated body of work but also, in turn, homage, pastiche and embrace it together via this role. \n\nAn emotional, heartfelt, and sumptuously designed piece of pure melodrama in the best sense. While we are all currently enduring a timely period of political divide and intolerance, the works of Spain's most appealing, enduring and above all graceful directors, was, and still is needed evermore. The film's closes with this line; \u2018To all actresses who have played actresses. To all women who can act. To men who act and become women. To all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother.' Let's celebrate that statement, eh?",

Combining All About Eve, A Streetcar Named Desire, and Spanish soap operas, Almod\u00f3var finds a happy medium of touching melodrama and silly humor to get you through the hard times. His direction is as colorful as his sets, costumes, and language. Jos\u00e9 Salcedo's editing is striking as he cuts from location to location with an effortless understanding of natural feeling narrative flow.\n\nEasing the audience through strange or unfamiliar subject matter is what Pedro Almod\u00f3var has a penchant for with his witty and nuanced script. Pedro allows audiences to sympathize with actresses, prostitutes, single mothers, and nuns all in one dreamy film. Pedro's writing is good natured and full of appreciation for women all over. Almod\u00f3var understands what pulls at the heart strings and tugs hard. I will always appreciate how Pedro tells his stories about women with a sympathetic lens. Almod\u00f3var's direction is gentle and compassionate with a smooth vibrant look. He delivers quiet sympathy for pregnant and grieving women alike.\n\nAffonso Beato's cinematography captures deep feelings and subtle emotion with each stylish shot. Everything is held close, whether his close-ups are of people or the mysterious world around them. All About My Mother remains a classic of Spanish cinema and a fervently feminist film.\n\nSpeaking of the female protagonists, All About My Mother contains a fantastic cast of talented actresses. Namely, Cecilia Roth as Manuela. Her agonized cries and gentle empathy make her a phenomenally moving lead actress. Similarly, the shy and graceful Pen\u00e9lope Cruz is outstanding as the pregnant nun Rosa. She stands out as an exceptional actress for performing a hurt woman with a longing for happiness. Cruz' eyes say it all. Marisa Paredes, Candela Pe\u00f1a, Antonia San Juan, and Rosa Maria Sard\u00e0 all act out compelling supporting actress roles.\n\nAntx\u00f3n G\u00f3mez' production design is wondrous with pops of red and orange everywhere, giving All About My Mother a warm tone. Bina Daigeler, Humberto Cornejo, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda De Coss\u00edo's costumes provide a serene warmth, especially with all their red jackets and crimson dresses for All About My Mother. Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez Lobo's make-up is striking with his unforgettable red lipstick choices for all the ladies in All About My Mother.\n\nAlberto Iglesias' score is sweeping and romantic, then suddenly mysterious and haunting with his subtle musical changes. His score ensures All About My Mother sounds fresh no matter when you watch it.\n\nIn all, All About My Mother is Pedro Almod\u00f3var setting a new standard for Spanish filmmakers forevermore.",

Almod\u00f3var breaks the barriers of the seventh art and combines the classics of the Spanish drama together with the theatrical ones in an exquisite and delightful story, in which it is more important how the story is told than what is narrated. A young man wanted to know everything about his mother, but he didn't live to achieve it. In fact, we know everything about her once he is dead. The cast is spectacular, especially Cecilia Roth and Marisa Paredes; Even the young Penelope Cruz understands her great acting potential despite her young age. \nThe narrative that is being used is excellent and very complex, and it is through the powerful images of the film how the emotions come to be so much exalted. Undoubtedly, this is a type of melodrama difficult to find a comparison, since this genre is difficult to consolidate. The issues that Almod\u00f3var handles are sexually under-exploited and delicate, and there are also subjects which can be very personally-felt and which are full of energy and color. The scenarios used are a reflection of the social context and they call for freedom of expression and feminism, that were completely oppressed during Franco's rule. The value of this film resides in what it transmits, being the subjects told from a very personal, critical and honest visions that allude to the love and to the humanity, being some sexual taboos seen like part of the normal thing. The cinematography has very beautiful nuances in which the director's dominance is emphasized on how he records, makes transitions, and the elaboration of the dialogues and script, expressing itself with an intense lyric and some very harmonic theatrical resources. A film that should be seen at least twice. 86//100",

            "content": "Being the film that finally won Pedro Almodovar an Academy Award, All About My Mother sounded like a prime chance to see the director in top form.\n\nPedro Almodovar has a very profound style about him as a director. He targets edgy subject matter with a very distinctive style of narrative, and this can encapsulate some viewers as easily as it isolates others. All About My Mother is no exception to this as it maintains a lot of existential themes in a narrative following predominantly female and trans characters. All these end up tied together in an endless series of melodrama without much of a developing story to create a sense of flow. And rhe 97 minute running time of All About My Mother shortens the extent of how much thematic exploration it can actually fit into the feature. Though there is a lot of intrigue at the heart of the plot dynamics, attempting to process them all when there is such a scattershot feeling about the narrative renders a rather meandering path. Pedro Almodovar is able to make it all seem natural with how he handles the drama itself, but the film largely feels like an anthology of sublots which break away from each other, characterized as a singular story only through the consistent presence of protagonist Manuela. Yet the film still has the power to touch viewers.\nAll About My Mother is very much a cry out for the troubles of women. The film features battered prostitutes, a pregnant woman with AIDS and a mother grieving for her son's death. Pedro Almodovar respects his characters and his viewers enough not to hold back with this material but rather to tackle it head on, and though there is a sense that he tries to fit a bit much into the story, it cannot be denied that there is some real power in the narrative. But a lot of the themes hardly feel explored. Though the film opens by touching upon the concept of organ transplants, these proves to just be a momentary dynamic that drives the protagonist somewhere else even though the script suggests at the beginning that it will do something more with it. This displays a flair for intelligent conversation within the dialogue which is certainly an element recognized over the course of the rest of the film, it just feels wasted. But admittedly, a film with such heavy ambition cannot reach the full extent of its narrative grasp and has to make exceptions. All in all it is easier to tolerate some of these faults since the greater plot points of All About My Mother transcend the lesser themes, and the pace of the film is consistent enough so that it keeps on moving forward towards some of the better moments in times where it drags on.\nVisually, Pedro Almodovar remains as much an artist as ever. The cinematography is very much positioned in a way of maintaining the illusion that viewers are watching a stage production, reflecting the film's depiction of the Spanish-language production of A Streetcar Named Desire. These shots last a long time and challenge the actors to speak for longer periods without the support of editing. There are many shots which happen up very close to depict every little detail of the actors' facial expressions and capture the full extent of their acting. But perhaps what is most notable is the several shots that display multiple images laid over each other with transparency, creating an interesting colour scheme and a momentary feeling of surrealism. The scenery of the film is similarly very nice due to the lush nature of the Barcelona countryside, finding natural beauty in it all.\nAnd to top it off, the cast in All About My Mother make a powerful effort to grasp the essence of Pedro Almodovar's characters.\nCecilia Roth leads the story as the titular mother Manuela. She project a friendly presence from her first moment on screen and shares a touching chemistry with Eloy Azorin to support this. Soon after, she is thrown into the pits of an intense story where she manages to illuminate the melodrama before following it up with a sentimentality to make it last. Constently, Cecilia Roth manages to maintain the internal emotional trauma of the part while sharing a spirited interaction with the rest of the characters. The balance is great, but her finest moments come from the sequences where she has to bring her trauma to the surface and discuss the fate of her son. She does this in a magnificent soliloquy of genuine heartbreak, never trying to reach into territory beyond what would be sensible within the story. Ceclilia Roth leads All About My Mother with dramatic grace and civility, making a beautiful effort to bring the material without faltering.\nComing from prior to her period of massive international success in the Hollywood market, Penelope Cruz delivers a gentle supporting performance in All About My Mother where the natural beauty and charm of the young actress become a staple of the character. With a true sense of vulnerability to her, Penelope Cruz projects a restrained dramatic passion where she captures the fears and confusions of her character without ever pushing beyond the insecurities of her character, captivating audiences with her genuine nature. Penelope Cruz contributes a brilliant performance in All About My Mother, and it's a clear signifier to the greater talents she would project in later years.\nAntonia San Juan also makes a strong effort where she captures the drama of her part without neglecting a witty edge. She adds some moments of deadpan comedy to the film to lighten the mood amid all the heavy melodrama, making a charming addition to the cast who shares a swift chemistry with Cecilia Roth.\n\nAll About My Mother displays Pedro Almodovar working with such great ambition that his intellectual reach sometimes exceeds the narrative grasp of the feature, but the brilliance of his screenplay is brought to life by his raw passion as a director and the skillful cast.",

It also takes the Spanish auteur away from his Castilian stomping ground and on to Barcelona, etching a tender gentle but never schmaltzy portrait of friendship along the way. There, Cecilia Roth's grieving mother connects with the father of her child, now a transvestite prostitute, and a richly-drawn array of actresses, hookers and the odd pregnant nun. As is traditional, Almodovar writes great female characters, hands them to some of Spain's best actresses and shoots them beautifully as they go. Sparkling, warm, witty, vibrant and bizarre, All About my Mother is a warped world of loss, mistakes, desperation and, conversely is a fitting celebration of moms everywhere.",

He never raises the question why a nun gets pregnant in the first place when she's supposed to live abstinent and why she has sex with a tranny.\n\nThese outcasts are presented to us as real people, with real personalities and never get judged for what they are - only for what they do. Considering that, that it's actual a regular film, set in a microcosmos, \"normal\" people mostly meet with awe, it's only half as strange as you'd expect.\n\nIt's a great film, Almod\u00f3var paints wonderful and lively characters and deals with a lot of themes which are tabooed by the main stream. He is obviously familiar with the subject matter and I wouldn't wonder if he actually knows people like the wonderful Agrado or Huma Rojo or Sister Rosa.\n\nMortality, faith, motherhood, love, gender.

I felt like with the two week transition, 3 week transition, and months transition you lost touch with the characters.

It just isn't as well edited or lacks that necessary pull. The acting is acceptable, except for my dislike of Roth attempting to cry. Antonia San Juan as Agrado easily has the best performance, who is a transsexual prostitute, and an old friend of Manuela. Even with its technical glitches, the story and its subplots lacking surprise, the director is still able to carry the movie on simple evocation of heartfelt emotions. Almod\u00f3var, while not being a great director is still an important one. \"Broken Embraces\" is his best film out of the three I've seen, \"Bad Education\" is in the middle, and consequently \"All about My Mother\" is last; a quality picture that has good intentions, yet doesn't live up to its potential.",

This ends in tragedy when he's hit by a car when he tries to get the autograph of the lady who plays Blanche, the famed Huma Rojo (Paredes). Deeply depressed by her loss, Manuela decides to travel to Barcelona to meet up with an old friend, transsexual prostitute Agrado (San Juan), and soon forms a new bond with pregnant nun Sister Rosa with AIDS (Cruz). But the overall reason for Manuela's travels is to tell her ex-husband, now a drag queen, Lola (Cant\u00f3) about the death-- but it turns out that the father of Rosa's child. Manuela has to comes to terms with her loss ... but there's even more trouble on the way. With all of its transvestites and a primarily female cast, \"Todo sobre mi madre\" sounds like some wacked-up comedy, considering director Pedro Almod\u00f3var has definitely made some crazy funny films in his time, but this is one of his most serious and melancholy films I've seen so far. Beautifully photographed and wonderfully written, the film remains a very difficult experience but with all of its colorful characters and it's strange one-liners the film smoothly keeps a good pace, and somehow stays entertaining. This was a film that just wowed me by the end, but I think if anything it was due to the spectacular performance by Cecilia Roth. There's never a scene where you can take your eyes off of her, and is so convincing that I could feel all of her pain. There's been so many foreign actors nominated for Best Act___ but she surely should have been one of them. And the young (at 25) Pen\u00e9lope Cruz is excellent as well, it makes it very weird to think that she would have been considered a horrible actress in America in the early 2000's. \"Todo sobre mi madre\" is so far my favorite Almod\u00f3var, and will be yours too for sure. Definitely worthy of all of its Best Foreign Language Film wins. Highly recommended.",

Although it's Almodovar's witty screenplay that is the film's beating heart, it's the sheer talent of its cast that has fueled it with pure and unbridled energy. \n\nPerformances by Cecilia Roth, who played the main character Manuela, a single-parent hardened by the terrible highs and lows of life, Marisa Paredes as the stage actress Huma Rojo, Penelope Cruz who contrasts all the other performances with her subdued turn as Sister Rosa, and especially Antonia San Juan's colorful portrayal of the character Agrado (the best performance in the film), a person whose socially unacceptable transsexualism never hindered her from being an optimistic representation of a hard-living modern woman, sweeten the screen with a unique vigor for life. \n\nThe film's title, \"All About My Mother\", when you look at how the narrative has unveiled itself, does not fully suggest that the film is indeed purely about Manuela's individual exploits as she searches on to locate her son's father and as she takes care of numerous colorful characters. With the use of the possessive pronoun 'My', which of course pertains to Manuela's son Esteban, who before dying in a tragic car accident wishes to know who his father is and who, after death, may have continued to look down upon her mother as she copes up with his death, with her quest and with life itself, it suggests that the story is spiritually progressing through Esteban's birthright to know his father. So the film, in essence, does not merely get its life force from Manuela alone, but also from the memory of Esteban's final wish. \n\n\"All About My Mother\" is, in context, a humanist adventure fueled by a two-sided notion for a tribute: One given by the already omniscient Esteban in an underlying manner, who flowers up her mother's endeavors by means of his prose taken from his diary, and one by Manuela herself as she tries to keep the fire burning in Esteban's torch of memory by way of fulfilling his dying wish: To find his father.\n\nUnlike the later \"Goodbye, Lenin!\", a film from which we rarely see the character of the mother but infinitely more of her son as he desperately find ways to fend off any shock or surprises that may worsen her health, \"All About My Mother\" views this idea of  a parent-child relationship in an opposite way by championing the concept of a mother's love to her son (instead of the other way around), but in an equally unconditional light. \n\nIn the film's entirety, its urgency is more inclined towards the dramatic rather than the comic. Of course, the spontaneity of the more humorous moments adds to the film's effective tonal shifts from colorful to gray and vice versa, but \"All About My Mother\" is infinitely more important to be absorbed as a drama that articulates the emotional context of promises, mistakes and reconciliations rather than as a comedy of blunders, innuendos and homosexuality. Nonetheless, the film works in either way.\n\nBut what has slightly put me off about the film, on the other hand, is its running time. Pedro Almodovar greeted our senses with exuberant, highly original characters yet ends the film with suddenness. It's one thing for a film to end and for us to want more, but to ask for more plainly because something lacks is another. I don't know what I've felt between the two when the film has ended, but I surely would have loved the film more if it would have been a bit longer, and I don't care if the conflict is already resolved. Well, on second thought, maybe it's just delusion.",

The film deals with complex issues such as AIDS, transvestitism, faith, and existentialism.\nThe plot originates in Almod\u00f3var's earlier film The Flower of My Secret which shows student doctors being trained in how to persuade grieving relatives to allow organs to be used for transplant, focusing on the mother of a teenager killed in a road accident.I was expecting so much of this movie,first of all, because the positive critics and the prizes won, second because i love Almod\u00f3var films, but finally it turns into a deception, cause the plot is so hard and difficult.Despite the great direction, it's a hollow and depressing movie.",

In directing this well-written and wonderfully designed film, Pedro Almodovar implements a defined sense of charisma and powerful emotional overtones in which femininity is not only allowed to excel but at the same time challenged and touched upon in its many different forms no matter how exotic, controversial, or pedestrian (mothers, girlfriends, prostitutes, transvestites alike). What begins as a potential comedy with zany humor and outrageous characters quickly takes a dramatic turn into a touching and heartfelt story of Manuela, a woman searching for consolation from the death of her only son as well as her past - Cecilia Roth is stirringly affectionate as the main role as she leads a strong cast that includes a moving but understated turn by a younger Penelope Cruz.

But the performances, setting, and the direction doesn't take you anywhere that you've seen before unless you're into it. Basically, there's no strong lead man character in this film, all in all are women and some are men but did changed sex. This film is also tearjerker most of the time and funny that you almost forget what these characters go into. \nAs Almodovar says at the end of this picture, this film is dedicated to all women who wants to be women, and men who wants to be women, probably Almodovar meant that being a mother or a woman is always not that easy or something you can count on. Out of all the themes that comes in this movie like transvestitism, existentialism, and faith, still it doesn't forget where the characters are going into until the very end, and again, a very sad and yet a very satisfying ending to this wonderful piece of cinema.
