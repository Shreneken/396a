    "summary": "A retired farmer and widower in his 70s, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) learns one day that his distant brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke and may not recover. Alvin is determined to make things right with Lyle while he still can, but his brother lives in Wisconsin, while Alvin is stuck in Iowa with no car and no driver's license. Then he hits on the idea of making the trip on his old lawnmower, thus beginning a picturesque and at times deeply spiritual odyssey.",

Lynch was struggling for content, this movie consists of a couple short interactions with people Alvin met along the way that break up the monotonous, drawn-out scenes of a man riding a lawnmower past farm land.  The tragic story of his daughter and his war stories felt very out of place in what could have been an uplifting movie.",

Older actors can bring something to the screen that is unique and personal and it is quite amazing just how much mileage is got from a story that is in itself simple and quirky. If you think that following an old guy on a 260-mile journey on a 1960s lawnmower is doomed to failure then think again. The film is awash with the midwest countryside and people, it seems to enter into the fabric of the places and locations. And of course, if you, like me, adore Sissy Spacek then you will love the film for the right reasons, Sissy doesn't act Hollywood, she makes real dramas; dramas as real as the story behind the film and the man behind the legend.",

            "content": "I think the idea of David Lynch making a G-rated Disney movie is its own brand of surrealism in and of itself. The fact that he didn't write the script for this film might have something to do with that. The aptly named Straight Story delivers exactly what you'd expect from its premise. There's no plot twists or big action sequences to make Alvin Straight's journey more cinematically pleasing. It's just a road trip with a lawnmower to go see his brother. And yet, there's something about it that makes it feel like...something deeper. Maybe it's the ending. Though the stunning cinematography, Angelo Badalamenti's score and scenes where Richard Farnsworth engages in conversations with other people such as a pregnant teenage runaway do keep things interesting. It would probably keep children, the primary target audience for Disney movies, bored. Like, even if you're unaware of David Lynch's style, the fact that such a fairly simple, slow-paced film that delivers exactly what its title promises has the Disney branding is rather weird. The Straight Story is a simple yet beautiful little film that can, at the very least, take comfort in the fact that it's the only David Lynch film that iconic film critic Roger Ebert actually liked.",

I don't think I can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely, but I'll do my best. The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I laughed out loud at least twice in the first twenty minutes and was soaking up every one of the exchanges between these colorful characters. I wasn't too sure about Spacek's character but when more of her background was filled in it was easier to understand certain aspects of her performance that I had previously found no purpose in.\n\nThe Badalamenti score also added even more value to this film than usual and he felt completely in sync with the mood and tone of the film that at times it could seem like the cinematic scenes were written after the accompanying score.\n\nI had always been told this film was nothing like David Lynch's other work and being a Disney film, found that easy to believe. I guess the mistake I made was always taking this as a criticism, when I now know it clearly wasn't.

            "content": "(a \"nothing straight about this story\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nIf someone had told me director David Lynch was going to direct a \"sweet\" film rated G and Walt Disney was going to produce it, I would have said they were crazy. This is the same David Lynch who gave us BLUE VELVET and the TV series TWIN PEAKS and other films that one can easily label as disturbing and unrelentingly violent. But if we play the director's tape through, this is also the same David Lynch who gave us THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) which was a film deeply moving about the life of John Merrick, a man with a disturbing outward appearance but the heart and soul of a kind poet. So, no crazy here that director Lynch would give us THE STRAIGHT STORY about Alvin Straight, a heart and soul of a kind poet, also a film deeply moving and deeply transitory, as most of our personal and spiritual journeys are.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is a biographical film of the real Alvin Straight who traveled from Iowa to Wisconsin on a lawn mower to see his ailing brother. I was talking with a friend about this film, and he told me it's not legal to drive a lawn mower on the road. I told him, \"I don't know about that. All I know is Alvin Straight did and we are all the better that he did.\" Alvin Straight is played by actor Richard Farnsworth who gives a heartfelt and deeply tender and exquisite performance. Sissy Spacek plays his daughter, Rose, and she is also brilliant. What is David Lynch's claim to unique and original fame is that he takes stories right out of the colors of a Normal Rockwell painting and turns his stories into dark and brooding shades of what lies underneath these idyllic \"family paintings.\" But as dark and brooding as Lynch explores in his stories, he also finds the humanity of that deep yearning for connection and transformation. It's like Lynch in his stories is telling us something I believe wholeheartedly: You have to explore the dark and brooding to find the light and freedom to humanly connect. This puts David Lynch in a class of his own.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is not at all \"straight,\" for Alvin has complications with his lawn mower along the way to see his brother, but it's more the complications of the people Alvin meet that make his journey \"nothing straight about this story.\" Alvin meets a pregnant runaway who is in the throes of shame and regret from feeling ostracized from her family. Alvin tells her a \"nothing straight about this story\" game that he used to play with his kids. He would give each kid a stick and tell them to break it, which they could easily do. Then, he would give the kids a bunch of sticks bundled together and tell them to break them, which they could not easily do at all. Alvin would tell his kids, \"that's family.\" The runaway must have been transformed by that because when Alvin wakes up in the morning after this discussion with her, she is gone, leaving behind only a bunch of sticks bundled together. And then there's the \"nothing straight about this story\" Alvin has with a fellow war veteran. They share their pain, regret, grief and guilt over killing men in their tour of duty. Both men weep during their shares, and we weep right along with them because their pain, regret, grief and guilt are ours, whether in the trenches or not. And I will not give away the ending to THE STRAIGHT STORY, but I will give away the \"nothing straight about this story\" journey of Alvin Straight being a deeply fulfilling one and, yes, transitory. It's an ending that is about two brothers who bury the hatchet to be those bunch of sticks bundled together that cannot, no, not EVER be broken.\n\nIn someone's hands other than director David Lynch, THE STRAIGHT STORY might have been ridiculous and even ludicrous, but Lynch is a director who understands what happens when \"nothing straight about this story\" is actually a journey to salvation. Lynch is in no way, shape, or form a \"Christian\" director, but he is a director who understands Christian values, i.e., an inner journey that while on the outside might look ugly is actually beautiful on the inside because of the transformation and salvation of one's spirit. Lynch is a \"anti-Pharisaical\" director; he has ZERO desire to direct on the surface but rather directs for the inner landscape of one's journey to familial connection and the necessary (and desperate) need to communicate. Yes, Jesus Christ would have VERY much liked David Lynch's films, I think.\n\nThere is something about the phrasing of \"another stranger\" that appeals to me and I think is applicable to THE STRAIGHT STORY. I hear this phrasing just about every day when I listen to Lady Gaga's song, \"I'll Never Love Again,\" from the film, A STAR IS BORN (2018). And I'm reminded of the Bible Verse, \"Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it\" (Hebrews 13:2). Alvin Straight in THE STRAIGHT STORY meets \"another stranger\" after another on his lawn mower, and I think our own journeys are about meeting \"another stranger\" after another. It's precisely these \"strangers\" who are our angels on our journeys. They are, in fact, NOT \"strangers\" at all if we show them hospitality. With this, they become necessary, what I would call essentials, to our own transformative journeys.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is David Lynch's most accessible film, tender and hopeful. It is Richard Farnsworth giving a haunting and satisfying (BOTH) performance as Alvin Straight. And it is a \"nothing straight about this story\" film that informs us all we are on this same kind of journey as Alvin Straight, and we are all poised to heal tremendously from \"another stranger\" journey, whether we take that journey on foot or on a lawn mower.",

It is the kind of movie that you’d think I would find boring, because it roams around at the pace of a lawn mower driving down the road. Yet it seems to relish in the simplicity of this man’s life and the determination in his journey. Along the way he impacts many people and reminds them of the simpler things that life can bring. I found Richard Farnsworth to be so charming, and had a number of good laughs at how he handled the difficulties of what he was doing. The end of the film could feel so mundane, but because of what we learn about our main character along the way, I found it deeply emotional. It’s an unexpected movie that sneaks up on you with subtle humor, and emotions. One thing that David Lynch knows how to do better than any other director is finding quirky actors who create a quaint atmosphere. The Straight Story feels like it is actually filmed in a tiny town right in the middle of Iowa. The people we meet along the way also have a unique quality that make them stand out. Ironically, the most recognizable actor in the entire film is the one I found the most underwhelming. It's not that Sissy Spacek is bad in the film, but her stutter always felt forced and over-rehearsed. It never came across as natural. Aside from that, there was very little that I disliked about The Straight Story.

That's why I am to state The Straight Story is my favourite movie of Lynch with this simple and touching story of an old man departing for his probably last journey in the life. This journey is not just an attempt to see his brother and reunite with him. This is also Straight's last life statement and challenge. He knows the life won't last and he decides to make a road-trip on a lawn-mower since he doesn't have driving license anymore. Lynch's movie is a rare example of his work based on the adapted screenplay. However, the way he pictures this journey is perfect. Alvin Straight possesses of tons of experiences, but he knows there is no way to utilize it anymore. It's a philosophical and beautiful picture of an old man whose life energy is waning, though his eyes are still young. I really love Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, but I would call The Straight Story my favourite movie Lynch. Twin Peaks doesn't count!",

In 1993, Alvin Straight, then 73 years old but with failing eyes and legs, drove his riding mower 300 miles to visit his estranged brother who just had a stroke (cameo by Harry Dean Stanton). Maybe Lynch saw surrealism in the story or maybe his innate conservatism (championing family values) drew him to the material.  If you look carefully, you can see his style of filmmaking in the way that the camera simply observes everyone in a matter-of-fact style and the dialogue (which he didn't script himself) is the same sort of non-ironic plain-speaking you get from characters in his other projects.  However, this is G-rated heart-warming material released by Disney, not a vision of the dark forces intruding on all things wholesome (although in the very beginning when we hear an ominous thud and the camera zooms up to a shuttered window, I wasn't quite sure).  Only rarely do things turn a bit weird, almost as if Lynch felt it was obligatory. But these moments distract from the main story which is really about Straight (played touchingly by Richard Farnsworth, who died soon after at age 80) and his interactions with other people, including his autistic daughter, Rose (played by Sissy Spacek), and the unbelievably kind Midwesterners he meets along the way.",

            "content": "Walt Disney and David Lynch are two names that you wouldn't ordinarily expect to see involved on the same project. Disney is, of course, the leading production brand for family entertainment and Lynch's work couldn't be further from that magical and innocent material. However, that's exactly what we're looking at with The Straight Story which is a complete change of direction from the usually dark and disturbing Lynch and he proves to his naysayers that he's entirely able to construct something of a different nature altogether. \n\nPlot: After hearing that his estranged, older brother has taken seriously ill, 73-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) decides that he's going to put aside their differences and visit him before it's too late. Unable to drive a car or take public transport, Alvin buys himself a ride-on lawnmower and begins his long journey over hundreds of miles in the most unconventional way. \n\nNot just in terms of the main characters' namesake, The Straight Story is exactly what it sounds like; a straight and simply told tale that's, without doubt, the most accessible film on Lynch's resumé. Those with a sound knowledge of Lynch will notice that the characters have no nefarious purposes, there's no metamorphosis, dream logic or hidden metaphors. This is an emotional and heartfelt odyssey about self-reflection, regrets and family connections and there's nothing to suggest that Lynch isn't absolutely at ease with lighter material. His film is a beautiful and poignant road trip that's full of pathos and stunningly captured landscapes.\n\nDespite the simplicity, Lynch still can't contain his propensity for oddball characters and slightly off-key tones but it entirely works for this material. What's most strange about this story, though, is not as a result of Lynch's involvement but because it's actually based on a remarkable true story. The one thing that will draw reminders to Lynch's usual work is his love for small town America and the odd inhabitants therein. Although he keeps himself on a leash, he is still able to capture the idiosyncrasies and mannerisms of ordinary people which still adds a (albeit lesser) surrealistic flavour to the film.\n\nLynch is aided considerably with regular collaborators as well; Freddie Jones' sublime cinematography captures some stunning images and Angelo Badalamenti's beautiful score compliments the proceedings. \nAt the heart of the film, however, is a commanding and heartfelt central performance from Richard Farnsworth. Rightly Oscar nominated for his superb work, Farnsworth is the beating heart of this story - a man that has come to terms with himself and the mistakes he's made in life but still has enough left in his twilight years to right some wrongs. Sadly, Farnsworth's outstanding performance is tinged with poignancy and sadness itself as the actor died with a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head, shortly after the film's release. Apparently, he himself, was nearing the end of his life with bone cancer and took the decision to go out on his own terms - much like the character of Alvin Straight.\n\nA wonderful and measured piece of storytelling from David Lynch. For those that can't handle his darker and more twisted films, then this is one for you. There's no denying it's charm and it's introspective reflection of life and all the challenges that come with it. This really is a pleasant, yet bittersweet journey.  \n\nMark Walker",

            "content": "David Lynch's most deviating film of his regular type of movie making is called ''The Straight Story'' and wow what a moving, gorgeous, extraordinary, emotional, American odyssey this one is. Because the film was directed by David Lynch, who usually deals in the bizarre, we keep waiting for the other shoe to drop--for Alvin's odyssey to intersect with the Twilight Zone. But it never does.\n''The Straight Story'' is astonishing in how simplistic, yet deep it is. Everything about Farnsworth's performance is brilliantly simple, just an old american trying to visit his brother before it's too late, and because he's not allowed to drive, he decides to drive cross country on a lawn-mower with a max speed of 5 miles an hour. This seems like a melodramatic plot to a cheesy movie, but keep in mind, this is based on a true story, and it handles the material perfectly.\nFollowing that notion is how simple but incredibly heartfelt the screenplay is, with simple characters saying things like: ''What is the number for 9-1-1?!'' or ''What do you need that grabber for Alvie?, Alvie answers: Grabbing'. '' but this screenplay also includes some philosophical, deep and meaningful dialogue like when Alvie tells a story to another war veteran about the war, or a little game he used to play with his children (i dont want to spoil anything, but you'll know what i mean when you'll watch it) and there are many more scenes like that.\n''The Straight Story'' is a straight-forward movie that's simple and easy to follow, unlike previous Lynch movies, but Lynch does make this story his own by using imagery and metaphors while shooting this movie. For example the people Alvin talks to, the first he talks to is a young runaway and he tells a story about how many kids he's had and how many grandkids, then he talks to a bunch of adolescents, then to an old war veteran in a bar, then to a pastor in a cemetery, all before his journey ends and visits his brother Lyle. Also the landscapes he drives through start of by being green, full of life, and sunny. But slowly digress into darker imagery, a girl hitting a deer before his eyes, him almost crashing down a hill because of the weakness of his lawnmower, and talking to a pastor on a cemetery. (You see/get the idea right) But the plot is so simple, yet so brilliant and dualistic, the clues in this film...as to why Alvin Straight is REALLY going to see on his brother on his tractor, are delivered with a degree of subtle high-art that even most reviewers of this film missed, but to give a hint... Runaway Girl (aka Dorothy from Oz invoking \"no place like home\" to start the journey) = Human Birth \nDeer-strike Lady = Human Ambition (with the leering deer symbolizing that which is lost in its wake) \nTractor Brakes/House On Fire= Lynch's explanation of what REALLY happened...pay VERY close attention to that scene. \nThe Handymen Dialogue= Human Honesty (as a result of the above) \nBartender Scene= Human Accomplishment \nGraveyard Scene= Impending Mortality \nDead Engine Short Of Destination= Deserved Punishment (notice how Alvin accepts this knowing he has earned this fate) and finally, I feel the greatest moment in the Lynch film... \nOld Man On Tractor= God Camera Pans Away= Dignity Of Private Confession Immaculate Repair= Sins Forgiven\n\nThe Straight Story is a G-Rated masterpiece.\n\n(Tip: before viewing, bring a box of tissues because, man, this film will tear you up. Multiple times. e.g The ending with his brother... yes... the bar scene with the two aged characters talking about the war... yes... Rosie's story of losing her kids... yes... Really, anytime Straight talked about his life or extended his thanks for someone's courtesy... yes, it had me crying)\n\nAll in all ''The Straight Story'' is an absolutely beautiful film, and a hidden gem in Lynch's filmography overshadowed by his magnum opus'.\n''The Straight Story'' is anoverlooked and forgotten masterpiece.",

Pacing wise, the film, like Alvin, takes its time getting there. I loved the montages of flowing fields and life in the country. These interludes take on a feeling of a trance between Alvin's strange encounters, accompanied of course by Angelo Badalamenti's score. And this has to be Badalamenti's best work as a composer. The music here is nothing short of breathtaking. It is emotional and haunting, beautiful and subtle. There were a few nights after seeing the film that I would fall asleep listening to the soundtrack. It's just so peaceful. Finally, I was absolutely slayed by the ending. So simple and subtle, its perfect. Just in awe of Lynch's big beautiful artistic heart which is on complete display.",

Richard Farnsworth, un an tout juste avant qu'il ne se fasse lui-même exploser la cervelle après qu'on ne lui ait annoncé qu'il mourra inévitablement d'un cancer terminal fatal, livre l'une des performances les plus touchantes qu'il m'ait été donné de voir, à un point tel que le suicide de l'acteur m'a presque fait verser une larme.\n\nDavid Lynch m'épate franchement tandis que je m'aperçois qu'il a appris à varier ses styles de film et à nous offrir différents voyages cinématographiques qui en valent toujours amplement la chandelle.\n\nStraight Story, à mon avis, parvient même à dépasser de peu The Elephant man.

Titles like Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire have toyed with our minds and coerced us into a new skewed way of watching movies.

It tells the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man who learns that his estranged brother has suffered a stroke. With a life of regret Alvin makes his mind up to make amends with his brother. His legs and eyes have failed him and he isn't permitted to drive a car and so he cranks up his ride-on lawn mower and rides 240 miles to his brother's door step. This is a really (REALLY) beautiful film. It's a welcome G rated Disney movie from Lynch that's wholesome, life affirming and heart warming. Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin and this would be his final film before he died. He was nominated for best actor at the Oscars and he should have won it. If you have never seen A Straight Story then you should... if you love Lynch then this will be unlike anything you've seen from him before. As with other film's he's released onto dvd, the cheeky bugger has removed all chapters so that viewers cannot skip scenes. He wants us to respect the story, respect his work... and fully give ourselves over to Alvin's amazing story.",

It is strange because it's, well, normal and linear. The Straight Story is, easily, the sweetest and most heartfelt David Lynch movie ever. The highlight is, without a doubt, Richard Farnsworth's powerful and touching performance. This is accented by the memorable characters he meets along the way and the gorgeous imagery Lynch provides throughout. Based on a true story, The Straight Story follows the story of Alvin Straight, a no-nonsense good ol' boy who is losing his eyesight and the use of his knees, and his journey across Iowa and Wisconsin to see his brother and make amends before it is too late. Without being able to drive a car, and too proud to accept help or take a bus, he opts for rigging up his old John Deere lawnmower with a trailer and riding that to see his estranged brother. Along the way, he meets several people on the road and has an impact on all their lives. The driving force behind the movie is Richard Farnsworth's deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. He is as sweet as he is proud and his performance really struck a personal chord with me. He actually seems like a close relative or the sweet old man down the street. While Farnsworth takes the lead, the supporting characters really move the film along. Sissy Spacek is a real sweetheart as Alvin's mentally handicapped daughter. There are also several other characters he meets along the way, a girl who ran away from home because she is pregnant, the man who helps him fix his lawnmower, and, of course, \"the blink and you might miss him\" Harry Dean Stanton as Alvin's brother. Lynch also put together some gorgeous shots to accompany the storyline. Periodically, he incorporates shots of the night sky which invokes a dream-like quality to the story, which matches perfectly with Lynch's motif. Shots of the scenery loom with an omnipresence over the entire film and really put you in the Midwest during the autumn season. It is weird that Lynch directed a movie so straight-forward, linear, and sweet. Very un-Lynchian. Lynch, himself, said that he \"fell in love with the emotion of the script.\" And emotional it is. It is a very heart-warming and sweet tale from an unlikely source (a collaboration between David Lynch and Walt Disney? Seriously?). It is very lovely film and a beautiful story with great acting, a wonderful supporting cast, and gorgeous imagery.",

It is one of the most unexpected movies ever - a G-rated, inspirational, Disney-produced movie directed by David Lynch. Seems impossible, right? But it totally works.\n\nBased on a true story, the movie follows a handicapped, 73-year-old farmer named Alvin Straight (an Oscar-nominated Richard Farnsworth) who hears that his brother has had a stroke, and decides to drive 240 miles on his tiny lawnmower to visit him. It's inherently emotional material, with an inherent risk of sentimentality, but fortunately the movie avoids that. He meets some people along the way who help him, and we also get to see his relationship with his slightly mentally-challenged daughter (Sissy Spacek).\n\nThe movie is warm, down-to-earth, and straightforward, as the title suggests. Farnsworth is fantastic as the stubborn and proud old man; apparently he was actually physically suffering from cancer and paralysis, disabling him in much the same way his character is disabled. The performance feels incredibly genuine and well-earned. Sissy Spacek, though she mostly just appears in the earlier scenes, is also extremely good as the daughter. You know how Robert Downey, Jr. said in Tropic Thunder, \"You never go full retard\"? Well, Spacek's performance as a mentally challenged woman here is beautifully balanced; she goes just retard enough to suggest the character's difficulties without overplaying it and still making us understand that she is quite capable in her own way. Other supporting performances come in and last for a scene or two, but they're all just what the movie needs.\n\nIt's funny how this movie is both nothing like Lynch's other work, and at the same time totally characteristic of Lynch. Here's how it's not like other Lynch movies: there's no violence, no sex, no hideous creatures, no people turning into other people, no arcane symbols or images, and the narrative is utterly clear. Here's how it is like other Lynch movies: you know that curiously sincere pastoral feeling you get from the early scenes of Blue Velvet, or the opening credits sequence of Twin Peaks? Imagine that sort of note played with complete sincerity for an entire movie. There are a couple of moments of seemingly typical Lynch weirdness - such as the woman who keeps running into deer in her car, or the woman on the lawn chair in the opening sequence - but even they don't feel out of place or unrealistic. The movie is visually beautiful, with lots of shots of cornfields and such, and clear cinematography; I can't think of another movie that captures the sense of being outside on a sunny day better. It is also helped out greatly by a pastoral musical score by Lynch's usual collaborator Angelo Badalamenti, which, for my money, is his best score. This material really brought out much of what is best in David Lynch, and I wish he would try his hand at similar things again in the future.",

In a career-defining role, Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a man who rode from Iowa to Wisconsin on a tractor to see his brother once more before both of their lives came to a close. The thing that makes Lynch's technique so perfect fort he story is that he isn't concerned with making big moments. Thanks to Farnsworth's performance, we immediately sympathize with him and, consequently, nothing in the movie is as important to us as he is. For instance, there is a scene in which a fast-traveling car swerves around Straight's slow tractor; a few seconds later, we hear the squeal of tires and the violence of a collision, but Lynch's camera remains on Farnsworth's face. In this moment, his safety is our first concern. We witness this and other things through the lens of Straight's experience vision and life seems a lot softer. Sissy Spacek is also quite good as Straight's daughter, a mature person with her own pains and fears, the one element of Straight's life that he cannot seem to face fully though it is the one closest to him. She represents both his strengths and weaknesses, and we cannot help but wonder from time to time if he is running to his brother or away from his daughter; is he nostalgic for the childhood of his past or afraid of a future without him in it? As an acute study of the preciousness of human life, as well as a stunning portrait of the midwest, this film is almost flawless.",

            "content": "This is probably the strangest, weirdest David Lynch movie. âSean, David Lynch movies are weird and strange. How can this be weirder?â? you might be asking. It is strange because itâ(TM)s, well, normal and linear. The Straight Story is, easily, the sweetest and most heartfelt David Lynch movie ever. The highlight is, without a doubt, Richard Farnsworthâ(TM)s powerful and touching performance. This is accented by the memorable characters he meets along the way and the gorgeous imagery Lynch provides throughout.\n\nBased on a true story, The Straight Story follows the story of Alvin Straight, a no-nonsense good olâ(TM) boy who is losing his eyesight and the use of his knees, and his journey across Iowa and Wisconsin to see his brother and make amends before it is too late. Without being able to drive a car, and too proud to accept help or take a bus, he opts for rigging up his old John Deere lawnmower with a trailer and riding that to see his estranged brother. Along the way, he meets several people on the road and has an impact on all their lives.\n\nThe driving force behind the movie is Richard Farnsworthâ(TM)s deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. He is as sweet as he is proud and his performance really struck a personal chord with me. He actually seems like a close relative or the sweet old man down the street. While Farnsworth takes the lead, the supporting characters really move the film along. Sissy Spacek is a real sweetheart as Alvinâ(TM)s mentally handicapped daughter. There are also several other characters he meets along the way, a girl who ran away from home because she is pregnant, the man who helps him fix his lawnmower, and, of course, âthe blink and you might miss himâ? Harry Dean Stanton as Alvinâ(TM)s brother.\n\nLynch also put together some gorgeous shots to accompany the storyline. Periodically, he incorporates shots of the night sky which invokes a dream-like quality to the story, which matches perfectly with Lynchâ(TM)s motif. Shots of the scenery loom with an omnipresence over the entire film and really put you in the Midwest during the autumn season.\n\nIt is weird that Lynch directed a movie so straight-forward, linear, and sweet. Very un-Lynchian. Lynch, himself, said that he âfell in love with the emotion of the script.â? And emotional it is. It is a very heart-warming and sweet tale from an unlikely source (a collaboration between David Lynch and Walt Disney? Seriously?). It is very lovely film and a beautiful story with great acting, a wonderful supporting cast, and gorgeous imagery.",

            "content": "Based on a true story, The Straight Story is about an elderly man's journey to reconcile with his brother. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a widower in his 70's living with in Laurens, Iowa with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), who has a speech deficiency. Despite suffering from a bad hip and emphysema, Alvin does not trust doctors. One day the phone rings and learns that his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke and may not live long. He and his brother haven't spoken to each other in ten years, which Alvin says is mainly due to having pride mixed with alcohol; but Alvin wants to make amends with his brother before it's too late. Lyle, however, lives in Wisconsin, Alvin has little money, bad eye sight, no car, and no driver's license so he decides to hop on his lawn mower attached to a trailer and travel all the way to Wisconsin, hoping he'll make it in time to see his brother. He encounters an array of different characters making new friends with them and giving lots of helping incite on life to them. Despite all the mechanical breakdowns, he refuses to give up his journey.\n\nBeing that this is a G-rated movie that was produced by Disney, one wouldn't expect that it was directed by the great, weird filmmaker David Lynch. However, the odd choice by him to direct this film was absolutely perfect. It shows that surreal weirdness isn't all David Lynch knows how to do. What we get is a very straightforward story about an ailing elderly man trying to see his brother who he hasn't seen in ten years. There's no mystery, no dread, no good vs. evil, just a plain and simple story. One that is incredibly moving. Despite the subject matter, the tone and pacing is pure Lynchian. The film shows just as much sympathy towards the characters as any of Lynch's past characters and that is the key the greatness that is this film. Richard Farnsworth gives an extraordinarily subtle and moving performance as Alvin Straight. His incredibly nuanced performance just gives his character so much depth. Knowing that he was going through leukemia and in his final stages of his own life gives his performance even more power.\n\nThere are three scenes in the film that stand out the most. The first of which is where he and another elderly man in town reminisce on when they were in the war against the Nazis where we find out that Alvin had not only been an alcoholic, but also been a sniper in the war where one night he made the mistake of shooting one of his own men and he was the only one that knew he had did it and not a Nazi sniper. Later on there is also a scene with a priest in a cemetery where he tells him about him and his brother and why they stopped speaking to one another. Finally, there is the final scene where he sees his brother and you can tell that both are happy and relieved to finally see each other. It's really moving, you just can't help but shed some tears.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the cinematography and Angelo Badalamenti's music are wonderful; the transitioning shots of the fields and the long, unending roads with the music playing is beautiful to behold.\n\nI think The Straight Story would make a great companion piece to Wim Wenders' road movie Paris, Texas as both deal with family and take place a great deal on the road, but most of all both of these films are incredibly moving pieces of cinema. The Straight Story is a film I can recommend to everybody. I don't think there are too many people that would not appreciate this story whether you're a fan of David Lynch or not. It is an extraordinary film. 10/10",

Lynch does the right thing by not including any of his trademark stylistic flashes, instead he decides to tell an emotional story with no punches pulled. The supporting actors, especially Spacek, do what's required of them, but it's Farnsworth (who filmed this movie while battling cancer that eventually led to his suicide a year later) who is so remarkable here. It takes a special actor to work through an immense amount of pain and the threat of dying (only John Cazale from \"The Deer Hunter\" comes to mind), but luckily for us, Farnsworth was able to make this film.

Soccer really isn't too interesting to me, and is quite a bore personally, but I love watching the skill and athleticism of the players and I can appreciate how well they can endure a long game. With The Straight Story, the movie is such an incredibly boring journey, but the lead performances of the movie by Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are incredible. There is talent both in front and behind the camera, but David Lynch is more known for his incoherent and maddening min trips that this is a strange choice of movie for him. Alvin (Richard Farnsworth) decided to make a long road trip to Wisconsin to visit his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) who is in bad health. He is helped out by his slowwitted daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) and Alvin has to make the trip on a lawnmower because he cannot legally drive a car. Now we can enjoy the continuous and monotonous following of a lawnmower going 10 mph for a whole 100 minutes. The Straight Story is appropriately named because it stays on one straight note throughout the whole movie that never waivers or shifts at all. This is the same line that you see in hospital when a patient's heart has stopped on the heart monitor. In other words, this journey is completely lifeless. Suffering from repetitive landscapes, insignificant passer-bys and too much distance from the main character, The Straight Story strolls down a road that I couldn't care less about. \r\n\r\nWe begin in the town of Laurens, Iowa where we meet Rose. She struggles with simple speech and in the past when her home caught on fire, her kids barely managed to escape. Her kids were taken away from her even though it was a freak accident, all she has is her father. So her father Alvin decides that he needs to go visit his brother in bad health, although they haven't talked in 10 years. The bonding of family spans a matter of feet and hundreds of miles. Lyle is still family, he is worth making the trek for. Richard Farnsworth earned his Oscar nomination as Alvin, an elderly man who knows that he is about to reach the end of the line. You can see in his eyes that he is going to go out with his dignity in tact. As he roves across the farmland, you can see he is still stubborn and he is haunted by what he has seen. There is a great scene in a bar where he talks to another elderly man who was in the war as well. These men have seen the worst of the worst, and that emotional poignancy gives Alvin so much depth and interest. I really wish I could have got to know Rose a bit better though. She just helps her father get on the road, and then she is gone. This makes sense because the story is all about ALvin and his personal journey, but Spacek still felt highly underused. \r\n\r\nThe massive flaw in The Straight Story is the journey itself. Alvin drives on the slow lawnmower to the relaxing rural violin music and beautiful landscapes. He stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next. He runs into a girl hitchhiker named Crystal. She is running away because she is pregnant. They have a pleasant chat over a campfire and then she is gone the next day. Alvin hits the road again and the same music comes up with the same landscapes cross-fading over each other. Alvin stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next, wondering if he can make it all the way. Next he runs into a woman who crashed in front of him after she hit a deer. She complains how she is always hitting deer and then drives away to go into town to fix her car. Alvin stares at the deer, feeling sympathy for the poor animal, then returns to his lawnmower. Alvin hits the road again and the same music comes up with the same landscapes cross-fading over each other. Alvin stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next, wondering if he can make it all the way. As Alvin is going down a hill, his brakes fail and he nearly swerves out of control, but manages to stop. His lawnmower is totaled. His journey may end right here. But wait! The people in small county where he came to a stop happen to have the ability to fix the lawnmower! He even manages to get the parts for cheaper from twin mechanics obviously trying to rip them off. After he refuses some shelter from the people who gave him some food and drink, he gets back on the road very early the next morning. The same music comes up with the same landscapes cross-fading over each other. Alvin stares ahead wondering what is going to happen next, wondering if he can make it all the way. What I am trying to do here is try to give you an idea of how this movie is going to progress. It is a rinse and repeat formula that is used way too much. A better example of a dramatic road trip movie is Little Miss Sunshine. However, Little Miss Sunshine benefitted from its quirky characters and twisted plot. Here, Alvin is by himself the whole time, but he isn't of interest when he is by himself. You never really know what he is thinking and he never has that moment of insight or change that we need to get close to Alvin. We are just another onlooker as he drives by at an incredibly slow rate.\r\n\r\nAnother road trip movie is Into The Wild directed by Sean Penn. What Penn does and Lynch doesn't is put to the front of the movie the aspect of self-discovery and human connection. Into The Wild is about the realization of the fear of human kind and The Straight Story is just about moving from the beginning to the end. There are few stops and little interest. Lynch chooses to test the viewer instead of invite them to join in. We are too distant from Alvin to care about what happens on his journey or what stops will come along the way. Watching a man travel about on a lawnmower isn't exactly a moving or engaging experience. Watching Emile Hirsch as he uses various types of transportation to achieve his goal. It even shows what happens when he reaches his goal. In addition, Into The Wild explains the affect that each character he meets has on his persona. He grows and learns along with stunning nature shots and a beautiful soundtrack. The Straight Story uses the same music and scenery to try and cover up the fact that they have no events to fill this long and winding road with. The characters that he meets are just there to help, or because this 100 minute movie had to have some stops or else we would have fallen asleep. Oh wait, I almost did that anyways. The Straight Story simply cannot connect us to Alvin. One could argue that this is because he is an older man and the issues relate only to his age, but I think it is because we never get close enough to know him well enough. \r\n\r\nHis journey lasted 300 miles and the ending will either infuriate or fascinate some people. The ending is very final yet this journey was so long, an abrupt conclusion didn't seem proper. However, the final line is one that is going to make you think for a bit. I was thinking how on earth this journey could have been so bland and empty. I'm not expecting him to get robbed, have a massive accident or break a bone, but there has to be something to fill up the void. Lynch builds these characters well and the ending is at least worth talking about, but he misfires on what is important: the journey itself. A cinematic journey requires an intimacy with the character or characters who are on the journey, or so I though. To Lynch, just showing the journey is enough. The realism is there, because most trips that we have in everyday life aren't too eventful. If I am going to sit down and watch a journey about a character, it shouldn't be like one of our boring everyday life journey. We want to see a discovery of something new and that feeling of accomplishment once it ends, or even if it is going to end or not. Into The Wild, Little Miss Sunshine and even the teenage comedy Road Trip are examples of journeys with excitement and all are rich with emotion. What if I just set out to get to Alaska right now? Who knows what would happen. Into The Wild answers our question with a fantasy based off a true story. The Straight Story shows us traveling we already know. The Straight Story has the acting and the two ends of a journey, but the middle is what is important. Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless said, \"The core of mans' spirit comes from new experiences.\" This explains why The Straight Story is spiritless, there are no new experiences for us to be had.",

It's based on the true story of Alvin Straight, a man who traveled across all of Iowa into Wisconsin on a lawn mower to see his brother who he hasn't seen in over ten years.  For a Lynch film, this is surprisingly (almost shockingly) conventional.  There's nothing weird or bizarre happening, it is just the story of a man's incredible journey.  Even though it is presented by Disney, it is way too slow moving for kids.  Some people may be bored by it, but I had no problem getting into it, there are a number of really nice things going on here, Richard Farnsworth performance, for example.  All that said, this is one of the slowest movies ever made, much like the journey must have been for Alvin Straight on his lawn mower.  It's worth a watch, but make sure you aren't feeling particularly antsy before you pop in the DVD.",

We are just given the (true) story of a man travelling across America to visit his dying brother on his lawnmower. Its one of those plots that doesnt instantly seem like a Lynch story, but once it gets going, oh man is it Lynchy.\n\nSissy Spacek is brilliant as our protagonists daughter who has a stutter so impractical it would only ever work in a Lynch film. Then there is Alvin Straight himself, who is just one of the finest, strangest characters in all of Lynch's back catalogue. The frail, cigar smoking 73 year old is charmingly realised by richard farnsworth, who makes Alvin instantly likeable yet surprisingly relatable. Alvin is a man who likes doing things his own way, but his kindness to others is never put into question.  \n\nAs for Lynch, well, there are too many moments to mention, the numerous lightning storms which Alvin finds himself watching, the burning house, the harvest  mill. All of these classic Lynch motifs work wonderfully in this new setting, and Lynch manages to conjure up some other moments which prove him to be a great landscape observer, showing that he can do more than just small town America.",

Regardless of how different the story is from his normal subject matter (and it's quite a departure, yes), this is on the same level as the director's most compelling, disturbing, and best work, such as \"Blue Velvet.\" While it certainly sticks out in his canon of films for its lack of narrative trickery, edgy sex and nudity and oddball profanity, this gentle change in pace from America's most unpredictable and unusual director boasts some of the most \"Lynchian\" scenes the director has ever taken on. Just because its simple, refreshingly straightforward story doesn't deter from reality or into surrealism doesn't mean this isn't Lynch. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, fans of the director will find his presence in every moment of this movie, from the graceful, fluid camera work to the intimate scenes focusing on the quirky and mundane. Lynch has often done films dealing with middle America, and it's hypocritical simplicity and darkness. This is subdued in \"The Straight Story,\" but it's there. In fact, this may be Lynch's defining statement on middle American attitudes, a more laid back companion piece to \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Twin Peaks.\" Slow but hynotic, meandering but graceful, it's full of powerfully quiet moments that haunt and linger with the viewer long after watching it. \r\n\r\nAs usual, the cast, which is limited, is excellent, with Rciarhd Farnsworth giving the performance of his career (his final screen appearance sadly) in a role that most actors have his age will never equal. Sissy Spacek is practically an extended cameo but does such memorable and specific work in her scenes she feels like a lead. \r\n\r\nEither with or without the knowledge that this sweet, wise, incredibly serene movie was made by the guy who did \"Eraserhead,\" \"The Straight Story\" will still be one of the most beautiful and relaxing cinematic experiences of one's movie-watching life. Lynch is a director of true Kubrickian quality; he takes his ideas, his style, his mood and his attitude, and throws it on a story unlike anything else he's ever done, and comes up with a homerun. I can't recommend this movie enough. How can something so simple, so laid back resonate so intensely? Cinema is full of wonderful experiences, like \"The Straight Story.\"",

C'est une sociÃ©tÃ© profonde, Ã  part et ou l'on se demande parfois s'ils ont toutes leur tÃªte. Mais ce sont des personnes sur qui l'on peut compter. C'est une oeuvre contemplative, profonde, Ã©voquant les rapports entre les hommes servie par l'une des plus belles compositions de Badalamenti. L'histoire est encore plus Ã©mouvant quand on sait le parcours final de l'acteur principal, Richard Farnsworth, qui se suicida une annÃ©e aprÃ¨s le film aprÃ¨s avoir appris qu'il Ã©tait en phase terminale d'un cancer.",

É uma reflexão amarga, melancólica e generosa sobre a passagem do tempo, marcada no filme pelo rosto de Richard Farnsworth. É um dos casos em que ator e personagem se confundem: Mickey Rourke em O Lutador, Clint Eastwood em Os Imperdoáveis. Uma atuação sutil, maravilhosa.\r\n\r\nConta a história do senhor louco varrido Alvin Straight que atravessou um estado dos EUA em um cortador de grama para rever o irmão. O filme anda na mesma velocidade que o personagem. A câmera anda suavemente, revela paisagens lindas e seus detalhes. A travessia do Rio Mississipi mostra cada detalhe da ponte, de maneira maravilhosa.\r\n\r\nÉ também uma obra sobre humanidade, bondade, sobre família. Uma obra de arte que suspira emoção. Lynch se mostra um diretor carinhoso e com imensa compaixão pelo personagem, e essa emoção fica transparente para o público. Filme maravilhoso, talvez o melhor do diretor, certamente o mais emocionante.",

Here in The Straight Story Lynch only shows his good side.\r\n\r\nI gave this film a look only to more complete my Lynch catalog.  The Straight Story does have a Lynchian feel  with the way he moves the camera slowly almost as if filming pieces of fine art.  Also, the way the score foretells the upcoming scene is so Lynchian that I kept expecting Willem Dafoe to jump into the frame a blow the top half of his head off at any moment.\r\n\r\nAlas, the story of some old dude riding his tractor for weeks on end is rated G for a reason.  It is a touching story that is not my cup of tea, but one that I did find relaxing and somewhat enjoyable.  Enough that it will garner a lukewarm positive rating from me.  I think the 95% the film gets from RT is a bit high, but still, if you enjoy a heart warming tale with real and well defined characters you will probably love this one.",

The sound it makes is a little bit like the high pitched opening of a small bottle. Open your lips and a smack abruptly sounds. Abrupt but also gentle. A childlike excursion into the realms of your mouth before puberty leads you down different roads.\n\nTHE STRAIGHT STORY is a film about the ending of those roads. They never dead-end but continue on and on. It is you who eventually pulls off to the side. You sit down in the grassy leaves and close your eyes, never to hop back on the road. All the other cars continue to pass and pass but they, one day, will pull off to the side to rejoin you. Alvin Straight's vehicle of choice may be a John Deere riding mower, but that does not keep him from getting into other cars and going for other rides.\n\nDavid Lynch has made one of the most uplifting films about the essential goodness of the human spirit that can possibly be imagined. Alvin Straight knows that all human beings have a story and he is always willing to listen. And he knows that the others will be willing to listen to him. His entire plan to ride across state lines on the riding mower would be crazier if he was not solely depending on the kindness of strangers to get him through the trip. He may be traveling through the gentle communities of Iowa, but that is no reason to think that such kindness would not lurk in the midst of big cities or the suburbs.\n\nRichard Farnsworth creates a character with such force and with such power that, by the end of the film, you realize that if every single person was an Alvin Straight, the world would be a much better place. He has his demons and he has his flaws. But he remains pure and untouched by the vagaries of cynicism and spite. His journey takes on a poignant complexity as we roll on that tractor.\n\nPerhaps something could be said about the fact that this is an atypical venture for Lynch. I don't think so. Underneath the shocking and bizarre surrealism of his other films, there was always a childlike innocence that regards these horrible things with wonder. Think of how Dennis Hopper's character in BLUE VELVET is essentially just an overgrown child. THE STRAIGHT STORY does contain its fair share of weirdness and darkness, but this is a film with its eyes wide open, gazing at the stars.",

The grumpy old man could've been just another grumpy stubborn old man, but hes more than that, which owes so much credit to a fantastic performance by Richard Farnsworth.  The supporting cast all do their jobs, but no one holds a candle to him.  Thematically and story wise this film is top notch, and I find nothing to complain about at all.  The end is magnificent.",

            "content": "I would rather watch David Lynch's worst movies than many of the best reviewed movies out there. Dune and Wild at Heart have more creativity than most movies. Who would have believed David Lynch's best movie would be G-rated, yes, no sexual perversions or graphic violence here, and released by Disney. What an appropriate name for a movie. In one way, it's the story of Alvin Straight, an ornary old cuss who lives in the mid-west and the other way, it's Lynch playing it straight and showing that the odd characters he's used in his previous movies exist in real life. There are people in this movie who make those in Twin Peaks look normal, such as the female motorist who is frustrated that she repeatedly hits deer on a highway but can't stop because it is the only road she travels or the storekeeper who haggles with Alvin over an grabber. The story is based on a true story as Straight, now forced to using two walking canes, is forbidden from driving. Rather cranky as he refuses to ride in a car with anyone else, he hops on his riding tractor from Iowa to Minnesota to visit his estranged and now-ill brother. Sissy Spacek is his daughter, who may or may not be mentally disabled. The movie never really lets us know. There is a nice small role by Everett McGill, who only seems to get to play nice guys in David Lynch's movies, who sells Alvin Straight a new John Deere tractor with just a small down payment, a hand shake and his word that he will pay it off. Kevin Farley and John Farley, brothers of the late Chris Farley, provide a little comic relief as they play some inept mechanics who try to short change Straight on repairs. He's sees through them. This was one of the best movies of the 1990's and the 20th Century.",

It got me thinking about films which have changed me as a person and in particular my views on life, love, etc.\r\n\r\nWell this film encapulates all that is good about life, a life dealt a less than perfect hand that is!  Basically in life, what everything boils down to, is who we are or where we have come from. Along the departure from our creation things go wrong, and that is whgere this film picks up.\r\n\r\nI shall not go into the sotry or plot of this film, as I shall assume that, given this film is 10 years old, you will reference this knowing a little of the story.\r\n\r\nBut in conclusion, if my life was summarised by a man on a lawnmower in such a touching way as this, heck, my life has been worth while.\r\n\r\nIf you watch one film in your life which you allow to touch your soul, please, please let it be this one.
