The villain is not good, the adults are so generic and lack any charm or chemistry with the kids it's cringeworthy. The babies are clueless and their eyes and facial expressions don't ever match with the words or mouth movement. This goes to the fundamental problem that babies can't act. The cinematography is just as equally bad. Stupid camera angles, dumb scenes, and dumb bad jokes besides the bomb threat which was good.The music is the same looped bad music played throughout 80% of the time feeling really obnoxious. The editing and pacing are the worst part of this movie. Half the film there is no story and because there is no charm, chemistry or any wittiness it makes things drag beyond belief. The story that is here is so stupid and the rules make no sense (Babies Crossing Over, The fact they can solve Einstein Equations but can't potty train) is such a dumb idea that is just designed just to have parents go see this and be focused on the adorable kids rather than any story telling. (Perfect example is the 3 minute ending montage of kids at the end with the sappy music meant to tug at heart strings and make you forget the horrible movie you just watched) Give this to your toddler and have them flush it down the toilet where it belongs.",

Any intentional jokes are unfunny and don't land, and all the other lines are cringy and the actors clearly don't want to be there. The plot is so utterly insane that I think about it nearly every week and I haven't watched it for years. The CGI... nonexistent. The athletic scenes make me want to sob and laugh at the same time. The babies mouths barely even move to the words..? This is no doubt the worst movie I have ever witnessed in my life time. I would like to buy a DVD for this movie just to light it on fire.",

            "content": "I will give some credit to this otherwise awful film, that it is better than its abysmal sequel Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. On paper, it doesn't look so bad, it has a great cast including beautiful Kathaleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd who is a lot of fun in pretty much everything he's in and the late Dom DeLuise. If only, if only it had a decent enough script and a good enough plot. However, the film is severely lacking in both areas, and makes a waste of those truly talented actors.\n\nThe script is just awful, and doesn't give anyone enough to work with, and there is no originality or sophistication. The story is one that has been done before and better about a nasty children's magnate who is carrying out tests on a host of brainy little children on the premise that they can speak in a secret language. Bob Clark's direction is very unfocused throughout, and doesn't improve whatsoever. The camera-work is rushed, and the slapstick is uninspiredly staged. In fact, if there was a redeeming quality, the soundtrack was okay to say the least.\n\nThe performances are disappointingly poor, and they are not helped by the lacklustre direction and the witless script. To be honest I found triplets Leo, Myles and Gerry Fitzgerald very irritating as the twins who try to outmatch Dr Kinder. As for Turner, this has to be a career low for her. This is a shame, because she is so beautiful and talented, but her strengths aren't even put to use here and she does overact quite wildly. Christopher Lloyd usually excels in roles similar to the one he has here, but he looks embarrassed here and looks as though he wants to get it all out of the way. And Dom DeLuise? For such a talented and versatile actor like DeLuise, you would expect a lot from him. But his part is so badly underwritten that he comes across as wasted.\n\nAll in all, sorry but I didn't like this movie. Even with such a wonderful bunch of actors, their talents are all gone to waste with poor writing, direction and plot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

And it's so short, they tacked on a sentimental little music video at the end, but it ain't enough. Worst of all, you'll likely be put off by the fact that babies can't act. Because infants aren't developed enough to understand basic direction, they can't be told to look happy or sad, so the filmmakers just had slightly older voice actors do their dialogue and superimposed creepy-lookin' lips over their mouths for scenes that require them to speak. You'll possibly have more fun countin' the amount of times infants are blatantly replaced with young children in costumes rather than from actually watchin' this film; a scene where a little guy in a Elvis costume with a baby's head poorly pasted over his is the one that really takes the cake.

For the most part, the effect is like watching a dubbed movie -- the lip movements don't always match the words. Director Bob Clark does everything in his power to make his diaper-clad cast endearing. Unfortunately, for a movie to succeed, it needs more than cuteness. Sure, it's fun to see Sly don a tux and strut his stuff to \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" but the entire movie is built on the shaky foundation that these kinds of moments will excuse a lot of pointless running around and inane plotting.

The jokes make me want to throw up i mean people say Diaper Gravy 5 times i mean can't you come up with something else thats funny then repeating the same thing over and over again ugg. The one thing i found good about this  film is maybe its voice cast who provide voices for the charactors they were good but i mean the real actors on set were horrible they just didn't care weather the film was good or bad its really sad. They all just did it to get paid and to add a title to their resume its upsetting it really is. Oh yes there is one other thing i enjoyed on this film is believe it or not its plot. Well really idea because its new , original as silly as that sounds it really is original and interesting to think that babies know everything up until there two its quite interesting it really is. But evrything else including the dubbing , jokes , charactors , Christopher Lloyd ( and all  the live action actors , acting ,  music , and anything else you could possibly think of. The dubbing of the babies mouth which is surpossed to make it look like the babies are really talking is horrible we see the mouths moving before sound actually starts coming out ugg its really annoying!!! I just wonder where all these people's time and money  went to making this film i really do !!!! This film is a sorry example for a film. The jokes are the worst of all he films problems probably as i said before they say the same jokes 4 times then move onto anew cheesy joke and then say that joke 4 times its really upsetting ugg. The charactors are so flat and unexplanned and just weak. They are all so under developed its really bad i don't understand  any of these people at all in the end i have no feelings for any of the charactors at all.  Christopher Lloyd is horrible he used to be a great actor in the days of  The Addams Family ,and Back to the Future but now he is just plan out bad this is probably the worst film i've seen with him in it is swear he did not even try to be good in this film he just did it because maybe he lost a bet and had to follow through on the bet which apparently was joining this films cast to add a bit of star power to this low budget film. The acting is really bad its so bad i hate it i do its so lame and cheesy ugg. The music is really bad having no real excitment in it. Well all an all this film gives basically zero effert to be a good film its just an example of a good idea gone bad - with this film really bad. D-",

Dr. Kinder and her partner in crime, Dr. Heep, are set to rule the world by running a lab to crack the code to a hidden baby language. The two-year-old Sly escapes from the labs and, with his twin brother Whit, fights to expose the nefarious plot. Mistaken for his twin, he is taken back to his uncle and calls the other babies to invade the secret lab and thwart the evil plot as a commando rescue.\n\nDirected by Bob Clark, 'Baby Geniuses' features very good acting performances from the following cast:\n1.) Kathleen Turner (Dr. Elena Kinder)\n2.) Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Heep)\n3.) Kim Cattrall (Robin)\n4.) Peter MacNicol (Dan)\n5.) Dom DeLuise (Lenny)\n\nWith its maturity and intelligence expressed by the infants, 'Baby Geniuses' is like a cute, live-action version of 'Rugrats'. And as I was watching this, I asked myself: how did the babies talk grown-up? They're probably preschool kids who could really act, as I never heard of a two-year-old speak at a 30-year-old level. Aside from their language abilities, they even fight bad guys and save people...for real! I can think of them as some of Super Commando Diaper Babies, really, and they were really good. For these elements I can say that 'Baby Geniuses' is very good and worth a watch.",

You just need a smart writer. Unfortunately, this movie is extraordinarily stupid. It's like the idea was \"babies are cute, seeing them do non-baby things will be hilarious\" was all of the thinking they did before making the actual film. \"Baby Geniuses\" doesn't show any inventive thinking, The same jokes get repeated over and over, the unfunny satire makes you wish it would simply go away and nonsensical plot drag this quickly into a near unwatchable mess. To make it even worse, the director knew this movie was complete junk and decided to throw in a last minute music video at the end in the hopes that seeing babies laughing at the sound of \"Gift Of Love\" by Randy Travis would make you forget how terrible the movie was.

            "content": "One way to get through ''Baby Geniuses'' is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close.\r\n\r\nDeceptive trailers and television shots may make this talking-toddler film look competently made, but that proves not to be the case. Its technical caliber is what you'd expect from ''Look Who's Talking 12.'' The plotting is dopey and barely comprehensible. The sound looping is off-kilter. The look is sad and cheesy, often bordering on the grotesque, so that the badly lighted faces of the film's adult actors take on a grayish pallor.\r\n\r\nAnd the babies don't fare any better. Ably executed computer tricks enable these tots to talk like obnoxious adults (they admiringly discuss ''The Jerry Springer Show''), but this trick is better suited to piglets than people. The morphed children look gnomish and strange.\r\n\r\nAs directed by Bob Clark, whose most notable film credits over a long career remain ''Porky's'' and ''A Christmas Story,'' and written by him with Greg Michael, this flawlessly unfunny comedy concerns an evil child psychologist and C.E.O., Dr. Elena Kinder. She is played by Kathleen Turner in a performance that says, ''Hey, it's a living,'' and is abetted by an overlooked sidekick played by Christopher Lloyd.\r\n\r\nThese two study the language of babies who can secretly say things like ''jerk!'' and plan to exploit their little laboratory specimens for evil gain. Meanwhile, nicer baby researchers (Peter MacNichol and Kim Cattrall) are unselfishly studying the same kind of data. The film's single weirdest stroke is to cast, as their assistants, Dom DeLuise and Ruby Dee (the only performer who escapes unscathed). According to production notes, these two are meant to be ''an older hippie couple'' -- Which is strange.\r\n\r\nThe story also involves twin babies (played by triplets named Fitzgerald) who switch places in ways meant to heighten the fun. Filmed as awkwardly as they are, they prompt thoughts about how children in glossier films and commercials are made to look so right. The babies' clumsy antics in this Tri-Star film often involve conspicuous use of Sony products. If Sony made diapers they would be plugged here too.\r\n\r\nBaby Geniuses has a sequel, and I plan to watch it to see what crap they have gotten themselves into now. I can't believe Hollywood actually let a sequel be brought up in the first place! No, actually, I can't believe Hollywood actually let Baby Geniuses to become a film in the first place. That's more like it.\r\n\r\nThis film just practices mediocre work and turns it into diaper stains. It's so bad, you'll be groaning at the horrible jokes this comedy film is supposed to contain. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Back to the Future, and Baby Geniuses? Not a good mix, Christopher. Next time, consider doing a more specialized role, one that's not over the top dumb and flat-out bizarre.\r\n\r\nBaby Geniuses just fails on every kind of level you could possibly think of. A lot of it has to do with the fact that whoever invented the idea, not the film, needs to be punished for eternity.",

She wants to make it to where every baby from that point on will be a genius. Trouble arises when her smartest baby, Sly, gets away. Sly has a twin named Whit. Some of Kathleen Turner's employees kidnap Whit because they think it's Sly. Whit's father (Peter MacNicol) must try to understand what his daughter and Sly are trying to tell him in order to get Whit back.\r\n\r\n\"Baby Geniuses\" was a big disappointment. I was expecting it to be funny and entertaining. You would expect a movie that has talking babies and even a baby that can do karate to be hilarious, but not in this case. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it halfway kept me entertained. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's one of the worst of the year. If you want to see a funny movie that features talking babies, I would recommend sticking with the \"Look Who's Talking\" series. NOTE: That was my Amazon review from the year 2000.
