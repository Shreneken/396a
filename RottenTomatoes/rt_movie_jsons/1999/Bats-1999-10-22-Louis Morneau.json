    "summary": "When a population of bats in a small Texas town starts attacking the unsuspecting citizens, Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer), a zoologist specializing in the species, is called in to investigate. With the help of her assistant and the local sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips), strange details about the bats begin to emerge: It's discovered that they are the product of a governmental experiment gone awry. With people dying and the military threatening to take action, a solution must be found.",

Supposedly the scientist genetically altered a flying fox and it somehow got loose in Tx and started mating with the local bat population. Now most likely the local bats would be mexican free tailed bats which are I'm guessing about 7 or 8 times smaller than the flying fox. That would be like a Great dane mating with a miniature Chihuahua. Being mammals that would be a real tough on the poor female free tailed bats not to mention the poor thing trying to tuck the baby on board to suckle it. But it's not all bad the movie does have some decent actors like Lou Diamond Phillips so it's good to pass some time.",

The bats, which look like they are made of rubber at times, are very ugly and shot in dim light to make them creepy. The bats are also well constructed puppets which moved pretty realistically. \r\n\r\nThe acting is fairly good in the movie. Meyers and Phillips are easily the best of the cast. The supporting cast of characters is not written strongly. In fact some of the characters are just there to help advance the plot, and do not much else. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that really help in the movie's creepiness is the editing. During the bat attacks, you see quick flashes of bats coming at the camera as if the bat is coming at you. If this movie was done better with a bigger budget, the bat attack scenes would have been better. \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this could be a pretty good second choice for a rental if your first choice is unavailable.",

The films plot is derivative of every other nature gone wild horror flick.Bats could have been something good, but it ultimately failed in delivering anything good to the screen. The film in originality, not providing us with interesting characters or story line. This film could have been good, instead it took liberties from other genre films, and it just became a big cliche riddled film. The payoff of the film is weak, and overall this is a lazy effort. The acting is sloppy, and is complemented by a very poor script. Bats is an example of a film that has had the misfortune of being in a genre of horror film that really is not interesting anymore. I mean, the nature gone wild genre has covered so much ground in the last three decades. Starting with Jaws, to Grizzlyu with Piranha, Alligator and Arachnophobia and culminating with Lake Placid. There has been other killer creature films since, but what separates this film from the newer films are that these films such as Rogue used cliched ideas in a refreshing way and had a good, well constructed script that used suspense and terror effectively well to tell its story However Bats doesn't do that. Bats uses cliches with a bad script, and it doesn't work. Stick with Jaws, Grizzly and the more recent Rogue. Bats just doesn't cut it, and it suffers from being a bad B movie that is more hilariously bad than scary. As a bad film, this one works, as a horror flick, it doesn't.",

This is mainly because they essentially all centre around the same core premise: animals with a slightly sinister reputation become mutated by a Promethean scientist and besiege an isolated small town, only to be eventually stopped by a scientist/feminist figure, a working class diamond in the rough and a comic relief who just so haoppens to be afraid of said creature. \r\n\r\nDespite a fairly strong effort by Dina Meyer (who this time manages to go a whole movie without getting naked) and a totally believable performance by Leon, the film can not escape its deep genre-confined script and thus is never anything more than a by-the-numbers affair. Lou Diamond Philips in particular feels about as realistic as a Ken doll and at no point is the audience ever led to believe that he may not make it out alive (the premise which made Deep Blue Sea so refreshing could really have helped here).   \r\n\r\nAs with most genre films, the special effects remain the biggest draw and the hideously vampiric bats do successfully satisfy in the creepiness department. Beyond that, Bats stands as nothing more than a time filler. Genre fans may want to watch it if they haven't already but newcomers are better advised to skip straight to Aranchniphobia, Evolution or the far superior Tremors.",

            "content": "One probably knows what they're getting into prior to seeing a film called \"Bats\".  Something that could rock in a throwback to 50's horror in all it's sweet campiness.  Or just a load of bullshit.  It falls into the latter category.\n\nThe plot involves a a couple of bat experts (Dina Meyer of \"Starship Troopers\" and Leon of \"Cool Runnings\") who hired to by an evil scientist (Bob Gunton of \"The Shawshank Redemption\") to capture and/or kill a swarm of genetically engineered super bats loose in a Texas town.  Of course the stereotypical Texas sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips, \"La Bamba\") is there to lend a hand as well.\n\nWhy the bats were created in the first place and why Gunton is obsessed with them and believes they follow his every command \"Willard\"-style (but they don't) isn't ever brought up in one of many plotholes.  The ingredients were there for something cool, instead our heroes run around shooting at bats (would a pistol really be the weapon of choice against a zig zagging flying bat?), locking them in a high school, and making plans to freeze the bastards.  No time is given to any kind of character development, so who these people are or why we should give a shit if they're eaten by flying rubber bats is beyond me.\n\nThe cast play this one totally straight without the \"wink at the camera\" which is sorely missed.  Much could have been done with the characters, including Bob Gunton's gung-ho approach to the whole thing.  But the second he starts showing signs of uplifting the film, he's killed off.  The effects aren't terrible for what they are, but better suited had the film chosen the campy route.  The CGI bats don't work as well, nor does fighter pilot footage, filmed with a completely different film stock, look good at all.  Hey, it's 1999 CGI, I guess it ain't horrible.  But what about those fuckin jets?  Oh yeah, that's just recycled footage from \"Iron Eagle II\".  Guess the lifeless rubber bats used up the whole budget.  Or maybe it's Leon paycheck following the critical success of \"Cool Runnings\" 6 years earlier?  He was also in uh...well, he was one of the bad guys in \"Cliffhanger\".  Alongside direct-to-video greats like Lou Diamond Phillips, one wonders how the hell Bob Gunton went from the sadistic warden in \"Shawshank Redemption\" to being eaten by 6 foot rubber bat.  Who knows, who cares.  It's not worth much of anyone's time.",

            "content": "A great time for anyone that enjoys cheesy monster movies. It really feels like a movie that was meant to be made in the 50's or 60's, and to be enjoyed at the drive in. There's no way to take the material seriously. Genetically engineered bats escape from a government lab, infect other bats outside a small Texas town, and proceed to kill everyone in sight. Of course the government recruits one scientist who is \"the best in the field\" to find a solution to the problem. The movie is filled with bats that look as real as the shark in Jaws. Whether they are animatronic, or computer generated, they rarely look real. But when they swarm, it's a cool sight to see. Director Louis Morneau makes great use of the beautiful landscape, and the quaintness of a small town to give the movie a great atmosphere. The characters are all stereotypical, especially Leon's ultra hip, token black character. But the actors are solid, and keep you interested. Lou Diamond Phillips can't sell a Texas accent to save his life, but he's heroic enough as the sherriff. Dina Meyer...ah me, Dina Meyer. Not only is she one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, she's also a solid actress, and makes her character tough, and is FAR more credible as a scientist than her Starship Troopers co-star Denise Richards was as a nuclear scientist in The World Is Not Enough. Did I also mention she's has one of the most perfect faces I've ever seen? The movie though, loses a great deal of steam in the third act. When the heroes enter the central nest of the bats at the end, it draws out way too long, and begins to become boring, with a finale that doesn't quite fit with the feel of the rest of the movie. But, if you like drive-in movies, cheesy monster flicks, or need nothing more than to stare at the beautiful Dina Meyer for 90 minutes (that would be me) then this movie is for you. In fact, I'm so taken with her beauty, that I'm going to give the movie an extra half star just for that.",

The bats kill everybody they see, so it's up to a wildlife zoologist (Dina Meyer) and a sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips) to try and get rid of the bats before it's too late.\r\n\r\n\"Bats\" might have had better success a few years ago, but with the great horror movies that have been made lately, \"Bats\" just can't stand up to them. Sometimes the camera in the movie just goes in circles to where you can't see anything. There's not much plot to the movie other than to get rid of the bats. Finally, \"Bats\" was made in 1999. It's pretty bad when a movie made in the late 90's doesn't even have good special effects. The only thing that I did like about the movie was that the bats looked pretty cool. \r\n\r\nSome people might like \"Bats,\" but for me, it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be.
