    "summary": "In this visually and conceptually impressive film, two-bit Berlin criminal Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) delivers some smuggled loot for his boss, Ronnie (Heino Ferch), but accidentally leaves the 100,000 mark payment in a subway car. Given 20 minutes to come up with the money, he calls his girlfriend, Lola (Franka Potente), who sprints through the streets of the city to try to beg the money out of her bank manager father (Herbert Knaup) and get to Manni before he does something desperate.",

It's jam-packed with fantastic creativity, including a wonderful way of telling the story quickly and smoothly. Colours are used excellently here, but most importantly, the soundtrack is a major highlight, as are the effective and fun sound effects. With only the third act slowing down slightly before the conclusion, Run Lola Run is a cinematic ride that always amazes me, even on repeat viewings.",

            "content": "The premise bobs back and forth between gimmicky actually thematic, but overall Run Lola Run is a neat exercise in the experimental thriller genre, if not a particularly deep one. On a high level, Tykwer's screenplay presents life as a balance between two forces - independent willpower that can be exerted to a surprising degree, and the overwhelming and unpredictable power of chance that can throw unintended conseqeunces at you with the slightest tweak. But then it also presents this balance by taking it to such extremes that the concept often seems silly - a woman is either going to have her child taken away and become a kidnapper or win the lottery, all based on when she runs into a woman with red hair. It's tough to call the film particularly sincere or impactful as a result, but it is consistently high-energy and interesting, particularly by its occasional mixing of mediums and the representation of personal will through an almost supernatural element. Neat and once in a while shockingly funny (thinking back to Lola walking out of the bank, only to have a SWAT team escort her away thinking she's a bystander instead of a thief), Run Lola Run takes leaps in some interesting places and is worthy of a watch. (3/5)",

After her and her boyfriend botch a money delivery for some dodgy looking folk, Lola (Franka Potente) has twenty minutes to come up with 100,000 Deutschmarks, or there will be \u2018consequences'. Run Lola Run is a madcap experimental thriller, complete with scenes of animation and a constant pulsing techno score, which adds to the madness.  The film shows us three different possible scenarios depending on Lola's actions, and although my friend who I watched it with got frustrated with the \u2018fake outs' I wasn't really sure how else you'd go about making the film. It's a chase film that at eighty odd minutes isn't long enough to outstay its welcome. Potente is a fine actress, in a role that reminds you of her part in the Bourne films a few years later, and she throws herself into the part, astounding you at Lola's incredible energy to seemingly be able to run flat out for lengthy periods. But this is never an issue because Run Lola Run doesn't take itself remotely seriously, and is also very funny in parts. It's acquired something of a cult status over the years, and it's easy to see why.",

            "content": "Run Lola Run plays out like a race-against-time video game in which you have only one life, but every GAME OVER popping up on the screen propels you to keep trying again over and over. Lola tries to avoid making the same blunders. Luckily for her, every misstep, or every second went to waste because of giving in to her emotions, a slight temptation, or a force of habit, drifting her from focusing on making it to the end before it's too late, can be rectified later.\n\nAfter her moped is stolen, Lola fails to pick up her boyfriend, Manni, a courier for a crime boss, who accidentally leaves 100,000 Deutschmarks on the subway, where it's stolen by a bum. Manni is dead if he doesn't bring it in, and Lola has only 20 minutes to raise that money for him. Otherwise, Manni would rob a grocery store near the phone booth he's hiding in.\n\n\"The ball is round, a game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is pure theory.\" Two things set this film apart for me. First, it's principally a film of small changes that cause larger consequences. Each time Lola bumps into someone, their life flashes before our eyes and we see how that a couple of centimetres alters the dynamic of people's lives drastically - for better or worse - \u00e0 la butterfly effect. Thus, it's a film that rests upon a theoretical pillar, not an arbitrary one.\n\n\"Man... probably the most mysterious species on our planet. A mystery of unanswered questions.\" That said, it also acknowledges the mysterious and sophisticated nature of our feelings and, consequently, gives Lola and Manni more than one chance to shake off any qualms they have for one another regarding true love, devotion and fidelity. Actions speak louder than words, let alone when such actions are of 'fate-defying' proportions and those words are of ineffable emotions.\n\nRunning at a breakneck pace and merging multiple styles as diverse as animation and cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, Run Lola Run is an adrenaline rush in every sense of the word that's cool and innovative in equal measure, and one that overflows with thematic significance, compressed into a compact 80-minute film. However, I think it would've benefited from a tad longer runtime to earn its weight.",

I recalled loving this when I was younger, so I wanted to revisit the movie again, and I'm glad that I did.  It's very fun and doesn't feel dated at all.

I get that it was heavily praised at the time of its release in the 1990's, but it has aged poorly. The acting is not particularly impressive as many in the cast are overacting.\n\nThe music is very dated in the 90's as its club techno music that mostly died after that decade. It's high stakes hyper fast pacing is nice as it keeps the plot moving. The funniest part is the overly dramatic 90's art house edits where there will be exaggerated screams, close ups, long pans, long takes, and even dual screen shots where multiple events are taking place at the same time on screen.\n\nI can see how Franka Potente became a famous actress for Run Lola Run as The Bourne Identity (which cast her after this film) clearly was influenced by its stylized cinematography. There are some neat ideas, such as when Potente hits someone while running, we see what their future will end up being, but it does seem unrelated to the plot. It's like it's just there for shock factor.\n\nOverall, I had some fun with Run Lola Run, but it's an incredibly frustrating movie that could have been so much better with a decent script and sense of cohesive storytelling. It's all style here that's rather dated. Maybe worth a single viewing.",

The music sets the pace as we listening to a fast beating heartbeat. This film never slows down. Franka Potente - the main actress - is always in motion, she never gets a rest here. Same thing with the cinematography. It's a music video in MTV style really. Tracking shots, close-ups, sometimes the live action story switches to Lola as running cartoon character. When she meets, bump into or screams at a passerby, we get quick flashes of their lifes and how they will turn out after this butterfly-effect encounter. \"Run Lola Run\" is structured in three different processes of the same story with every single story showing a different decision made by Lola and how the story changes because of it. It's not only Lola who runs, it's the whole film that is running away and we have to be fast and coming along to don't lose track of Franka Potente and Tykwers swift style.",

The fact that it draws the viewer's attention to the means of production through symbolism, transgression of boundaries, and false consciousness, is what makes the film stand out.\nIn the beginning of the film, the animation of Lola running as fast as she can and breaking obstacles while constantly being surrounded by clocks, illustrates that life is a game. We are constantly repeating our day to day routine with minor changes, and time is always running the same exact way. So, we, humans, are imprisoned by time in some space in life and the events that take place go round and round, except that they go in spirals and not in circles. Therefore, the choices we make at a certain time influences the future or rearranges it in some way, affecting what stages we reach to in life, much like the butterfly effect. As a viewer watching the film, you feel as though Lola has been given much more than just 20 minutes. It gives a perception that Lola manipulates time or tries to create it, which specifically makes the film transgress the boundaries of time in the realistic world.\nLola's physical appearance in the beginning of the film leads us to think that she is careless, but that perspective changes when the film shows that she wholeheartedly cares and is actually full of intelligence. This is meant by the director to address the false consciousness within the viewers. Moreover, in the first two attempts, Lola always chooses to seek help from her father figure, but on the third attempt she never asks anyone for help, especially a man. Only then does she succeed in winning the money all by herself. This cinematic idea is demystifying the fact that one, a female in particular, does not need a male figure to succeed in life. Therefore, the false consciousness of society's perspective on this matter is challenged by the director through her final attempt. \nThe symbolism in this film is very obvious, in which it metaphorically speaks to the audience. Lola's character is associated with red; her hair is red, her telephone is red, and her personality represents the color red. Red is the color of her desperation and passion to accomplish her 'mission' and stick by her promise to her boyfriend Manni. It is also the color that shows her fierceness or wildness. Red is also the color of 'emergency' in the film. It is evident in the scene where Lola runs alongside the emergency car, that similar to the driver of the car, Lola also has an emergency. Spirals are also a repetitive theme in the film that emphasizes the loop we go through in life, which is constricted by time. \nThe fast paced extra diegetic sounds where Lola runs emphasizes on the fact that time is running and she has an emergency. It further allows the transfer of boundaries in which the audience can feel the anxiety that Lola feels. A song called \"Believe\" by Franka Potente is played in all the three times Lola runs. The lyrics of the song contradict how Lola is framed in the film. The song repeats \"I don't believe in promise, I don't believe in chance... I don't believe in panic, I don't believe in fear.\" However, while Lola runs, she delivers the impression that she does believe in promise and chance, and that she is in panic and fear at the same time. She promises Manni that she will find the money, she takes the chance of gambling in the casino, and throughout it all she is anxious and fearful about the future. This ironic distance between her thoughts and her actions creates another form of false consciousness, in which she knows that she does not believe, but she does not want to know that she does not believe, so she does not know to be able to get through her attempts and 'win the game'.\nRun Lola Run is also a film in between modernism and post-modernism. It follows a modern world, in a sense that it portrays how people are constantly pressured by time without exaggeration as her 20-minute attempt in each of the three times is actually 20 minutes long in the film, so the audience is able to feel her anxiety and take her place in the film. It can also be seen as a post-modern world, where Lola gets to stop and repeat time to go back to the same exact setting and make new, different choices. This is something beyond our capabilities, which gives the film its element of the supernatural world. Not only does the film fulfill the audience's excitement from the beginning to the end, but it also succeeds in generating innovative approaches towards time.",

            "content": "Run Lola Run: The Bigger Picture is Hidden within the Tiny Details\n\nThe film Run Lola Run is about a girl that has 20 minutes to help her boyfriend with a predicament that will most likely cause him his life. The film is an artistic masterpiece that transgresses the architectures of containment in such an interesting way. The director Tom Tykwer was successful at capturing the imprisonment of time that the main character Lola was experiencing throughout the film. The pattern portrayed throughout the film gives the viewer a sense of depth that is not always presented to the same extent in many films. This was achieved through the use of sound, color, editing and the various camera angles. \nThe opening scene of the film shows a panoramic shot of the city from above and quickly zooms into Lola's apartment complex. We follow the camera as it quickly aims toward the red telephone ringing, all while hearing the sound of upbeat techno music that gives the viewer a sense of urgency. The crane shot which proceeds to zoom in is a way to portray the main event of the film, a technique to show the object of most importance. Even the color of the telephone is significant, which is identical to the color of Lola's hair. The color red is noteworthy as it was intentionally displayed in an attempt to give the viewer an indication of passion, anger, emergency, love and worry.\nLola answers the phone and the director uses the same technique of shifting the camera to her boyfriend Manni in a similar fast paced zooming as seen earlier. This simply adds to the effect and feeling of urgency that is displayed time and time again throughout the film. The director intensifies the anxiety of the situation by abruptly shifting the shots to both Lola and Manni as they speak during their telephone conversation. Manni informs Lola that he has lost the money he was supposed to deliver to a drug dealer and he will most likely be killed by him if he does not deliver the 100,000 marks within 20 minutes. They end their telephone conversation and the techno music intensifies as Lola turns to the clock to see the time she has left to help her boyfriend. Simultaneously, we get flashes of her television screen showing a set of dominos swiftly toppling over. This is a brilliant foreshadowing of the films main theme of how every action has a reaction that leads to a specific outcome. It highlights the fact that everything is linked together, perfectly representing how the butterfly effect takes place and how every miniscule encounter can have a major impact on an individual's timeline. This is displayed when Lola passes by the side characters in the film and we are shown millisecond clips of their fore coming futures. The way the director chose to show us the future was portrayed in such an artistic and simple way that gave us the solid visual of the effect that would take place in their lives, and this was achieved in mere seconds through time lapse shots.\nWhile the dominos are toppling on the television screen Lola is seen to be shuffling through her mind desperately thinking of a person to seek help from. We see clips of the people Lola knows flash through her mind and finally fall on the image of her father, she utters the word papa and rushes out the door. Interestingly the image of her father comes to life and he gazes at her as she runs out the door then shakes his head in disapproval. The director is giving the viewer a hint of what is to come later in the film. Since later on in the film it is revealed that he is not her biological father after all and is unwilling to help her with her dilemma.\n \tThe movie is constantly engaging the viewer and keeping them at the edge of their seat by using the many techniques shown in the film. In many scenes we are shown clocks to express the urgency of time and a constant reminder of how Lola is running out of time to complete her task. Lola repeated the task three times and in each round there are slight variations in the details of her journey. For example, the third and final round is when Lola did not cross between the group of nuns, however, the first two rounds she ran right in-between the group of nuns. This is a very interesting small detail that the director added, which is an unconscious indication of Lola's faith in accomplishing her task. Moreover, during the final round the first side character Lola runs past is shown through the time lapse clips to have a future in which she enters into the faith and becomes religious. This only adds to the signs that Lola has developed faith in her mission for the last round. \nOverall, I found the film to be visually appealing and the plot to be very entertaining. I appreciated the subtle hints that connected the small encounters to the bigger picture and brought the story together. The beginning of the film starts with a clip of many people rushing to their everyday lives as it focuses on some of the characters shown in the film. This represents how many people you can cross by throughout your life without even realizing how that may affect you or them in the future and this is basically what the film was representing all along. Every small difference Lola made in each one of her three journeys not only affected her outcome, but also it is quite obvious that every other person in the film that interacted with Lola had a different outcome each time, no matter how minor the interaction was. The film helps us appreciate and be aware of the strangers we pass by and how the tiniest interaction could have a major effect on their day or even their life.",

            "content": "Run Lola Run: A World Without Boundaries\n\"Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? How do we know what we think we know? Why do we believe anything at all?\" These are the questions Tom Tykwer poses to the viewer in the beginning of his 1998 film, Run Lola Run, to set up a postmodern world that transgresses temporal and social architectures of confinement. The film has a game-like feel to it, with Lola as the player and the various men in the game, including Lola's father and her boyfriend, Manni, as the source of obstacles in the game. The 'game' begins when Lola gets a phone call from Manni, who desperately needs help. Earlier in the day, Manni loses a bag containing a hundred thousand German marks, which to Manni's despair, belongs to his murderous drug-dealer boss who needs the money in exactly twenty minutes. Driven by her love for Manni, Lola races against time to gather the money but gets shot on her first attempt. So, she goes back to where she started, but wiser than before, and tries again and fails again and then tries again and succeeds. Even though every attempt is essentially the same, a minor change in Lola's timing of her runs leads to three different outcomes, the last of which is a success.\nThese different outcomes that result from the same story reflect a fundamental consequence of postmodernism; there is no \"singular truth\" but a \"multiplicity of truths\" and \"different perspectives\" (McDonald). Through the film's plot that often switches between animation and reality; game and non-game, Tykwer makes it harder to identify what is true. And the creative mise-en-scene and energetic soundtracks used in the film further blur the line between real and unreal, which effectively illustrates a postmodern world in which \"no definite terms, boundaries, or absolute truths exist\" (Niles). Therefore, by using elements of form and content, Tykwer creates a postmodern world that allows him to transgress the temporal and social boundaries blocking our escape from the shackles of time and from the sexist gender roles imposed upon us by modernist society. \n\tTykwer sets up his postmodern world in the very beginning of Run Lola Run through provocative questions with no clear answer. The narrator ironically replies to these questions by saying, \"isn't it always the same question? And always the same answer?\" This ambiguous answer along with the fast-paced techno music that follows and the loud ringing of Lola's phone sets a chaotic mood that is characteristic of a postmodern world. The chaos of the situation only increases once the 'game' starts and Lola has to run to save Manni's life. The extra-diegetic techno music runs with Lola as she rushes down the streets of Berlin, and the rush of the situation becomes so extreme at times that Tykwer must use animations to reflect the urgency of the situation (Tykwer). \nHowever, the switch between animation and reality creates an increased sense of confusion and makes it harder to distinguish what is real from what is not. Sometimes the animation translates seamlessly into reality, however, the game-like nature of the situation makes the viewer uncertain of what is real. For example, an animation portraying Lola run down spiral stairs and trip on her way down translates to a limp in her run in real life (Tykwer). But the fact that Lola gets shot on her first attempt and comes back to life on her second makes the viewer question the truthfulness of what is presented, which is what Tykwer needs to establish a postmodern world with \"no definite terms, boundaries, or absolute truths\" (Niles).\nOnce Tykwer establishes this world, he is able to transgress temporal and social boundaries. The temporal boundary that forces us to rush our actions under the pressure of time is represented multiple times through the spiral motif. There is a spiral on the pillow Lola sleeps on, a spiral on the door in the animation, a spiral on the \"Spirale\" shop, and a spiral staircase (Tykwer). This motif symbolizes the endless spiraling of time; the endless rotation of the hands on a clock that, despite their cyclic movement, lead to different outcomes with every rotation. By creating a game-like experience, Tykwer breaks this endless spiral and allows Lola to repeat the same story and the same time frame more than once, thus transgressing the boundary of time. \nOn the other hand, to transgress the boundary created by modernist gender roles in society, Tykwer characterizes Lola as the player in a game where men are the source of the obstacles Lola must face to succeed. For instance, Lola must engage in a stressful race against time because of Manni's \"amateur\" way of handling the drug money and her father's reluctance to give her the money she needs to rescue Manni (Tykwer). Making men the source of the problem clearly transgresses the social boundary that often portrays women as the issue in society. And the fact that the female, Lola, must provide financial support for the male, Manni, reverses the modernist gender roles that dictate that males must provide for the females, which is once again a transgression of the boundary of gender roles and a rejection of the false consciousness which portrays women as unequal to men.\n\tIn conclusion, Run Lola Run is an excellent film that portrays postmodernism in a creative and thrilling way. Through Run Lola Run, Tykwer not only tries to entertain the viewer but also attempts to fight the endless spiraling of time that imprisons us and the sexist gender roles that hinder our societies' advancement. By using a game-like plot, creative mise-en-scene, and fast-paced music, Tykwer succeeds in creating a chaotic postmodern world that temporarily frees us from the social and temporal architectures of confinement present in our modernist societies today.",

            "content": "Being a critically acclaimed German action thriller with an unconventional structure, Run Lola Run sounded like it offered a combination of unconventional storytelling and different culture.\n\nOutside of films relating to Germany's involvement in the two world wars, I can't say that I have had much of an experience with German cinema. It's interesting to see a film like Run Lola Run because it is not heavily indebted to cultural values but is simply a German production attempting to be a stylish thriller. There is no denying that it succeeds at this.\nRun Lola Run immediately kicks off at an incredibly fast pace. Establishing the context of the entire story over the means of a single conversation, Run Lola Run sets up a simple story which paves the way for an alternative style of storytelling in which the viewer experiences very much the same story three times with key differences in small plot points upon each episode. The gimmick of the unconventional narrative structure in Run Lola Run is the gimmick that supports Run Lola Run's lasting value amid the overall simplicity of its main narrative. The concept in Run Lola Run revolves around just how much in life can change on the basis of the most insignificant occurrences. Protagonist Lola has 20 minutes to reach her boyfriend and ensure he has the appropriate finances to save his life, and each run is slightly different based on the experience she has with a tenant in her apartment block at the beginning of her run. This theme isn't explored through the topic of discussion, it is the entire staple of the narrative drive and is explored further through the many characters Lola encounters in her run which is revealed through the momentary flash of several snapshots before returning to Lola's path. The entire concept of the three-episode structure of the same story offers a brilliant twist on a smile story which paves the way for an exploration of style.\nThere isn't much substance in terms of character development or genuine dramatic depth for the majority of the film, but the manic pace of the experience helps viewers to keep distracted from this all. The soundtrack to Run Lola Run is a strong factor influencing its ability to consistently maintain atmosphere as the fast-paced beat remains steadily consistent over the course of the faster scenes of the film, pulling back to be subtler when the feature slows down to emphasize character drama. The entire film is a massive rush, and is very atmospheric in capturing this which manages to keep viewers deeply ingrained in the exhilaration and beauty of the experience. And with only 81 minutes of running time, the film definitely does not overstay its welcome.\nVisually, Run Lola Run has a very distinctive grace to it. Coming out during the era of the cinema du look movement in France, Run Lola Run seems to have the same sort of colour scheme popularized by that style of filmmaking. There is a light tint of white in everything which brightens up the experience and almost adds a sense of surrealism to the experience, reinforcing the zany nature of the story structure. There is also strong brilliance in the cinematography because it proves to keep up with Franka Potente's fast movements throughout all the scenery with a combination of extended shots and quick editing. As a result, Franka Potente is truly challenged to push her maximum athleticism into the part and it is captured with many smooth-gliding tracking shots and other techniques. Amid all this, the German scenery of Run Lola Run remains gorgeous and provides an enticing backdrop to the journey.\nAlso, the way certain shots of Run Lola Run are edited to cut frames out works a lot better than in Hollywood productions. Rather than overdoing the gimmick to speed things up beyond a state of visual comprehension, Run Lola Run mediates this technique so that it is only used sparingly. As a result, the brief bursts of speed brought on by this editing merely reinforce the exhilaration of Run Lola Run. Though I wouldn't exactly call it an action film, Run Lola Run's extended sequences of Lola's journey on foot are captured with such tenacious energy that it perfectly mirrors the frantic speed of the feature.\nAlthough characterization takes a back seat to style in Run Lola Run, the film is not bereft of character. Thanks to the power of Franka Potente's leading performance in the titular role, Run Lola Run carries a strong protagonist. Most of the film challenges her to prove her physical power in running long distances and maintaining a state of tension the entire time which she proves easily capable of. But between all the extended periods of sprinting are momentary glimpes of her character's insecurities and vulnerabilities. Franka Potente manages to find a real character in her role and captures some beautiful interactions with Moritz Bleibtreu. The entire reason Lola is running is for the love of her boyfriend Manni, and within the transition scenes between narrative episodes she has brief moments to convey the kind of connection the two share. They are very restrained in tension and focused simply on putting as much heart into their words as they can, and it creates some really wonderful character moments. Moritz Bleibtreu delivers an intense supporting effort, but with the limitations on his screen time there is only so much of an impact that he can make. The character potential of the narrative is all reliant on Franka Potente who easily delivers. Franka Potente has the appearance of a comic book character due to the rich colour of her attire and particularly her red hair which makes her easily a memorable character, but it's the physical and emotional ambition of her dedication that truly propels her to stardom.\n\nRun Lola Run may offer a simple story, but the innovation lies all in the brilliance of its narrative structure, themes and fast pace while Tom Tykwer's brilliant eye for imagery provides a spectacle for the talents of Franka Potente.",

Up to this point your whole life has been a lie. Mull over that a little bit. Up until you decided to read this work you were completely unaware that everything you had done until now had been fake and a perfidy. You are now free, and I feel not the least embarrassed to say \"You're Welcome!\" And no, this is not some Fight Club-esque bullshit this is the real, unadulterated truth, the kind that can be mainlined and lived off of for the rest of your life. \n\tYou see, it all started when I watched Tom Tykwer's seminal 1998 film Run Lola Run for the second time. I had watched it back in my uneducated darkness days when I was still a sheeple muddling through my undergrad days in a daze of frankly embarrassing unintellectual sump. I was so drowned in this troglodytic much that I was blind to the truth that was presented to me. I can only strive to make sure that this does not happen to anyone else.\n\tThe second time I viewed Run Lola Run, or should I say The Truth Incarnate, I had cleared enough of the blinding pseudo-reality from my eyes to allow my now enlightened self to be enwrapped by its chrysalis and emerge a full formed Monarch butterfly king, of all it sees and understanding of its reality. I had become aware of the one guiding truth that exists in this universe, Franka Potente's is playing the same character in this as she is in The Bourne Identity. It is only once you realize this for yourself, can you realize exactly what has been holding you back your entire life. It cannot be explained for you must realize it yourself.

I also love art house movies, especially euro cinema, its daring, full on, fresh, exciting. Although Run Lola Run has all of these traits, it suffers the biggest flaw a film could, what was the fuckin point? Lola gets a phone call from her hysterical boyfriend, explaining how a drug exchange for a gang leader, went right close to perfect, until he managed to lose the money, thus leaving Lola 20 minutes in which to make her way to him, hopefully sorting the problem out on route. No i'll try not to spoil it for those of you who have yet to see it but the films main problems are its highly predictable,  its visually inconsistant and morally has no idea what it wants to achieve. There are a bunch of small characters who the film feels the need to shoe horn in, just to show how different scenarios could alter their lives, okay, quirky but these characters are of no substance or interest and most of them have very little to do with the outcome of the film. Which is the biggest let down of any film, I've seen in quite some time. At first I was enjoying its quirky, quick cut, mixed approach, its flashy and fast paced, it contextually makes sense, however once Lola actually starts running, it becomes bogged down with far too much needless dialogue and moments that need not exist. There are messages dotted about here and there, about the couples life style and what would they do without each other but nothing every becomes of it, this is mainly down to the way in which the film decides to structure itself. It actually almost had me clapping half an hour in as i thought that the film makers may actually have the balls to completely do something so special new and completely unseen. But they pussy out, leaving you watching the same events, unfold time after time, only marginally different from the time before. It becomes a choir to watch and eventually turns completely stupid, defying all laws of physics and actual chance. The films like a preacher with no heart and soul. luckily the movie has at times a really lovely and polished look to it, the camera work is at times extremely well crafted and with the bouncing score over the top, it gives the film a pulse and a life. Then there are moments when either a completely different camera or grade is used for 1 scene, fine does it add anything? No, meaning that it doesnt asthetically look solid all the way through. I would have much rather had 1 of the first 2 insane options, fleshed out a bit more and dealt with a bit more care than the outcome we get. This film feels highly over rated, hugely dissapointing and hilarious, when it shouldnt be. Despite its major flaws, the film manages to throw enough at the viewer to keep them present and aware for a run time of 1 hour and 20 minutes but by the end you really would have rather it been a short film, tighter, more honed in and wonderfully crafted, than over bloated and flat.",

I tend to really enjoy movies that explore the whole butterfly effect idea, and this movie does it by showing the same events with only slight changes and then presents how dramatically that affects the path of the characters' lives. What's really interesting is they also show quick flashes of how the different interactions Lola has with bystanders also changes their lives. One of my big complaints, though, is that there isn't any consistency to who gets these flash-forwards on each run through. I generally prefer (in films of this style) for everything to be the same except for subtle differences, however in this film there are people that Lola doesn't even come in contact with from one time to the next. I also am a bit confused, because I'm not sure whether Lola is aware that she is reliving the 20 minutes or not. It seems there are some snippets of information she is carrying over from one time to the next, but it's just not clear. I guess I would simply like a more defined set of rules to the strange supernatural way the story is being told.\n\nThe acting is not at all consistent in Run Lola Run. Some actors are really great, and impress me with an emotionally nuanced performance, while others are flat and feel like they shouldn't even be acting in commercials. One example would be Franka Potente, because she has certain moments that impact me emotionally, and then later she's entirely too whiny in tone and lacks the confidence that I think they're trying to present in her character. However, despite the flaws I do find the story of the film engaging. I like that they present the entire thing in 3 distinct arcs, and some of the creative visuals they utilize are excellent. It's particularly interesting that each time they reset we are presented with a poorly drawn cartoon of the beginning of the run. I also like some of the split-screen techniques that increase the tension as time is quickly ticking away. Overall, the style of Run Lola Run kind of trumps the story-telling of the movie. I think they have a kernel of a great idea, but it never fully forms into a great film. It almost feels like there should be a director's cut somewhere that I'd enjoy more. A cut of the film which connects some of the side characters' stories we see in the first run-through but are left without on round 2 or 3. As it stands I'd watch Run Lola Run again, but it's not one that I feel warrants a recommend from me.",

It's as unique a film as you will ever see.\n\nThis uniqueness is hard to fully rationalize. The film is less than 80 minutes long. The plot plays like the climax of a full movie, repeated three times. The editing falls into montage mode every few minutes. There is an animation aspect that I still can't explain. It feels like Tom Tykwer, the director, learned a bunch of filmmaking techniques, then stuffed them all into the same movie. But is that really a bad thing? It can be distracting, and it can be unnecessary, but Run Lola Run benefits from all its eccentricities. Without them, there isn't much left.\n\nWhat the movie does right is simple, it keeps a ridiculously high level of kinetic energy throughout. The film never stops! It barely takes a moment of a breather before launching into another frantic scene. And yet, the narrative never gets exhausting, thanks to the brevity of the run-time. There's no denying that the story can be repetitive (it's the same scenario, played out three different ways), but the movie is succinct enough to withstand these flaws.\n\nThe film is bolstered by two dependable performances. Franka Potente (Marie from the Bourne trilogy) stars as Lola. A lot of the performance is relegated to sprinting through the streets of Berlin, but Potente proves herself as a solid lead. Moritz Bleibtreu has the main supporting role as Manni, Lola's boyfriend. He provides the finest acting in the movie.\n\nRun Lola Run is a neat concept film. It keeps things moving at a brisk enough pace to prevent any glaring flaws. But the story lacks substance and the characters lack development. At the end of the day, you won't remember the film two days after you see it, but it is certainly not a movie you will regret allotting an hour and twenty minutes of your time.\n\n\"Well, we all have our bad days.\" 6.5/10",

It's a fascinating plot about a guy who has lost a lot of money and contacts his girlfriend to help him. We get to see three different versions to it or in other ways how decisions and time can bring different outcomes. I like the way a lot of techniques were used to present the story. A very good film, starring Franka Potente (Creep, the Bourne trilogy) and M\u00f6ritz Bleibtreu (Das Experiment, Munich). The film was shot in Berlin.\n\nRed-haired Lola (Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Bleibtreu), who has just lost 100.000 DM, that he was bringing to a gangster, on a subway train. Manni is desperate and wants to rob a store to get the amount in time. Lola tells him to wait as she will do everything in her power to gain the money and meet up with him. With only 20 minutes on the clock, Lola will have to run for her life, Manni's life and their future...",

Lola takes the calls, she screams so loud with frustration things begin to break, this may suggests she is an outcast and different from what the \"norm\" is told to be.  He is in some sort of trouble and has lost 100,000 marks.  There is only twenty minutes to recover this lost fortune before he has to meet with his criminal boss.  Lola tells her boyfriend to wait for her, and frantically throws the phone. The intensity is obvious.  And then Lola runs.... without hesitation Lola runs to the bank her father works. Lola never stops, the streets of Berlin are busy, life around is moving, and Lola keeps moving. This man who Lola calls \"Papa\" refuses her money. She exits the bank and continues to run. During the course of her desperation and the twenty minutes coming near an end, Lola will face many obstacles.  She must find a way to save her love and fix the issue with the lost money. \nThis is where the story begins, and just when the viewer's believe the long, loud, busy movie comes to an end, it happens again. A different twist of events will happen, and then again. This movie has excellent music if you like loud raving techno; it ran parallel with the event taking place.  The editing was just as busy, the motion of slides cut at a rapid pace, defining the twenty minute allotment to collect the money. If you like to see a hundred different pictures at once, I can see how those who created the movie do this technique and why, it demonstrates the stress Lola is under, her mind is racing, she is racing, the movie keeps pace with the movement. The camera did clever work, but the motive with duplicating was confusing. The story line lacked detail, and even when the scenes changed, what was about to occur was totally predictable.  Many movies allow a build up for some the audience to connect with the casting characters. This movie did not offer choice. Like it or leave it! \nUsing a five star rating scale, I give Run Lola Run a 2. The acting was terrible and the actors lacked personality, however Lola did define the energy. The film accurately showed motion and the lighting was good. There were elements of the quality of the film that were present, for this I did not offer a one.  As any foreign film viewing, reading the subtitles with so much commotion really takes away from the enjoyment of watching.",

From there, Lola starts a journey in which she bumps into an aggressive mother, causes a car accident, is told some damning news by her father and causes havoc with a gun. When she fails her objective, she refuses to be defeated, and the film rewinds right back to the start, for her to try again.\nClearly influenced by films like Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting, and having an influence on the films of Edgar Wright, German director Tom Tykwer's 1998 thriller Run Lola Run is quite simply one of the most exciting, fast paced and imaginative thrillers of the nineties. From the opening animated title sequence, the long tracking shots of Lola's journey and the original flourishes (photo sequences show us the probable future of various characters Lola bumps into), Run Lola Run feels like it can't allow itself to slow down, and it practically never does. The camerawork is some of the finest you'll see, twisting, flying and practically gliding down the beautifully shot streets of Germany. Though there are a few grainy, handheld style shots which do jar when contrasted with the fantastic cinematography of Lola's scenes, the rest of the film is just gorgeous to look at, and when you discover the film was made for under $2 million, it's astounding to see what you can do when you have infinite talent, infinite creativity and infinite energy.\nWhile it is fair to say occasionally the running sequences do last too long and lose some of their energy, by the third go at success, you'll be on your seat. Director Tykwer knows how to make a dumb, fun thriller but he does manage to keep in a sense of the arthouse. What other action film features a character die and then flash to a long and cryptic bedroom conversation about love and death? Meanwhile, the use of the \"try again\" multiple versions of the same plot gives Tykwer the excuse to both have his cake and eat it; he's allowed to make a dark, complex indie flick with depressing outcomes and beloved character deaths, and still allow us to punch the air and cheer by the end, in which the puzzle perfectly falls into place and offers one of the most enjoyable final scenes of all time. All of these devices would be nothing without its titular star, but as the crimson haired, incredibly put-upon heroine of the piece, Franka Potente is brilliant. Later to be seen in The Bourne Identity, here she gives a performance that hits just about every note you could want her to hit; she's calm and intelligent when consoling Manni; completely despairing when her world begins to crash down; charming and loveable in the quieter, more romantic scenes; and simply a sheer badass when she takes matters into her own hands. Action cinema needs more kick-ass female leads like Potente in Run Lola Run, and she ranks right up there with Ellen Ripley and The Bride as one of the finest heroines in cinema.\nWith ultra kinetic visuals, a blackly comic and often very sad script, plenty of top notch action and a pitch perfect leading performance from Potente, Run Lola Run is one of the most insane thrill rides in all of action cinema, and fifteen years on from its original release, it's still as exciting, imaginative as influential as ever.",

The soundtrack is pulsing and helps to drive this film as the main character runs through the streets of Berlin in order to save her boyfriend. As the story progresses, it regresses back to the start, like a video game when the character dies. However, this time the outcome changes slightly depending on the choices made and ultimately, to the final conclusion.",

And I absolutely loved all of it.\n\nRun Lola Run is about a girl who's boyfriend lost a 100 000 marks (it's German) and has to get the money back. The films goes through three alternate endings.\n\nDespite its short runtime (1h 16m) the film covers each question left open while adding humour, action and tension. The film is well made. I especially love most of the transitions between shots.\n\nI believe Twyker as done a remarkable job with the film\n\nTo see more of my reviews go to thatonewebsite.tumblr.com",

The strange quirky visuals are entrancing, as are the strange quirky performances. Lola is a character you are rooting for, even when she makes a wrong decision. But the film allows her to go back and try to make the right decision with a series of what if scenarios. It was fascinating how the slightest change in action created a different path for herself and everyone around her. I recommend this fast-paced and entertaining yet highly thought-provoking film.",

It's one of those movies that tells the same story a few times but this time it;s through the same character and if she didn't one thing differently it would change everything. It was cool how it pointed out that if you change one little thing in a journey your whole future can be changed. It kept your interest the whole time, it's such a fun film to watch. I really enjoyed it, even though it was in German with english subtitles that didn't bother me. Run Lola Run is one the best thrillers I've seen in awhile, nonstop thrills with awesome music. A very fun movie to watch, not a thriller to pass by.",
