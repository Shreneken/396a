Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unexplainable.",

            "content": "The mysterious and thrilling movies get the audience to itch their heads, especially M. Night Shyamalan's movies, as he blows their minds with his mysterious masterpieces. In The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan opens the movie with Dr. Malcolm, a therapist, celebrating his work with his wife. During the celebration party, an intruder breaks into the house and accuses Dr. Malcolm of failing to treat him; eventually, he shoots him and ends his own life. The following fall, Malcolm observes a boy named Cole. The journey starts with Malcolm trying to approach Cole to help him in honor of the intruder who killed himself in Malcolm's house. On the other hand, Cole is not performing well in school and has had his mom and teachers see his strange actions, making him feel worse. One day, Cole gets bullied at a birthday party and thrown in a locked room in a horrific scene ending in the hospital. On the other side, Malcolm feels his wife is ignoring him and tries to get closer to her but gets no opportunity as if he is not there. In the hospital, Cole confesses his condition to Dr. Malcolm, which was the plot twist in the movie. After that, Malcolm finds a way to help Cole, which they start applying. Finally, Cole confesses his condition to his mother in an emotional scene, and Shyamalan shocks the audience by showing a scene explaining Dr. Malcolm's case. \n   As the movie shocks the audience with its theme and events, it also carries hidden messages. Shyamalan has had his signature on many paranormality-themed movies; Signs, The Visit, and The Sixth Sense. In this movie, he mastered the art of paranormality, mystery, and thrill. Through his two main characters and focusing on their lives, Shyamalan succeeds in planting a value in them in the audience's minds. The steady and perfect development in their stories makes the audience interact more with them. Smartly, Shyamalan deceives the audience\ninto seeing and believing what he wants. Scott Essman, a writer-producer, comments on the movie that the audience rewatched the movie many times because they could not believe how fooled and deceived by the director they were; he made them think the story is about one character while it is all about the other one. Throughout the movie, the director delivers many messages that talk about the concept of life and death. He shows how some people take their lives for granted and sheds light on the importance of not giving up. Cole's story shows the\nimportance of appreciating life, where people should focus more on what they have than what they do not. People should be grateful for everything and live truthfully before it is late. Through Malcolm's story, the audience learns not to give up and always look after the mistakes they make to never fall into them again. Moreover, when people face situations where they are mistaken, they should be brave the next time they face a similar one and be prepared to solve the problem, not escape it, just like Malcolm did.\n   The Sixth Sense is a movie that will forever be in the minds of its audience due to the impact that it could leave, yet it had some flaws in the details of some of its scenes. As one of the audience, I see no sense in some scenes. When Cole's mother was trying to help him, people were looking at her with no effort of going and getting the keys to the door. Such flaws were repeated a couple of times in the movie. It also could have been better if the director focused on having more first-point-of-view scenes because that could add more tension and thrill to the\nmovie. Nevertheless, I still see The Sixth Sense as a masterpiece that people should have on their to-watch lists because of its plot line, plot twists, and outcomes. I have watched it more than five times and still see new things I never saw before. So, it is a 5/5",

The acting in this film is beyond excellent and raw from the performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette. The costume designs were very nuanced with the subtly. The writing by M. Night Shyamalan was carefully constructed and the build-up he mad was simply wonderful. His direction throughout the entire film was just brilliant and marvelous from beginning to end. The attention to detail that M. Night Shyamalan brings to the table is beyond this world with the imagery and the world-building is so artistic. The Sixth Sense gives you the raw emotion of the fear of life, the fear of what's ahead, the fear of letting go, and fear itself. The Sixth Sense reflects on asking eternal questions as well such as love, commitment, and (as it was stated before) life. In simple terms, The Sixth Sense is such a fantastic and artistic film.",

At the beginning of the movie there are a few paranormal activities that happen that really help set the tone for the rest of the movie. We see our first dead person about halfway through the movie which is where everything starts to change. It is not often that a movie about ghosts and talking to dead people can so perfectly help a child watching this movie. I think that the message of this movie is not to run away from things that you or others may see as your own imperfections but instead learn to embrace them and learn from them. The movie has a lot of graphic scenes that may be hard for young children to watch and there is a lot of suspense throughout the movie especially near the end, though I found that the ending was amazing. The twist is something I never knew was coming but as it was an M. Night Shyamalan movie I had a feeling that there was going to be something that shocked me at the end. The other message of this movie is to learn to let go, we see this through Bruce Willis' character who seeks to help out a child due to the fact that he wasn't able to help one earlier in his life. Instead though we see him and the child help eachother. This was a very heartwarming film which I would highly recommend to people just due to the fantastic performance of Haley Joel Osment as Cole alone. The child actor did fantastic and made me and I'm sure many other people really feel something throughout the course of this movie. The line \"I see dead people\" is still chilling and his monologue is only something that you cannot help but look back at when the truth about this movie is revealed.",

I love the way the movie was filmed. It's not overly saturated or too dark to force a certain tone or mood. It's filmed as is, which is great. Osment was the star of the show. It's almost surreal how skilled of an actor he was even as a child. It's almost like he's not human, like he's an adult in a child body. Terrific acting from everyone. Good editing as well. I love the switch to handheld camera during the breakfast scene with Cole and his mom. Really gives off that documentary-like feel to it.\n\nPoor kid, he probably gets bullied wearing those oversized glasses. I feel for Cole. Can you imagine being a kid and having to deal with all that terrifying and confusing stuff? Why do they have metal music playing at a kids birthday party? That was unexpected and hilarious at the same time. That kid with the back of his head blown out got me. I was not expecting that.  \n\nIn a way, Cole is kind of like a ghost whisperer, a therapist for spirits. Helping them to move on to the next life. Both a beautiful and a cursed gift. Omg I can't believe the mother of that girl was poisoning her the whole time! That's crazy. The question is, but why though? Was the mother doing it because she's evil? Like what was the reason behind her poisoning her daughter? And wow, the build up to that twist ending was wonderfully crafted. That's spooky how the Spanish phrase, \"I don't want to die\", is repeated after the credits roll. Leaves you with a pretty haunting feeling. \n\nEven though it deals with ghosts and spirits, it's a very human movie. It's actually quite beautiful the whole story and it's message. There's this certain sense of uneasiness at times that feels like a jump scare can happen at any moment, but it doesn't. The movie does a really good job at restraining itself from that which is a breath of fresh air since there's so many horror movies that abuse the jump scare to the point where it becomes stale and gimmicky. I noticed there's a good amount of shots of statues throughout the movie as well. Maybe reminding us of how the past can still linger even in the present. The movie has its chilling and spooky moments, but at the center lies an endearing and somewhat beautifully human drama about acceptance, loss, learning to let go, and the importance of finding help as well as helping others. Overall, a very solid well-crafted drama/thriller that deserves to be watched again.",

            "content": "The twist that everyone knows has now reached me, a self-declared \"film expert\". Even people who haven't seen The Sixth Sense have heard of the mindfuck moment par excellence. I managed to avoid what is probably the most spoiled movie scene in history for 21 years and all I can say is, I was still completely caught by this twist. The concentration was so much on not missing the decisive moment that the story of a child therapist who helps a child who, according to his own statements, can see dead people, got a bit lost.\n\nYet no end of homage should be paid to the acting performances in this film. Bruce Willis embodies the child therapist Malcolm Crowe, for once a completely different role than what one we are used to from him. No stubborn anti-heroic action hero, but an empathetic workaholic who supports his young patients with everything he has. This has a negative effect on his private life and especially on his relationship with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams), who often sees herself as second best because of Malcolm's iron will to work. Crowe is, on paper, the protagonist of the film. After the initial focus is more on him, he makes room for the real star of the story as the film progresses. The then nine-year-old Haley Joel Osment delivers one of the most profound and authentic performances of any child actor as the psychologically damaged outsider Cole. Mysterious at the beginning, for a long time you don't know what demons haunt this boy and why he behaves the way he does. Only through the later realisation that Cole can communicate with the dead do we understand him better and are immediately fascinated by him. The second half of the film de facto belongs to him alone and we accompany Cole on his way to no longer be afraid of his illusions, but rather to engage with them and find a coherent way of dealing with this \"curse\". Director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to stage this unorthodox character, who doesn't conform to any clich\u00e9s of children in films, in such a way that as a viewer you always d'accord with Cole's slightly absurd behaviour. A perfect complement to Cole's life is Toni Collette as his mother Lynn. She raises her son alone and struggles to understand how to relate to his weird and unpredictable ways. This strain affects her so much in many parts of the film that Collette is often called upon in emotional breakdown scenes, which she handles fantastically. Quite a great portrayal of grief and the desperate search for logic.\n\nIf you don't know the twist of The Sixth Sense, the film still provides the big bang despite its advanced age. The question is rather whether you should watch Shyamalan's breakthrough work at all if you already know the twist. The mere fact that Willis appears in a different role than usual, Osment and Collette deliver their best career performances to date, and the two protagonists have very amicable chemistry makes the film worth a watch. It's also an atmospheric thriller, peppered with trippy horror elements, that manages to generate an insane amount of tension. Top directing, minimalist but great music and a terrific final punchline!",

Night Shyamalan's breakthrough film catapulted him in to the big leagues of directing, and also brought a new voice into the mystery/psychological thriller genre. Revolving the story around a young boy who sees dead people, the film could have easily been a horror film or one that is a psychological drama. But more or less, this is an excellent drama first, diving into the mentality of the young boy (played amazingly by Haley Joel Osment), his mother who struggles with raising him (a fantastic performance from Toni Collette), and the psychologist that helps the young boy (a revered and surprisingly subdued performance from Bruce Willis). Its a movie that has some scary scenes here and there, but the gist of the story is propelled by the excellent tone and atmosphere brought to life by M. Night and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. Its a dark and dreary film, mixed in with this coldness that you rarely find in PG-13 horror films. Also, you can't talk about this film without referring to the plot twist and literal red herring's that happen through out the film. Its quite an amazing feat for a young director, to establish a film full of small details that the viewer must be keen on noticing while watching. It makes for a much more attuned viewer and creates a sense of purpose to each and every scene. An excellent thriller that sparked a wave of copy cat films and inspirations.

Night Shyamalan directs this movie beautifully and paired it with the phenomenal performances of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette. The color scheme, tempo, and suspense of this film is truly remarkable. Plus, it does not rely on cheap scares by ghosts to provide horror, but on the story to strike fear in the audience and provide scenarios so much more frightening than any jump scare. Also, the twist ending everyone is talking about is extremely brilliant, and even makes the second viewing better. This movie is a classic piece of cinema every film fanatic must see. For that, I give \"The Sixth Sense\"... 5 stars.",

When I started watching, I thought it would be a horror and nothing else, being ready to say how overrated this movie is and how I don't believe that anyone likes it, but, the further the plot got, the more amazed I got. I only saw in the end of this film that it was directed by Shyamalan and I was shocked, as right now there is barely anything good coming from that director. As well as Bruce Willis, who right now is not an A tier actor anymore. This film is an emotional ride, as it makes you sad, happy, amazed and scared. I found myself actually scared because of the jumpscares, even though I understood they were coming, they worked really well. They were not screams, they were just people, dead people. Such intense moments help the viewer understand what the main hero could have felt while seeing a dead person. Music is outstanding, as it makes for the greatest part of the film's experience, but actors are even better. This is Bruce Willis's best performance ever, in my opinion. The thrilling part of the movie is outstanding, as you never know what is coming next and you never believe in what you have just seen. The whole plot leads you into creating theories and making countless questions, which is what I consider a good film. The ending is the best part of the film, as it comes to the logical conclusion and it is a massive emotional explosion. It is very good and I have actually cried in the end. There are countless allegories that could be made out of this end and one of them related to me really well, which is why I believe that this ending is one of the best movie endings ever made. This is a true must watch for anyone, this movie is already cult, which is amazing, in my opinion. Honestly one of the best thrillers I have ever watched, which is why I adore this movie so much. A definite 10/10, I wish I could have even gave it more, because this is a film that actually got me touched and made me judge this film by what I felt, not by my standard criteria. Astonishing, amazing, incredible -- there is not enough words to describe my experience while watching this film.",

She doesn't acknowledge him at all and that seemed too weird to me. Then that continued for the entire film, nobody but the kid was ever aware of Malcolm's presence so I became certain I was right. And by the time I got to the big reveal, I was just like \"yeah, got it.\" And then the movie ends. Like I said, it's not bad. It's just not nearly as great as the ratings it gets.

But one of the best things about the pic is the strong chemistry between Bruce Willis and young Haley Joel Osment. It deeply explores child anxiety, as well as life and death. And that surprise ending just had me startled as hell. What's even more fascinating about The Sixth Sense is that it wasn't far from a directorial debut, and makes M. Night Shyamalan a credible and talented director. Overall, it's a great horror pic and a must see for anyone. Recommended!!",

            "content": "For a film named one of the best 100 of all time by AFI this film has come to be fairly reviled in recent years as M. Night Shyamalan's filmography after this breakout hit has been largely disappointing. I have to say that I can't quite see what all the fuss is about as beyond the twist the film has little to say about the impact of grief upon people's lives or the struggles of being an emotionally repressed child. Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment turn in splendid performances but Bruce Willis gives an odd performance as the lead and some of his odder mannerisms leave us feeling emotionally detached from him. Certainly not one of the best films of all time and not one of the five best of 1999 this film's popularity surprises me.\n\nChild psychologist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis, is assigned to work with the troubled Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment, who is socially inept and isolated from those around him including his caring mother Lynn, Toni Collette. Crowe and Sear grow close and Crowe confesses that he is experiencing difficulties in his personal life as his wife Anna, Olivia Williams, will not talk to him and he feels that he has failed a previous patient who shot him and non-fatally wounded him. One day Sear confesses that he sees ghosts and while initially skeptical Crowe comes to believe him and encourages him to come to terms with his abilities and use them to do good. With some hesitation Sear adapts and he and his mother grow close when he reveals that he is regularly visited by his grandmother. Meanwhile Crowe recognizes that something is amiss in his own life and comes to accept who he is and the mistakes he has made.\n\nWhat could have been an interesting dissection of a selfish man who learns to appreciate his wife after losing everything turns into a film more interested in cheap scares involving vomiting young women and voices on the other side of the wall. The greatest scares in the film do not come from these scenes but a scene in which we learn that a young woman has become a victim of her mother's desperate attempts to keep her ill. The idea of a controlling and mentally troubled parent getting away with the murder of her child is truly scary and the brief scene we get of a grieving father realizing his wife's deception is both emotionally devastating and genuinely fearsome. We would all be shocked if a family member we loved and trusted was found to have done something like this and almost gotten away with it. Having a ghost in your tent is much less likely and because the ghosts do not represent some deeper fear as would be true in a better film therefore we aren't afraid on an internal level of this threat.\n\nWillis gives one of the strangest performances I have seen in a horror movie as we get all of his usual tricks, the self-satisfied smirk in particular, but he makes choices that seem far to big for the register that this film is working at. He is relatively convincing in early scenes as a man who can no longer connect to his wife and a professional with a world of regret for his previous conduct but as soon as he meets Osment there is an artifice in his work that makes us resistant to him. We are meant to see this story through his eyes but I found myself not knowing who Crowe was and in scenes that were meant to inform us of who he is, he tries to guess facts about Sear's childhood from across a room to earn his trust, I just felt uncomfortable. There needed to be so much more there as he was facing off against actors as strong as Olivia Williams and Collette. His leading ladies blow him off the screen as William's is effective at being distant and icy while Collette makes the most of her big showcase scenes in which she tries her hardest to get through to her son. Osment made his name with this film and he is beguiling as the precocious young man who stands back in wonderment at his own abilities while remaining emotionally detached from the situations he is presented with.\n\nI would not recommend this film despite strong supporting performances as I was never fully drawn in by the horror or the emotional drama.",

But I think his is so particularly specific that he cannot help carve that piece of pie in a slow sensual way. That delicate touch. It is important to him. Important for exploring a sensitive subject as such. Accepting your fate. What you are. And it is something that everyone finds it difficult to go through. And it is also something everyone has to go through. Now the reason why people find the experience difficult or horrifying, if I may, is for the obvious element of surprise. Ergo, the writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan's debut horror film isn't just a drama or a horror but also mysterious.\n\nThe suspense is exhaustingly intense. You'll be sweating. And a huge amount of credit goes to the emotion that shadows each characters and the performance that overshadows that very content. And in lead, Haley Joel Osment is the surprise package whose empowering bursts are nuanced and jaw dropping. For instance, when he runs away from the situation or the condition he is trapped in, a kid is to, has to express his fear.\n\nAnd mixed with his fear, the pseudo effect is him tearing down, sobbing with the expected fear, the awareness of the tragedy he is doomed to live with. Maybe that is why he is the hero of this tale. He has already accepted his fate. He is ahead of other characters. All he is doing, is waiting for them to catch up, along with us, the audience. And is also why he is sensible and mature considering his age. The Sixth Sense has all five senses heightened up for the cinematic experience, awareness, fear, acceptance, medicinal help and communication. A key for a good socially functional family that our protagonist is about to start.",

Night Shyamalan, and stars Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear and Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe.\n\nThe Story follows a man named Dr. Malcolm Crowe as he try's to rebuild is reputation after an incident involving him and one of his old patients. He try's to rebuild his reputation by getting a new patient and trying to cure him (Cole) of his problems. The story I found to be intriguing and gripping, especially in the third act with Cole and Malcolm. \n\nThe acting I personally found to be really strong, especially Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear. Normally I find children actors to either be too emotionless or just over the top, but luckily Haley Joel Osment gave an emotional and realistic performance.\n\nThe characters in my opinion were portrayed and written really well, especially the relationship between Cole and Dr. Malcolm Crowe.\n\nThe cinematography was very strong, with some really good and stylistic shots of the characters.\n\nThe style of the film I personally found was great, from the direction to M. Night Shyamalan's signature twist.\n\nThe makeup and practical effects were also very strong, especially one scene involving Cole and Malcolm in a school corridor.\n\nThe musical score for the film is now one of my all time favourites, from the instrumentals to the atmospheric vibes it gives off.\n\nThe atmosphere is hands down some of the best I've ever seen in a film to date, especially in the second and third act.\n\nThe film I found also dealt with emotions incredibly well, especially one scene involving Dr. Malcolm and his wife.\n\nOver all I give it a\n10/10\n\nOne of my all time favourites",

Night Shyamalan gives what is probably his best twist in a movie ever, that really flows well with the story and makes sense in the overall world that he has built. The score by James Newton Howard is so, so good and it really resonates the overall tone and feel of the movie. Haley Joel Osment did a great job as a child actor and he didn't feel out of place at all. Overall, The Sixth Sense is just a really good thriller with a great twist and a great overall narrative.",

            "content": "A mindbender from M. Night.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller The Sixth Sense (1999) is a timeless classic deep in empathy for those suffering from mental illness, depression, grief, or pain. It remains perhaps M. Night's greatest film up there with Unbreakable. The Sixth Sense is tender to its characters, while shocking to its audience.\n\nM. Night's direction has all the style of a killer suspense film with the thread work of a gripping thriller. You are constantly asking questions that all get answered. The Sixth Sense is simply one of the most satisfying films ever directed as it contains so much setup and payoff of meticulous details. Once you understand what the plot is, you can even go back and revisit The Sixth Sense to reveal all the hints that M. Night laid for you. The cinematography is so sleek and every frame is focused in on the characters and their facial reactions. The Sixth Sense is as finely honed as films get.\n\nM. Night's script starts out as a family drama that delves into what marriages need in order for husbands and wives to be happy, but further expands into the minds of children. The Sixth Sense takes place both from the perspective of a married man, but also a child experiencing his parents' divorce and the pain that separation has caused him. M. Night is clever enough to explore further still with a twist for the ages.\n\nJames Newton Howard's creepy score is as haunting as M. Night's script and direction. Howard composes a chilling atmospheric score to accompany all the suffering and scares within The Sixth Sense. There is so much to love with how subtle Howard's music is for The Sixth Sense.\n\nBruce Willis is phenomenal as a child psychologist desperately trying to communicate and relate to his young patient. Willis displays a sincere sympathy for this boy that is rare in Willis' filmography. His quiet pondering and emotional distress is so apparent that it makes you wonder what M. Night told Willis to make him act so tenderly and affectionate. The Sixth Sense contains Willis' best acting alongside another M. Night masterpiece Unbreakable. Willis showed up for The Sixth Sense and portrays one of cinema's greatest characters as Malcolm Crowe.\n\nLikewise, Toni Collette is outstanding as the depressed and uncertain, but kindly mother Lynn Sear. Collette's display of longing to be rid of her husband, acknowledgement from her mother, and affection or understanding from her son is awe inspiring. Collette feels like a real mother in The Sixth Sense. You can relate to her and sense her fears. She is just so good!\n\nI must mention Haley Joel Osment is a revelation of empathetic and nuanced acting from a young child actor as Cole Sear. Osment's ability to portray a boy suffering and struggling features such complex emotional range that comes across the screen so deeply that you would think he had been acting for years prior to The Sixth Sense. He has such an intriguing chemistry and friendship with Willis. He clearly liked and idolized him, but played his character at a distance on purpose. Haley Joel Osment gave the performance of a lifetime in The Sixth Sense.\n\nAdditionally, I adored Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe in The Sixth Sense. Her sullen dejection is impression and heartbreaking.\n\nLastly, I would like to give a special commendation to Donnie Wahlberg in The Sixth Sense as a troubled former patient to Willis named Vincent Gray. The second he appears on screen, he takes your breath away with fear and staunch terror. He is hypnotizing in his brief role so much so that Wahlberg's presence is felt throughout The Sixth Sense. His is one of the best movies scenes in cinema history.\n\nIn all, The Sixth Sense perseveres as the most memorable twist in movie history, or at least, up there with the best. But more than a great twist is the surrounding thriller that keeps you on edge and gripped on suspense. M. Night completely captures you in his dreamy atmosphere and film noir style.",

The ending is one of the best twists I have seen because not only do you not expect it but it gives you a reason to watch it again and the second time you view it the way you view the movie is totally different and I gotta commend Shyamalan for that. I have not seen every single one of Bruce Willis's films but from what i have seen this is his best performence yet and Haley Joel Osment is also really good, not just for his age but in general he is fantastic. This movie also plays with your mind a bit if you don't know the twist and that is just genius writing. Overall this is a great movie that is suspenseful and clever but it isn't without its flaws however. Since Bruce Willis's character Malcolm is a ghost how does he know that Cole was at the hospital? He was not there when Cole passed out and he has no one contact with to know because no one besides Cole can see him and talk to him so that is a head scratcher to me. Despite that I highly recommend you check this movie out",

Bruce Willis was just ok. Did whatever was needed for the story. Nothing spectacular, to be honest.\n\nThe story's concept was actually surprisingly well realized for me. The movie managed to show what's his day to day life is like with his extraordinary condition. I could really put myself in my shoes, and immediately realize that \"holy fuck, that is absolutely insane and thank goodness that shit's not possible\". It was scary and at the same time endlessly sad.\n\nI liked how the story progressed and built itself up slowly, each section of the movie making sense in light of the previous ones. It had a nice stable pace and trajectory. The thing that kinda craps on it all is the insanely abrupt and out of nowhere ending. It just fucking fades to white and then immediate ending credits. No time for any emotions to sink in. Just kind of hastily tied.\n\nThe music was pretty much unnoticeable. The camerawork on the other hand was feeling very much alive and organic. It just felt good.\n\nEnjoyed this well enough, things mostly worked. Good movie. Would've definitely enjoyed it more if it wasn't the world's most spoiled movie.",

Bruce Willis's character must help him to overcome this problem.\n\nThe Sixth Sense was a great start for director M. Night Shyamalan. Not only that, but this film is what introduced me to psychological horror. From the very well directed imagery, to the sense of being followed or chased.\n\nThe chemistry between the two actors was an enthralling storyline to watch. Their acting was good also.\n\nIt is packed with twists and turns that are unexpected, making the movie almost unpredictable. This is what turned it into a thriller. For me, saying that this is 'good' is a bit of an understatement. I absolutely adored it. \n\nOver all, The Sixth Sense was great when I saw it, but it got even better when I thought about it more, which is absolutely brilliant. 5/5 stars",

But this movie doesn't really need to be scary, it's different. It has creepiness to it but once you find out what was actually going on, it kinda effects your emotions. One scene in the movie was really scary to me but then once I found out what it was I suddenly wasn't scared anymore. My emotions changed. I'm pretty sure everyone knows the plot twist in the movie and I even knew it before I watched it but I won't spoil it for anyone who doesn't. If you watch this movie without knowing the plot twist, it will be an even greater movie. I definitely recommend this movie and it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. A",

Night Shyamalan's may be the downbeat responsible for the deluge of twist endings that eventually consumed his - now infamous - filmography. However, what \"The Sixth Sense\" also does outside of its game-changing final reveal is simply tell a compelling story. In fact, the plot threads and characters in play are so frightfully addicting to watch that I knew full well what the twist was going in and I still had an unmitigated blast seeing everyone get to that final, cathartic revelation. This is a rich, jet black study of death and the macabre, the dangers of psychological trauma and isolation, the raw power behind human regret and reconciliation, and how all the aforementioned thematic devices can influence one another in life. It really is a carefully-constructed, laser-focused achievement in cinematic storytelling, with a stunning collection of lead performances (especially from that of young Haley Joel Osment) and, yes, a wallop of an ending. Make no mistake though, this didn't make over a half of a billion dollars because of its final two minutes. Indeed, with \"The Sixth Sense,\" it's all about the journey. For me, the destination, seems like a footnote in comparison to all the beauty at hand throughout this one.",

Sure, there are plenty of good things about The Sixth Sense, but I can't help but think without the famous twist, this movie would have been just your average thriller.\n\nBeing a huge film fan, it was always hard admitting that I haven't seen M. Night Shyamalan's \"masterpiece\", The Sixth Sense.  But because I've known the twist for years now, I had a difficult time mustering up the motivation to watch a film knowing its ending.  I can't stand knowing endings going into the viewing experience.  With that said, there are a lot of things about this film that are good, so I'm mad at myself for taking so long.  But also keeping that in mind, I hardly believe this film was best picture quality, nor deserves to be on \"all-time great\" lists.\n\nBesides the twist, The Sixth Sense is perhaps most notable for being the coming out party for Haley Joel Osment, who plays a child with the ability to see and speak to the newly perished.  He, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis are the best things about this film.  The performances alone make it worth the price of admission, with Collette being the clear standout for me.  And Willis perhaps hasn't given as good of a performance since.\n\nThe problem for me is that knowing the twist going in really tramples any sort of enjoyment I had.  The \"thrills\" weren't all that thrilling and the plot seemed to never truly pick up pace until it was too late.  That falls on the shoulders of Shyamalan and his directing.  I feel like people were so enthralled with the late-game revelation, that they forgot how plotting the first hour and a half feels.  There's a lot here I liked, but it's nowhere near the high praise that people give it.\n\n+Performances carry the film\n\n+Emotional connection is felt towards the end\n\n-Plot drags\n\n-No re-watchability\n\n6.4/10",

M Night Shayamalan uses a vast variety of creative movie techniques to give the audience the chill of horror. Bruce Willis's performance was good but the highlight of the movie has always been Haley Joel Osment. One factor that I wasn't amused was that the director decided to explain everything to the audience rather than leaving clues behind for the audience to think about it. I loved this movie but but this mediocre score stay this way because of everyone who decided to spoil this movie to me.",

He went a bit overboard after making this thriller masterpiece The Sixth Sense, which he made his directorial name clear after introducing a compelling story with breathtakingly rich scenes, fantastic performances and characters with an overall atmosphere that isn't particularly scary but at least a little chilling. His other films are another story we'll get to later, but The Sixth Sense is one of the most intriguing horror films of all time.\nDr. Malcolm Crowe, an esteemed child psychologist, helps a young boy, Cole Sears, who hauntingly reminds him of a previous patient, Vincent, who grew up to become mental and shoot Malcolm. Malcolm, a year later, helps Cole mainly to comprehend Vincent's similar problem. Cole reveals that he sees chilling images of ghosts and Malcolm must help him confront them and a challenging social and at home life suffering from a complex parental divorce. The Sixth Sense is particularly known for its surprisingly twist ending - for the record, I didn't know about the ending unlike many walking into the movie and I'm glad I didn't.\nThe Sixth Sense is extraordinary. Willis' character is almost comforting himself to the viewer and Osment portrays his character in such an realistic manner at such a young age. The story is compelling and some scenes were literally breathtaking - for example, the scene where Cole first confronts a ghost adds a sense of genuine curiousity and sympathy for the fear of the character. The story has been done a few times before but adds so many nicely done twists that makes it unique from the other paranormal films before it. Some future films like Paranormal Activity tend to feed off of some elements from The Sixth Sense and fail for the most part. The Sixth Sense is an all around fantastic thriller and is the epitome of a chilling film, not a ridiculously overdone horror. The Sixth Sense is particularly significant in its genre and in pop culture in its entirety - it paved the way for a genre that captured many filmgoers and introduced them to an all new kind of fear. Let's try to forget about the other M. Night movies while we're at it...",

It is thrilling and interesting all the time, isn't super fasted paced but holds your attention, and even though it's not really scary, it's use of music and seeing the characters breath when there's a dead person around gets our excitement up and gets us focused on every little detail waiting for him/her to walk out from around the corner.  It's very well done, erie, creepy at times, and very well thought out.  The ending is great, how we find out Malcolm has been dead the whole time, which is why Cole can see him, why his wife doesn't talk to him, why he can't open certain doors, how he figured out how to make them all go away.

Yes, \"The Sixth Sense\" is a good flick, but it's not a great one. The style is shifts between awkward and opaque and while the twist from the end is an inspired one, the story itself feels forced and artificial, feels like the work of someone who is trying too much.\n\nYet, I can't deny the film has its moments of  tension and sheer emotion and, even with its aforementioned flaws, it manages to be engaging.

It's confidently directed by Shyamalan, and the central performances by Willis and Osment are terrific. It's not without flaws, and some of the things in the film do not quite work.

It is not his first film but the first thriller that he made which ended up being the genre that he would keep going on to make movies for. I'm not saying he went on to become a great writer and director though. But The Sixth Sense could very well be the best thriller of all time and is definitely the best ghost movie. Shyamalan and stars Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette were nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this movie. The screenplay was excellent with lots of suspense and an unexpected surprising twist. It was a well chosen cast and director M. Night Shyamalan gets the best out of his actors making this a spooky must-see movie that'll surprise you, scare you, shock you, and give you chills. My score for The Sixth Sense is 80%.",

Night Shyamalan's one and only true masterpiece: The Sixth Sense, i waited awhile to try and watch it (though fearing my hate for the director's later work killing his identity would make me hate this). But when i FINALLY did see it, I was blown out of my mind. It is a masterpiece, in every shape or form. The actors (mainly Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment) did FANTASTIC, the atmosphere was brilliant, the intrigue and mystery kept me going, the tone was set perfectly MATURE, the score was amazing, the twist was unexpected, the cinematography and direction can't even be described, I COULD GO ON AND ON! IT IS THAT GOOD! Though little issues like some of the acting, and even at times the director's future trademarks even show itself in some scenes, The Sixth Sense is a movie that will stand the test of time, and will continue to show the potential M. Night had before sucking.",

            "content": "Watching this movie made me feel the passion for films that I have to this day. Haley Joel Osment as a young boy who sees ghosts may just be one of the most chilling and well done performances ever put to film. Yet despite this, Bruce Willis is not overshadowed due to his mentor-like status over Osment and he too shows off a great range of acting capabilities - proving to everyone that he is not an action movie one-trick pony. Shyamalan gives everyone a chance to shine in The Sixth Sense as his sublime screenplay cater towards character development and embodiment. Toni Collette in particular, does not even feel like an actress as I watch her in the role of a single mother looking after Osment - her love, concern, and fright for him is apparent in every scene she is in. James Newton Howard's fantastic score remains consistently tense and riveting, leading to an explosive payout in the grand finale. What makes The Sixth Sense so magical is that: The first viewing, you see it through the eyes of the audience. The second viewing, you see it through the eyes of the filmmaker. Noticing little easter eggs and hints is what gives this movie such a repeatability factor, much like in Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere during this film is fantastic due to Shyamalan's superb direction - never letting the audience experience either far end of the relaxation/scare spectrum, whilst always keeping our concentrations focused and being on-edge. This, in my opinion, is M. Night Shyamalan's best picture.",

It features excellent performances by Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, and especially young Haley Joel Osment.  I've never seen a child actor give such a marvelous performance.  These performances lend themselves well to the superb character development.  \"The Sixth Sense\" is also one of the most creative paranormal films of all time, while also feeling in many ways like a homage to \"The Shining\".\n\n\"The Sixth Sense\" is a beautiful, moving film, which is not something you get from your average ghost story.

Night Shyamalan as he now keeps directing and writing films that are hilariously bad, and with that upcoming movie The Visit, he seems like he's now making small movies. We will never act like we don't know how the director got famous, although we wonder about how's he still making films that are failure after failure, as he has a fantastic start with The Sixth Sense.  People praise Brice Willis and Haley Joel Osment which make sense and Haley Joel Osment is one of the highlights of the film. The thing is however, I think Toni Colette should get some of the recognitions as she is also just as great as Willis and Osment and also can act as an emotional person very well. The writing is great and there's never a line that seem to be unintentionally funny like Shyamalan's recent movies. It does have some funny moments though, and a lot of creepy moments. The movie has a good balance of creating a ghost story with tricks from old horror films, while putting in new horror tricks that wouldn't make the film feel dated. It does have some bit of jumpscares, but it's mostly out of imagery which is very effective and gave me a bit of a jolt out of it. I know that people are questioning Osment's character about how he got the ability to see, hear, or talk to spirits, but my question is, why do certain people even have that gift at all? I know this is a cliche thing for me to say, but from my thoughts, there are some things that can't be explained at all, and we just have to accept it from what the special type of people can do. For the twist ending that everybody has gone on about this film, I knew how it ended after I watched the whole movie, but when it got to it, the twist is very effective, and would come up as a gigantic surprise to people who had never heard of the ending of have never seen this film. James Newton Howard did a great job with the soundtrack, and the direction by M. Night Shyamalan is really good. The Sixth Sense is a thriller masterpiece that has created a line, \"I see dead people,\" that has been said to this present day.",

Nevertheless, it all comes together to weave a tale of many underlying themes that are supported by a primary story that is poignant and timeless, a tale of love and the importance of life and the spirit both now and forevermore.

Night Shyamalan, whose next two films are as equally engaging, and arguably more so, The Sixth Sense is the work of a master filmmaker and one of the finest storytellers of this generation.",

Suddenly, we're not faced with an individual threat: we're given a situation where it's all about the experience of horror, the confrontation with an unknown, and asked to decide what we would do faced with a similar challenge. Should we be scared? Unlike so many, this is a supernatural thriller which celebrates bravery and humanity beyond guts or scares.",

Some of M.Nights best work, the Six Sense brings out a stellar showing from Willis and maybe one of the best child acted performances of all time. M.Night beautifully directs this film. The story is suspenseful and chilling, the script is well written, and the twist is the definition of thrilling and possibly the best weve ever seen. Another great note to add about this movie is the color scheme we see within the movie. The objects that are red indicating a ghostly suspenseful moment is memorizing. The Six Sense will go down to me as one of the best all around movies I have ever watched and is a film ill never forget. It suspenseful tale will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end.",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR A MOVIE EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER HAS SEEN.\n\nIt's weird how you can tell this is an M. Night film, yet it's the only one of his movies that is universally liked.\n\nSo, The Sixth Sense is a psychological thriller created by the guy that ruined Jaden Smiths acting career, and it stars Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment (at the height of his powers) and Toni Collette. I know most people only think of the two main stars, who are great together on screen, but the chemistry between Collette and Osment is so natural and believable that you would believe they're actually mother and son. She's never quite absent, she's always their for her son from beginning to end, and to me that makes her character as important as Haley Joel Osment's. And it's vice versa, he's always their for his mom, he doesn't want her to worry about him so he does things like lie about having friends and being somewhat popular. That's really the theme to his character, he doesn't want people to think he's a freak, mainly because of his terrifying secret: he sees dead people.\n\nEnter Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Malcom Crowe, a celebrated child psychologist who has some real problems of his own. After being shot by a former patient he failed and seemingly surviving, him and his wife seemingly have marital troubles some time after and he feels he can redeem himself and make his marriage better by helping Osment's character Cole. Right off the bat, these characters have a connection, because they're both on a mission to make things right with their lives. The most notable scene with them, of course, is the famous \"I see dead people\" scene. The build up in this scene is intense and the ominous score just ups the creep factor. And there are a few scenes like this where Cole is seeing ghosts or just saying how he wants them to go away, and it legitimately sends chills down your spine. That's what I really like about this movie, it has so much genuine emotion between characters and that makes the creepy ghosts scenes that much more effective because you feel for these characters.\n\nAdmittedly, there are probably two scenes where I'm like \"Meh, who cares, what does this have to do with anything, get back to the good stuff\"\", but it definitely doesn't take away from the overall experience. Eventually you see Malcom discover that his last patient, the one that he failed, actually had the same problem Cole did, thus he became a believer. From there you find out that the ghosts actually want to use Cole as a medium to take care of unfinished business, which is a cool little twist, these ghosts aren't scary on purpose, they just want help. Malcom then redeems himself in the fact that he helped Cole overcome his fears and accept what he is, followed by a beautiful closing scene with him and his mom, but Malcom still has to fix things at home. When he gets back to his seemingly neglectful, anti-depressant filled wife, he unfortunately discovers the real reason she's been so distant, the big twist M. Night Shyamalan is famous for... Bruce Willis was dead the whole time. Yep, turns out that gunshot wound actually killed him quite instantly, and I swear to you, this twist STILL surprises me when I watch it. Not just because it's shocking, but it's actually a bold move for the movie, because it could have just as easily been a really bad ending, but thanks to once in a lifetime clever film making, the ending makes sense and it actually is another beautiful close for another fleshed out character.\n\nAnd that's the brilliance that is The Sixth Sence. It's by no means perfect, and neither would the rest of M. Nights work be, but it's by far his best film and one of the best psychological thrillers in recent memory. M. Night would later make the stars of his films fools, emotionless, or emotionless fools, but here he seemes to have struck gold. Not just with the stars being realistic characters, but also the story being a layered mystery with plenty of suspense and emotion and some really creepy scenes to boot. 9/10",

By now, everyone knows the twist of this movie, but it was simply an artistic touch -- a tragic, but sympathetic one -- on a great psychological horror movie. The ghosts themselves are not really that scary, a discovery that Haley Joel Osment must confront and learn, but their presence and the psychological toll that it takes on everyone, especially Osment (an exceptionally good actor, given his age), stuck with me. The premise for the ghosts is that many spirits of the dead wander around as if they were alive, not always aware of the fact that they are dead, awaiting closure for missed opportunities in life. Osment recognizes this, but would rather not have his ability to interact with spirits than live with the responsibility of confronting them. Most of my chills were induced by Osment's relationship with the ghosts and the world, in his many failed attempts to appear connected solely with the living. Meanwhile, Willis is a child psychologist who feels he must redeem the mistake he made on one particular patient, who shoots Willis and himself in the opening scene, and help Osment in truly overcoming his struggles. What is interesting about Willis' relationship with the world is that both he and Osment are unaware of the fact that Willis is dead (no longer a spoiler), and we are treated to a depiction of the world in the scope of childhood innocence / inexperience. This lends itself to some scenes not too far from the many other dramas that depict a mutually educational relationship between an adult and a child. Willis being dead and Osment seeing ghosts recreates the trope into a psychological horror, and that really showcases M. Night Shyamalan at a creative peak, as both director and screenwriter. What a shame that he peaked so early.",

He has made several atrocities such as: Lady in the Water, The Last Airbender, and The Happening. Before he made these hideous films, Shyamalan was a household name, garnering praise from critics and fans. His very first film blew people away. \"The Sixth Sense\" is directed by Shyamalan  and stars Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and Haley Joel Osment.\n\nDr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychiatrist. He helps troubled children dealing with lots of pain. Some of his patients are mentally ill, including a young boy named Cole Sear (Osment). Cole has been assigned to Malcolm for help. Cole's mother is under extreme stress and is worried about her child. Cole appears to have scratches all over his body, and acts very odd. Malcolm failed to assist a former patient in the past, and wants to help Cole with his issue. Cole sees dead people.\n\nOne of the best parts of this film are the wonderful performances. Bruce Willis does a great job playing a character you really care about. He and Osment get along splendidly on screen. The young actor also gives a very sincere and moving performance. At the core of the film is a friendship between Malcolm and Cole. Several scenes these two share are incredibly moving and sentimental. You really care about Cole and his journey. The characters feel very real and are very likable thanks to the great script.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan directs this film quite strongly. I might say he directs it brilliantly. He has crafted a beautiful, haunting, and thought provoking film. Generally, allot of people don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural. This film definitely makes you think and wonder at the possibility. The script is absolutely impressive. All the dialogue feels real, and the characters are fleshed out well. Howard Shore composes a beautiful score, and the cinematography is beautiful.\n\nThis film is sort of a horror movie. It's not necessarily terrifying, but it is at times very scary. It sort of puts the audience in the shoes of someone dealing with mental illness. I can't imagine what it must be like for people to hear voices and see things that aren't there. I must admit, this film had me in tears at times. The emotion is so genuine, and the characters are so well written. Not only is it a scary film, but it's a heartwarming one. It deals with subjects like the supernatural, love, marriage, and being different. Obviously, this film is known for it's ending. I won't spoil it, but it was so inventive. I didn't see it coming.\n\n\"The Sixth Sense\" is M. Night Shyamalan's greatest film. Not only is it haunting, it's emotionally powerful at times. He directs this film with expertise and passion. The script is impressive, the performances are top notch, and the characters are great. Is this film a masterpiece? No. It's a bit too long and at times it gets just a little bit hokey. Nevertheless, this is an extraordinary movie that will leave you reeling by the end. It was suspenseful, well made, and beautiful.",

            "content": "Since pop culture has made it impossible to see The Sixth Sense without knowing its twist ending, it is unfortunate that I had to go into it aware if what would happen at the end. But considering that it was the one M. Night Shyamalan film considered great, I figured it was worth the chance.\n\nBeing fully aware of the plot twist in The Sixth Sense, I was able to view it in a very different light to the many other viewers. Admittedly, it wouldn't end up laying down the same effect as if I felt the unexpected chill of learning the great secret of the protagonist in The Sixth Sense. But nevertheless, it gave me a chance to focus on a lot of the smaller elements of the film that only viewers who are completely aware of the film's twist ending would understand. I still wish I could watch the film without knowing its secret, but stuck with the situation that I had to face, I figured I should just make the best of it.\nThe Sixth Sense remained a good film nonetheless.\nOne of the strongest assets of The Sixth sense is the fact that it is strong at building atmosphere. It is able to gradually build an eerie sense of tension as its premise unfolds at a gentle pace over the course of the film's running time. It isn't hard to see how audiences would get scared from The Sixth Sense because there are a lot of chills and thrills written into its screenplay and encouraged by its atmosphere, ensuring that it grasps both a lot of original concepts and a strong style.\nAdmittedly, for me the film was not too scary. It had some moments thanks to the building tension of its atmosphere, but for me I had more appreciation for the fact that the film had a lot of sentimental value in terms of its story and the way it depicted the relationship between Cole Sear and Dr. Malcolm Crowe as they help each other come to terms with life and death. The bond that grows between these two characters becomes one of its most compelling elements of the story, and it was largely what kept me watching. Of course I enjoyed the supernatural elements of the story, but there was a lot more depth to it thanks to M. Night Shyamalan's sensitive directorial approach to the material which he has written with such grace. The Sixth Sense made me feel a lot of things which is what made it great, so it went beyond the surface level that many other M. Night Shyamalan films have in the past and reached an unprecedented high point for his career.\nThanks to sleight of hand from director M. Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense is filmed in such a way that the twist ending remains unexpected for viewers who haven't suffered because of having it spoiled by pop culture, while also in a way which constantly hints at it without making it clear for viewers who are aware of it. The cinematography and general choreography of each scene was excellent due to its style, and it helped to ensure that the twist ending of the film remained fully sensible the entire time. This is the one time that M. Night Shyamalan created a twist ending which actually remained sensible and tied into the narrative of the rest of the story seamlessly. M. Night Shyamalan helps to ensure that The Sixth sense is a strong visual experience and one with touching sentimentality to it.\nAnd to add to the depth and meaning of the film, The Sixth Sense is further enhanced by an absolutely perfect cast.\nAnyone can tell you that Haley Joel Osment's performance is the standout in The Sixth Sense. Despite his age, Haley Joel Osment has no limitations in his performance because he handles the emotionally traumatic nature of the material with a lot of sophistication and juvenile charm. His performance is incredible because he sinks into the role of Cole Sear with serious sympathy and depth which makes him a compelling presence in The Sixth Sense. He is excellent because he conveys the emotional trauma of being cursed with the ability to communicate with the dead, coupled with his troubled emotional state from having divorced parents and social awkwardness. Haley Joel Osment puts a lot of spirit and depth into the role of Cole Sear without challenge or fear, and he constantly conveys the emotional state of the character through intense line delivery and physical involvement in the emotional state of the tale, so M. Night Shyamalan is able to harness the greatest talents of him for The Sixth Sense.\nBruce Willis is also able to deliver a strong leading performance in The Sixth Sense. In one of his strongest and most character oriented performances to date, Bruce Willis is able to easily put a lot of depth into the role of Dr. Malcolm Crowe because he keeps himself appropriately involved in the material so that he has sufficient involvement in the life of Cole Sear without being overbearing in his nature. He encourages the character's sense of redemption in the story development and becomes stronger in his involvement in the material as it progresses, and he constantly delivers his lines with firm drama while maintaining his emotions on a subtle but effective level. Bruce Willis gives a very focused performance in The Sixth Sense and shares excellent chemistry with Haley Joel Osment.\nToni Collette also makes an unforgettable presence in The Sixth Sense. In one of the finest dramatic performances of her career, Toni Collette does a sympathetic job conveying the stressful status of being the mother of a troubled child. The relationship that they share is conveyed intensely through the chemistry between her and Haley Joel Osment. Her expression of emotion is strong because her line delivery is very tense while her physical involvement in the material is equally powerful. Toni Collette has no difficulty in her role in The Sixth Sense, and so she makes a notable impact on the tale.\nDonnie Wahlberg is spot on in his brief part as well because he expresses the shattering emotional trauma of a broken man, and his small role in the film is pivotal and unforgettable, reminding audiences that acting talent runs in the Wahlberg family.\n\nSo although the effect of the horror in the film is somewhat diminished for viewers who are aware of its iconic twist ending, The Sixth Sense is an intense and touching horror story which is well written, sentimentally deep and acted excellently as well as probing that M. Night Shyamalan was not always the joke he has become in recent years.",

M Night Shayamalan may not be a good director anymore but I will always love how he did The Sixth Sense and he definitely directed it very well. I definitely think this film deserves another rare 5 star rating from me as it is a great film and also very smart with a great plot. The thing that I really like about The Sixth Sense is it doesn't fail to impress and if you have a good taste in  a horror film you will love The Sixth Sense. The Sixth Sense also has a very surprise ending which I don't think anybody expected. I love The Sixth Sense and I wish M Night Shayamalan could have directed more great films like this.

            "content": "Before he forever ruined his career with his disgraceful adaptation of The Last Airbender, M. Night Shyamalan had a very promising directing career on his hands. And The Sixth Sense has long considered to be the huge highlight of his mostly disappointing career (do I say that... well prior to this, my only experience with M. Night was The Last Airbender). With almost no knowledge of this film (not even the extremely talked about twist ending), I was unsure of how I would react to another film from one of Hollywood's most infamous... and it turns out The Sixth Sense is well worth anyone's time, especially those still angered by Last Airbender.\n\nI promise I won't reveal any big spoilers (especially the twist ending), but here's all I can reveal regarding the film: Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a doctor of child psychology, who goes to great detail to investigate the secrets behind a troubled eight-year-old boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). When it's revealed that Cole is visited by threatening ghosts (I guess Saramouche really wanted to do the Fandango; Queen reference for those that didn't get it), Crowe, still recovering from a failed patient who committed suicide due to his problems, will do anything to redeem himself, one that ultimately comes at a price.\n\nI think a very good experience with a film like The Sixth Sense has to be where you have almost no knowledge of the film, dim the lights to where it's almost dark, and watch the entire 105 minute film alone. With that in mind, The Sixth Sense has to be one of the most terribly frightening films I've experienced. M. Night must have used heavy Hitchcockian influences when making this film, cause throughout the film, it was literally playing tricks with my mind, in style of the best of The Master of Suspense, particularly in moments when the audience is taken in the mind of the troubled child. And then we arrive at the twist ending (which I won't reveal, I promise, to those who still need to watch the film), and the whole film just rises to a high level just in the last five minutes. It's one that makes the audience think of the events that unfold and rethinks everything that made the film great to begin with. Seriously, if Shyamalan hadn't of ruined his career, he probably would have been the modern-day Hitchcock just for this film alone! \n\nThere's a reason this was nominated for Best Picture back in 1999, and I think it has to do with how well the drama works in combining with the horror aspect. And that fact benefits from its two excellent lead performances. In a role different from his usual \"Yippie kay-ey, mother------\" stunts in Die Hard, Bruce Willis gives a very strong dramatic turn as Malcolm Crowe. Willis succeeds well mostly for the drama alone. He's still upset over his last patient's suicide, his relationship with his wife went down the drain due to his obsession with his work, and he fears that Cole is going down a similar path as his last patient. But it's Haley Joel Osment that captivates the film completely. From his first scenes, Osment relates his characters' issues to where we want to know what's going on and why he's viewed as a freak, or hates when people look at him funny. When we find out about the secret, Osment goes total control of very strong acting, particularly from a child. His fears of what's going on also plays into the minds of the audience. Even more outstanding is the fact that Osment was nominated for an Oscar for his spellbinding performance. Don't know why his career went down the drain, but The Sixth Sense is guaranteed proof that Haley Joel Osment can make a comeback.\n\nThe film also benefits from an effective score from frequent M. Night collaborator James Newton Howard. Though surprisingly quiet for your typical thriller, it still manages to leave a solid impression. It also effects the twist ending to why it worked in the film.\n\nI don't think it's 100% perfect; some of the character's actions are still left unexplained and Olivia Williams' performance as Crowe's wife is extremely bland (though the aspect of their failed relationship still works due to Bruce Willis), The Sixth Sense is a remarkable modern thriller. It's approach to frightening terror is on par with the genius of Alfred Hitchcock, the drama succeeds very well, the lead performances are fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and the twist ending... well, that just adds a whole new light to this great film. I don't know if M. Night can return to making good-quality films as this, but I will say that no matter how much hatred he receives and the Razzies he wins, The Sixth Sense will still remain the reminder of the greatness of the notorious M. Night Shyamalan.\n\n\"I see dead people.\"",

            "content": "I've been a film fan for as long as I can remember. I've had internet access for the past ten years. I've been reviewing movies for the past two. And yet, with all that, I went into The Sixth Sense spoiler free. I didn't know the twists. My knowledge of the movie started and ended with Bruce Willis and \"I see dead people.\" And thank goodness for it, because the element of surprise is what makes this movie truly something outstanding!\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Sense is a 1999 supernatural mystery, written and directed by the now infamous M. Night Shyamalan. This was the director's big break, his first renowned movie. And it's good, it's very good. In fact, as the movie goes along, your appreciation for the experience just keeps getting more positive. I started out interested, but not entirely engrossed. Then a shoe drops, and I was all ears. The movie then plugs along at a very high level for the next hour or so. At this point, I knew that the movie was very good. I liked the movie a lot. As the story wraps up, I assumed I had it all figured out. Character A would be just fine, while character B would say a few snappy lines to fix all of his problems. But then the last five minutes happened... Had these last five minutes not happened, I would still have a very high opinion of the film. But the ending - that ending makes the movie oh so much more!\r\n\r\nDr. Malcolm Crowe has devoted his life to child psychology. But he seems to be losing his edge. That is, until he takes the case of Cole Sear, a nine year old boy with seemingly more problems than one man can fix.\r\n\r\nThere are three things that very easily date the movie as being fifteen years old. Firstly, Bruce Willis has hair. Secondly, Bruce Willis actually gives a rip about the role he's playing. And thirdly, M. Night Shyamalan received Academy Award nominations for this film, instead of Golden Raspberry Award nominations. Up till this point, I had only known the director based off his reputation (which, clearly, is not good), but I cannot watch this movie and still think of M. Night Shyamalan as the talentless hack that he is portrayed to be. \r\n\r\nHis original screenplay is stunning - balancing mystery, drama, and a good bit of horror. His direction is literally spot on! He does things with camera movement, lighting, and sound effects that suggest a budding Hitchcock Jr. in the making. He succeeds so completely in creating atmosphere. It's not fair to label this a horror movie - it's not - but that doesn't mean that the movie doesn't boast a few eerie moments. It's overall as well made a movie as you would expect from an Oscar nominated director ... which is exactly what Shyamalan is.\r\n\r\nThe acting is another thing of special note. Bruce Willis stars as Dr. Crowe. And it's probably the best performance I have seen from the actor. It's definitely the most understated I've seen him, no Die Hard hero antics or Armageddon bravado.\r\n\r\nBut the marquee performance is given by then ten year old Haley Joel Osment. And it is a milestone in child acting history. I'm racking my brain, trying to remember a better performance from someone so young ... I'm drawing a blank. The role requires more than just isolated fear, or happiness, or anger, or distress. The fear has to carry over, even in scenes of happiness. And it does! From what I gather, Osment was nominated for twenty-five various awards for his performance - one of them being an Academy Award. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast isn't given much to do. Toni Collete received acclaim for her performance as Cole's mother. She has some good moments, but I didn't find the performance anything particularly noteworthy. Donnie Wahlberg, on the other hand, manages to make more of an impression in two minutes of screen time than any of the other supporting actors. His entrance and subsequent exit from the movie is so jarring, it can't help but be memorable. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that knocks the movie down a peg is the lack of explanation for some actions. One such scene is never explained, and the other makes sense at the time, but becomes confusing in retrospect.\r\n\r\nThis film marked the first collaboration between Shyamalan and composer James Newton Howard. The score is understated to the max, but it enhances the movie very well. There is a rather rote (but appropriate) horror aspect to the music. But there is also some nice, memorable material to be found. It's a good score, but Newton Howard has definitely done better.\r\n\r\nSo my first experience with much defamed director M. Night Shyamalan is an overwhelmingly enthusiastic one! It's a movie that I would be happy to recommend without the slightest hesitation. Either you've seen this movie, and I'm pretty confident that you're impressed with it. You haven't seen this movie, you DON'T know the ending, and you should definitely watch it as soon as possible. Or you haven't seen the movie, and you DO know the ending - in which case, I'm truly sorry.\r\n\r\n\"I see dead people ... walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.\" 9/10",

I'm digging through my memory, and I can't remember a film in recent memory that has generated so much frightened tension and chills. Unlike most horror films, which play off of sex and gore, this one does what I think most scary movies have in common, and that is to play off of a psychological effect. The movie isn't in your face with the scares, it lets them really sink in at an agonizingly slow rate that lets the tension build to absurd levels. Moreover, this is the only horror movie that I've seen that has really registered with me on an emotional level. Sure, it's scary as hell, but it never loses touch with the story's emotional core. That's pretty rare in a horror movie. What I don't understand is how the man who directed this masterpiece is also the man who directed The Happening and The Last Airbender. I'm a fan of M. Night, but what the hell?",

The Sixth Sense follows a young boy who claims to see ghosts, and a psychologist tries to help the best he can, while also trying to deal with his personal life, as well as the boy trying to deal with his.  This psychological horror flick is nothing compared to the traditional high budget horror flick is that it actually delivers what audiences want, a phenomenal work of art.  The film has a creepy atmosphere aided by visions of ghosts, disturbing imagery, stellar acting, and James Newton Howard's score.  M. Night Shyamalan's directorial debut is one of the best, as he's able to blend psychology with horror and thrills, creating one of the most culturally phenomenal films ever.  The iconic twist ending is hard to believe as the execution of the film keeps you from believing the truth, showcasing the best writing of Shyamalan's falling career, and it's also the best direction as he is able to capture the visual look and narrative structure while directing, showcasing the best direction of his career (anything bad about him now was amazing here).  Yak Fujimoto expertly shoots each scene with the right angle and range, and Andrew Mondshein edits the film perfectively.  The best thing about this is the acting, and there's so much you can endure from the stars in this, including the above-average performance from Haley Joel Osment, who received an Oscar nod at age 11, despite the fact that he has become forgotten (not exactly true, but he hasn't done much for a long time).  Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe shows his full talent as an actor, though it fails to be as powerful's as Osment's.  Toni Collete also does a good job as Lynn Sear, Cole Sear's (Osment's) mom, who tried to cope with her son's mental condition, and what's going on in their lives.  The supernatural elements and the twist ending is what made Shyamalan an icon at the time, though now, he's become one of the worst Hollywood directors, and a \"one-trick\" filmmaker.  Even if we hate him now, we still love him for doing this as he crafted something intelligent, scary, and thrilling all at the same time.  A must-see, and an undisputed masterpiece from an otherwise awful filmmaker.",

The whole film rides on Cole Sear: it is his overwhelming fear that provides the conflict and setting, and he must overcome it to resolve the conflict. Osment pulls this off better than most adult actors could, and it made the story tremendously affecting for me. I was truly impressed that an 11 year old kid could pretend to be a much more complex 11 year old kid so well. He managed to keep Cole at the center of the film despite Bruce Willis' great performance as the ostensible protagonist.\n\nThe scares really sold Cole's arc. Early in the film, he, and the viewer by extension, are powerless victims of forces beyond our control. After his crucial character development, they are defanged. The ankle grab in the girl's house was a particularly great example, as the audience went right along with the ride as all the anxiety of Cole's life to date came back up and subsided as he conquered it. \n\nI loved the way the twist ending elegantly reframed the film; Cole goes from Crowe's successful project to a sort of independent success of his own. It sort of doubled the value of the plot, made everything a lot richer. Overall, it's a really well written story that's acted phenomenally.",

The twist end is easily the most surprised I've ever been watching a movie, surprising me so much, I couldn't have been more impressed with the execution of the film and how there are subtle hints dropped, making this an even better re-watch. This is a spectacular movie with emotional depth and a brilliant plot. The Sixth Sense gets 5/5 stars (A+).",

            "content": "Yeah... It's pretty good and that's about it. Had I been of viewing age when this film was released it probably would have blown my mind too. Besides the ending that is as twisty as we love it to be and an amazing performance from Haley Joel Osment, this film seems kind of average. While the initial premise is brilliant and the ending is of course is great, some of the middle portion of this film felt flat, it was poorly scripted and I noticed some errors (which I won't say due to spoilers). Don't get me wrong, it's an immensely watchable thrill ride that's also entertaining, held my interest for its duration and really got me invested but it wasn't perfect and I'm sure if Shyamalan had released this today it wouldn't nearly have had the same impact partly due to the fact that a generally creepy performance wouldn't be present because Osment would have been too old and he is important because he made this movie, I can't see it being as effective if he wasn't present. No disrespect to a man just trying to make a living but I think Shyamalan is a one hit wonder because after seeing some of his recent films (Happening, Airbender) makes me wonder how this man ever got nominated for two Oscars and how a film he made was nominated for Best Picture. I do feel sorry for him in a way, I'm guessing people don't really review his movies fairly because they're comparing it to this.",

What about the teenage boy who blew his brains out? What about that ghost in the metal closet? Frankly, though, I do like the choice of the little girl, as her story is by far the saddest. But I just think if all three of them were explored we could not only lengthen the movie, but have the relationship with Cole and Malcolm strengthen, and cause the final scene to be all the more heart-wrenching.",

            "content": "If you were to merely mention the name M. Night Shayamalan in a room full of movie watchers, you would either elicit hysterical laughter, or hysterical sobbing.  M. Night Shayamalan is the infamous director of some of the worst movies of all time.  So one could be forgiven for forgetting that at the beginning of his career, Shayamalan was one of the most promising new directors in Hollywood.  The Sixth Sense is a testament to his initial genius.\n\nVery little of The Sixth Sense can be revealed without potentially spoiling something (don't worry, I will avoid spoilers in this review).  However, the basics of the story is as follows: Brilliant child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, is attempting to help a young boy, Cole Sear, whom acts almost jarringly like a previous patient of Malcom's.  This previous patient of Malcom's ultimately committed suicide, so in order to redeem himself (and lift the guilt of his failure), Malcom tries to help Cole, though he quickly discovers that this case may be much more serious than he first anticipated.\n\nThe Sixth Sense creates a chilling atmosphere.  It is a bit frightening (occasionally terrifying), but incredibly skilled to be certain.  The cinematography (while more than a touch odd- sometimes distractedly so) amplifies the creepiness and the tension.  The Sixth Sense is a masterpiece of mood.\n\nOf course, the element that The Sixth Sense is known best for, is the twist at the end.  In my opinion, the end twist is perfect, and for a large number of reasons.  For one, the movie is not about the twist.  The Sixth Sense is not merely a build-up to get to the finish.  In fact, this would have been a perfectly satisfying movie without the twist.  But the last 3 or 4 minutes of the film is really what causes it to rise above so many others.\n\nThe twist also makes one think.  It forces one to reconsider almost the entire events of the film.  To replay them in one's mind.  It causes one to have a different perspective on everything.  It's so obvious.  It makes so much sense.  But you can't see it coming.  There are many brilliant twists in the world of, not only film, but literature and even music.  The  Sixth Sense will likely remain as one of my all time favorite twists.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, The Sixth Sense is a fascinating, creepy, and completely gripping experience, even without the brilliant twist.  The story is highly intriguing, and as events unfold, things get more and more interesting.  Alas, The Sixth Sense is mislabeled as a horror film.  And while there are moments of somewhat grisly violence (and moments of undeniable terror), simply calling The Sixth Sense a horror film is a disservice to the film's successful mystery elements.  Because at the heart of The Sixth Sense, it is a mystery.  A wickedly creepy mystery that seems all wrapped up by the penultimate scene (and easily could've ended there), but the last scene makes is what really concludes the mystery.\n\nAnd then there's the acting, which is excellent.  The highlight is undeniably Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the disturbed child.  His performance is one of my favorite child performances of all-time (closely rivaling my other favorite; Asa Butterfield in Hugo).  He absolutely kills every scene he's in.  Osment sells the tears, the stress, the anxiety, and the intelligence that's so important to convey in this character.  This is not an easy role, but Osment not only succeeds, he triumphs.  \n\nOsment's performance is so extraordinary, one almost forgets that the rest of the cast also flourishes.  Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm nails it, by balancing sympathy and wit into a likable and layered character.  Toni Collette as Lynn Sear- Cole's mother- is also a sympathy producing role, and is handled with the right amount of strength, and motherly kindness.\n\nJames Newton Howard's score is mostly atmospheric.  It enhances the film, and unlike most atmospheric scores, it has a distinctive personality that one can recognize even without the picture in front of them.  \n\nThe Sixth Sense is both an intellectually satisfying film, and a thrilling one.  It's gripping, riveting, and at times, a bit scary.  But it's a sensational experience that must be seen to believed.  It truly is a shame that M. Night has become one of the biggest jokes in cinematic history, because his earliest contribution to mainstream film is a very important one.",

            "content": "Oh, I'm detecting an error in the title, because if this boy is supposed to have some kind of a new sense that allows him to interact with the dearly departed, then this film should be \"The Eighth Sense\", as you also have to take into account sense of humor and common sense. I'd imagine there are plenty of people who would say that joke reflects that have neither, but really, I still feel like the counting is off, because you also have that sense where you taste things a little bit when their scent gets really far into your sense of smell, or at least that's what I learned from Peter Griffin when he was trashing on Christina Aguilera. For the record, I haven't been crazy about \"Family Guy\" since its return from cancellation way back in 2005, so I don't know if my reference to that throw-away little cutaway is cheesier than my joke about the seven senses... or at least I didn't until I actually spelled that out and decided that, yes, the eight senses joke is cheesier. Yeah, let's pay some respect here and cut the corn, because after \"Wide Awake\" in 1998, I'm sure M. Night Shyamalan was glad to be doing quite the serious piece of dramatic cinema... before getting way back into the cheesiness. Yeah, Shyamalan has gained a tendency to corn things up in relatively recent years, but hey, at least his career's still intact after this film that was intended to break him out, either because he doesn't have a brother who ended up being more marketable (Sorry, Donnie Wahlberg), or because he wasn't caught with drugs in his car. Hm, after that incident, I wonder if Haley Joel Osment can actually see his career, because it is dead and, as coincidence would have it, has had to resort to doing voice work in \"Kingdom Hearts\" video games. You really can't see his James Van Der Beek eyes, at least for no, but until Osment gets back into the live-action film business, we have our memories, which are pretty sweet when you consider this film, at least until clouded by some missteps.\r\n\r\nAs screenwriter, M. Night Shyamalan delivers on subtly meaty characterization that keeps gradual expository depth adequate in this drama which is heavily driven by its characters, and yet, if there are holes in expository depth of this film, then they are gaping, certainly not to where you're all that distances from the characters, but decidedly to where you feel as though more should be said about the depths of this story and its characters. Only so much is said about the characters in this undercooked drama, but really, it's not like there is all that much to say here, because, like most of M. Night Shyamalan's succeeding efforts, where this thriller could have had more activity with its intense subject matter, Shyamalan ultimately chooses to structure a narrative concept that is most interested in steady rises to intensity rather than actual intensity, and while Shyamalan's story is sharp enough to compel in spite of its minimalism, the point is that minimalism stands, limiting the weight of this drama, maybe even challenging your investment. A good bit of meat is found here and there throughout this basic story concept, but there's still something kind of distancing here, and Shyamalan's directorial interpretation of this somewhat thin story concept isn't exactly frequent in making compellingness all the more prominent, because even though Shyamalan's all but trademark steady approach to minimalist subject matter is backed by enough heart to keep you engaged through and through, there are those time where plot momentum slows down, and atmospheric momentum joins, driving the film into blandness. Granted, the film never slips so low that it hits the dreaded point of dullness, and it's not like the film even gets to be that bland in its steadiness, but Shyamalan's ambition to make a very meditative dramatic thriller sometimes backfires on him, and yet, the backfire is hardly all that severe. Atmospheric limpness creates a sense of aimlessness at times, sure, but on the whole, atmospheric limpness isn't so much a big problem with this film as much as it is an opportunity for you to meditate on how structural pacing really holds the film back, because even though there's enough subtle dynamicity to plotting to keep you reasonably invested, when plotting drags, it bloats itself with repetitious material, and plenty of it, limiting rises and falls in momentum and giving you more than enough time to figure out the possible surprises in this thriller, - excluding the twist, that is - until what you end up with is a drama that never loses too much momentum, yet still slowly, but surely, loses steam, until the final product sputters out short of what it could have been. Yeah, flaws are pretty limited in this film, which is far from short on considerable strengths, but those subtle little missteps end up going a long way in reflecting limitations in potential, which is considerable, make no mistake, but thin enough for underwhelmingness to be a possibility, and for excellence to not be. The film is too improvable to even make it as truly strong, yet don't go thinking that the final product isn't rewarding, because through all of the natural and consequential shortcomings, this is a good story done very good justice, even in something as simple as the musical aspects.\r\n\r\nAfter the obscure \"Praying with Anger\" and the just plain forgotten \"Wide Awake\", M. Night Shyamalan, through this film, really broke into the business, and did so with the help of the great James Newton Howard, who has since never left Shyamalan's side, which is good, considering the scoring talents of Howard that can even be seen in this, Shyamalan's and Howard's first collaboration, which isn't all that impressive, but relatively refreshing in its being defined by a tasteful brood which carries an unconventional and chilling beauty, married with subtle atmospheric intensity. This film's very atmospheric score set the tone for Shyamalan's and Howard's business relationship every bit as much as it helped in setting the tone for this film, having enough uniqueness to it to play a role in distinguishing the final product, yet still not being as unique as the story concept behind the film itself. Again, there's only so much development and dynamicity to this interpretation of a story concept that has only so much meat, therefore there's only so much kick to storytelling, but not so little that it's difficult to appreciate Shyamalan's ultimately worthy story concept, which is unique, with a rich potential for thrills and drama that more potential for strength than underwhelmingness, which is ultimately eluded by what is done right in Shyamalan's execution of such a conceptually intriguing story. As a screenwriter, Shyamalan delivers enough subtle characterization to do an adequate job of compensating for expository shortcomings, but it's Shyamalan's directorial atmosphere that most challenges shortcomings, for although atmospheric storytelling often runs out of meaty material to soak up, resulting in limp spells, on the whole, Shyamalan's meditativeness stays comfortable enough to keep dullness at bay, and when momentum picks up about as much as it can in a thriller that has only so many thrills to offer, tension is firmly established, broken up by, if not seamlessly bonded with effective dramatic resonance organically enough to really draw you in. It all comes down to that legendary little twist, which is justly praised, not just because it is audaciously clever and strikingly surprising, but because it is anchored by a heavy dramatic weight that tightly resolves the depths of the final product and really satisfies on a cerebral and emotional level as a height in Shyamalan's directorial effectiveness, which is consistently worthy, enough so to secure reward value, but not without help. When the haunted spirits who plague our leads pop in, they all but steal the show with their effectiveness as supporting players, with Donnie Wahlberg being dramatically revelatory in his all too quickly abandoned role, but it's the leads who really carry this film, with young Haley Joel Osment once again reminding us of how he got be a key influence in the recent movement to raise dramatic acting standards for child performers by being powerfully convincing in his layered, emotionally charged portrayal of a deeply disturbed and fearful lad who goes haunted by both distanced, maybe even cruel peers who cannot connect with him, as well as by terrifying images that connect with him too deeply, while Bruce Willis also proves to be effective in his portrayal of a good, respectable man who struggles to mend the stability of a disturbed boy he can relate to and may not be able to save, while struggling with his own demons as a flawed man who his himself haunted by his failures. The humanly moving performances that Osment and Willis turn in carry the film quite some distance, but they're not the only driving forces behind this drama, because in spite of the subtle, but ultimately considerable shortcomings that hold full potential back, there is enough inspiration on and off of the screen to carry the final product as rewarding as both a meditative thriller and deeply thoughtful drama.\r\n\r\nBottom line, limited development and atmospheric coldness call your attention more towards natural shortcomings in this relatively minimalist story concept, though not as much as the aimlessness that leaves steam to gradually die down behind repetitious dragging, until the final product falls short of its full potential, but not so short that effectively atmospheric score work, strong acting and viscerally effective steady storytelling behind an intelligently unique and well-layered story concept don't prove to be enough to make \"The Sixth Sense\" a generally tense and emotionally satisfying meditative thriller.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

With some exceptions to 'Signs' and 'Unbreakable', everything else by this poor man has been an utter disaster.  In fact, many people now jokingly insist that this movie was little more than an accident, something that wasn't supposed to be good but somehow was.  But the director's shortcomings aside, this film is easily one of the best horror/thrillers ever made.  Right from the very first shot, with the basement light slowly growing brighter, to the heartbreaking but ultimately beautiful moment when Malcolm transcends through the recovery of his grieving wife, this film demonstrates that perfect unity between adept direction, ingenious writing, movingly refined performances (Willis, Osment and Collette are equally perfect) and an intensely creepy music score by James Newton Howard.  Like all great horrors, 'The Sixth Sense' is morbidly terrifying, but then like all great movies in general, it is also a heart-warming story about love, courage, and redemption.  I think this film is very important, and should be experienced by everyone, regardless of their taste in movies.",

However, once the movie ended I realized I see a great movie (I see dead people, see what I did there? lol). The Sixth Sense is full of Mystery & Suspense, along with great story-telling. There were some moments where I was genuinely creeped out.\n\nThe performances are also extremely impressive. The young Haley Joel Osment was outstanding. Bruce Willis too was great. I've really only known Mr. Willis as the epic action hero, but this gave me a whole new perspective of him. The mother also did a very solid job.\n\nHats off to you for this one M. Night. Job well done.",

Its story is slowly but surely unraveled with nearly unprecedented attention to every small detail to ensure faithfulness to the film's climactic and disturbing reveal in the final frames. Its imagery is generally dull and uninteresting, and its sound design somewhat pedestrian. Nevertheless, it all comes together to weave a tale of many underlying themes that are supported by a primary story that is poignant and timeless, a tale of love and the importance of life and the spirit both now and forevermore. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, whose next two films are as equally engaging, and arguably more so, The Sixth Sense is the work of a master filmmaker and one of the finest storytellers of this generation.",

The expertly written narrative and directing will keep you hooked and give you chiils down your spine from start to finish. The cinematography stands out to me which it usually never does but it needs to be addressed here. It is simply wonderful, the angles and what is going on in the frame of these camera shots are so clever and precise not a single shot was made without thought going into it. I was unfortunate to see this film after someone accidentally spoiled the twist for me but suprisingly, it didn`t affect the enjoyment I had. It gave me a new perspective and it`s so easy to see the many clues hinting about the twist. Every single actor did an amazing job especially Willis and Osment. This is actually my favourite Bruce Willis movie, his performance was so genuine and I can not imagine anyone else replacing his performance it was hand down fantastic. The screenplay is almost perfect in my opinion, the timing and the words are just spot on. It has a great pace with all the characters showing great development and ofcourse they are all likable like most well written characters are. I have not seen alot of M. Night Shyamalan movies but I will definitly after this exceptionally well made classic.",

The images are disturbing and you feel for Cole as he desperately wants the images to go away.  Bruce Willis counsels him and does his best to help the boy deal with the images he sees and life in general.  The rapport between Willis and Osment is one of the best most memorable between 2 characters.  The movie sets up for a twist ending that catches all who watch it off guard.  With memorable one liners, great acting, and well executed scenes of terror The Sixth Sense has became a classic.",
