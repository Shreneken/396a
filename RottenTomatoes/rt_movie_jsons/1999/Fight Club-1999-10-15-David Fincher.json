            "content": "Finally watched this classic after years of being admonished by people who consider it one of their favorite films. It was fast paced, intense, and undoubtedly entertaining. The truth is, without Brad Pitt and Edward Norton's nuanced performances, this film wouldn't have impressed me all that much. I imagine that in 1999, it would have had much more bite than in 2023, a time in which we've all become so accustomed to edgy, mind f*** type media. \n\nI can see how some get the idea that the film glorifies violence and hyper-masculine bravado. I viewed it as more of a cautionary tale of a man who doesn't appreciate his life  and thinks violence will be his salvation, only to find that it's an ever-escalating road to nowhere and what he truly wanted could have been his all along. \n\nAt any rate, it's a film worth watching if only for the iconic performances and slick visuals.",

            "content": "Fight Club is a provocative and thought-provoking film that challenges viewers to question the values and norms of modern society. Directed by David Fincher and based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club is a movie that rewards repeated viewings, as it is filled with subtle details and layered meanings that are easy to miss on first viewing.\n\nThe film stars Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, a charismatic and enigmatic figure who leads the narrator, played by Edward Norton, into a world of violent rebellion against the consumerist culture that surrounds them. The two form a \"fight club,\" a secret organization where men gather to physically fight each other as a way of releasing pent-up frustration and aggression.\n\nWhile the film's violent content has drawn criticism, it is ultimately a commentary on the destructive nature of masculinity in modern society. The characters in the film are struggling to find meaning and purpose in their lives, and their violent behavior is a manifestation of their frustration and sense of powerlessness in the face of societal pressures.\n\nFight Club is also notable for its stunning visual style, which combines a gritty, urban aesthetic with surreal and dreamlike imagery. The film's use of subliminal messages and fourth-wall-breaking techniques add to its unsettling and thought-provoking nature.\n\nHowever, Fight Club is not a movie for everyone. Its themes and content can be challenging and disturbing, and some viewers may find its message to be nihilistic or even dangerous. Nevertheless, for those who are willing to engage with its ideas and wrestle with its complexities, Fight Club is a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience that raises important questions about the nature of identity, masculinity, and the pursuit of happiness in a modern world.",

            "content": "I'm torn on this one. On one hand, I love a lot of the movie - the grimy look, the performances by Norton and Pitt, the comedy, and the mystery. On the other hand, I don't like the ending, it's less interesting than the setup and too large in scale – I think almost all the movie's strongest scenes have very limited settings and relatively few characters. There is also some interesting social commentary at play. The criticism of capitalism is interwoven nicely into the narrative, though it's also tied to the ending which I found too fantastical and out of touch with the rest of the movie. I did like the theme of masculinity in the film though.",

Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter play the main characters in David Fincher's film, which also features other notable actors. \n\nThe narrative centres on Jack, an office worker who struggles to find meaning and purpose in his life and suffers from insomnia (played by Norton). When Jack eventually meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), he is introduced to the world of underground fighting clubs by this charismatic and enigmatic man. Jack and Tyler work together to create a cult-like movement that seeks to upend the status quo of society and implement extreme change.\n\nIt takes several viewings of the movie \"Fight Club\" to completely grasp its complex plot and challenging ideas. Dark and dirty visuals complement the film's nonlinear story, which keeps viewers guessing until the very end. \n\nPitt and Norton both give amazing performances, and their on-screen chemistry is fantastic. Strong performances from the supporting ensemble, which includes Bonham Carter, complete the characters played by the leading performers. \n\nDespite the fact that \"Fight Club\" contains violent and explicit sequences, the movie is unquestionably a unique and thought-provoking work of cinema. Overall, if you're seeking for a smart, suspenseful thriller that questions the social order, I definitely suggest this film.",

Everyone's said it: the book was clear that it was saying Durden's mindset was harmful and is what made the narrator a terrible person, but the movie wasn't as clear, and some people thought Tyler Durden was just a cool guy fighting the man. \n\nHonestly, if you just watch it with the knowledge that the Narrator is wrong about masculinity and what it means to be a revolutionary, it's great. At the very least, I think it's a fun movie, with a lot of potential for some really interesting themes. Good stuff.",

The story is brutal but always interesting, the cinematography is excellent, Fincher's direction (especially some of the camera angles he chooses) is inspired at times, the score is fantastic, and the acting is great throughout.  Where the film falters at times is in its stylistic excesses, most of which feel inconsistent and unnecessary – the breaking of the fourth wall, the rapid-fire editing, the single-frame subliminal shots, and much more.  It's a good movie with an important message, but it's really not a great movie.",

I enjoyed the major plot twist at the end of the film and can say that it was my favorite part. The character's monotonous voice and deep eye bags really add to the film.

            "content": "One aspect of the film that makes this movie stand out is the personality differences between the two main characters. The first main character who we follow throughout the film (who is unnamed) is the average white-collar worker who tends to keep to himself while Tyler Durden is almost the complete opposite and is super energetic and outgoing but has a mysterious vibe to him. Unlike the first main character, he has multiple jobs but his main job is being a soap salesman. The movie's settings and environments add to their personality differences. It starts with where you would think an office worker would live, in a bustling city. Then we move to an abandoned house on the outskirts of the city next to a factory where nobody is living in the vicinity and you have the freedom to do whatever you want, representing Tyler Durden's character completely.\nThis film had its moments and I would say that it was an above-average film. There were times when it had you up off your seat and not knowing what would happen next while there were times when the storyline got so convoluted that I didn't even know what was going on. A lot of the time, this movie leaves you wondering what the point of this scene is. Some scenes don't add anything to the story and end up confusing it even more. If you can get past the confusingness of the story, the focus on mental health and society shines throughout most of the movie but is somewhat ruined by the twisting and confusing plot. I would recommend this move to a more mature audience that can handle themes of violence and mental health issues. A pretty good movie but nothing special.",

            "content": "Throughout the film I was astonished at the fact that the actors were amazing at their jobs. Characters like Edward and Tyler really stood out because they made their presence stand out. Edward's acting stood out because he took the character to another level. Edward if the early film was a cold insomnia who acted very stoic. This carried the pace of the film, making the first 20 minutes of the movie seem very slow and in my opinion very boring. After meeting Bob in the Testicle Cancer cry group the acting for the characters to show emotions and being vulnerable hit me. I loved the acting for many reasons, but a huge reason was the fact that the acting controlled the pace of the film and can make certain scenes in the film have emotions.\n\n\tAfter watching the film Fight Club by David Fincher, I think that the film's quality was not the best, but it was very great. The film's production with special effects and the plot of the story was amazing. The plot of the story had very many ups and downs, not ups and downs as the quality, but the pace of the story. There were many moments where we dove into different characters like Tyler and Edward. Both of them were focused a lot throughout the film, but near the end these characters really were shown without any mask to hide behind. It seemed as if there was a fight between good vs evil, yet they were the same person with two different personas. I would not recommend this to a younger audience because of how complex the story is and the use of many things, like sex, drugs, and mental illness. Overall I would rate the movie 4.3 / 5 stars. The film was amazing, but there can be some improvements to the film whether it was more visuals or even a deeper dive into some side characters that had importance to the film.",

I think the main character is so well written because of their use of his narration throughout the film. I don't find there to be much meaning in the actual plot of the film but it's the narration from the character and the dialogue between them, that really gives the film meaning. I find they show the way he sees the world and the capitalistic society he finds himself in really interesting and they make for great quotes. The setting of the film and the gloomy lighting and costumes is like a whole new aesthetic on its own.",

Looking back at the movie, no scene is unimportant no matter how it felt at that time, though to me I enjoyed nearly every scene. The opposing personalities of the two main characters puts across a very different kind of buddy cop movie feel that I really appreciate. I really liked Edward Norton's character as \"The Narrator\" and how they change throughout the story bit by bit but still stays true to his character personality at the beginning of the movie, all the major changes to him happen in the last 30 minutes of the movie and it is absolutely perfect how it happens. I do feel very sorry for this character and to see him show his true insane self is very interesting and amazing. Brad Pitt's character Tyler Posey is really interesting in of that I was never able to understand his motivation or reason for doing anything but that isn't bad, in a strange way that was his brilliance as a character. I did not like the \"Project Mayhem\" parts of the movie very much and not in the way that we aren't meant to like it, I did not enjoy those parts of the movie. The twist was fantastic and had I not known about it I would have never figured it out. The hints dropped throughout the movie are amazing and the way they handle such a difficult matter such as schizophrenia is done greatly. The movie ends in a truly poetic way which I could have never guessed would happen. I very much enjoyed this movie",

This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images.

I don't remember the last time I saw a movie with such a plot twist and the bond between the narrator and tyler is so showing of the questionable mental state of the narrator. And the ending was amazing. \"You met me at a very strange time in my life.\"",

            "content": "\"Fight Club\" is an amazing film and dare I say one of my personal modern favorites, that delivers both a stunning and atmospheric look into the mind of an insomniac and his hallucinations.  Edward Norton plays the \"Narrator\" who can't sleep and is depressed when he goes to his doctor he is turned away and told to take some natural remedies for his insomnia.  It's around this time that he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and his life takes a dramatic plunge into darkness and insanity!  The film is an intimate look into the life of the narrator and is filled with symbolism and complex dialogue and themes making it what many consider a masterpiece.  While I have viewed the film several times before, all these occurred when I was alone and not with a diverse and easily offended crowd.  While I always pick up various subtitle pieces and visuals or meaning with each viewing, It was hindered by the more sensitive of the crowd (There were eight of us total watching the film in our vacation log cabin at night time) who constantly let it be known that they were upset and that the film was terrible.  While of course I and most critics would argue the opposite, it is their opinion and they are entitled to it, no matter how versed in film they are.  The direction is superb as is the dialogue and set pieces, the acting from the leads is stunning and pulls you into their madness and adds up to a revelation!  \"Fight Club\" is Highly Recommended if you can stomach fighting and a dark and at times disturbing film that has many things to say!",

It's been a while since I last saw it; I've a lot more life and films under my belt since then. I was interested how is react. I still love it. I laughed much more, especially in the first half. It really hasn't lost any of its uncomfortable, prophetic power of a spiritually and emotionally impoverished generation. Now we know what that generation would grow up into: Trump-electing, vaccine-suspicious, compassion-allergic, increasingly alienated but increasingly yearning for connection. Palahnuik and Fincher saw it all coming; a lot of people should have listened more carefully. ‘‘Twas ever thus. At least its status as a masterpiece is now pretty much unassailed.",
