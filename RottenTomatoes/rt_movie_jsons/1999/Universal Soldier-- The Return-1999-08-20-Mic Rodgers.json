The movies does very little  to explain how the character got from where the the original movie ended to where this starts, it feels like a forced sequel. Another aspects that let down its the generic plot and cheap direct to TV feel, on a midly positive note, the last 20 mimutes are not that bad with some occasional entertaining action sequences.\n\nI hated the use of late 90s rock music, it makes the movie feel so outdated",

            "content": "Before \"Independence Day\" and before even \"Stargate,\" Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin made an underrated Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi action film where he and Dolph Lundgren play soldiers killed in Vietnam who find themselves reanimated and turned into programmable cyborg super soldiers. That film was followed by two made-for-TV sequels and then by this film, making it the fourth film in the franchise, although this sequel ignores the events of those TV movies, instead picking up following the events of the first film. JCVD has removed his cybernetic implants, so he's a regular ol' human now and is doing consulting work for the military. The Universal Soldier program is still running and the soldiers are getting an upgrade by being run by a new supercomputer. However, when the supercomputer finds out the UniSol program is being shutdown, the computer goes all Wargames and uses the programable soldiers to protect itself. Since JCVD used to be one the the soldiers, he supposedly knows how they think, fight, and feel, enabling him to fight them off better than others. Oh, there's an even a dumber subplot involving his daughter being kidnapped. All around, this film is pretty dumb and uninteresting, despite a halfway decent cast, which besides JCVD includes professional wrestler Bill Goldberg, Michael Jai White, Xander Berkeley, Daniel von Bargen, and playmate Kiana Tom. However, Jean-Claude is an actor who I'm strangely entertained by, regardless of the quality of film he's appearing in (similar to my affinity for low-quality Steven Seagal films), so JCVD's high kicks made this fourth Universal Soldier film watchable despite its many faults.",

First of all, I liked the first Universal Soldier, Lundgren vs. Van Damme, one liners, good sets, quick pace competent screen fighting, it was pretty good, very sequel worthy. So, I was a little excited to see the second one despite the fact that I never liked Bill Goldberg the wrestler, mostly because his moves suck, but also because he couldn't act. But playing a regenerated dead soldier in a movie seemed like one role that he couldn't mess up. But then this movie happened, and it almost killed a promising franchise. It is one of those movies about a super computer that doesn't look like a computer, it's a rotating cube in a glass bubble or some shit that becomes self-aware and tries to take over the world or kill a bunch of people, it's been done a million times and usually pretty poorly. \n\n\nAt the time of The Return's release, I didn't realize that a 2nd and 3rd Van Dammeless Universal Soldier movies had been released, and it doesn't much matter. The Return was playing at Seattle's Northgate cinema, a single feature cinema that is no longer in existence. I tried to get a summer job there after my Freshman year in college, hoping to see Universal Soldier: The Return for free, or actually get paid to see it. I didn't get the job, never paid to see it. Rented it one time, thought it sucked, then I bought one of those compilation DVDs that they sell for five bucks in a basket near the checkout stand at a one-stop-shop's electronics section. I thought it would be worth some small fraction of five bucks to re-watch it, but not only was I wrong, I feel that I was wronged. THIS MOVIE SUCKS.",

            "content": "Sequel to Universal Soldier brings mindless action to a new level. However does it pay off? Well let me start by saying that the original film, although not the best action film, it certainly wasn't the worst either. But this film lacks anything that made the first one worth seeing. This is a mediocre action flick that has poor acting, a poor plot and sloppily thought out action scenes that simply fail to thrill. Universal Soldier: The Return feels lazy and it is clear that the filmmakers didn't care about creating something as exciting as the first. Universal Soldier was thrilling, fun and mindless popcorn action that worked because of an interesting idea. However this sequel tries too hard at bringing more depth to the UniSol franchise and it just doesn't succeed because the script is too sloppy and is limited to paper thin ideas that simply don't take off. Also one of the big problems with this sequel is that they tried to give Van Damme's character too much personality, and the result is not impressive, and leaves a lot to be desired. There is not much to offer fans of the first, and a few ideas were recycled from the previous one. This is a lacking film that just fails in terms of an effective and memorable action film. The script is laughable and the acting is wooden, with no standout performances. Even in terms of a mindless action yarn, Universal Soldier The Return just doesn't cut it. I much more enjoyed the first film, even with all its flaws, it was fun and engaging to watch, however this sequel is void of great action and interesting plot.",

That is of course on top of the two made for TV films which are also ignored, so really the UniSol franchise is a bit of a mess.\n\nYou can see why this film was not a hit upon release and since ignored. The whole look of the film is not much better than the previous made for TV films. Everything is set within your standard cliched generic military base/weapons experimentation type facility, it all looks very dull, very grey and with plenty of glass and computer monitors to shoot up hehe.\n\nThe plot about the master computer brain taking over the UniSol project it looks after and basically setting all the UniSols free is basic but reasonable. This equal lots of faceless military types getting shot to pieces every 5min and plenty of 'Terminator' style posturing from the UniSols. The saving grace being the fight between JCVD and White, White being one of the best visual fighters in the biz. Unfortunately Goldberg doesn't quite get the true fight he deserves and merely lurches around as comical relief half the time, if you can call it that.\n\nThe whole film feels very watered down and not really in the same adult vain as the original film. There is even a 'Hal' moment in the film clearly ripped from '2001', its like they are trying too hard with the material. End of the day this film hasn't broken away from the 'made for TV' look n feel of the previous two efforts.",

Unfortunately, a contradiction once again occurred and I found myself discovering little value in Universal Soldier: The Return.\nWith a film like Universal Soldier: The Return, the story is hardly one of the more important assets of the film. Yet with Universal Soldier: The Return, the story decides that somehow the series protagonist Luc Deveraux has gone from being a Universal Soldier in the first film to a fully functioning and intelligent human being in this one. It is never explained, nobody even tries to pretend that it matters. Because of this, the entire route taken by the film feels significantly different to the first Universal Soldier and the absence of Roland Emmerich reinforces this notion when it comes to the technical values of the film. In all essence, the story in Universal Soldier: The Return is packed with a generic plot points and poor dialogue, but some of the characters are especially poor. The antagonists of the film are not as robotic as they should be. The actors are appropriately robotic their limited abilities, but for Universal Soldiers they speak way too much. For some reason, they are fed some of the cheesiest lines in the film which are seemingly modeled after the nature of writing that was given to action heroes of the 1980's. The screenplay in Universal Soldier: The Return is blind in its incompetence due to its inability to even write the villains to be thin enough to be appropriate for the story. Everything in the film is thin and shallow, but this is a case where it is the wrong kind.\nUniversal Soldier: The Return has an even bigger budget than its predecessor, and so that suggests that it should end up being an even bigger spectacle. However, the film opts instead to take on a more generic root which combines the action themes of Die Hard with the science fiction aspects of 2001: A Space Odyssey. That should be fun enough, but unfortunately the lack of Roland Emmerich is all to clear. While that man is off directing blockbusters like Godzilla and The Patriot, Universal Soldier: The Return features the directorial efforts of Mic Rodgers. There is a clear reason you've never heard that name before, and that's because his directorial style is so distant from the actual project and bereft of a sense of style that he buries the film into the generic roots of countless other Jean-Claude Van Damme action vehicles. The man has experienced extensive success working in stunt choreography and that's the area he should stay in because some of the action scenes in Universal Soldier: The Return are decent because the film is structured out of mainly mindless explosions and shootouts with the occasional use of Jean-Claude Van Damme's flexible fighting talents, but as the visual style has such a small scale feeling in contrast to the wide angles and tracking shots used in Universal Soldier. This film does not have any great imagery, and the simplistic visual style with its repetitive colour scheme and uninspired editing ultimately ends up making everything look rather cheap.\nEven the cast of the film do not carry the gimmicks effective enough to prevent the extensive failure of Universal Soldier: The Return.\nJean-Claude Van Damme is a generic lead in his return to the role of Luc Deveraux. While he carried some strong gimmicks as a robotic action hero in Universal Soldier with his fighting skills and his restrained line delivery, in Universal Soldier: The Return he is forced back into playing a fully functioning human character once again. This aforementioned flaw forces Jean-Claude Van Damme to play a more legitimate part even though neither William Malone and John Fasano know how to write one. Because of this, Jean-Claude Van Damme goes for the limited expectations that he is condemmned to by everything else in the production. There is no denying that he is not the greatest actor in the world, but Universal Soldier: The Return makes this all too clear by expecting him to carry a $45 million film on his back when the story does not give him enough situations to deliver his iconic fighting techniques. Jean-Claude Van Damme is forced through a terrible script and generic story in Universal Soldier: The Return, and while some of his most dedicated fans will appreciate his fighting skills, most of them will see that he deserves a lot better than he gets.\nKiana Tom is so cheesy in her attempts to capture the melodrama in the screenplay that her effort ends up on par with the intentionally over the top efforts of Charisma Carpenter when she portrayed Cordelia Chase in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. This would work if the film was trying to be cheesy, but since it takes itself so seriously and yet she does not, she drags down the experience whenever she is on screen. Kiana Tom's severely limited acting abilities are all too clear in Universal Soldier: The Return, and the fact that her brief period of screen time actually stands out says a lot about her.\nHeidi Schanz is also frustrating. As the damsel in distress of the story, Heidi Schanz has no charisma whatsoever. The character is annoying enough in the first place as she is an ignorant reporter who drags herself into a bad situation, but the heavily archetypal nature of the character and excess of repetition in her dialogue makes her annoying very quickly. Because of this, it would be far more appealing if her character Erin Young was actually killed. The fact that Heidi Schanz creates the complete opposite effect in her character is not completely her fault, but she has no gimmicks to add to the film's slight chance of success as even a guilty pleasure.\nBrent Hinkley is supposed to supply the comic relief in the film, but as the experience is incredibly unfunny and his only real claim to fame as an actor was a notable stint on one episode of Seinfeld, he has nothing to boost his credibility. He is not the only Seinfeld actor in the film as Daniel von Bargen is given a prominent role in Universal Soldier: The Return and manages to act better due to his natural ability to take on a commanding role, but he is another actor severely limited to playing an archetype without the experience to transcend it all.\nReally, the only cast member with the slightest bit of value aside from Jean-Claude Van Damme is Michael Jai White. His acting charisma is the furthest thing from rich, but his handsome demeanour and strong fighting style make him appropriate for the part. And since he is the most robotic character of the film he feels the most legitimate in the part. His attempts to be antagonistic are befitting, even if they are extremely cheap and more valuable for their unintentional comedic value than anything else. Overall, it is just worth brief appeal to see Michael Jai White go against Jean-Claude Van Damme.\nBill Goldberg's stature and cheesy delivery of his lines are also slightly appealing at times, even if its because they add to the value of the film as being occasionally entertaining for its guilty pleasure appeal.\n\nBut despite the small amount of appeal in the presence of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Michael Jai White as martial artists, Universal Soldier: The Return is more incompetent as a sequel than a genuine film, which is sad considering how rooted in subpar storytelling and generic action it already is.",

Rachmil, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Allen Shapiro\n\nDirected by \tMic Rodgers\n\nGiving sequels a bad name is this absolutely ridiculous sequel to Roland Emmerich's 1992 sci-fi actioner UNIVERSAL SOLDIER that somehow managed to get a theatrical release and drum up half of its squandered $19 million budget, presumably on the waning box office draw of returning star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Even the presence of talented martial arts actor Michael Jai White, who was stuck in career purgatory after starring in SPAWN two year prior could not salvage this cinematic disaster. It provides the perfect example of what happens when a filmmaker neglects sound plotting, clean editing and acting fundamentals in favor of mindless explosions, shootouts and fighting sloppily cut together and drowned in irritating metal music. Van Damme has starred in a fair number of disappointing action films but this is easily one of his worst as of 2010.\n\nUNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN is the first solo directing gig for veteran stuntman and second unit director Mic Rodgers, a professional whose experience in handling action sequences extends to major films like BRAVEHEART, MR. & MRS. SMITH, NATIONAL TREASURE, and APOCALYPTO. It's also the last film he has directed which isn't surprising given how badly the direction of this movie is. Like the original film, THE RETURN is essentially a rip-off of better sci-fi movies but with the introduction of a rogue supercomputer it seems like the creators aren't even trying to mask their lack of creativity in the slightest.\n\nSporting a bit of gray, Van Damme returns to the role of Unisol Luc Deveraux but this time he has been fully rehabilitated from an emotionless killing machine into an ordinary human with a daughter and a sense of humor. Like a freed slave choosing to work as a slave master, he now works freely for the government, helping them to train other Unisols. Everything is fine and dandy until the government decides to cut costs by shutting down the program. When a \"HAL 9000? supercomputer character at the Unisol facility named S.E.T.H. (Michael Jai White) learns of the cancellation it goes into self-preservation mode and begins to reprogram the Unisols. As they begin to take over the facility, Luc, now joined by another nosey TV reporter (Heidi Schanz) struggles to stop S.E.T.H. and his Unisol army. To make the struggle more tangible, S.E.T.H. conveniently downloads himself into a Unisol body which allows martial arts movie fans to witness a screen fight between Van Damme and White which presumably would be a lot more exciting than watching Van Damme roundhouse an off switch.\n\nProblems with THE RETURN begin with its ludicrous script by writers William Malone and John Fasanco. It takes a cue from the completely forgettable TV-movie sequel UNIVERSAL SOLDIER II: BROTHERS IN ARMS by giving Unisols personalities, whereas in the original film these genetically modified super soldiers had lost nearly all sense of their humanity. This is best evidenced by a Unisol named Romeo, played by buff pro wrestler Bill Goldberg, who develops a smarmy rivalry with Luc that takes on added dimension when he is reprogrammed. Lack of personality was one of the few compelling elements about the Unisols because it made us pity their loss of humanity and free will, at least for Luc. In THE RETURN they're reduced to smirking, wise-cracking characters fit for a cartoon series for children. Yet the whole movie is more or less directed like a cartoon so at least there is some consistency here.\n\nAll acting across the board is uniformly dreadful. Even Daniel von Bargen, a usually dependable character actor portraying an Army general, struggles with his role. That means Van Damme and White don't stand a chance. The worst performances come from the women, notably Schanz as Luc's reporter friend and former ESPN fitness guru Kiana Tom as Luc's friend who hilariously gets turned into a female Unisol in a very bizarre bit role that appears to have been trimmed down. The monotone delivery of both women makes Ally Walker's turn as a stereotypical news reporter in the original UNIVERSAL SOLDIER look like an Oscar-caliber performance in comparison. Likewise, no praise can be spared for the actor portraying an obnoxious computer hacker who aids S.E.T.H. in claiming his body although that has more to do with the script which produces yet another cartoon character.\n\nAs with most action B-movies, many of the film's flaws could be forgiven so long as the action is good. That's not the case here. While there is plenty of mayhem in the film it's poorly arranged and edited with little suspense or reason behind it. For instance, the opening sequence is an elaborate jet ski chase that could have been the lead in for a low-budget James Bond movie but it makes little sense when you discover why it's happening. It's a flimsy gimmick like most of the action in the film. The gunplay is bland, explosions are cheesy and worst of all, the fight work is mutilated by confusing and excessively chopped up editing. The end fight between Van Damme and White represents a career low for both actors but blame again falls squarely on the direction and editing that completely destroys what could have been a decent match between two skilled screen fighters.\n\nFor their subsequent sequel UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENGERATION, father and son Peter and John Hyams pretty much ignored both TV sequels and this regrettable feature film sequel which was a good idea. Like the HIGHLANDER series, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is a solid action B-movie that has largely been maligned by most of its successors. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN is good for an unintended laugh but that's about it.",

Das gerÃ¤t natÃ¼rlich erneut auÃer Kontrolle, und der Aufstand der untoten Soldaten muss in finsteren Fluren und Lagerhallen ausgefochten werden. - BestÃ¼rzend ist an diesem Sequel weniger der Umstand, dass es fÃ¼r hÃ¶chstens ein Zehntel des Budgets der Vorlage entstanden sein mag, man dies an allen Ecken und Enden spÃ¼rt, auch nicht, dass das Skript (von William Malone) nicht eben ein Hauptposten im Budget gewesen sein mag.

            "content": "Believe it or not I was looking forward to this film when it was released. First of all I liked the original Universal Soldier, second it had the return of Van Damme, and third it was the franchises return to a theatrical film after two ultra lame TV made sequels in 1998. Even the title got me excited...\"The Return\". I thought it was the return to what made Universal Soldier enjoyable, the same enjoyable factor that the two TV made sequels buried in a well, 50 feet Deep, covered in concrete then had a house built over it. As you can tell by my rating my childhood dream of actually having a decent Universal Soldier sequel came to a crashing halt.\n\nThe film's plot completely ignores the previous TV made sequels and thankfully so. The title even ignores those lame entries by having no number. I usually dislike sequel titles that use a subtitle and no number however I an ok with it for this film. You couldn't call it \"Universal Soldier 2\" because one already existed and that would just confuse the shit out of people. You also couldn't call it \"Universal Soldier 4\" because that would mean they would have to acknowledge that II and III exist and trust me, they shouldn't be acknowledged or remembered. So instead the film opens after a ultra lame title sequence with Van Damme on a Jet Ski with what looks like a handful of universal soldiers on his tail. It ends up being a training exercise and Van Damme, whose character is now completely back to acting like a normal human being, is the man in charge of training the UniSols for battle. The UniSols are all run by a central computer named SETH. Once SETH gets word that the Universal Soldier program is going to get shut down, he goes all Hal 9000 on their ass by trapping every crew member in the building and releasing the Universal Soldiers to wreck havoc.  SETH later gets its consciousness transferred to a human body (in the form of Michael Jai White) and predictably it comes down to a showdown between him and Van Damme.\n\nDespite being a theatrically made film with a higher budget, this sequel threw everything it had going for it for making an entertaining sequel to B-action classic in the toilet. Everything about this film is God awful! The plot....it's just Hal 9000 having a temper tantrum and killing people with re-animated soldiers. The acting is also atrocious. It's a sad day when Van Damme is actually one of the better actors in the lot. WWF wrestler Goldberg makes his film debut as the muscle soldier for SETH and it proves he should stick to television entertainment and keep his greedy little hands out of feature films. The Rock he is not! Director Mic Rodgers is a stuntman turned director and it shows. He gives the film a flat, direct-to-video look and fills the film with moronic sequences. The films three ultimate lows he filmed includes a sequence when SETH on a computer monitor types \"on the other hand, FUCK YOU\" complete with a caricature of a hand flipping the computer programmer off. The second sequence has our heroine ride on the back of Goldberg down a stairway like a sled, slamming his head through a cinder block wall. The third sequence has Goldberg actually tear off his shirt and use his signature wrestling spear move on a soldier. I actually felt a little sick at the complete stupidity infecting my living room from my TV screen.\n\nDirector Mic Rodgers would never direct again and I thank God for that every single day. He had the chance to reclaim the B-action glory of the first film that was wrecked by to TV movie sequels and he failed making this theatrical effort even worse than those two previous abominations. I never for one moment thought this franchise could get any worse but it did and the Universal Soldier franchise deserved to die. It actually did kill the franchise for 10 years until one day I was shocked by another sequel on the DVD shelf entitled Universal Soldier: Regeneration. I was fooled 3 times into seeing Universal Soldier sequels and all I got was a shit sandwich and I was not going to take a fourth bite. However thanks to my brother I gave it shot and was pleasantly surprised. People like me who have given up on the franchise are still recommended to see the next entry, even if it means skipping the first three ultra shitty sequels.",
