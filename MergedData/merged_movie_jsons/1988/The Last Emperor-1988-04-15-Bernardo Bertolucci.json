            "content": "\"The Last Emperor\" is a near perfect film.  It was nominated for nine Oscars in 1987 and it won nine (including the Best Picture Oscar).  The movie is about the life of Pu Yi (John Lone), China's last emperor.  In spite of becoming emperor at the age of three, Yi's reign was more of a burden than anything else.  Yi would ultimately end up living an unsavory life of imprisonment which is heartrending to the viewer.  \"The Last Emperor\" is visually stunning.  The minute details are amazing.  However, the story stands up high as well.  Historically accurate for the most part, \"The Last Emperor\" is easily one of the top 10 films of the 1980s and overall an exceptional achievement in every cinematic department known to man.  5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci's \"The Last Emperor\" is a monumental, perfect film, and stands as one of the great artistic achievements in any artistic medium. Told in a complicated flashback/ flash-forward style, it's the story of Pu Yi (born 1906) who was the last absolute monarch of China. During his lifetime he falls from the Lord of Ten Thousand Years, the emperor/God of billions of Chinese, to an anonymous peasant worker in communist China. Pu Yi was the child emperor from 1908 until the Chinese revolution in 1911 when he had to abdicate. He was allowed to remain in the Forbidden City but was stripped of his power by the communists. He was expelled from the city in 1924 by a warlord. In 1932, Puyi was installed by the Japanese as the ruler of Manchukuo, a puppet state of Imperial Japan. At the end of World War II, Pu yi was captured by the Soviet Red Army and turned over to the Chinese communists. Considered a traitor, he spent ten years in a reeducation camp until he was declared reformed. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens.This film vividly portrays the change from the imperial and religious traditions of ancient China to the godless totalitarianism of modern communist China, so the film is, on one level, the story of China's revolutionary transition from imperialism to communism. Visually the film is stunning especially the scenes in the Forbidden City. It was the first film to receive permission to film in the Forbidden City.The film can be enjoyed on the first viewing but really demands more than one viewing and some knowledge of history. In this respect it resembles Akira Kurasawa's masterpiece \"The Seven Samurai. The cast includes John Lone as emperor Pu Yi, Joan Chen, and Peter O'Toole. The film won 9 Oscars including best director and best film. A must see on DVD widescreen or in the theater.",

            "content": "The Last Emperor is a truly larger than life film telling us about a life of a human, but not just any human, the Emperor himself. He's also not your normal emperor, he's the Last Emperor of China, his name is Pu Yi. He lives his life however he wants to and he sort has a larger than life persona. In just his late 20s, he stood at the throne ruling over one of the largest nations on Earth, with the most people on Earth. He controls and commands the lives of nearly Five-Hundred Million people. Throughout his abdication, his decline and dissolute lifestyle; his exploitation by the invading Japanese, and finally to his obscure existence as just another peasant worker in the People's Republic.While the film isn't perfect, it is certainly beautiful and a visual treat for anyone. Bernardo Bertolucci's cinematic biography of Emperor Pu Yi is an emotional, beautiful and astonishing film... And it's a massive production which won 9 Oscars, It deserved every single one of them. The film will always be remembered for its size and its beauty. This Asian Masterpiece tells us a story of not only an Emperor, but of a country, which was and still is the largest nation in the world. The Last Emperor is certainly one the Largest, most beautiful films ever created in Cinema.A Monumental Achievement. ~10/10~",

            "review_title": "Heaven's Mandate",
            "content": "Back when I was a university student studying a course in the Far East  we learned the term 'Heaven's Mandate'. It was said that when one  dynasty overthrew another, the mandate from powers above to rule China  had been lost and a new mandate was given to the winners. It was a self  fulfilling idea because if the Mings went out and the Manchus went in  it was because the Manchus now had the Mandate.  The Last Emperor is the story of Young emperor Pu Yi who was the last  Manchu Emperor, crowned at the age of 3 in 1908 and removed in 1911  during the revolution. Pu Yi spent half the rest of his life trying to  gain that back and the other half trying to roll with the punches for  making some very bad choices in trying for the former. By that time if  you want to extend the idea, the mandate now fell to Mao Tse-tung and  the Chinese Communists.  Still very few people had as colorful, as tumultuous, and as epic a  life as Pu Yi as portrayed by Chinese actor John Lone. Whatever else Pu  Yi was, he was a survivor and maybe if he hasn't got Heaven's mandate  any more, he's at least got a heavenly place.  From 1911 until he was kicked out, the young Emperor was still  permitted to run a kind of fairyland kingdom in the Forbidden City area  of Peking which was the exclusive domain of the Chinese Emperors for  centuries. During that time he had an English tutor in Peter O'Toole,  the one major occidental player in The Last Emperor. The relationship  here is similar to the one shown in Seven Years In Tibet between Brad  Pitt as Heinrich Harrer and the young Dalai Lama. Here though the  emphasis is on the pupil not the tutor.  The Last Emperor is an epic international achievement, not possible  during the years of Mao Tse-tung's rule. As a film it received great  international respect winning nine Oscars including Best Picture and  Best Director for Bernardo Bertolucci. That's quite a mandate in and of  itself.  Though the film is more than two and half hours long I guarantee your  interest will not flag. And it really is worth it to see at the very  end the elderly Emperor's meeting with the new Red Guards of Mao's  Cultural Revolution and that bit of symbolism with the cricket.  Absolutely priceless, just as the film is.",

            "content": "'The Last Emperor' tells the story of Pu Yi, as an adult played by John Lone, the last emperor of China. He was three years old when he first sat down on the Dragon Throne. He didn't know anything. The movie tells his story from that moment in flashbacks. We also get to see Pu Yi when the Chinese Communists have the power and he is imprisoned. Because people have taken care of him the rest of his life, from three years old to the moments inside the prison, it still feels he knows nothing.To tell you about the life of Pu Yi would be a mistake. You have to see this movie to learn more about it. The strange thing is that Pu Yi can not do and decide much for himself. He is a hero of a movie where he is controlled by rules and other people. That is one of the reasons not many real things happen. We see the emperor grow up, we see him take an empress and a concubine, and then he has to leave the Forbidden City because the enemy is at the gate.The impressive thing here are the locations and the costumes. Everything looks fabulous and it is not a surprise to find out that the movie was shot on location. With all the extras in those beautiful costumes there are a lot of very impressive scenes. May be the movie is a bit too long for some, it didn't really bother me. Director Bernardo Bertolucci has made a terrific movie.",

            "content": "This is a unique film because it is a unique story. Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi (also known as Henry Pu Yi) was the last emperor of China, who spent most of his early life as a puppet of others. He was then re-educated into an ordinary citizen (He worked as a gardener) in the People's Republic of China. The exciting thing from our point of view is that Henry Pu Yi wrote an autobiography (\"From Emperor to Citizen\"), and it is largely on this book that the film is based.The colourful pageantry in this film is superb - utterly unforgettable. Unfortunately the characterisation is not so well thought out. Only as the cheerful gardener does Pu Yi become anything approaching real - which may be the truth anyway. Otherwise the film becomes a series of historical events, which could well bamboozle anyone who does not know their history, since it is often not quite clear what is actually going on. Having said this, the tragedy of Pu Yi's life - and it was mostly tragedy - comes through well. As well as the end, that although stripped of title, riches, wife, etc, Pu Yi the gardener, the citizen of Red China, is now a free man, comes through well, too.One can find faults with this film - or to be more exact, what one would think are faults - but to list these would prove nothing. This film treads new ground. It is difficult to make, with three actors playing the same person. You have to watch this film, because it will improve the way you view other people, and you will see the tragedy of monarchy: that the monarch himself becomes little more than a specimen in a zoo - rather like the cricket kept in the jar underneath the throne. It will also whet your appetite to read \"From Emperor to Citizen\" which contains much information that the film could not show.",

I'm not sure what the non-director's cut was, because the version I saw was the director's cut, but it was absolutely fantastic. Not once did I think that the nearly four hour run time was too long because the story was so compelling, the direction brilliant and the acting engaging.  I find it hard to believe that it took me this long to see this film, and I also find it hard to believe it is not in the IMDB Top 250.  Its Best Picture and Director honors were well-deserved, and the Oscar-winning score is amazing.  I'll admit that I was left hanging a bit in regard to the Emperor's wife, but that is the only thing that I can remotely find slightly lacking in this film.  An outstanding film, The Last Emperor is entertaining, informative and important.--Shelly",

The cinematography is stunning, as are the scenery, editing, costumes and sets. In fact, it is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen, and I've seen a lot. Not only that, it wonderfully juxtaposes the pre and pro-revolutionary Chinese worlds.The music is beautiful and adds to the charm of the film as well as having an authentic flavour. Bertolucci's direction is superb, the story is engrossing and I rarely found it dull over the (almost) 3 hour duration and the dialogue is thought-provoking.The acting is most excellent. John Lone is truly remarkable in the lead, it is a very difficult and multifaceted role and he copes brilliantly with it. Also remarkable, perhaps even more so, is the great Peter O'Toole, whose is very charming, graceful and eloquent.Overall, a beautiful and arresting film, one I found myself admiring rather than adoring first time, but now it is becoming a favourite. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I guess I'm the only one who watched this from a worn out-of-print VHS copy. No matter what the quality, THE LAST EMPEROR is arguably among the best of the foreign pictures. The sights and sounds of The Forbidden City are sharp and beautifully screened right on with the provocative events that unfold the coming-of-age life of Pu Yi. It has plentiful moments including his romantic affairs with concubines and how he learns the way of the world as a child. His chronicle of a young emperor boy paints a colorful picture for the first half, only leading to more conflicting matters later, which is the most exciting part. Don't expect to see heads getting chopped off, like I thought would happen (unless you have the longer DVD version), but the intensity of the talk surrounding it sounds horrifying and true. Nevertheless, the dialogue is clearly mystical. Every minute is a feel-good breeze through crafty cinematic art, but it ends too fast, and the narration from Pu Yi in his prison term could use a lot more detailing. Maybe I'll stick around longer and wait to see the Director's Cut which has more. Definitely a winning treat not to be missed for foreign movie lovers and collectors of premium filmfare.",

            "review_title": "The Last Epic",
            "content": "The Last Emperor, like Once Upon a Time in America, is an epic saga that delves, among various aspects, into the realm of Time and the ensuing effects it has on a human being and his culture as it passes through his lifetime.  The Last Emperor of the Qing dynasty, Pu-Yi, was coronated in 1909 at the age of three and due to his youth ended up being a puppet to his adminstration. Bertolucci successfully shows us a young man who while understandably spoilt by many luxuries of monarchy, is in actuality a tender hearted, independent thinker (not doer) who is passionate about his homeland (Manchuria) and has a ravenous desire for experiencing life in the outside world.  His caged lifestyle in the Forbidden City (Beijing) is definitely a major contributor to this mindset.  From his infancy the director takes us through a chain of historical events that ultimately lead to Pu-Yi being an ordinary man (we know this from the beginning, however flashbacks explain his situation at the start).  However, it is not the desired lifestyle that he sought as an Emperor in his youth.The Last Emperor is breathtaking in its cinematography and Bertolucci's direction is impeccable.  A lot of criticism was directed at his film '1900' (1976) due to its sheer length.  The Last Emperor clocks in at 215 minutes (director's cut) and barring 10 minutes of a marriage related scene, it never lets up.  Bertolucci seamlessly interweaves the flashbacks with Pu-Yi's situation in post-WWII China by providing us with a real life tragedy that epitomizes human weaknesses, vices, love and loyalty.  Here is a film that is a true story but goes beyond mere narration or simple depiction - it is a three and a half hour, non-stop attention grasping journey through the spectrum of humanity that defines our lifetime through the eyes of an unfortunate soul who was a victim of circumstances like many are.  Any questions that the viewer will have concerning an event in the plot will be immediately answered through the rich tapestry that Bertolucci shows when depicting Pu-Yi's imperial life.On a technical note, the acting in this film is brilliant.  John Lone deserved atleast an Oscar nomination for best actor due to his seamless portrayal of Pu-Yi.  He makes his portrayal of a 21 - 60 year old Pu-Yi seem like an effortless act. Through his performance the audience feels an even greater compassion for the last emperor as we come across a man who despite all the hardships he endured was very compassionate and soft centered. The sheer down to earth nature of his character as a 55-60 year old who walks with a tired smile, forever accompanied by his loving brother, is a testament to Lone's ability to portray any age and move the audience.Once again, it takes a Hailey's comet like event for the Academy to nominate someone from the eastern world (or non-British, non-American when it comes to best actor).  The rest of the cast is also brilliant barring Ryuichi Sakamoto (who portrays the one-armed Masahiko Amakasu) who, for the most part, presents us with a classic display of Japanese overacting.  Although I wouldn't call it overacting in a Kurasawa-esque/Japanese film environment, it becomes quite hilarious in a production such as this.This apart, the film is brilliant.  It is the last great epic (yes, Gladiator is very good, but is far from an epic in my mind) and somehow I hope it is rediscovered and re-appreciated as it once was back in the late eighties.While the Oscars have always contrived to ignore the true best picture for most of the last two decades, here is an example of a best picture winner which beat the competition by miles.",

Not to say this movie is bad, but it's often tedious since there is really nothing here to move the plot. The film goes at such a slow pace, but however this film can be incredibly fascinating and the film is enriched with detail. As a history buff, I enjoyed this film as it was because of the historical narrative it induced.Bernardo Bertollucci's film is about the last emperor of China before the warlord age and communist age. The film talks about how Puyi became emperor at such an young age, how he abdicated this throne, and how he ended up as a political prisoner.The acting is really good and we needed good acting to get through a film like this. John Lone does an excellent job as the adult Puyi and really conveys his emotions very well. Peter O'Toole, one of the few Western actors here, does an excellent job as always.Overall, The Last Emperor seems like it does not have in mind to entertain, but to teach. It's a good, fascinating film that talks about changing times and how people must adapt. I was intrigued by this film because the dynasties of China has always impressed me. Is this the film that should win Best Picture at the Oscars? Perhaps not, but this is still a good film to see despite it's tepid pacing. I rate this film 8/10.",

Tradition is at the center of everything and the Emperor is in the middle of it all. Now add the circumstances of the reign. First of all, the great and powerful Emperor can't leave the forbidden city. He is pursued by people willing to die for him, though many are crooks and people of questionable character. You then add the maturity level of the boy given this title Obviously, he has no tools to do what he is supposed to do. His divine right makes it a zoo in the palace. He is attracted to Western culture and want so badly to be a celebrity playing outside the walls of his imposed exile. He gets in bed with the Japanese because it gives him an opportunity to regain power but pretty much brings his undoing. I can't begin to explain all the elements in this film that are so impressive. Others can do that so much better. The incredible time shifts from his incarceration and \"confession\" to a time in China when so much \"strange\" stuff was going on is portrayed so well. There aren't many three hour plus movies I will watch a second time, but this is one of them. The performances by all are so striking. Peter O'Toole is outstanding, as are all the incarnations of the Emperor. This really deserved its Oscar.",

He's separated from his mother for years and his younger brother Pu Chieh comes to stay with him. He becomes obsolete as a child emperor when the country turns into a Republic. R.J.

            "content": "This is somewhat long and generally lacking in excitement, but it's beautifully filmed and it serves as a fascinating look at the life of Pu Yi - the last Emperor of China, who came to the throne in 1908 when he was three years old, and finally died in 1967 as a gardener in Communist China, after serving 10 years in a PRC prison being ideologically \"re- educated.\" Much of the story is told in flash-backs taken from his interrogation by Communist officials in the PRC prison. Much attention is paid to Reginald Johnston's book \"Twilight in the Forbidden City.\" Johnston (played in the movie by Peter O'Toole) was Pu Yi's Scottish tutor.John Lone's performance as Pu Yi was very good. Not surprising perhaps for someone who became an emperor at such a young age, Pu Yi is depicted as one who is used to comfort and used to having his way - a characteristic he seems to have retained for most of his life, although he doesn't really come across as bad or arrogant; just as someone who never learned how to care for himself or treat others as equals. I suppose it would be hard to expect a child who was treated almost like a god from the age of 3 to grow up psychologically well adjusted. He was actually overthrown not much more than a decade after coming to the throne but I appreciated learning that although he abdicated when the Nationalist revolution took place, he retained his title and it seems as though the Forbidden City remained his \"Empire.\" He continued to rule this little enclave within Beijing, much as the Pope rules a little enclave within Rome. That was very interesting.There was a lot of attention to Pu Yi's accession as \"Emperor of Manchukuo\" in 1934. He became a puppet of the Japanese, who placed him on the throne to give Manchukuo a semblance of credibility but no freedom, was captured by the Soviets at the end of the war, and finally handed over to PRC officials in 1950, his transfer to Chinese authority being where the movie begins.Near the end of the movie there's a truly fascinating scene depicting a small portion of the work of Mao's \"Red Guards\" during the so-called Cultural Revolution that was quite sobering. I was disappointed, though, with the way this ended. It chose to conclude on a sort of fantasy scene, where Pu Yi returns to the Forbidden City. I suppose it was meant as a way of saying that at his death he returned home, but I found it a weak ending rather than a heartwarming one, perhaps because while his life was interesting, I can't say that I developed any warm feelings or sympathy for Pu Yi by watching this.",

            "content": "This film is one of only three total Best Picture winners that won every one of the awards for which it was nominated, but strangely enough it received no nominations for acting. I found this odd, since I thought that one of the film's finer points were its performances.In this film, Pu-Yi grows to a man who was deposed as the last emperor of China while still a child, and thus he wanders from country to country as a young man who is wealthy but without purpose. Thus, never really coming to terms with the fact that he is no longer king, he jumps at the chance to sell himself out as a puppet to the Japanese when they offer him the opportunity to rule at least part of China again. As Emperor of Manchukuo, Pu-Yi is blind to the barbarous acts and experiments that the Japanese perform upon his subjects, blind to the fact that his wife has an affair with a servant to produce a royal heir, and most of all, blind to his role as puppet in the Japanese scheme for world domination. Not until the end of World War II does he seem to even have an inkling of what has been going on.Now for the part of the movie to which I really object. Although it is compelling to see Pu-Yi slowly owe up to his responsibility for what happened in China during the Japanese occupation and come to terms with the fact that he is, after all, just a man like any other man, I strongly object to the Maoists as the good-guys in this quest for redemption. The Communist Chinese did the same type of reindoctrination on many other people - among them Christian missionaries, Buddhist monks, and believers in democracy and a free press - anyone who simply got in their way and needed their world view \"readjusted\". On top of that, how the Communists reindoctrinate people in this film is G-rated compared to what really went on in such camps. For details, consult the novel \"1984\". These points are completely whitewashed. Without the flaw of the portrayal of the Communist Chinese as the patient and kindly savers of lost souls this would have pretty much been a perfect film.",

            "content": "The last Emperor of China, Pu Yi, we now understand, was never anything more than a puppet. He wielded absolute power within his real realm -- a gilded cage of a palace -- but could never shape events except for tragedy to himself or to others. We see his life as one unlikely person, the one person that one would have most expect to have been insulated, in a gigantic tragedy -- that of China between the chaotic beginning of what might have been a long reign and the destructive Cultural Revolution of Mao, with coups, warlord rule, World War II, and the Marxist Revolution culminating in the rise of Mao. One recognizes that the pathologies of imperial China never truly died, but merely took new forms in the cult of the Leader. That the scenery is beautiful and hedonism among elites is rife hardly conceals the fact that China was a political Hell.Pu Yi, once the Emperor of the great (but decrepit) Chinese Empire, becomes Emperor of the Forbidden Palace in 1912 before he is expelled in one of many violent revolutions (this one in 1925) in China. We see him doing a few things right, like reforming the Palace bureaucracy from a den of thieves into something honorable. He gets a superb adviser in Reginald Johnston, who gave him the confidence to be a political figure -- even a good one -- in the happiest time of his life. Johnston leaves as Pu Yi is expelled from the Palace, and eventually falls under the spell of the Japanese, who rip Manchuria from China and find someone willing to rule it in an enlightened manner -- himself. The Prime Minister of his choosing is killed, and Pu Yi becomes a puppet ruler of a contemptible entity. It's just like the old days, only the intriguers are worse -- far worse. The decrepitude of the system sets in at the first moment. As Emperor he can only accede to what his Japanese overlords demand. At the end of the war he is arrested by the Soviets because he dallies too long on unfinished business -- and after the 1949 Revolution he is sent back to China as a war criminal and traitor. Rather than being executed (as one might expect) he is sent to prison as a convict.As a prisoner he is incarcerated with some of his former underlings -- war criminals of the Manchukuo puppet state -- who have learned to ape the ideology of their captors, and he runs afoul of those 'fellow' inmates. Ex-fascists make the most fervent communists. All in all, he simplifies and becomes a very ordinary man in a society that punished anyone who challenged anything that the regime didn't want people to challenge. Pure puppet? Not quite. A dupe who never left when the going was good -- if the going was ever good -- and that is exactly what the Imperial role made him. In childhood the ruler of the greatest empire (in population size, that is) on Earth -- in a premature old age, a cipher. Then again, what else did most Chinese ever become in China during the first two thirds of the 20th century become -- ciphers, old before their time, wrecks of no fault of their own, just to survive.",

            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is a glorious epic that almost should be made for someone of a higher stature. In a sense all of the visual splendor that Bertolucci, DP Vittorio Storaro, and all the costume and set and art designers- not to mention the Forbidden Kingdom itself- are a contradiction on a man who spent his life more or less as a prisoner, either by birth or by choice. He was taken from his mother at a very young age, still practically an infant, and basically given an empire, with many servants waiting at any and all command.But then Pu Yi was given an empire that was crumbling due to the historical shift from power of empire to republic, and he became only important as an obscure figurehead in a society that kept him away. Until he was 18 or 19, when he was forcibly ejected from the Forbidden Kingdom by a new system, his whole upbringing was warped. This led then to becoming, by something of his choice (though, as with any drug like the devil opium from his homeland, something he wanted without knowing all the consequences), an installed 'puppet' emperor. And, finally, this led to a real prison, albeit one with a far greater existential means to an end.What Bertolucci charts, brilliantly, is what a man of royalty becomes when he has no power, no real influence (and, if any, as a pawn figurehead for the Japanese), and most importantly with very few actual emotional connections. There's a wet nurse, there's a wife (or two, briefly), and R.J. (Peter O'Toole), but in general there's very little Pu Yi can cling to. It's rather staggering to boot since the director is not entirely after a political message- Maoists are seen as just another wave, towards the end of the film, that's stemmed from the protesters from earlier in the late 1910's- but more-so about what Pu Yi's purpose is in life without real freedom. There are escapist pleasures, like being a Playboy, and even as a puppet emperor there's some escapist element from the gravity of the real situations he's not aware of. As the director said once about the character, which makes some good sense, is that he's a 'Peter Pan character', and with change being reflected as something that goes on to far greater lengths around him than in himself.But is this a Peter Pan story or film? Not quite; it's one of those grandly filmed historical dramas that does the rare step of choosing character over plot (this despite the fact that Bertolucci jumps back and forth between the 1950s prison and the history), but at the same time everything goes like clockwork, staggeringly at times, in terms of the production values. Almost by luck, like with the scenes with little Pu Yi, there's some awesome cinema captured in the unexpected, as the colors spring out, sumptuously, with themes that are quite internal and deeply felt. He also has the luck of having John Lone playing, for the most part, Pu Yi from young adult to old man, a presence that often hides back his true isolation with the markings of a man who's not as strong as he thinks he is (this despite how he acts with his wives, and how he is around the wise and caring Johnston, played by a perfectly cast O'Toole). Lone makes the character sympathetic in ways that would be trickier for a less adept actor with those subtle moments of anguish.Worth seeing for sure in full widescreen, preferably the remastered Criterion where everything's crisp as bacon, it's one of the best films of 1987, and it challenges the perception of the typical 'costume epic'; beneath the veneer of the hundreds and hundreds of extras, the atmosphere behind the walls of the Kingdom or at the prison, and in all the carefully orchestrated moments, there's questions about the nature of power and change in contexts political and personal.",

Here's a film about an emperor, ruler of a quarter of the world in his time, who died a common gardener. It offers unlimited possibilities for visual splendour, of course\u2014the Forbidden City above all, closed off for centuries but here open to our gaze. And it is a history of millions, it seems in the West we can't comprehend China unless it has swathes of conflict.The main narrative device is so good, it boggles the mind that more wasn't accomplished\u2014not just history but a chronicle recalled from many pairs of eyes as our film, Citizen Kane- style. A deathdream, a memory triggered by a newsreel, a contrasting testimony perhaps offered to please. A fancy Scottsman's memoirs, perhaps embellished? Perhaps read by the prison warden to confirm preconceived guilt?A confession before a tribunal, but one we could trust in any way? A truly imaginative mind would've done so much more with the triggers and stirring of untrusted narration. He would've done more with the second consort's disappearance and simultaneous appearance of the spy woman, introducing opium and deluded ego. More, in general, with the shifts inside the memory from gilded childhood where sight begins to dim to the self-delusion of power to loss and humility. To its credit, it's more interesting than I thought it would be after the first hour.But as in Kundun we get for the most part an operatic sort of beauty. Oh there are a few unforgettable images in there, most to do with fabrics and colors. But the eye of the camera is much like the emperor, a dull observer of fancy things. There's no real difference between different voices telling the story, the many concealed desires and quashed dreams that may be pushing through the fabrics, conscious or not, changing what we see as we see it. There's just so much to play with here, it's a shame we end up with merely preserved harmony. But that's also how the Chinese would have it.I can only imagine what transcendent dragons of self Malick and his floating eye would have seen in the flowing silks.",

The camera is rich in every element: framing, lighting, color, movement, composition are all almost elaborately designed. The effect is overwhelming lushness. The place looks far better here than it ever did in real life. In fact, the container is so incredibly rich, one wonders why the contents are so thin.And the reason I think is simply Italian filmmaking sensibilities. Beautiful is enough. The actors themselves are beautiful, and the idea of the historical sweep has a sort of beauty. But the actual story makes one wonder what was the point. Did anyone really care about it? The same thing can be said of `Kundun,' and that's clearly an artifact of Italian storytelling. The result is beautifully boring. When O'Toole is on stage. our eyes rest a bit and our souls get engaged. But he is already emaciated and a walking tragedy of waste, his own tragedy more hypnotizing in his brief moments than all the other character movements combined.(Quite possibly, the story is weaker here than in most Bertolucci films because of Chinese sensitivities. Why was the ten years in the prison camp not shown as the grueling hard labor it was? Why was the treachery of Mao not mentioned.)There's some slight self-reference when the `invasion' occurs: the invaders bring still and movie cameras.There's one scene that has stuck in my mind for 15 years, when Lone is in bed with his two very lovely wives, covered with an opulent cloth sensually undulating. One of the loveliest and most memorable moments in film. You get mesmerized by the shifting, polychromatic tones and shadows. Then it turns a passionate red, which in fact is the treasure of a 4,000 year old culture evaporating. Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.",

            "content": "\"The Last Emperor\" is an example of what might be called the \"epic biopic\", a filmed biography made on the grand scale. Other examples of this genre are David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and Richard Attenborough's \"Gandhi\", but there is an important difference between Bertolucci's film and either of those examples. T.E. Lawrence and Mahatma Gandhi were historically important figures who, in their different ways, both played important active roles in the history of the twentieth century. Bertolucci's subject, the Chinese Emperor Pu Yi was, despite his elevated birth, an entirely passive figure. (It is perhaps incorrect to call him the \"last Emperor\" as the title was briefly revived for a few months in 1915-16 under General Yuan Shih-Kai). The word most commonly applied to him, in connection with his controversial role as figurehead of the Japanese-sponsored state of Manchukuo between 1931 and 1945, was \"puppet\", but Bertolucci shows that he was a puppet for virtually the whole of his life. First he was the puppet of the Court officials who proclaimed him Emperor as a young child, then after the revolution of 1911 of the warlord-dominated Republican government which for its own political reasons allowed him to continue to live in the Forbidden City in Peking, maintaining a Court and the style of a monarch, then of the Japanese and finally of the Communist regime which sought to make propaganda out of his supposed transformation into a model citizen.Pu Yi was not only a puppet, he was also for most of his life a prisoner, either in the literal or the metaphorical sense. He was literally imprisoned between 1945 and 1950, first by the Soviets and then by the Chinese Communists, but at all times his freedom was restricted by those controlling him. One of the most memorable scenes in the film comes when the young Pu Yi attempts to leave the Forbidden City to attend his mother's funeral but is prevented from doing so by palace guards who slam the gates shut. A deliberately similar scene occurs later in the film when he, now ruler of Manchukuo, is prevented from leaving his palace to visit his wife in hospital by his Japanese handlers.Despite Bertolucci's own Marxist sympathies and the fact that the film was dependent on the goodwill of the Chinese authorities, it does not really try for a consistent political interpretation of Chinese history, but concentrates very much on the character of Pu Yi himself. While in prison, Pu Yi complains to the prison governor that he is only being kept alive because he is useful to the Communists. The governor, presented as a relatively decent man despite the totalitarian nature of the regime he serves, replies \"Is that such a terrible thing, to be useful?\" This is meant as a kindly rebuke, but it begs the questions \"useful to whom?\" and \"useful for what purpose?\" Certainly, to have served the interests of two brutal regimes, the Japanese militarists and Mao's Communists, is nothing to be proud of, but at least Pu Yi's talent for making himself useful meant that he managed to survive (when many did not) during some of the most turbulent epochs of China's history.The film is not told as a straightforward linear narrative; it starts with Pu Yi being handed over by his Soviet captors to their Chinese allies in 1950, and continues by inter-cutting scenes set in prison with flashbacks telling the story of his previous life. This technique enables Bertolucci to contrast the austerity of Pu Yi's captivity (although I would agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that life in a Maoist labour camp would in all probability have been much harsher than shown here) with the magnificent, if empty, splendour of life in the Manchu court and his decadent, luxurious life after his expulsion from the Forbidden City.The film won a number of Oscars, including the awards for \"Best Picture\" and \"Best Director\". I am not sure that it was the best film of 1987 (my personal preference would have been for John Boorman's \"Hope and Glory\"), but it is nevertheless an excellent one. What surprised me was that it did not receive a single Oscar nomination in the acting categories, although in my view it could have had three or four, Best Actor for John Lone as Pu Yi himself, Best Actress for Joan Chen as his tragic, drug-addicted Empress Wan Jung, and Best Supporting Actor for Peter O'Toole as Pu Yi's Scottish tutor Reginald Johnstone (and possibly also for Ying Ruocheng as the prison governor). Around the time this film was released, the lovely Joan Chen was widely tipped to become a major Hollywood star; that she has never really done so might suggest that leading roles for Oriental actresses are as hard to come by as they were in the days of Anna May Wong.If I have a criticism of the film, it was that it did not explain things enough and expected its audience to have a wide knowledge of Chinese history. My comments are based upon the 160 minute version; I have not seen the 219 minute director's cut, although I would be very interested to do so. A running-time in excess of 3\u00bd hours might well be justified if one's subject is the history in the twentieth century of the world's most populous nation. Bertolucci has made some horribly boring films, such as \"Last Tango in Paris\" and \"The Sheltering Sky\", but \"The Last Emperor\" is a fascinating one. 8/10",

A person of importance by birth perhaps, but someone who ultimately observes history pass him by, preferring to watch things happen instead of making things happen. The picture is a study of a man attempting to reconcile personal responsibility with a political legacy, but the ramifications of Pu Yi's (John Lone) life didn't resonate with this viewer. The most artistic elements in the movie for me include the production design by Ferdinando Scafiotti and Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, capturing the harsh beauty and elegance of Peking's fabled Forbidden City. As other reviewers have noted, the movie's near three hour run time also plays on one's attention span, and I'm generally fairly patient by nature.

The story gets told as a flashback, with the imprisoned Puyi remembering the different stages of his life. The Communists charge him with collaborating with the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, but this new government has become just as bad. There has been no change in China's politics from the imperial era to the republican era to the communist era. As emperor, Puyi was confined to the Forbidden City, and now he suffers a new kind of confinement.Bertolucci makes use of colors the same way that Stanley Kubrick did, adding up to a most impressive movie. It won nine well deserved Academy Awards including Best Picture. John Lone puts all his effort into the role of Puyi, and has fine support from Joan Chen, Peter O'Toole, Victor Wong and others.

It also spurred me into researching a little more Chinese, as well as Japanese, history.  I think I should note here, there are some great books to research on the life of Pu Yi.  There is in fact a book; \"Twilight In The Forbidden City\" by Reginald F. Johnston as well as \"From Emperor to Citizen\" an autobiography by Pu Yi himself.  I'll list some titles and where to find them at the end of my \"comment\".This \"oblique\" angle that I'd like to take is on the emotional impact of the film.While I found the film informative and well made, I also found it conveyed an emotional emptiness, and maybe even sadness.  I was distraught at the end of the film.  In short: It made me feel that here is a man who was somebody, and at the end of his life he has nothing.  He lost everything he ever had, and died alone.While everyone may get something different from the film, they undoubtedly will find similarities with other viewers as well.  I almost wish some creative license were taken to end the film on a happier note.Although, I found it sad, solemn, and many times it made me feel just empty like I wasn't sure what to feel but I wanted anything to fill the emptiness, I also found it compelling.  Not many other films have so made me want to learn more about the history, and people in a film.That's my review.  And as a final note: while my review may have had a somewhat down tone to it and may have even left some people feeling like the review is a bit empty or unfinished, I also hope it compelled people to think a little differently about \"The Last Emperor\" and maybe even spur some of you to do a little of your own research on the people and places in the film.Books:Twilight In The Forbidden City by Reginald F.

The first time I watched the film I knew nothing of the history but the writing was strong enough that I able to following the political intrigue and the personal story of life long prisoner. The script does a remarkable job balancing the flash backs and telling the story of Pu Yi's last ordeal in political rehabilitation.Now, don't get me wrong the film is absolutely grand in places. The cinematography especially is beautiful. Further, it has a little bit of color coding. (i.e. the rehabilitation prison is washed out blue and grey, the Forbidden City is gold and black, etc.) to help orientate the viewer.

The Last Emperor is a grand story, from 1908 to mid 60s about the last emperor of China.Told in flashbacks Puyi (John Lone) is a prisoner of the People's Republic of China, he is charged for be a collaborator with the Japanese in Manchuria. As a child Puyi was crowned the emperor of China at the age of three. The film explores his youth in the Forbidden City, where he is pretty much a prisoner who is not allow to be outside in the real world or be with children, to being a brat who can do whatever he wants but with no understanding of the political situation outside his walls, to a smarter young man who wants to reform his court and being tutored by Reginald Johnston (Peter O'Toole). After being removed as the emperor of China he ends up becoming the puppet of emperor of Manchukuo for the Japanese, with his relationship declining as he desires some sort of power.The Last Emperor is very much like a David Lean film, shot in a similar style, matching his scope on a grand scale and tackling a story he would have handled. The Last Emperor's setting in a Chinese prison was very much like the framing device was very much like the one used in Doctor Zhivago. Visually Bernardo Bertolucci and his cinematographer Vittorio Storaro do make a great looking moving, with large colourful scenes in the Forbidden City to the grab greyness of a Communist Prison. Bertolucci shows a really interesting culture within the Chinese court and there are big ideas about how isolation and a boy being told that he is going to rule and do what ever he wants can really mess up someone's childhood. As a child Puyi was a brat but there is sadness and lonely because he can not be with children, nor be with his mother, resulting with him relying on a wet nurse at an old age. There are also ideas of a child who is meant to be a ruler but obviously has no understanding of the political situation, because of his age and his councillors lie to him. As he gets older he is more politically enlightened and want to be a reformer, but again there are ideas that he still wanted to be a ruler, therefore he ended up in leagues with the Japanese. Bertolucci uses some clever imagery, such as hearing a protest outside the walls of the Forbidden City when the troops start to fire at them, showing both Puyi isolation and powerlessness, as well as the political turmoil that China was suffering. and the coronation of Puyi as emperor of Manchukuo is at a windy, empty mound, a symbol that Puyi was hollow figure for the Japanese: but he was wanting to rule for the good of his people. Another powerful image is when Puyi tries to cycle out of the Forbidden City, seeing Beijing/Peking and the guards shut the gates in front of him. To add to the atmosphere Bertolucci with his composers also employ an excellent Chinese sounding score throughout the film.There is an excellent cast, giving performances like in a Lean film. Lone was excellent as the Emperor and though it was a weird casting an English man to play a Scot (and not even bother doing an accent), O'Toole was very strong. Ying Ruocheng too gave a good performance as the prison governor and even though it was a very small role, I loved Ric Young as a harsh interrogator. The child actor were very good and confidence in their performances, with Richard Vuu being very sweet as the 3-year-old version of Puyu. Joan Chen was assured (and lovely looking) as Wan Jung, starting out a nice young woman who likes Puyu for being an intelligence young man but slowly destroys herself with opium. I personally would have preferred to have seen the film in Chinese languages but because it was in English the film can appeal to a wider audience: plus my favourite film is Schindler's List which in theory should have been made in German, so I can't really complain.To anyone who is interested in history or Chinese culture then The Last Emperor is a must see for you. It is also an excellent film if you like Lean films like Doctor Zhivago, Lawerence of Arabia and The Bridge over the River Kwai and the Spielberg film Empire of the Sun.",

            "content": "The Last Emperor (1987) was a western look at the fall of the Manchurian Dynasty, the last piece if ancient China. The Manchu's emperor would later become a prisoner of his own environment. In the latter years of his life, he would remain ignorant of the warlord period and his corruption of \"power\" when he would become a glorified puppet of the Japanese Empire. After the end of World War II, the Emperor Pu Yi would later become a prisoner of war in a Chinese \"re-education\" center. He would have to answer for his crimes and be reformed so he could live in a new society.Pu Yi is the ultimate survivor and has managed to escape with his life on several times. He has watched those around him die and sacrifice themselves just so he could live another day. Eventually, Pu Yi learns to live with others and renounce his privilege life and become a comrade of brothers within Mao's China. One thing that I didn't like about this movie (besides playing around with the facts) was most of the actors spoke in thick accents and broken English. To make it as realistic as possible they should have used sub-titles and have the actors speak in their native tongues. A film of extraordinary magnitude. I would also like to recommend the Hong Kong production of Yoshiro Kawashima. She was the last crowned Princess of Manchuria who's life evolved around the activities of Pu Yi. But she wasn't as lucky as Emperor Pu Yi (or was she?).Highly recommended (despite it's flaws).",

            "content": "Wow, nine Academy Awards is pretty impressive....at least until recent times when \"political correctness\" took over at the Oscars. This movie had nothing to do with anything PC, but it had lots in common with Academy Award winners in the last two decades - the public didn't like it. It was a bomb at the box office, and has been discontinued on DVD, as well, at last reports.Anyway, I came into it with a feeling of optimism but wound up disappointed, too, with my look at in on VHS. However, I didn't give up, buying the DVD with an extra 54 minutes on it. I really, really wanted to like this film....but, once again, I found myself just plain bored with it all. That's the major fault with the film: it's doesn't grab you, get you involved in the story and the characters. After an hour and a half, it's \"who cares?\"Too bad because the story is filmed in a fascinating place, China's \"Forbidden City,\" and features a cast of thousands and some spectacular costuming. The Asian colors of orange, yellows, purples, reds, etc., makes it a color feast. The acting, led by John Lone, Joan Chen, Peter O'Toole and others is fine, and the language is very tame. The problem is everything is too tame, and it shouldn't be with all it has going for it.",

            "review_title": "This Emperor Does Have Clothes",
            "content": "The poster of \"The Last Emperor\" shows a chubby little boy in ceremonial dress with the majestic palace of the Forbidden City in the background. While richly evocative, it will probably give the wrong idea to the audiences expecting 'another' costume historical drama, or one of these sweeping Oscar-swiping epics. Not to mention that the last emperor of China doesn't play in the same league than Gandhi or Lawrence of Arabia, as far as historical magnitudes go.But it's precisely because the last emperor of China wasn't exactly an icon or a major history player that his story works on a narrative level, he's passive enough to be a foil to the more turbulent history of China, but strong-willed enough to drive the story within his own 'limited' power. Yes, 'limited' is the word and what an irony for the ruler of the largest and most secular Empire in the world to have spent his whole life powerless. Indeed, summoned to the Forbidden City as a toddler, his childhood coincided with the Republican era where his power never exceeded the limits of the Forbidden City\u0085 which didn't prevent him from an imperial upbringing with its gallery of bowing servants and playing eunuchs. These scenes look like your typical history epic material except that Bertolucci makes the right choice by telling the story through flashbacks. It actually opens with the arrest of Pu Yi (John Lone) after World War II and his transfer to Funchu Prison as a War criminal and traitor. One would think that death is the penalty awaiting him, he even tries to precedes his executioners by cutting his wrists, and feeling a washbasin with such a symbolic red, but People's Republic of China has other plans for the last living remain of the old order. Pu Yi is coerced into confessing his crimes, and his collaboration with the Japanese regime whose actions against Chinse people have been overshadowed by the Holocaust.Pu Yi's motives become all murky yet captivating from a narrative level: was he driven by ambition? Was he holding a grudge against the Republic that dethroned him? Bertolucci doesn't take a specific side apart from showing a man who's been out of touch all his life, and one-step behind the march of history. There's a crucial moment during his reign over the puppet state of Manchouko, where he makes a speech meant to assert the independence of the country, the Japanese diplomats leave the place, followed by the Chinese staff. Pu Yi realizes that a ruler of men, he'll never be. This scene occurs at the two thirds of the film but it adds a new tragicomic dimension to all the protocol and ceremonials from the first act.Indeed, what makes \"The Last Emperor\" such a compelling story is that the film never seems to 'endorse' what it shows, it clearly has a stance over the imperial over-zealous decorum, and as viewers, we can only empathize with Pu-Yi when he transitions from an obedient kid to the rebellious young man who goes as far as cutting his plait. The character of Johnston, Peter O'Toole as the Scottish mentor, is crucial, because he's Pu Yi's window to the Occidental world, literally opening his eyes since he's the one forcing the imperial establishment to buy the Emperor glasses. He also teaches him how to ride a bicycle, which leads to another crucial scene where Pu-Yi learns he can't even leave the City, another eloquent irony. The fascination toward the Occidental world is obvious and Pu Yi, as well as his new wife Wanrong (Joan Chen) grow progressively Occidentalised until they finally get fully rid of their traditional burden after the Republican coup, and their exile from the City. Later, Pu Yi is shown singing Bing Crosby during a reception, which establishes the long road from that 'golden child' of the start. The film shows natural born outcasts, caught in the turmoil of a time that made their collaboration with Japan tragic because it was inevitable. Pu Yi's concubine becomes a Japanese spy and is quite vocal about it, Wanrong becomes an opium addict, and Pu Yi a traitor to his own country.But the film takes an interesting angle toward the end, it doesn't make the Chinese regime more evil than we'd expect, although it doesn't sugarcoat the devastating effects of the Chinese revolution. One of the camp commandants encourages Pu Yi to confess his crimes, as the step for redemption is the awareness of guilt, but for the real crimes. Pu Yi collaborated with the Japanese but he could never have known about the biological crimes. His re-education reaches a new level when the commandant realizes he can't even tie his shoe or do anything alone, he's put in a cell where he must live in community, and learn the hardship of being one-among-the- others, and obeying certain rules, like to pee in silent on the side of a bucket.Finally, we see him at the twilight of his life, as a free, serene gardener who have embraced the spirit of new China, the film comes full circle with his life when he meets a child in the Forbidden city and tells him he used to be the Emperor, and gives him a pet cricket he received when he first sat on the throne. It's quite fascinating that he was the exception to the rule, the one person who could have been positively affected by the Chinese revolution, since he spent all his life like a living anachronism and was the perfect candidate for a re-education, and a life full of such ironies was a perfect candidate for a biopic.And behind its Best Picture prestige facade, \"The Last Emperor\" is a powerful character study of a man, whose transition echoed his own country, because like China, the Last Emperor had to make his own (r)evolution.",

            "content": "To say that Bernardo Bertolucci aptly over-saw the creation of a masterpiece on an era of history that would definitely change the relationship of nations throughout history, forever, is putting it mildly. That he did it with such artistically factual film-making is to say his success was nearly miraculous. \"Never can be made again\" is one of many \"users\" favorite descriptions of many films. You may conclude that would be a quite accurate statement about \"The Last Emperor\", especially for American film-making......they had nothing to do with it.To amass such a huge cast today would put many nations into immediate bankruptcy, much less movie-producers. Every scene is detailed to perfection; the reign of the last emperor of China wasn't that long ago, so there were unlimited sources for research. That they were made available - and especially shooting on location in The Forbidden City - with the approval of the communist government of Peking in the 1980s is even more miraculous. After centuries of the Qing emperors' reigns, for this gigantic nation to change its manner of governing boggles the mind. One would assume China would just as soon deny that one year of its history, much as Japan is only beginning to admit its Asian atrocities.As we have seen a poverty-stricken nation become a world-power, it's frightening to realize it is an ON-GOING epic - the USA has fought two major wars against China, without putting one soldier on its soil: The Vietnam War and The Korean War, not taking into consideration the countless insurgencies to contain this giant, a major ally during The Second World War. Keep tuned, folk - the drama continues.......I wonder if this period of history is being taught in our schools. It certainly would help students to understand that era more easily just by showing \"The Last Emperor\" to every class, inviting their parents also to attend for a little briefing. There must be millions who had/have no idea these incidences were happening and what catastrophic results that brief era could have hidden in the wings. The Giant is awakening, already an atomic power, with some of the world's greatest cities. \"Made in China\" is no longer a derision - we have seen with our own eyes how intelligent its peasants have always been; the metamorphosis into a nation which does pretty-much as it pleases was possible only because the peasants - until today - were dispensable.Again we are shown what epics were filmed during the 1970s-80s - there are no modern-day movies that can compare to the richness of this film. The luxury therein will never be matched; it is almost unbelievable to realize Chinese royalty and its wealthy citizens lived every day of their lives with such pomp, up to modern-day history.All of the actors who portrayed the emperor were stellar - the closing of the crimson gates at The Forbidden City and at the Japanese palace in Manchuria left no doubt this unfortunate creature was going nowhere but where other powers forced him to go. John Lone was truly robbed of an Oscar. His role clearly depicted the emperor's vulnerabilities to have no power to conduct his own destiny. As a puppet-emperor, he was totally controlled by the Japanese, then subjugated to communist cruelties in Russia, and then brain-washed into the free-but-pitiful citizen he became in his later life. John Lone's acting definitely gave us the character of totalitarian-with-compassion Pu Yi was.Joan Chen and \"the second wife\" were brilliant, as was the \"spy\" who undid their lives. Peter O'Toole, in my opinion, was barely convincing in his role. ALL of the supporting actors/actresses were totally convincing; just the management of such masses of people is astounding. There is so much to see and learn in this movie, I cannot imagine anyone not being caught-up in it. Mark Peploe's script was perfect, the way every script should be. The panoramic cinematography a feast for the eyes - the costuming and choreography and score mesmerizing. I wondered how many people realized, during the early scenes in The Forbidden City, those gigantic headdresses were actually the ladies' hair !!!I sincerely hope there are many other films of this caliber I have not yet seen - would make no difference where they were made. The scope of this movie demands a rating of 15-to-10.",

John Lone did his best, Peter O'toole shines as always and Joan Chen played the broken wife perfectly, but again, this was a touching story of a man you can not be touched with! finally; the film score was great, I enjoyed hearing it repeatedly away from the film itself!",

The wonderful ending alone would make it worth watching that long.\"Epic\" is the operative word here in this Bernardo Bertolucci film about the history of one man and the growth of a nation. The film follows the life of Pu Yi, the last in the line of 2,000 years worth of royal emperors, crowned when he was but three years old. We see him unknowingly abdicate his throne as a boy, held virtual prisoner among the greatest opulence as a teenager, then seduced by the warlike Japanese as a young man, who return him to the throne as a puppet over Manchuria, which they've conquered. This narrative is intercut with his imprisonment and \"re-education\" as a war criminal during the time of Mao-Tse Tung. There's not a great deal of what we normally term as \"action,\" but there is an intriguing story and plenty of glorious sites to see. This panoramic film is as big as China and deserves to be seen.

            "content": "This is a film that is unfairly ignored in the list of the best films ever made. Despite receiving nine Oscars it 1989, it receives little to no attention. There are a few reasons I can think of off the top of my head. The first is that it is a slower and longer movie, and there is not a lot of action or melodrama to break it up, turning off some people. The second is that it was made by Bernado Bertolucci, who is not particularly well-liked in Hollywood for reasons that date back to the movie that made him famous, The Last Tango in Paris, as well as for his hatred of the system.But it is nonetheless one of the most striking and evocative historical epics ever put to film. Some films are ashamed to be connected with actual history. While this is not inherently negative, there is something to be said about a film embracing the history that inspired it. Art and history are often at each other's throats, but they do not have to be. One can piggyback off the other.The only film I can compare to this is Lawrence of Arabia. That film is slightly better than this one, but both are sprawling epics that make you feel like you're in the front of a roller-coaster that's rushing through the past. While that film is more ambitious and better-acted, I actually personally prefer this one more. It's involving and atmospheric and one of the best-shot movies of the century. Every time I pop it in, I am enraptured.There is so much work put into every scene. The makeup, the art direction, the style; this is dedication incarnate. The Last Emperor is like The Lord of the Rings or Titanic: you may not like these movies, but you have to respect how much work went into them on every front imaginable. There are times when I can't believe what I'm seeing wasn't made for quick on the computer, but then I notice how real it all seems.The plot is simple and not the focus. John Lone (as well as a few other actors of varying age) plays Puyi, the titular 'Last Emperor'. Taking the throne as a toddler, Puyi is sheltered from the rapidly changing world around him until he can be sheltered no more and is thrown from power by the Chinese Communists, who take him to a 'political rehabilitation' camp.A lot happens in this movie, but there are not a lot of twists and turns. You just sink in to the movie, sink in to this atmosphere. Breathe in, breathe out. Some people might be bored, but the movie is not boring. Sixty years are covered; sixty of the most interesting years in history. That is not just enough to fill three hours; that is enough to make those three hours interesting. This is the kind of film that you originally only plan to throw on for an hour or so at a time, but grabs you and pulls you in and persuades you watch the rest of it.Interesting fact: this film did not even enter the top 5 at the box office until its twenty-second weekend of release, the weekend after it won Best Picture. That is... really rare. I know this was the eighties, when films hung around the box office as long as that wet smell hangs around a dog, but this was still not common in the least. If not for this unexpected boost, it would be alongside The English Patient, Amadeus, and The Hurt Locker.I cannot believe a film like this was independently funded, but it was. I don't know which is more incredible, the fact that they were able to reach 23.8 million in funds or that a film of this scale was made for that cost. Either way, the fact that this film exists is almost as remarkable as the film itself.Almost.What I love most about this film is how it is able to make you feel a rainbow of emotions by doing very little. The acting and the camera work and the music make you feel what the character is feeling without having to sit through gobs of unnecessary dialogue. There are few better cases for the power of cinema than The Last Emperor.You feel how sheltered he is, and how utopic they are trying to make the palace. You feel how depressed and trapped he is, especially as he grows older. You feel how confused and angered he is when he is forced by his advisors to adopt the old customs even as the world is rapidly changing. You feel his disappointment as he is deprived of a chance to rule just as he is shaped into a good ruler.And without those gobs of unnecessary dialogue, time is freed up for important things, like fleshing out the world in which Puyi lives. With all the clever behind-the-camera work, it doesn't quite feel like a real place but rather like a enhanced, dreamy version of a real place, which I think the effect that they were going for. If it wasn't, then the people who made this stumbled onto genius: this pseudo-surreality makes it seem like a vision that is receding with every passing day, that is quickly fading out of the present into the history books.Kudos to the filmmakers for bringing this story to the masses. Double kudos for going all out and sparing no expense. Triple kudos for making one of the best films of all time.",

While I can quote clich\u00e9s about the \"meaning of film\" all day long, I believe that all movies (whatever the aims and nature) should be enjoyable while watching them and you shouldn't be glad when the final credits roll - indeed you should be sad!Bernardo Bertolucci believes that cinema is mostly vision and atmosphere - and believe me he is master of his limited focus - but there is also a need for a story. Something that passes him by. If we are lucky a story that changes pace, informs, excites and thrills.This film has moments that will stay in the memory forever and when I first saw them as TV clips I thought \"this is going to be something else - an epic.\" However they are simply impressive props and backdrops for a story that would be better told as a documentary. The film opens up on the story of a little boy born with a destiny. Not many people are born with a destiny outside of royalty and they should be treat with sympathy because, while they may seem fated, they also live in a gilded cage. Even if history had not taken over events Pi would have lived a life of quiet impotence - despite the title he would have had no powers and would have had no influence on his countries' affairs. A living and breathing statue. The revolution probably did him the best favour that he ever had.I always think that a life spent on holiday is most intelligent person's version of hell. A life spent on holiday while trapped inside a prison camp must be the worst. Filming took place in the real Forbidden City, but I am not that impressed by it. It could have been built in a studio and we would not have known. Vast amounts of money have been spent and it is all up there on the screen, but that, by itself, doesn't really impress me.I won't go through the changes in the Emperor's life on a stage-by-stage basis (as so many have done) because that would take away some of few things that will carry you through the (very long) movie.It is a comment on the nature of this film that people are quite happy to explain it scene-by-scene as if this doesn't take away anything from it. It does and frankly does a disservice to the film or maybe this is one of these \"great art pieces\" in which such spoiler rules don't apply.Bernardo Bertolucci is pretty overrated as a director and as a story teller he couldn't work on TV. He is a bit of a fossil in that he takes hours to say what could be said in five minutes. The acting is steady, and in Peter O'Toole we have excellence, but I couldn't get inside anybody - they either had a brown nosing or duty-to-do role and no-one is really allowed to be themselves. The acting is - in the main - cold and seems swamped by the oriental mysticism that the director wants us to bath in.This is an important film and well worth seeing, but I wasn't entertained and after the opening - which looks at a unique childhood - I became bored and restless. Usually childhood is most boring part of any biography and the story usually picks up when they take up the sword of whatever made them famous. Here we have boy/man on the road to nowhere or nothing. A sad tale of a boy/man who seemed to have everything but in fact had nothing.Sorry, I was left with a numb brain and a numb bottom - and I didn't even see the \"long\" version! To borrow a very famous review line \"there is so much to admire here that I only wish I could have liked it more...\"",

Although the film bases its story on the true life accounts of the last emperor of China, Last Emperor shows that life can deal one undesirable circumstances and the way one reacts and handles these circumstances determine one's place in history.  Bertolucci's powerful method of storytelling also further enhances the greatness of Last Emperor.   The motif of pursuing a forbidden love that remains out of reach presents a tearful message.

            "content": "This movie is the biography of Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi (commonly known as Puyi), the titular last Chinese Emperor. It is a rare Hollywood picture about the Orient. It takes very few liberties with historical facts and covers his entire life, an impressive feat given the many events that had taken place in and during his lifetime. He was coronated at the age of three and sent to live in the Forbidden city. It was the time when China was transitioning from Monarchy to a Republic. The new government allowed him to retain the title and he was not to leave Forbidden City. Thus began his life as a puppet placed on a seemingly high pedestal by different regimes for their own benefit.Puyi grew up in an extremely unhealthy environment. Separated from his mother when he was a toddler he had no friends, apart from his wet nurse, to give him love and no parental figures to teach him disciple or responsibility. The eunuchs residing at the City had no authority over him and he was at liberty to abuse them with impunity. He grows up to be a product of his circumstances. His has well-meaning plans for Forbidden City and later the people of his native Manchu but he has no idea how to implement them. Instead he becomes even more powerless. To top it all he is misogynistic and vain with a misplaced sense of entitlement. He gets no sympathy from us, the viewers even thought we have seen how we became the person that he is. We hold him responsible for his decisions and non-action.The movie opens with the beginning of Puyi's life post-imperialness, when he was held prisoner. After his release, he becomes a commoner. His time as the Emperor are shown in flashbacks. Ostensibly, he had a better life before. But, is it really true? He now has the freedom he never had before. This movie is as much of a character study as a historical account. What makes this aspect of it work is its strong cast. Richard Vuu, as the toddler Puyi (he gets the movie poster all for himself!), is a delight to the eye and has remarkable acting chops for someone so young. John Lone brings the many internal conflicts, flaws, weaknesses, aspirations and virtues of both young and old Puyi to life. Joan Chen is perfect as the Empress who understands the situation better than her husband but is helpless because she is a woman. Vivian Wu, as Puyi's second consort, makes the best of the limited screen time she gets. Peter O'Toole, as teenage Puyi's mentor, is good as ever. Maggie Han deserves a special mention for making the character of Eastern Jewel, a real life Japanese spy whose life story merits a movie of its own, stand out given that she has very few lines. The only weak link in the acting department is Tao Wu (15 year Puyi).This movie does not make the mistake of treating the Orient as something exotic, something which Hollywood is often guilty of doing. The mores, traditions and beliefs of the people, place and time portrayed in the movie have been well researched and it was shot on location in the Forbidden City scenes. Together they add up to give an authentic feel to the movie. It is a movie that richly deserves its Academy Award for Best Picture.",

            "content": "\"The Last Emperor\" tells the real life story of Pu Yi, who was the last emperor of China before it became a republic. Pu Yi (Played as an adult by John Lone)is brought to the Forbidden City as a child and is made emperor. From that moment he becomes a prisoner of circumstance: He cannot leave the palace and even though he is still the emperor, his power is limited to the inhabitants of the Forbidden City since China is ruled by a republic.Pu Yi wants desperately to escape to the West, starting a new way of life (Going to Oxford is one of his dreams), but he instead escapes into marriage with Wan Jung (Joan Chen) and takes on a concubine (Secondary consort is her title) as well. When he is thrown out of the Forbidden City, he sees a chance to follow his dreams, but instead becomes a puppet for the Japanese, becoming emperor to the republic of Manchuria, resulting in his arrest toward the end of World War II. This results in a new change as he is re-educated and spends his remaining days as a gardener.Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, we witness the sad tale of Pu Yi, an Emperor with no power, only used as a symbol. He had no control of his fate, and was a puppet since the age of 3.Worthy performances by Lone, Chen and Peter O'Toole as Pu Yi's tutor. Winner of 9 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it is a sight to watch and a gripping story to listen to.",

We don't have to see the feces left by his royal highness at 3.The picture comes alive when our little emperor attains adulthood and things begin to happen in history. His collusion with the Japanese government sets off quite a life. John Lone, as the adult emperor, gives a very compelling performance, as does his neglected wife, the unhappy Joan Chen.His life in a Chinese Communist prison after the wall is well done. We see an emperor reduced to humiliation in cleaning toilets and living a very hard life following a 10 year confinement.The picture well shows the Chinese cultural aspects around 1903 and the period of the Kuomintang circa 1911. In retaining the title of emperor, Piu (Lone) allowed himself to be a mere puppet of the Japanese, and when he realized this, it was far too late to do anything.",

Following the life of the last emperor in China, The fact that the film manages to fit an considerable amount of material into an relatively short space of time is an minor miracle, With excellent performances from John Lone as the emperor, Joan Chen as the empress and Peter o Toole as his english teacher. This is truly a work of art but what makes this particularly compelling is possibly the greatest example of cinematography to date by Italian genius Vittaro Storaro. The effect created by him is truly stunning and recreates the emperor's world perfectly, photography that hasn't quite been matched before or since by anyone. Bernardo Bertolucci directs with an sure artist's hand pacing the story and dazzling visuals to perfection. This is also an study of how noone is invulnerable and most importantly, how power corrupts.",

            "content": "\"A successful parasite is one that is not recognised by its host, one that can make its host work for it without appearing as a burden. Such is the ruling class in a capitalist society.\" - J. Read.The 1800s. China is ruled by various emperors and warlords. Exerting their will upon these rulers are the Great Powers (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom and the United States), who accord themselves special privileges, immunities and extraterritorial rights. They carve China up between themselves.Tired of imperialistic powers exploiting their country, countless rebellions spring up. Some target foreigners, others challenge the Emperors, who are Manchurian and so perceived as invaders. Soon, Chinese nationalism is on the rise. This leads to The Boxer Rebellion (1899), in which proto-nationalists dare to take on imperialists. The Great Powers respond by sending in their fleets and troops. The rebellion is crushed.The next major upheaval occurs in 1911, with the Xinhai Revolution. Here China's last Imperial dynasty - the Qing dynasty - is kicked out, and the Republic of China established. Far from a homogeneous class movement, this Revolution is propelled by various disparate groups. In many regions it is spearheaded by the landed gentry, stockholders and the upper middle classes, who oppose the ways in which their assets are being sold to foreign banks (mega banks in Britain, Germany, France, Denmark, even the nefarious J.P. Morgan) by the Emperor in an effort to pay off China's escalating debts. The Revolution ends in 1912 with the abdication of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, China's six-year old \"Last Emperor\". In an instant, 2000 years of Imperial rule comes to an end. The Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) henceforth assumes control of China, though many regions remain under the rule of regional warlords. The Kuomintang spends the next decade wrestling control away from these warlords.Today, most historians steer clear of the word \"feudalism\". Social scientists likewise deem \"feudalism\" a vague or meaningless term. Socio-economic relations under dynastic rule were more complex than is typically thought, they argue, and there is very little that firmly distinguishes contemporary capitalism from the reality of \"actual feudal life\".Such a lack of meaningful distinction is something which the Chinese swiftly come to realise. Royals had been kicked out, but elites, often with ties to the very same foreign powers who brokered deals with the emperors, still skewed things in their favour. And so China swiftly descends into Civil War, forces loyal to the Kuomintang-led government on one hand - supported by hundreds of thousands of troops from America, England and other European powers - and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China on the other. The war began in 1927 and paused briefly whilst both parties put aside their differences to counter the Japanese invasion of China. The Civil War resumed in 1946, after hostilities with Japan had ended. The Civil War then ended in 1950 with the communists victorious and the leadership of the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan, where today they still claim to be the legitimate government of China.In 1949, communist leader Mao Zedong ushered in a new China \u2013 the People's Republic of China \u2013 with its capital in Beijing. Chaos, disorganisation and confusion followed. Millions would die of starvation and due to the ensuing lawlessness. Slowly, however, the communists began to pull things together. Hundreds of millions of peasants were given land, women's rights were advanced, living standards rose, foreign powers were booted, literacy rates skyrocketed, health-care and education were extended to the working masses, and ordinary people were involved for the first time in the political process, and even encouraged (in theory) to continually challenge the revolutionary government. Over time, the more radical tenets of communism would be reversed by market reformists within the communist party, eventually giving rise to modern China; a state-capitalist juggernaut.Bernardo Bertolucci directed \"The Last Emperor\" in 1987. A lavish biopic, the film watches as Emperor Puyi, a young child, cute and innocent, loses all official powers and is barricaded in The Forbidden City. Here Puyi lives a privileged but isolated existence, banned by the Kuomintang from ever leaving his expansive palace. He receives private tuition, is married and dreams of reclaiming his throne.Overlong and hampered by its fidelity to history, \"Emperor\" is nevertheless a lush, spectacular and oft interesting film. It was inspired by the epics of Luchino Visconti, a Marxist whose films were preoccupied with the effects of revolutions on the upper classes. Bertolucci is himself a Marxist. But where Visconti observed as dynasties fade and wither after various social \"reconfigurations\", Bertolucci does the opposite, his emperors desperately clinging to power.The Latin root of \"radical\" is \"to strike at the root\" or to \"target the source\". As such, Bertolucci portrays Puyi as a kind of weed or seed that keeps re-germinating once conditions are right. This ideological contaminant, or parasite, may go into hibernation, may appear to be safely quarantined, it may even appear to be extinct, harmless, cute or benign. But as Bertolucci shows, it craves power and always tries to re-establish itself. Puyi cannot help but infect, infest and grow.And so \"Emperor's\" second half watches as Puyi becomes an adult. He becomes increasingly possessive, treats even free men as his underlings, and eventually forges alliances with the rulers of Japan, who support his puppet reign in Manchuko. The film ends with Puyi removing a cricket from his throne. It's an implausible scene \u2013 the cricket is decades old, having been given to Puyi during his coronation \u2013 but symbolically apt. Associated with growth and harvesting in Chinese mythology, the cricket speaks to the survival of Puyi's brand of power. Like a resilient Hydra, heads may roll, but the beast lives on. Fittingly the cricket is passed to a devout Red Guard, suggesting where exactly China's parasites now reside.8/10 \u2013 See \"The Damned\" (1969).",

Past and present of my birthplace (Russia) is exceptionally rich with biographies of worthy people that have become puppets in the hands of history or some dictator (e.g.Stalin).Now a \"parallel\" interpretation arose. We can think also about \"fate-person\" relations. Our fate is often personalized by the forces of subconscious. Historical and subconscious forces have much in common. Both are very strong and tend to provocation. An attempt to beat them often comes to end in the same way as the attempt of Pu Yi to \"use Japan\". In both cases, information that we have in our struggle is extremely restricted.The last remark. We had all been Emperors in early childhood.

The characters never come to life. Scenes are left undeveloped. The movie suffers from something a lot of movies post 80's are infected with. There is such a great need to move the plot forward to get the narrative progressing that characterization and scene development suffer. This results in the viewer (me) not giving a rat's a$% what happens to anyone in the film. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't. Even the appearance of Peter O' Toole is no help as he plays a stiff upper class British tutor in a film that is already filled with so much stiffness it is in desperate need of his Year of Living Dangerously character to liven things up.

It's also an essay on the corrupting power of an absurdly sheltered life. Following the private and public trials of Puyi, who ascended to the imperial throne before his fourth birthday, it's one soul-crunching onslaught of manipulation after another over the course of several decades. Almost every single member of the cast is either disgustingly entitled or a steadfast, unwavering fanatic to a self-serving cause, including the emperor himself who often falls into both camps. He's naive and misguided, a result of his isolated regal upbringing, but also wants desperately to make a lasting positive mark on the world. It's frustrating to watch his attempts at reform explode on the launchpad over and over again due to the oppressive presence of a corrupt group of advisors, a hamstring he's never able to overcome. Though it has a tendency to linger far too long, the film is drop-dead gorgeous when it's set inside China's famous forbidden city. When later chapters shift to other locations, it drains that life from the screen and the already-dreary story really starts to drag.

Yes, the costumes are grand, the mass scenes are impressive, the music (the Chinese music - not the indulgent American music of the period) is special, the cast is solid, but the impressive aspect of the film is the opportunity to re-visit history in this manner. Especially, today when we are constantly reminded of China's influence in global affairs, it is interesting to recap how that country went from being ruled by a child emperor to the influx of Japan and the wars and the destruction of many of the most beautiful antiquities of China, and became the Republic of China.John Lone is especially well suited as Pu-Yi as an adult as is Peter O'Toole as his teacher RJ Johnson. As one observer noted, 'This sweeping account of the life of Pu-Yi, the last emperor of China, follows the leader's tumultuous reign. After being captured by the Red Army as a war criminal in 1950, Pu-Yi recalls his childhood from prison. He remembers his lavish youth in the Forbidden City, where he was afforded every luxury but unfortunately sheltered from the outside world and complex political situation surrounding him.

It has wonderful authentic costumes and thousands of extras, permission being granted for its filming within the Forbidden City itself, a huge imperial complex of 250 acres. However, it's a film that disappointed me personally. I found it both confusing at the time and forgettable long term.The film relates China's history through the prism of its last emperor, Pu Yi...his birth, brief childhood reign after being crowned emperor at age three, captivity in his own palace, taking of both a wife and a concubine, abdication and decline into a dissolute lifestyle, exploitation by the Japanese as emperor of Manchuguo, re education by the Communists, life as a regular peasant in the People's Republic and death as a humble gardener in Peking's Botanical Gardens. My main complaint, lacking much personal knowledge of the history, is confusion as to the story, especially given the story telling method of both flash back and flash forward. It was all very artistic as opposed to informative, and presumed a considerable background knowledge of Chinese history on the part of the viewer. Although the film painted a vivid and compelling portrait of this tragic historical figure for me at the time, the images left me soon after I departed the theatre so something must have been lacking.",

            "content": "\"The Last Emperor\" takes us through the waning years of Qing China, its decades as a struggling republic, the Japanese occupation of Manchuria during World War II, and the dawn of Red China; all through the eyes of its final emperor, Puyi (John Lone).I loved the sets and the use of extras and the costume design. It gives the movie a very regal feel and contrasts well with the prison scenes set in the 1950s where the communists wear drab gray clothing.It goes really in-depth on a lot of twentieth century Chinese history, which will admittedly be a little hard to follow for those who don't have at least a rough idea of when certain events took place and who the main players were. John Lone gives an excellent performance as Puyi, who's often portrayed as out of his element and who plays a na\u00efve puppet role his entire life. It kind of makes me feel sorry for the guy as he was never really given the freedom to live the life that he wanted, was always kept somewhat in the dark by conniving eunuchs and advisors, and had a lot of the blame of Japanese war crimes placed on him despite his ignorance of it. That being said, he did have a huge ego and wanted so desperately to stay with the traditional ways that he never took the time to notice that the world around him was changing and that a lot of people, including his citizens and his wives (Joan Chen and Vivian Wu) suffered a lot because of his attitude.A great biographical film that sheds some light on East Asian history, which I feel is a neglected subject that ought to have more representation. The politics of that region in that specific time period are very interesting.",

In retrospect, I can't find anything in it that made me sit through it twice. 30 minutes in, it still hasn't gotten moving. It has no forward impulse. The emperor Pu-Yi is such a passive historical figure, it's hard to care about him... or even to relate to him. It's harder still when Bertolucci is done with him. Even as Pu-Yi tries on ill-fitting personas. Even with an editorializing score, telling you where you're supposed to feel something, the movie is numbing and rambling. No amount of shouting Chinese revolutionaries can inject drama into what is hopelessly undramatic and undramatized. You'd think Bertolucci knew his task was to find a throughline for this muddle, but instead he's a muddle amplifier. He's found nothing to dramatize; or perhaps more correctly, his entire dramatizing urge is crushed by his anomie urge. For a Marxist, Bertolucci is way too impressed by opulence, and gleaming surfaces. 1987's brightest; Ryuichi Sakamoto & David Byrne both contribute efforts that did powerfully little for their careers.",

            "content": "The Last Emperor (1987) :\nBrief Review -An ornamental theory to tell the story of an ambitious emperor who did not deserve it. The Last Emperor suggests very much by its title that it is a story of the Last Emperor of the Forbidden City, China who was nothing but an ambitious child who cultivated his own empire, reformed it and destroyed it too. The inception of an idea that he's an Emperor and he can do anything he wishes was done when he was just 3 years old but by the time he grows he finds himself trapped in World War and Republication of China and Japan. The story doesn't really offer anything extraordinary in terms of writing skills but it had to be honest to the available data even if it doesn't fit really in any cinematic or dramatic proportions. And anyways it doesn't really connect to the audience who doesn't know or care much about China and Japan's history. Well, i am one of them. Besides, i had to like to it as a Cinematic achievement, that's a fact. Director Bernardo Bertolucci delivers a very much watchable and interesting film using all the cinematic properties like locations, screenplay, production design, cinematography and gripping storytelling in systematic manners. The performances looked convincing and so does the characters, doesn't matter of they don't stay in memory by the time film ends. It's about spending those 160 minutes without feeling lazy and The Last Emperor succeeds in keeping the laziness away. Overall, it's a very good biopic and even a Fantastic must watch but only if you care so much about China or Puyi's history. Biographies are meant to rule Oscars and this just got lucky otherwise who cares about this film as we do for other memorable Classics.RATING - 7/10*\nBy - #samthebestest",

Pu Yi lived very much in a bubble. He lived in the Forbidden City in Manchuria and was never allowed to leave. China changed drastically while he remained behind the Forbidden City walls such that he never realized he was essentially powerless.While the movie was following this last emperor it was also following China's travails.

He grew up in the Forbidden City, where he played the leading role in a theater without an audience. He was raised and educated to regard himself as a sublime creature, but the cage is a cage even if it is made of gold. When communists took power in China, he gets asylum from Japan, where he continues to maintain the illusion of Emperor while being a Japanese marionette. When the Russians liberate Manchuria, he ends up in prison where he finally begins to grasp the world around him as it really is.Under the baton of Bernardo Bertolucci was born a movie which was nominated for nine Oscars and won all nine. It takes almost three hours, it's slow and not so entertaining, but the depth and strength of this drama does not leave room for boredom. This film is both technically and essentially excellent and I recommend to everyone who did not watch it to make up for that failure.8/10During the film, I had the impression that some parts of it were very familiar, as if I had already watched it, and I'm sure I didn't. It was only on the last scene that I discovered why, because the loan was so large that it could not go unnoticed. Korean film The Last Princess was apparently created after the model of this film. The titles of the films are almost identical, the story has a lot of similarities, and the end of The Last Princess is almost copied from The Last Emperor. The fact is that the stories of the last Korean princess and the last Chinese Emperor by their very nature must have some similarities, but the similarity of these two films is too large to be attributed to coincidence. All other similarities could be accidental, but the end is definitely rip off.",

About ten years or more ago, Joan Chen was a widely known star in China for this picture. Almost every Chinese know it. However, I never saw it before last afternoon. The reason is I'm afraid of I'm too young to get the point of the thick history. So I saw it when I'm sure I have been up to understand history enough. BTW, \"10,000 years\" never means \"he was the king of 10,000 years\", that's a wish. All people wish their emperor could live forever, even 10,000 years(the brothers of the emperor called 1,000 years). Everyone must say it when he or she meet the emperor. That's the rule of each dynastic royalty never change till QING dynasty vanished away. I seem to pity Pu Yi throughout I experience the picture. He was an emperor without any power and enough space. The most unfortunate is he never escape from an invisible cage. At first, he was imprisoned by warlord in Forbidden City and then by Japan military till been a criminal of betrayed motherland. He wants to be a true emperor, he never been released by his soul and ambition, eventually makes him as betrayer and totally puppet. What a tragic character!

            "content": "I am fascinated by history and historical figures. It was and will remain my all time favorite subject of interest. So, I was more than thrilled watching this movie which sheds light on perhaps the most oldest but less understood Chinese dynasty history. The movie is about Pu Yi who was the last Emperor of China because in his life time itself monarchy was abolished and China went public. This movie covers almost all important incidents which occurred in his life right from his birth to crowning as an emperor at age 3, to his love life as well as imprisonment as a war criminal. His story is un-folded in a series of flashbacks and flashforwards. This movie is technically brilliant with superb editing and background music. Camera-work is also of the highest quality. Memorable scenes define the greatness of a movie. This 3 and a half hour long tale has lots of great scenes. The scene where a 11 year old Pu Yi runs after the carriage which has his mother but the gates are shut on him is replicated when the same Pu Yi runs after the car which has his wife at age 30. The final scene where an old Pu Yi has to buy a ticket to enter and sight-see his own palace gave me goosebumps. There are too many of such scenes which makes this otherwise long movie an enjoyable experience. I never felt bored while watching it. Each scene was giving me something. On the acting front, John Lone plays the adult Pu Yi with absolute dedication and understanding. It was as if, this was meant to be played by him. This was a very difficult role. He had to portray not only the arrogance and blue-bloodness of an emperor but also the helplessness and dejection of an average man. Peter O'Toole as the Scottish tutor of Pu Yi impressed with his graceful approach. The rest of the cast also play their parts sincerely. Overall, I was glad that I watched this movie. Rating : 9/10",

            "content": "Bernardo Bertolucci... Wherever I ask anyone about this man, there is usually one answer that appears: the director of THE LAST EMPEROR (1987). This film, made almost twenty years ago, is still so popular that every day there is a place in the world where it is watched. One may ask \"what is so special about it that a film about the last emperor of China became one of the undeniable cult movies?\" The answer, I think, lies primarily in Bertolucci, the director and some of the movie's powerful aspects.THE LAST EMPEROR which, on the one hand, deals with quite a difficult content being a sort of \"vague movie\" filled with flashbacks and flash-forwards, is, on the other hand, a real tribute to what Bertolucci tries to convey in cinema: colors and fascism. The overdose of colors may seem an exaggeration for some viewers while fascism appears to be a wonderful insight into characters' emotional states. The movie, particularly the sequence filmed in the Forbidden City, is full of breathtakingly stunning picture of the declining imperial power of China. This makes THE LAST EMPEROR an impressive epic proportion film and the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro one of the finest found in films. Pu Yi (John Lone), the last emperor, spends his youth years in the Forbidden City where he theoretically rules, but actually plays ruling since his country is no longer the empire it used to be but a communist People's Republic of China. These scenes (actually flashbacks since the film's action starts in 1950 when Pu Yi is already a prisoner) are splendid. Let me mention, for instance, the throne of the Empress widow, Pu Yi's wedding, a sensual love scene between Pu Yi and his two women - the Forbidden City sequence is pure Bertolucci with magnificent entertainment. The rest is a contrasted moody picture and a realistic image of the cruel reality that the main character experiences after the downfall of his power. Therefore, it is a different entertainment filled with director's political evaluations. CAST: The performers consist primarily of Chinese cast, some not famous internationally. Nevertheless, they are all worth attention and the performances in this movie are unquestionably good. John Lone is very appealing as the Son of Heaven, the Lord of ten thousand years, Pu Yi. He perfectly expresses the emotional states of his character, gives a balanced performance of an aging man and of someone whose fate is exceptionally brute. By his developed performance, he leads a viewer to his character's psyche and creates a unique insight into his emotions. Joan Chen is marvelous as the empress Wan Jung - a beautiful woman and a very talented Chinese actress. I think that her most unforgettable moment is the wedding night and her first kissing the young emperor. But the performance that is outstanding in the movie is the one by Peter O'Toole. Since he is the only \"British looking\" actor in the film, he does a perfect job among so different cast. His role of Reginald Johnston, the emperor's tutor, a Scotsman, is entirely worth consideration. O'Toole is a great actor, one of the very best of all time and whenever I see his name in the credits, I am certain that he will not disappoint me with anything. And that is true, without any doubt, when applied to THE LAST EMPEROR as well.CONTENT: The entire story may seem sad: the last emperor of China who was considered the Lord of ten thousand years, ends up as a peasant citizen of the People's Republic of China experiencing communist cruelty and even the Mao cult with its Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Yet, the action is constructed in such a way that a viewer's interest is wonderfully kept. I loved the aforementioned flashbacks and flash-forwards since this created a feeling of timeless facts. Not chronology makes the utmost importance but life treated as an integral part of a human. When we live, we escape to our memories very often and that that is the thing which constitutes our dreams and evaluations. Moreover, by showing Pu Yi's life in this way, Bertolucci went deeper into his emotional states and filled the film with associations and inner struggles. I loved the moments of \"Open the door!\" - how beautifully symbolic and how accurately emotional! CULTURAL REFERENCE: There is one more factor that makes this film interesting: the insight to the Chinese culture. I have never seen a movie that presents an exotic culture (exotic to me as a Pole) in such a balanced and interesting way. Among many moments that show the marvelous culture of the Far East, I loved the moment when three year-old Pu Yi appears at the imperial palace. A widowed empress is set on her throne under the black pearl and tells little boy about his future and the dead emperor who is riding dragons in heaven. Little Pu Yi's face is filled with wonderful curiosity of a child. This moment remained in my memory as particularly unforgettable. THE LAST EMPEROR is a good film. I do not consider it a masterpiece as some other people do, but I find it a highly accurate movie that is absolutely worth a look. Perhaps, you will not agree with me that the performances are that great since you may have different expectations concerning this aspect; perhaps, you will not like the Chinese story since the history of this country does not constitute your primary interests. However, you will love the number of moments filmed in the Forbidden City...I promise you that!",

Eventually he is able to leave the Forbidden City after he unexpectedly abdicates from the throne, he tries his best to become a regular man, exploitation of invading Japan, and existing as a peasant worker. Also starring Joan Chen as 'Elizabeth' Wan Jung, Ruocheng Ying as The Governor, Victor Wong as Chen Pao Shen, Dennis Dun as Big Li, Ry\u00fbichi Sakamoto as Amakasu, Maggie Han as Eastern Jewel, Ric Young as Interrogator, Vivian Wu Jun Mei as Wen Hsiu, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Chang and Jade Go as Ar Mo. Tha acting in this film by the four stars playing the Emperor is rather good, the story does have some good ups and downs to keep you more or less hooked, and the use of colour, costumes and locations are wonderful to watch, so while it may be a little long and at times I drifted a little, it is a worthwhile epic biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Ry\u00fbichi Sakamoto, David Byrne and Cong Su, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Costume Design and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Score, Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Very good!",

It is a beautiful movie. But it simply is not great now. Regarding the time it was made ('86-'87) it was probably great. I read several glowing reviews - but all the 5 to 7 star reviews mostly say the same thing I found issue with - the way the movie goes back and forth between the times of Puyi's life. And also how the film is shown seems to infer that I know some of this history.So, I momentarily stopped watching at about 20 minutes in. I researched Puyi and his history, which is also somewhat confusing - he is both a good & bad guy, a victim of circumstances but by necessity a manipulator - all at the same time - basically trying to stay alive. It certainly is very interesting to try to imagine & understand that he saw & lived this unique childhood & history in his short life.Unfortunately, my major problem with this movie was my DVD - no captions. And a lot of the dialogue was either mumbled or in Manchu or something. I don't know why the film makers didn't at least caption those words!I also think this movie could've benefited vastly by having narration. Someone explaining the story so when the decades change back & forth the story teller/narrator explains some background of what's going on.I wish they would remaster it with a really great narrator.",

            "content": "Biographical genre tends to be loose and boring because the narrative is linear, chronological, or predictable. However, in case of 'The Last Emperor', not only the story itself but also storytelling is interesting.First, Puyi's life right in the middle of Chinese's rapidly changing political turmoil is tragic and dramatic. Being a 'supposedly godlike' Emperor at so young an age in collapsing regime and always being forced to move around and caged his whole life can tell many interesting stories. Intriguing and refreshing topic from the get-go.More importantly, I want to praise how the movie tells these eventful affairs in organized and absorbing manner. The director uses the technique of 'story within a story'. Outer frame is about present Puyi and People's Republic of China while inner frame is about his past and Qing / Manchuria. The role of an Interrogator is important in connecting these two frames. An interrogator first states Puyi's action and explains more about political background and international affair at that time like how a history book would write about Puyi. Then, the flashback (inner story) of the that specific moment begins as a way of telling Puyi's own personal story from his perspective. Repetition of this pattern helps connect private life of Puyi to the world full of wars, colonialism, and nationalism in early 1900s and helps audience consumed to the film with organized narrative structure.",

One wants to go. The movie is based on bare facts of a quite extraordinary life lived by someone who seems to have been a most commonplace person. Pu Yi was an accident of meteorology, the calm, rather empty center of the political hurricane that was blowing around him and that defined his place in history. Pu Yi was a cipher compared to the remarkable characters who, in one way or another, shaped his life and modern China.The director was given access to some magnificent locations within the Forbidden City as well as elsewhere in China and Manchuria. The eye is frequently entertained, while the center of the screen remains dead. Mr. O'Toole rattles off his lines with speed and what often seems to be a comic disregard for what they mean. From time to time, when he must register a certain ineffable sadness, he enunciates each word as if it were a pearl, which it isn't. This is not a great performance. Somewhat better are Mr. Lone, Miss Chen, Miss Lu and Richard Vuu, who plays Pu Yi as a 3-year-old and looks angelic. Ultimately, it's a let-down.",

I haven't seen \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" so I'm not saying \"The Last Emperor\" is his greatest, but it's one of his greatest.Okay, that second one sounds lame, but give me a chance.This is a fine film. I love Oscar-worthy films, and this one deserved Best Picture 1987. Bertolucci does a fine job with this film, which is a cinematic masterpiece.(Some of you may find it ironic that I like this film and not Lord of the Rings. That's okay, we all like different movies.)SPOILERS ARE IN THIS NEXT SECTION! BEWARE! DON'T READ FORWARD IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE!!!!The acting is fabulous. Joan Lone is Emperor Henry Pu Yi, who goes to the throne at age three. The empress or queen declares him China's \"emperor of 10,000 years\" and sends him to the Forbidden City. He is not allowed to leave, but he seriously wants to. Reginald \"R.J.\" Johnston (Peter O'Toole) becomes Pu Yi's tutor and buys him a bike. Pu Yi uses this opportunity to leave the city, but returns to find him a wife. In a classic scene, he is covered in lipstick with kisses from his bride-to-be. They marry and eventually leave the Forbidden City. Pu Yi decides to mingle with the locals, and conducts business with Hirohito and the Japanese in Manchuria, which is occupied by the Japanese troops and is called Manchukuo by them. Pu Yi gets incarcerated by the Japanese for the majority of the Second World War and more years afterwards. In flashback moments, his wife leaves him and wastes away and dies. After several more years, around 1956, Pu Yi is released into the streets of Beijing as Mao Xedong and the Communist powers overthrow the country. Pu Yi is a failing gardener who watches in horror as Xedong imprisons many of his cellmates from the prison. He returns to the Forbidden City one last time, where he spots a young boy. Pu Yi had a cricket as a child, and after many years, it has survived. He gives it to the little boy, then rests in his old bed. Slowly he takes his last breath and dies. Right at the end, a tour guide is explaining the life of Pu Yi.MORE SPOILERS (Sorry, all of you.) This was the first PG-13 movie to win Best Picture (please correct me if I'm wrong!)So this would be an excellent movie to watch. 5/5 stars, 10/10 stars.\n\"Throughout history there have been tyrants and murderers, and for a while, they may seem invincible, but in the end, they always fail.

To me, Bertolucci's astonishing \"read\" and \"take\" on the life and times of Henry Pu-Yi is, at heart, totally \"subjective\" and \"intimate\" vis-a-vis the enormous historic backdrop of global consequence. The review I refer to, after brief scanning, seems to insist on American bias and prejudices of the day and beyond, which is to say that exotica lies well beyond their appreciation. Experiencing Bertolucci's Forbidden City and imperial \"life\" from a reference point of sociocultural sniffishness, not forgetting sociopolitical judgments, is, to me, ongoing \"western\" error. Judgments of dynastic downfall and historic human fallibility herein neglects contemporaneous American incivilities like Prohibition gangsterisms and that sad saga of Depression America and the Okies and Arkies of Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath.\" Along the same lines, as with the India artists and craftspeople of Attenborough's superb \"Gandhi,\" I wonder why \"The Last Emperor\" garnered Oscars in all categories but those of the actors therein. For me, it is racism, impure and simple. And, by the way, I wonder just how indebted the Bertolucci script was to the Chinese teleseries that preceded it by three years? In the final estimate, \"The Last Emperor\" must be accounted a masterwork for sure, and a film for all time, whatever the context.",

She was related with the emperor: Her father and the emperor's father was brothers, which mean that she was the the emperor's cousin. She was the 14th daughter of her father (14? amazing? yet that's normal in the royal families) After the empire collapsed, her father colluded with the Japanese. And she was fostered by a Japanese and sent to Japan where she grown up. Her early education in Japan gradually turned her against China. Later she became a spy for the Japanese. Before the World War II, she acted in collusion with the Japanese in Shanghai, China. For her effective spy work and her Japanese foster father's military background, she got to drive into the kernels of the Japanese army in China, especially in Manchuria. At her top, she'd even lead a troop, as a commander, of around 5000 soldiers. Yet, her indiscipline and arrogance somehow annoyed the Japanese. As a result, she was sent back to Japan.As she grown up, her foster father coveted her beauty and tried to get her married to him as a concubine. However, she strongly rejected him. After this incident, she was said to become a little out of mind and turn somewhat freak. And She was fond of being dressed in men's clothes(said to be a lesbian). She also became an addict to opium.During the World War II, she was found to be useful again by the Japaneses. She served as an interpreter and a bridge between the Japanese and the puppet Manchukuo government because of her special royal background, and her career as a spy continued. When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, she was taken with the emperor as prisoner as you saw in the movie. However, she was not so lucky as the emperor. The Chiang Kai-shek government court (not the later Communist one) sentenced her to death as war criminal for the offense of high treason. She was shot to death on Oct.5th 1947. Here are some old pictures about her. Warning: the last picture maybe a little bothering for someone.

Crowned as a baby, he lived a life of limitless luxury but was eventually expelled from his throne by the revolution of 1911. Imprisoned in his palace like a bird in a golden cage, he saw the decay of his country and the dramatic changes of Republican China from the inside of the Forbidden City. Expelled by the Communists years later, he spent a good part of his life trying to regain his throne, and the rest of it imprisoned in Chinese reeducation camps that transformed him into an ordinary man. There is undoubtedly a poetic beauty in the transformation of the main character, and the film can make us feel the changes in his personality, as well as the changes of his former empire. The film suggests several things about him and the imperial family that I do not know if they are truth, like the apparent lesbianism of one of the emperor's wives and their use of drugs. Bernardo Bertolucci is a director that I normally do not appreciate, but I recognize in this film many qualities. The actors did a very regular and interesting performance. John Lone was perfect in the role of the emperor, but even brighter was Peter O'Toole, in a role that, otherwise, with another actor, could be overly subdued. The film's set-ups are glamorous and go a long way toward creating a Hollywood-era epic movie feel.

In fact, the first thing that I noticed was that it was produced by an Italian director (and a rather controversial one at that). As such, a part of me wasn't at all surprised that there were elements to this film that made it feel much more like an art house production than your typical Hollywood movie. Another thing about this film is that it was the first Hollywood film that received permission to film inside the Forbidden City.As the title suggests this film is about the life of the last Emperor of China, and I have to admit that he certainly did live an interesting life. The one thing that struck me was that he actually managed to live until old age, and in China as well. This surprised me because in most cases such a person would generally be executed, particularly since he represented the old order, and as such could easily lead a revolt against the new order. Obviously this didn't happen though.Mind you, he was born during a rather turbulent time in Chinese History, and as an emperor really didn't last that long. He became emperor at the age of two, and it seems as if he abdicated shortly after, and only fulfilled a ceremonial role, if that. However, the thing was that during this time China descended into a collection of warring states, and he was eventually expelled from the Forbidden City, and really only held the title in name only.Actually, this seems to be one of the themes that goes through the film, and that is that he, in reality, was an emperor without any power. At a young age he certainly didn't have the capacity, or the knowledge, to be able to rule an empire, and no doubt for the short time that he was emperor in name, and authority, he was ruling though the Eunuchs. However, as time moved on, he seemed to just end up being a puppet, and as his power was stripped from him, finished off as a simple gardener. Sure, he might have lived in the Forbidden City, but it was clear that he had no authority beyond its walls, and even when he attempted to exert his authority, the Eunuchs rebelled.Another theme that is explored in this film is that of imprisonment. While it appears that the Emperor wasn't always imprisoned, it seems that it was the case for most of his life. The film opens with him stepping off a train, a prisoner of the Chinese Communist Party, and being interned in a re-education camp. However, throughout the film we constantly see images of him being in prison. He is imprisoned in the Forbidden City - whenever he tries to leave the gates are closed. The same when he is the puppet ruler of Manchuria under the Japanese. His wife leaves, and his mother is sent away, and he cannot follow. In fact, it seems that the world is changing around him, yet from his prison he cannot see the changes. We do get glimpses through the gates, however he is never able to leave.Yet even when he is expelled from the Forbidden City, you still get the impression that he is still imprisoned, that is that he is imprisoned in China. Whenever he attempts to leave, there is something that is holding him back. He has a desire to go to Oxford, however when the time comes he seeks shelter in the Japanese Embassy as opposed to the British. Even when he attempts to flee to Japan at the end of the war to become a prisoner of the Americans his indecision results him being captured by the Russians.While this is pretty much a biopic, the way Bertolucci does the film brings up these numerous themes that are about his life. He is an Emperor without any power, and he is a free man that is imprisoned in a gilded cage. He has everything done for him, including having his shoes tied. Yet, it seems as if he finishes his life off as a simple, and humble, gardener. He was born an emperor, but as time goes on, and as people are re-educated, he even begins to lose that prestige. The only thing that is left that he has to prove that he used to be emperor is a secret that was hidden under the throne.",

            "content": "A very strange film about China. To look at the history of this country in the first seven decades of the 20th century through the exclusive eyes of the last emperor who lived locked up in the Forbidden City all his life till he was freed by the Japanese and marched to Manchuria to become the last emperor there is kind of debilitating and disappointing. Then he was captured by Mao Zedong's troops and was re-educated in some kind of rehabilitation camp and finished his life as a gardener. At the end of his life he saw the mounting pressure coming from the Red Guards and announcing the Cultural Revolution. The vision is both sorry and disappointed in a way. But does this film present a picture of this man, or of China, or of the world that is worth remembering? He is too capricious to be in anyway great or even remembered. He lost all his power when Sun Yat Sen arrived and yet he survived as some kind of a symbol that the Japanese used. He accepted to sell himself to the Japanese as this symbol precisely. But he more or less gracefully acknowledged the fact later on, though we will never know whether he agreed with the rehabilitation procedure or just suffered it and tolerated it out of surviving interest. Rather beautiful though if anything.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

Having never seen it before, but always being aware that it was a well-reviewed and critically acclaimed film led me to believe like most films that fit into his category, it too would be enjoyable even though it took me years to get around to viewing it.All I can say it that I really do NOT understand the High rating or how this film won 9 Academy Awards!! Whilst I can see that the subject matter was quite interesting and had Great potential to be a very very interesting film and highly entertaining, I found it to be slow paced,lacking in detail of the many occurrences/conflict points in the film, and general overall lack of making you care about the characters in the film.I can see that the film should have been great, and certainly had the potential to be great based on an extremely interesting subject matter, but I just felt like the lack of true emotional connection to the characters or their situations (due to poor explanation on the film's part in my opinion) make it impossible to enjoy this film the way I should have or would have liked to.I can see on paper that the sheer scope of this film warrants some attention and praise, but I thought the execution in practice was very very poor and the film uninteresting.I really do not understand the high praise this film receives (other than it being the \"epic\" type of film Hollywood like to praise from time to time), as I thought it was poorly acted (other than the younger children), poorly conceived, and lacked any real emotion from what should have been a powerful powerful film.Just my take on what I was hoping would be the epic film I had heard so much about.",

Lone shines in his part, as well as other actors like Joan Chen and Peter O'Toole, who plays the young Pu Yi's mentor.This visually splendid film can however prove exhausting, especially in its uncut version. But for all the negative criticism it has got, it never gets dull. Bertolucci has never done a movie like this before or after. The closest he got to it was with \"Little Buddha\", a movie not as good as this one. What else is there to say about it? It serves both as a history lesson for those who know little or nothing about the Chinese history before Mao and a feast for the eye. It is a lesson that can not be taken for granted. A story about a man who wanted to build a paradise, but ended in hell instead. I think the value of this film is everlasting.

            "content": "I didn't intend to review this film when I threw it on. I bought it because it's great, and I just wanted to watch it again, but then I read Roger Ebert's review and I felt like he completely and totally misinterpreted the ending. And then I read the essay that came with the Criterion Blu-Ray by David Thompson that seemed completely scattershot and talked more about the rest of Bertolucci's career rather than The Last Emperor itself. So, I just felt like I needed to get my own thoughts down.Much of the conversation around this movie is about how China allowed Bertolucci to film in The Forbidden City. Ooo...aaaa...amazing. Okay, that's done.Snark aside, the movie is a visual delight, and it is in no small part because of the expansive location that is the Forbidden City that that works. This story needs to feel big because it is the story of two things that are the intimately related. The first is the eponymous last emperor Puyi, and the second is China itself. The connection makes sense without even considering the details of the story, but the way the story plays out (which I assume, like I assume with all historical movies, is roughly 90% ahistorical). Puyi's brief childhood reign as emperor leads to time as an accepted figurehead in China, a puppet for Japan, prisoner of the Communist Chinese government, and then a modest gardener. As he progresses through this story, the country around him changes along with him.One of the things that bugged me about Roger Ebert's review was that he described Puyi as passive. That's only partially true. He was never able to directly affect any major events, but he tried. He tried a lot. From his time as a boy where he climbed off of his throne to wander and founds only his supplicants to his affirmative effort to become Japan's puppet emperor of Manchukuo throughout the Second World War, Puyi was trying to assert his will upon his household and China overall. The problem was that every time he tried, he received pushback of a proportional nature. His effort to bicycle out of the Forbidden City after his abdication is met by a closed gate, but his effort to assert China's independence alongside Japan is met by hostility from Japan, effectively ending his faux-reign before he's captured by the Russians (and then handed off to the Chinese).Ebert asserted that the re-education Puyi receives is successful because he never really had an education in the world, and I think it's one of the most wrong-headed things he ever wrote. Puyi received an intimate education about the workings of the world from his secluded spot away from things. It was a hard education, but he did receive it. The re-education he is forced in prison doesn't actually work, but over that time Puyi learns his smallness in his own life. His reflection on his contributions to his life and the history of China are minimal at best, represented best by his inability to function without a servant for the first time in his life. It's not that he became a good communist, it's that he spent 10 years thinking about his life with little else to do. It's only when he takes up gardening that he finds something he can influence. It's small, but he can make the world better in a very small little way.Puyi's journey is compelling in his continual efforts to make changes in his life, but it's brought to life visually and there's much more to talk about than the Forbidden City when it comes to The Last Emperor's visuals. Vittorio Storaro, the film's cinematographer is one of the greatest of his craft, and he used color intelligently and explosively in this film. The vibrant colors of the imperial period end up mirroring the bright colors of the period in Puyi's life where he's out of prison in Communist China (1967), implying a connection between the two eras with Puyi's drab, colorless prison period in between. I think he's saying that little has actually changed in China. The children's marching and singing in praise of Mao in the streets evokes the singing death chant of the Empress Dowager at the beginning of the film. It's still a highly centralized society with deep inclinations towards pomp and circumstance.The movie is sumptuous visually, compellingly acted, intimately involved in the history of the country, grand in scale, and intimate in scope. It's a triumph of cinema and one of the best movies of the 80s.",

            "content": "What is an emperor, who has been told all his life that he is meant to rule, supposed to do when he no longer has an empire? It is easy to condemn the Emperor Puyi as a weak willed collaborator and monarchist and to reasonably wonder why anyone would want to make a movie about such an apparently vacuous person. But Puyi's life was tragic and as such provides the basis for an excellent historical drama. Puyi never asked to be emperor, which was the only job he was ever trained to do, and after having been evicted from his palace ... which was his home ... sought refuge with the Japanese who took him in and gave him a job, the only job he was ever trained to do. So can it be any wonder why the dispossessed emperor would have had some affinity for the Japanese? John Lone gives a great performance as the dispossessed and unhappy emperor and Joan Chen is equally impressive as his depressed and opium addicted wife who was the classic innocent victim and who did nothing to deserve her vile mistreatment by her own people. Mrs. Puyi was so utterly harmless that the mere thought of anyone wanting to mistreat her is sad and troubling. This movie dramatizes a universal theme - the challenges associated with adapting to relentless change as one tries to maintain their emotional equilibrium and sense of identity while all the landmarks of their lives are rapidly disappearing. Was Puyi a opportunistic criminal? Or was he a man caught up in a whirlwind of change that ultimately proved to be his undoing and then his redemption?",

            "content": "I can understand someone loving \"The Last Emperor\" (as I do), or being bored stiff. Visually ravishing, it is an epic film about an empty man, the last emperor of China Pu Yi. Raised from birth with no real experience of the outside world, trained only to fulfill his role as a symbolic figurehead, we watch Pu Yi swept along by the great tides of history in the 20th century east. Only after going through ten years 're-education' at the hands of the Chinese communists does he start to seem connected to the world and to himself. The film forces a lot of challenging 're-thinking'. While clearly not forgiving the murderous excesses of the Chinese cultural revolution in the 60s, it does show that \u2013 at least in this specific case \u2013 the harshness of the Chinese communists was better for Pu Yi as a human being than the false kindness of all those that surrounded him for much of his life. There are weak spots. Peter O'Toole - who I usually love - is at his most self-consciously theatrical as Pu Yi's western tutor, a tone that makes it feel like he's in a different film. Some scenes feel like pure exposition, with characters having conversations only so we the audience understands historical context. And it's sometimes hard to stay fully connected to a 165 minute epic about an empty man (although 'Citizen Kane' could be looked at that way). But in the end, when Pu Yi finds some measure of happiness and wholeness as a simple gardener, there is a fascinating feeling of deep emotional reward for much of what felt flat earlier.The Italian TV cut is almost a full hour longer than the feature version (which Bertolucci is now said to prefer), I find each have different strengths. I agree that the longer version is a bit \"more boring\" to quote the director himself, but it also fills out the story in important ways. By giving us more information about Pu Yi's childhood, and time in prison (even if some of those scenes do feel a bit clunky with exposition) his character feels much more fleshed out, less of a cipher. More a man, less a symbol. And some of the important changes both in the story and in his personality feel less sudden or confusing. Probably my personal 'perfect' version would split the difference, but I was very glad to see this alternate cut.",

The panoramic photography is like a window opening onto another world, filling the screen with rare and exotic sights.

The movie looks great, of course, but I think the main reason why I've always found \"Last Emperor\" tedious going is that the title character is really a pretty dull fellow. While young, would-be emperor Pu Yi is playing with his eunuchs, taking lessons from his tutor, and rolling around in bed with his 2 wives (with a little unlikely bisexual titillation to liven things up), tumultuous, world-changing historical events are happening outside the walls of the Forbidden City.  While Bertolucci's camera drinks in the sights of the emperor's opulent, self-indulgent life-style, we're held prisoner inside the palace along with him.  Time after time, potentially exciting spectacle (like the burning down of the palace storehouse by the eunuchs) is happening offscreen.  Pu Yi is never an active participant in his country's historical development, even after he is set up as the puppet emperor of Japanese-controlled Manchuria later in the story.  At over 3 hours, the film becomes almost as vacuous as the leading character; the director seems to be more enamoured of pageantry than drama.

The film traces the life of the last emperor of China. He ruled from early 20th century through to the Chinese Revolution inthe 1940's.  Rich in historical moments, and culture, The Last Emperor is avisual masterpiece that accurately depicts the costume, architecture, andtraditions of Imperial China.   It is these elements, the costume/design, Art Direction, etc. that help make The Last Emperor what is was and undoubtedlywill remain.However, the film is not perfect and, in fact, has several flaws.  First, and absolutely foremost, the acting is nothing great.  Peter O'Toole and John Lone do decent work in the film but nothing great.  This is certainly not one of Peter O'Toole's better roles.   Arguably the practically emotion-less characterization of many of the characters in many of the scenes is part of the screenplay andrepresents the dignity of the Chinese soul.  However other films have done this well without having its characters seem  tired and empty  [Such as Raise theRed Lanterns]  The story is well written but it is VERY slow  [and VERY long] I do not see any reason to blame the scriptwriter but instead believe that Bertolucci needed to address the tempo of the film.  Granted the tempo is what he wanted and I think that is the film's greatest weakness.  In areas, the film is downright boring.  This is, as I stated, no fault of the writing but instead of the director's intention to have this pace for the film.  And, arguably, that is a cultural artifact of the Imperial Chinese culture.

            "content": "A resplendent and often illuminating historical pageant that's also resolutely undramatic and, until the final (somewhat rushed) segment, astonishingly apolitical considering its subject matter and its director's career.  Its subject is broader than politics, perhaps: the shape of history, personal and public, and how those two shapes interact. \nPu Yi, played by three actors and followed over six decades, is an emblem of historical change, a fulcrum between tradition and modernity (as well as between east and west) who always contrives to be ill-suited to his imperial role and perhaps his citizen's role too, until the moment when that role has definitively become mere history, vanished into museum culture. Pu Yi's radical lack of an identity may be a dramatic liability, but it's a central and necessary preoccupation for the film; its more serious weaknesses lie in the screenplay's tendency towards banality at the verbal level, and some decidedly mixed performances in the supporting cast.  The principals are pretty much beyond reproach in what was never going to be an actors' film, and both Peter O'Toole and (in particular) Joan Chen find some substance in roles that are quite superficially written.  Only the surfaces of things and people are accessible here, and the emperor himself is a man who is nothing but surface.  He has no hidden depths, only hidden shallows.Perhaps the energy that really drives this film is the tension between its lush cinematography and its broadly left-wing sympathies.  Storaro's photography is lavish and celebratory; it adores material luxury of whatever kind - traditional Chinese or 1920s faux-Parisian or whatever - without reservation.  Bertolucci's camerawork meanwhile is austere, as restrained as the performances, and the emotional and intellectual temperatures are much cooler than the colour scheme. Not surprisingly, given China's official approval of the project, it is largely anodyne in its account of the People's Republic, but the closing segment is sufficiently barbed.  The snapshot of the continuing revolution, with its Maoist quasi-imperial cult, presents a country that has not changed at all, whilst the final glimpse of contemporary Beijing presents a country that has changed everything, surrendered to the westernisation which Pu Yi championed (the very existence of Forbidden City footage is testament to this).  China emerges as a country in which revolution and stasis are twins, and in the present century everything and nothing has changed.",

He leaps from the throne and runs toward the door laughing as the yellow drape billows over his head. The drapery blows back and thousands of his minions bow to his presence. 'The Last Emperor' is the story of a boy born of power and privilege that was all window dressing.Pu Yi's life is full of irony and vast spaces of emptiness. When he was barely three-years old he was crowned Emperor of China. Power never goes to Pu Yi's head mostly because by the time he reached the age of seven, the political climate in China had changed to the point that he didn't have any power to wield. When he is 7 he gets a new bicycle but his guards forbid him from leaving the palace.The story flashes back and forth from his childhood to his later years as a gardener after China became a communist country. When he is only 12 he gives up his power and sits on the throne as a figurehead but not a ruler. He is tutored about life in Europe and dreams of someday going there. Reginald (Peter O'Toole) coaxes him to get married instead. He does, her name is Wan Jung (Joan Chen) When he is 24 he finds himself locked out of the Forbidden City. The irony is that he once couldn't leave his palace, now he can't go back in. Finding that he now has to fend for himself without any of the tools or instincts that would allow him to make it in life, he moves to Manchuria. His wife becomes a drug addict and Pu Yi is arrested by Russians and returned to the Chinese.He is not killed but sent to a re-education camp. Pu Yi has never done anything for himself. At one point he stares at the water coming out of the faucet because he doesn't know how to turn it off. This re-education process was probably the best thing that ever happened to him. For the first time he was being taught to do things for himself. Nothing before in his life had any meaning. It was all empty consequences. The journey through Pu Yi's life is riddled with sadness, loneliness and emptiness 'The Last Emperor' is a beautiful looking epic on the grandest scale. It's bold set designs and costumes are the equal to any David Lean epic. Like Lean, director Bernardo Bertolucci is able to find the smaller story inside a grand-scale epic. But unlike Lean's work very little really happens in this film. This doesn't bother me because the story of Pu Yi isn't one of overwhelming action scenes or dialogue, it is simply the story of a man who was born of privilege and because of the Chinese Revolution, found himself at the end of his life educated at doing something where he could be useful and happy.",

The next sixty four years of Pu Yi's life are spent as a puppet emperor, always being manipulated by the people around him. It is unfortunate that Pu Yi never gains control over his own life.

            "content": "The Last Emperor is one of the final epics of old. It is a tale about the final emperor of China, Pu-Yi, and his descent from emperor to ordinary man. Unlike older epics like Lawrence of Arabia, there are hardly any action scenes or moments of intrigue. Instead, it is a story that tells the life of a government puppet within some major historical events. To me, that is what makes this story worthy of telling. It's not particularly about the life of an emperor, but about the transition of feudalism to the current state of communism of China's society. The movie is very long and can be slow at times, but in the end, Bernardo Bertolucci created a worthy epic. Worthy of Best Picture? Who knows. I do know that this is a visually stunning film that takes advantage of the Forbidden Kingdom with dazzling shots. The story can be imperfect at times with its tonal shifts, but it is a good learning device. I learned more about Pu-Yi and his \"worthiness\" to the powers that may be.\nBertolucci's epic is the first Western picture to ever be filmed in the Forbidden City. The director took advantage with this by creating such gorgeous visual shots. As an avid traveler, they really now make me want to visit the place which is home to so much history. As a film that needed to be approved by the Chinese government, apparently it was easier to work with the Chinese than the studio system. Outside of a few scribbles here or there, the authorities gave the production complete authority. The film was independently financed by producer Jeremy Thomas, as he was able to raise the necessary funds himself. He even had to use the phone pages to find potential financial backing. Regardless, he was able to produce the money. Columbia Pictures distributed the picture, but they did not feel comfortable doing so until very late in the game. It was not even a box office success, but it certainly wowed critics and award groups alike.\nWhat I think the picture did successfully is portray the kind of person Hu-Yi (John Lone) was. From a very young age, he was denied access to the outside world as we see in the scene where he received a bicycle, but his own guards stopped him from leaving the grounds. For the man himself, his story is bittersweet. He abdicated the throne at the age of 7 and was handed to the Japanese and eventually handed to the Communists. He was certain that he was going to be killed at the hands of the Communists, but instead went through \"re-education camp\" where he would end his days as a farmer. It sounds so awful going from a somebody to a nobody, but it seems he was at his happiest working as a farmer. I personally felt the ending was really sad as he ended his life in an obscure fashion. Along the way, we see the man he would become. An independent thinker, someone who longs for the outside world and the European way (taught by his mentor R.J. Johnston, played by Peter O'Toole). This person was not really seen as a person, but as a means for people to use to help satisfy their personal goals.\nThe performances were fantastic. John Lone could have gotten an Oscar nomination and I would not have complained. He played Hu-Yi from the ages of twenty through sixty. Through the years, he really changed as a person and Lone was able to pull it off and make you sympathize towards the man who does not mean much as a person to others. An isolated loner who developed a skill for independent and philosophical thinking. Peter O'Toole also lent his charisma and does a great job in a supporting role.\nThe Last Emperor is the winner of nine Oscars. Bertolucci pulled off a difficult feat in putting this film together. His cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro gave us an impressive display of shots of a Chinese area that many Westerners have not seen. The score was an impressive blend of traditional music. The costumes felt genuine and were beautiful. The story itself is a little long and could have used better editing, but I liked how the several narratives were interwoven with one another. As someone who loves history, this was a learning lesson for me. I could not help but feel for this man who is treated as nothing. The ending is bittersweet for me. I liked how he was happy, but he was just a no one. I guess being happy it what matters in the end. I was very surprised this movie cleaned up at the Oscars. But for those who love long epics and can stand a little messy narrative, definitely give this a buzz.\nMy Grade: B+",

            "content": "This movie is EPIC. There is no other word that can describe it, and it is if this word was invented especially for it. And conversely, this is the film that gives the most accurate feeling about what the word \"epic\" means. It gives life to this word.I live on the \"other side\" of the Earth, measured to the places, where these events happened. Geographically it is one third, but in real terms of culture, language, trading and traveling routes, ties, relations, mentality, etc. - I'm much closer to the Western European countries, America, Russia, the Middle East, even Africa - than to Eastern Asia. It is simply - in all kinds of ways - a completely different world, different as mentality and as a philosophical way of perceiving, thinking and understanding the reality. So in a way, everybody - either from Europe or America - lives from the other side of the Earth, from the point of view of China, Japan and Korea - the countries of the Far East. Yet this film brought me straight into this world, into its history, into the lives of the people there - from all kinds of perspectives - as it managed to \"catch\" EVERYTHING.The historic events were only a frame for it. As the picture was coming in front of my eyes slowly, as it was forming - it showed me the things under the facts, the things the facts were made and shaped of. If somebody had told me before, that one day I will feel so strongly and emotionally for somebody, who is from the ROYALTY (I'm a confident ANARCHIST - so I don't like even the democratic rulers, let alone the royal ones); who is Manchurian Chinese (which means for me that he is from another race, and he lives \"at the bottom of the geography\" - that stands for somewhere far, far away - almost on another planet); who is MALE (yes, male! A nice, innocent, beautiful woman or a girl naturally would turn some emotions into me, especially when I see her suffering or crying. To feel that towards a man, as I'm a general feminist and man-hater, is fifty times more difficult); who is OLD; who was not that \"refined\" in the actual reality (as I know from some historic facts) - I wouldn't believe it: I would just shook my head in a gesture of neglectful disbelief.And in total contrast to that - here I stay now, humbled and overwhelmed by this great, epic film - by its grandiosity - feeling strongly to this man, emperor Pu Yi - the last emperor of China, and contemplating the sad, horrible destiny that he and over one billion Chinese had through the quietly, or thunderously passing millenniums, and through the whole 20th century, and today - in the times when China finally wakes up, but still hasn't risen. I didn't believe that I could feel so strongly and closely to the Chinese people, who were foreign to me, before I watched this movie. Now I consider them my brothers. I found: as much they're different, that much they're close to us; they are warmblooded people, they have the same dreams, hopes and aspirations, as we have. And I will never forget what I saw. Before this film it was just dried, black & white historical facts, which I almost didn't know and didn't care for. Now it's colourful and living, and repeating, and developing into my mind, and I'm as interested in their history, as if it was the history of my ancestors and relatives. All this - from a movie: the third greatest movie.SOME SPOILERSThere were exceptionally great scenes in it: the young Pu Yi, playing indifferent, but then crying for his mother, while driving his bicycle, when nobody could see him - as he was a boy and a royal, and was ashamed of his weakness; and when he stood helpless in front of his mentally broken wife, who he couldn't save from the crushing wheels of the cruel history - and he cried again, depicting the frightening inability of his puppet emperor's position; and when he was walking through the Forbidden City as an ordinary visitor, and he looked so old! So terribly old... And the metaphor of how he died - it was one of the FIVE MOST INFLUENTIAL END SCENES, that I have ever witnessed in a movie. It stays together, and equal to Rose, when she threw the diamond in the ocean; and to T-800, when he said: \"Now I know why you cry. I wish I also could\", and then hugged John; and to Lester Burnham, when he was \"remembering\" the great moments of his life; and to Thelma and Louise, when they \"dived\" into the abyss with the car. Intense sadness comes from these moments, yet they are so sincere, so pure, that they look almost real - as if they just happened, in front of our eyes. And they will haunt me forever, as fire images, engraved in every cell of my brain, being a proof of how great cinema is.SPOILERS!!!And I will remember... The boy opened the round box, and the cricket appeared from it - and it was IMPOSSIBLE, as no living creature can stay there for such a long time and survive. It was impossible, but yet so real, and so sad... So desperately sad! This was his spirit - which was trapped through his whole life, and finally became free, only in the time of his death. And he was there, and when the schoolboy turned behind, he was gone. There was crushing emptiness... Whoever invented this scene, is a great genius. And then: the guide was announcing it, routinely doing her job. And for all the visitors it was just dates and facts, but not for me. Because I KNEW. I knew his life and fate, and everything...",

            "content": "You simply could not escape hearing about how great this movie was back in the late 1980s. This biopic, is a film about Henry Pu Yi, the last emperor of China. What is great about most historical films is they always tackle certain \"lost\" parts about history. The bridge in a remote part of Burma, in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), the tiny sailboat used by the American army in the film, the Wackiest Ship in the Army (1960) and this film, which also has that \"lost\" feel to it. Not many of us would think, that even a huge empire like China, would have a last emperor. It makes the audience wonder, even the thought of the idea seems interesting.That is what director, Bernardo Bertolucci, gives to you in this film. He establishes that interest in the idea of a last emperor. The film opens up in 1950 when Henry's life, as he knew it, is already over. His glory days have gone by and he is now a captive in the more modern version of the People's Republic of China. A political prisoner, who once was an emperor of Manchuria China. The audience is then transported back to 1906, as the new emperor of Manchuria, who right now, is barely out of diapers, begins his journey through the decades.Bertolucci created a film, that may have been ahead of its time. You don't even have to mention the Oscar wins, the great critical response or even the commercial success of this movie. What really makes this film good is the two linear time-lines that Bertolucci drives the film with. He takes the 1950s part of the story, continues it along, by weaving it into the other timeline, that started in 1906 and flips, back and forth, between each, in a highly informative description of this man's life. It is a plot device seen more today, in the 21st century, than the 1980s really.Henry Pu Yi is played by a gifted actor, who some people may not know well, but he has quietly put together an amazing acting resume over the last 50 years. I knew of John Lone from his work in the Year of the Dragon (1985), the Michael Cimino-Mickey Rourke film about the Chinatown crime organizations. I also remember him popping up as the triad bad guy in Rush Hour 2 (2001). What I was really shocked about, is a movie I have been watching, every 5-10 years, since it was released in 1984, starred this guy in the title role. It was the role that put him over the top and into Henry Pu Yi's lap. I never put \"2 & 2\" together until I wrote this review. John Lone was the caveman in the critically acclaimed film, Iceman (1984). That blew my mind. If you appreciate his work in that film, you will love his work in this film too.7.5 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",

            "content": "The Last Emperor is one of the finest, and last, examples of the old-fashioned art epic. Featuring a massive cast, an extravagant budget, and an epic sweep that brings it from the Forbidden City to Manchuria to the streets of Bejiing, it chronicles a half-century of history and the life of China's last emperor, Henry Pu Yi.It is not a film for everyone. At times it is decidedly opaque; the acting is unspectacular, and the story is slow moving. If you want a dramatic, fantastic epic, go see Braveheart or Lord of the Rings.But if you're in the right state of mind, Last Emperor is spectacular. Much of the story centers around the title character's life in a communist re-education camp, told in flashbacks as he comes to grips with his life and the parts he played. For years a prisoner in his own palace, held captive by the winds of change in China, he becomes tyrant and puppet-emperor of Manchuko, the Imperial Japanese puppet state, and collaborator. In his own mind, he has finally ascended to greatness, but we see how sad and utterly pathetic he has become. When the war ends, and he is captured by the communists, he is confronted with the reality of his own sad life, and forced to come to grips with it. The conflict between inner and outer perceptions characterizes most of the film.The Last Emperor is remarkably even-handed in its portrayal of the various political factions. This is probably due to the fact that almost every nation portrayed contributed in some matter to its production. There are no winners, and as we see the chaos of the 1920s and Chiang Kai-Shek lead to the tyranny of the Japanese occupation and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, we are left with a sense that history is fulfilling itself, again and again and again. We see Pu Yi's helplessness and impotency firsthand, that even as China moves from the 15th to the 20th century that men do not change. They can only come to grips with their own actions and accept responsibility for their deeds. And yet, life goes on.The Last Emperor is a somber, artistically reflective piece, and one of the best films of the late 20th century. See it if you're in the mood for a more relaxed piece, and a melancholy look at how the romance and pageantry of Imperial China grew into modernity.",

Eunuch may make a show of worshiping him, but he never holds real power outside of the palace. His only power, when he reaches adulthood, is to banish the eunuchs from the palace for their corruption. (And this makes for the movie's best moment-they are given their \"organs\" in little jars, as Pu-Yi is told that \"whatever their crimes, they cannot be denied their right to be buried as real men.\") But even upon being taken out of the palace, when Pu-Yi is excited to finally see the world outside, he is still but a figurehead. He never is able to take an active role in the historical events around him, so the movie is essentially passive.",

It's too long, it's about something deep and meaningful, it's light on the watchability, it's pretentious and it's probably not actually the best movie of that year. And TLE ticks most of the boxes in the best picture rulebook and it's impossible for something like this not to be critically acclaimed and awarded with Oscars. With the butt numbing run time and poor pacing which means the film half heartedly goes in and out of fascinating content I think we can all say safely 9 Oscars was a bit excessive. However, this is a good historical epic. The visuals could have come right out of an art gallery and many beautiful images are created without there being a pixel of CGI in sight. The acting is all around pretty good, and you can tell the director Bernardo Bertolucci really knows what he's doing and has plenty of experience in the film business.TLE works thanks to its sobering and moving story which has some interesting themes to do with power and yearning for power. It's fairly powerful on an emotional level and by the end one does feel genuinely moved. It's got plenty of boring moments but plenty of interesting ones as well and it feels authentic and recreates the period well. It doesn't come across as manipulative or overly sentimental and you get the impression it is telling the story accurately without artistic deviations from fact. It does meander, but it has to be admired for the powerful storytelling and amazing visuals. It's not the most enjoyable film ever but it is a very interesting one and you still enjoy it a fair amount. Overall, this is a stirring and interesting historical epic which is rather entertaining and thought provoking, although they could have made it a bit faster. Still, that's Oscar winners for you.7/10",

At the end of the movie, I was left wondering what the whole point of the film was.

The so-called emperor was his habit, which trapped him, and the tide of history took him away.",

            "content": "The Last Emperor (1987) starring John Lone, Joan Chen, and Peter O'Toole won the \"Best Picture\" Academy Award for 1987, and is a curious departure from movies which usually win that honor.The movie is about China and a man chosen by the Chinese Empress Dowager in 1908 to be the next Emperor of China (the little boy named \"Pu Yi\" was one of many princes the polygamous and dead former Chinese Emperor left behind, and was not the son of the Empress Dowager).The toddler aged little boy begins his life in the monster royal palace in Peking (later renamed \"Beijing\") in a royal building complex called the Forbidden City, and grows to early manhood there.China becomes a Republic in 1911, and the Chinese Monarchy ends, but the young Emperor is allowed to continue life in the Forbidden City into his early manhood in the 1920's when he and his two young wives are evicted by the unstable, warlord dominated, constantly changing government system which had replaced the monarchy.The young evicted monarch and his wives keep their considerable fortune, and move to a coastal city in China and live \"the good life\" as rich people there until 1931 when the former Manchuria (NW China) becomes a newly named country called \"Manchukuo\" and the young ex-Emperor of China is installed as the new monarch of the new country.He remains in that job as Head Of State until the end of World War II, and is taken prisoner by the invading Russians who turn him over to the Chinese Communists who gain control of China in 1949, and keep the former Emperor of China and Monarch of Manchuria (aka Manchukuo) imprisoned for 10 years until he is released in bad health in 1959, only 53 years old, but looking much older, and clearly a broken man.His final years are spent in Peking (Beijing) where he dies in 1967 during the Chinese Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao organized to delay the invasion of capitalist money into China and the start of China as a huge sweatshop for WalMart and other western business enterprises.The Emperor had a rich and glamorous life up to 1945, and a hard life from 1945 when the Communists were about to take over China, which they achieved in 1949.The movie starts out showing the Emperor as a prisoner in 1950, and we see his former expensive \"easy living\" life in flash backs. The Communists who imprisoned the Emperor throughout the 1950's demanded that the Emperor confess his crimes, sins, shortcomings, etc. etc., and the movie alternates between his time in the 1950's as a prisoner when he recalls his past, and flash backs of his memories of it.The prison life he lives is dull and gray and awful and ugly. The previous life is colorful and attractive in most ways.The Last Emperor (1987) starring John Lone is a visual treat since most of the movie centers around \"the good old days\" of the Emperor's pre-1945 life in the Forbidden City, as a rich civilian in a coastal Chinese city in the 1920's, and as Monarch of Manachuria (aka Manchukuo)from 1931 through 1945.The colors, particularly the gaudy use of red and gold, are dazzling.The music score and presentation in the movie are very well done.The movie is a 1980's Reagan era \"rich is best, greed is good\" testimonial. The Chinese Emperor lives like Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) did in Wall Street (1985). Rich and happy.\"I've been rich and I've been poor,\" Mae West was once quoted as saying. \"Rich is better.\" --------------------------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

            "content": "The film The Last Emperor is a very well-known film in the world. It was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci who is an Italian director. It is also a China, Italy and United Kingdom jointly produced movie. The Last Emperor also is the first story movie which viewed in the Forbidden City. The film won nine award of the Academy Award in 1987. The Last Emperor shows a whole life about AIXINJUELUO Puyi, the last emperor of China. The story has two time lie, the reality one happened in a train station in Manchuria in 1950. Puyi was facing trial and detained as a prisoner so he thought of attempted suicide in the station lounge. The other one showed the earlier life about Puyi via his memory. When Puyi began to reign he was only 3 years old. He had no idea about how to be an emperor and governance of a country which is in edge of collapse. When ministers had to bow down to him, Puyi was only interested a grasshopper. He was told that he was the most powerful man in the China. However when he was older, he only found that he could use his power just in the Forbidden City. While with the passage of time, Puyi even find his power was limited in the Forbidden City. He can not retain his wet nurse. In 1919, the famous Fleming Johnston became Puyi's new tutor and he gave Puyi much information about foreign countries. Puyi began to be changed by Western culture. As this situation, he had done something not meet the progenitor system like wearing glasses and riding bicycle. But when he was heard his mother was dead he still can not leave the Forbidden City by himself. He was so tired to this kind of life but have no idea to change it. His marriage was chosen, but not by him. In fact, the audience could easily find that most things in Puyi's life were not chosen by him. He was forced to leave the Forbidden City, and was lured to be the emperor of Manchukuo. However this so-called country was just under controlled by Japanese. Puyi still have no his own power. In 1945, with the surrender of Japan, Manchukuo also did not alive. All above just happened in the memory of Puyi's memory, this is one of time line in the movie. While in the reality time line, the movie shows how Puyi abandoned his idea about emperor and became a common people in the prison. When first came to the prison, Puyi can not do anything except reading the book. One of his roommate was his flunker and have to do everything for him. The warden realized it and forced him to become the person have self-care ability via asking Puyi to change the room. Puyi also began to abandon his emperor thing through trial again and again. The warden made Puyi to know how a common people live in the world. Finally, Puyi was released and become a botanist in Peking. There are several shots with very deep information in the movie. In a very common talking from Puyi and warden, when warden told Puyi that he should not sign the paper about the Japanese biological warfare experiments in Harbin. Puyi even have no possible to know it. Puyi said that he should be responsible for everything, and the warden told him that he only need to responsible for what he do. The warden point out his mind which is just because he used to be the best one in his life and now he think he is the worst of all. In fact it is still a kind of emperor idea. The movie did not show the end of the talking but people do believe that Puyi had thought this things after that. It is also the last time to show his idea of emperor in the movie. Another shot is in the last of the movie, when Puyi got off work and find the praising of Chairman Mao by Red Guards. It was so like in his memory about praising of emperor. Audience could not find what Puyi was thinking at that time, but it is really a kind of cycle. The old emperor had already been changed to a common, what about the new \"emperor\". If someone could link to the Cultural Revolution in China, this shot could be has much more information.",

A 15 minutes documentary has the same effect...The acting is not special and the soundtrack is also nothing new. I had hoped that this would be an extraordinary movie like Ghandi which is a similar genre. However I got dissapointed and will not recommend you this movie.

            "review_title": "Best movie of the 80's, no competition",
            "content": "As a keen follower of Chinese history, watching this movie when I was twenty probably engaged my enthusiasm. It is undoubtedly the best movie of the 1980s and number 3 on my top 50 movie list, it is one of the best movies ever in my opinion. It carries with it great emotion, reaching a brilliant climax right at the end when Pu Yi goes back to the Forbidden City to die in the place he was crowned.The story follows the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, from when he was crowned in 1909 to when he died in 1967. As is best for most movies, he is not an interesting character, but interesting things are always happening around him. He began his life as emperor of China at only three years of age before being overthrown by the nationalists two years later. After being forced to hide away in the Forbidden City for thirteen years, he and his two wives flee from the warlords to Tianjin (Tientsin) and he ends up working for the Japanese. His ancestors came from Manchuria, so when the Japanese offered for him to become puppet emperor of the state when they occupied it, he accepted. However, he did not like the Japanese policies and they immediately began to torment him, first by taking his wife away and tampering with her brain and then by locking him in his small palace. In the end, he is caught by the Russians and taken back to the PRC, where he spends nine years in prison.The entire movie is well done - flashbacks are used effectively throughout the whole movie, and the use of the Forbidden City and the Puppet Emperor's Palace as sets was greatly effective also. For a non-fiction biography, it is surprisingly well structured and amazing dramatics are used. Final ratings - Acting, 8/10. Cinematography, 10/10. Soundtrack, 9/10. Costumes, 10/10 (very realistic).",

            "content": "Reversal Of Fortune I saw this film when it was first released on video in 1988 and its power has never diminished.It is very easy to see how this won NINE Academy Awards including \"Best Picture.\" It visually stuns the senses. It's important to remember that in 1987 the communists were only beginning to open up China's national treasures to the western tourists. Unless you were a student of Chinese history, for most of the audience this was their first look at the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City restored to its 1908 glory was itself deserving of \"Best Picture.\" Any film set almost entirely the Forbidden City is truly bold. There is no comparison for a more powerful visual setting. The fact that they filmed in the real palace and not just a Hollywood set is overpowering.Bernardo Bertolucci uses his visual masterpiece to emphasize the dramatic reversals of fortune in Pu Yi's life. Arguably more of a reversal than almost any historical figure.Bertolucci uses flashbacks to visually contrast Pu Yi's pathetic existence as a political prisoner of the communists in the 1950s to his awesome childhood being crowned the sole ruler of 500,000,000 people at age 3 and being raised in the splendor of the Forbidden City.Only a few years later Pu Yi would find himself an exile in his own royal palace during the Chinese democratic and nationalist revolutions. He had no power, no talents, no friends or family. As he says in the film. \"The Forbidden City had become a theatre without an audience. Yet the actors remained on stage only to steal the set piece by piece.\" When he asks, \"Am I emperor?\" a eunuch answers, \"In the Forbidden City your majesty will always be emperor.\" A harsh reality meaning \"No.\" The only thing worse than being a prisoner of the Forbidden City was the being forced to leave it. With no out a home Pu Yi fled towards China's worst enemy during the time, the Japanese whom also held him captive for their own purposes.The film does not portray Pu Yi as good or evil, smart or stupid, but just one of the most tragic figures of history. We see him as an innocent toddler without any power or love in his life. Sadly this never changed.The often overlooked aspects of the film are the superb acting and dramatic musical score. John Lone is amazing throughout. Ric Young as the communist interrogator is very memorable and it's easy to see why he's always cast as an Asian villain. \"It is not an accusation! You are a traitor! You are a collaborator! And you are a counter revolutionary!\" Yikes! I can even remember his frightening performance from 1988!",

            "review_title": "What's It All About, Pu Yi?",
            "content": "This film used to be classified as \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" with the nothing being the character of Pu Yi, but the question after years of viewing and thought becomes, \"What's it all about?\"  Bertolucci spends tons of money and showcases opulence on a epic scale to tell the story of a man who descended into anonymity, who journeyed from greatness into cypher-dom, who make terrible decisions and was guided by selfish desires.  The greatness of \"The Last Emperor\" is in that question; Bertolucci taunts and challenges his audience to digest the once-lived visuals, the pomposity of the circumstance and realize life's absurdity and folly.  \"The Last Emperor\" is a religious allegory, but instead of raising religion on a pedastal, Bertolucci mocks God and religion, ultimately praising humanism, as portrayed in the final shots, as an older, \"educated\" Pu Yi shares the only lasting joy and wonderful memory of his childhood, the grasshopper.Vittorio Storaro brings as much to the design of this film as Ferdinando Scarfiotti, masterfully working bold strokes of color to emphasis the film's emotion.  The contrast of Italian imagery with Eastern subject is a fantastic dissonance few filmmakers can successfully achieve.  The modern air these characters breathe lends credibility to Peploe's screenplay: human characters caught in the turmoil of intrigue and impending death always react in an amoral way, justifying their brutality as survival. Many of the supporting characters, while never gaining audience empathy, defend the argument of their actions of drug-abuse, treachery, and psychological cannibalism.Sexual frankness is always a element to Bertolucci's films and his restraint here is both sensual and offensive.  Brando sodomizes with butter, but the three-way here is performed under opaque silk, lending it a more sensual air, but shields us from forbidden, exotic sex.  Is the Orient still taboo? Must we only be privy to the hairy, primal animalistic behavior of European sexuality, and not voyeurs into the smooth, delicate moves of another region's sexual play?  It is a surprising move from such an erotically provocative director, and while one may actually blame Puttnam's regime (the releasing studio was Columbia Pictures) for the censorship, Bertolucci's artistic power should have won the argument.As a stand-alone work of art, discounting the crass nine Oscars and its piddling box office stature, this film is harmed by its use of flashback, a contrived device to show off symbolism and color, more than an indictment of the infant regime \"educating\" war criminals.  It doesn't know where to take this guilty verdict, as the film ends during the \"cultural\" revolution, depicting the never-ending flip-flopping of political ideologies.  Would it have been more powerful to unravel the linear story line from epic to personal?  It will forever remain unanswered.Joan Chen is an exciting presence, and with this film, proves herself one of the most beautiful woman in the world.  John Lone is adequate in the title role, but is intimdated by Bertolucci's direction.  While passionate as a child, the character's battles become more internal and do not register. As a device, it supports the thesis of the character, but as a performance it loses the audience's interest.  We become more fascinated with the cruelty of the household than the political intrigues that forced Pu Yi's hand to the Russians. A more defiant Lone may have struggled with Bertolucci, but the result would have been a more fascinating portrayal.Despite criticism, this remains a film that must be viewed in letterbox and in surround sound (if possible).  Its title sequence alone is worth the price of admission and is a hell of a precursor to the experience one has watching this film.  The score (credited to three composers), is melodramatic and luscious, working our emotions and exhilirating the piece. It is gorgeous and enhances our experience.  It is recommended to cinema lovers everyone and the challenge remains to answer the question: \"What's it all about?\"",

            "review_title": "A Look Into the Mind of a Ruler",
            "content": "Many questions linger after this film.In the some odd seventeen years leading up to his death, the former emperor Pu Yi is defeated and unloved, long gone from the money and servants that framed the life that he leads us through in his flashbacks.  But had anything ever changed?  Much of the film shows him quite defeated and unloved, trapped in perhaps the most exclusive prison in the world.The director keeps in mind throughout this film that as he presents us the emperor, bit by bit, year by year, the audience must come to some opinion on how they view the man portrayed before them.  Will he be a man loved, or despised?  If no emotional attachment has been created, then the movie fails.My own opinion seems to have been caught between loving and hating him. Yes, the early scenes in which the emperor explores the limitless power and beauty bestowed upon him with child-like innocence and wonder are touching, but as he becomes a man, so does his world begin to be seen through the darkness and immorality of an adult.Never quite an \"absolute ruler\", the emperor's career seemed destined to fail by a world changing and advancing on its own far beyond his reach, both physically and symbolically.  Should we feel love for him because he has failed?  If Hitler had been unable to advance Nazi Germany to such imposing power in WWII, instead ending, let's say, as a lowly street sweeper, would not have film documentaries have crowned him the ingenious man that could have saved Germany from humiliation and poverty?Surely, Pu Yi had all the markings of an evil tyrant: the intimidating intelligence, the arrogance to challenge anyone or thing that defies him, and ultimately the will to mold any situation into his favor.There are many forces outside his grasp that shackle him, and inevitably he is indeed a failure, a joke.  But that is not enough to make me love him. It is an error to love a man for his failures, but rather one should love him for that which he contributes to life.  But what does Pu Yi contribute to his life?  His is littered with the bodies of those that have come into contact with him, a morbid graveyard created from deaths that did not come from his hands, but from his ego and his power.My inability to either love or hate him if anything makes him quite human. If he had been blatantly set up as an obvious protagonist or antagonist, the movie would have been flat, shallow.  Humans are hard things to find in movies these days, and here is a rare opportunity to catch a sight of one. Kudos to Bertolucci for such an intelligent film.",

Pu Yi (Played as an adult by John Lone)is brought to the Forbidden City as a child and is made emperor. From that moment he becomes a prisoner of circumstance: He cannot leave the palace and even though he is still the emperor, his power is limited to the inhabitants of the Forbidden City since China is ruled by a republic.Pu Yi wants desperately to escape to the West, starting a new way of life (Going to Oxford is one of his dreams), but he instead escapes into marriage with Wan Jung (Joan Chen) and takes on a concubine (Secondary consort is her title) as well. When he is thrown out of the Forbidden City, he sees a chance to follow his dreams, but instead becomes a puppet for the Japanese, becoming emperor to the republic of Manchuria, resulting in his arrest toward the end of World War II.

While he had almost absolute control of his subjects within his Empire, he was seen as more of a prisoner, involuntarily trapped within the confines of the Empire. Bernardo Bertolucci does extremely well to portray this to viewers, as there are many scenes in which viewers are made to pity Pu Yi's situation.THE LAST EMPEROR is a superb film featuring some of the best cinematography, set direction, costume design, and music of all time. The screenplay is simply magnificent, and viewers will find themselves totally drawn into the film as it progresses. The pacing of this film is a strong part of what makes it so great, as it never seems to sprawl for long periods of time. Taking home 9 Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) in a relatively good year for Motion Pictures is no fluke. THE LAST EMPEROR is a film that simply should not be missed.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at #98. Highly recommended.",

I didn't realize it won best picture until after I watched it, so I watched it again in the hopes of seeing something I missed. I only made in half way through. When I read that it won all 9 of the Oscars for which it was nominated, I was even more surprised when I looked at some of the categories. Best picture? I guess compared to the other nominees, that's possible. Best cinematography - sure, it is a gorgeous film. Best costuming - yes, absolutely. Best sound - perhaps, I don't know how this is judged, although I can think of at least one instance where a \"sound effect\" didn't even match the action, but I'd rather not get into it. Best score? This I take great issue with. The main theme was poignant, but incessantly repetitive. And shallow, without depth or variety. It made the film sound like a T.V. movie of the week. When I saw that John Williams was up for an award that year and LOST to this score I was shocked. I expect Williams would do better humming in the shower than what we got here. I wish he HAD scored this film, it might not have been so tedious. Best editing? I don't know - there were definitely things going on that didn't make sense (in my opinion) that might have been more clear with either better direction or editing. Also, sequences that could have been shorter were not cut, scenes that needed more development were prematurely dropped. Overall the acting was very good, with O'Toole giving a wonderful performance, as usual. In fact, I liked all the actors and performances. I will watch this again in a widescreen format if I get the chance, but not before. If I have to listen to that overused, underdeveloped excuse for a \"theme\" again without good reason I might not be too happy.",

In this movie I think the drama captured the political unrest with enthusiasm and vigor for a memorable experience of the Chinese national transition in respect to the imperial household and society's' national Chinese identity through political change. Being the Emperor must be very difficult during this time period. I am not so sure about the moral, ethical, and pathos displayed and depicted with the royal household in this movie. Since servants are trained professionally from a young age with strict discipline some of the un-ethical and immoral acts by the emperor seem very hard to believe. Such as the use of drugs, and illicit sex uncommon to the use of concubines which was more historical. Actually because the cricket was still alive in the end of this movie I still think the Royal Household still exists in a non-formal intangible way within the society of China or else-where through Chinese mysticism. Somewhat symbolized in the spirituality where guidance exists through family lineage found in wisdom. Even in the Walt Disney movie Mulan the use of knowledge, science, and society was always a common theme to defeat the enemy with the help of the spiritual family lineage and presence of social brotherhood symbolized by a combination of mushu the dragon, \"Lucky\" cricket, and sword of the father through reflection of this social wisdom.",

The marriage of Bernardo Bertolucci's persistent direction and Vittorio Storaro's lyrical cinematography produce a spectacular visual context, created exclusively on-location. With reverence and respect, the two Italian masters offer Western audiences precious glimpses of life and culture in one of the world's most complex civilizations. The didactic theme of the film is equally precious, delivered through the life of an 'emperor of nothing', whose elevated social position causes his life to be meaningless and interned. Paradoxically, his prison reeducation under the communist regime frees him physically and mentally by rendering him, for the first time of his life, master of his own actions. Sadly, the film's visual and moralizing components appear to exhaust the film's usefulness. The script tends to spiral around itself producing several meaningless segments, and one gets the impression that, more often than not, Bertolucci treats his actors as rudimentary, consuming himself with visual delivery and theoretical extrapolations to the expense of character development. Ultimately, more equilibrium between the film's elements would probably have achieved a higher degree of purpose, whose absence undermines this fine production in more ways than one.",

They could never realize, nor understand this level of cinematography and would turn it into a Pearl Harbor (Oh my!). What makes this movie great, is the way the movie continuously shows what seems  to be a fairy-tale, but what is in fact nothing more but a play. A play played in China, suffering extraordinary changes itself. As Pu Yi mentions himself: a theatre without an audience. Left long ago. This movie focuses on a single man, trying to make a change, but fails, for he is nothing but a puppet, controlled by the Japanese, as he for years was a puppet for China. He is eager to be in control, simply in order to make those changes reality, makes him an easy target for the Japanese. He grows up to be served and to be seen as the almighty and cannot hold himself up in New China, where there is no place for an emperor any longer. The only persons that seems to do well in this new environment, is the woman who had in fact even less freedom; Pu yi's second wife. She claims her freedom after being settled in England. Because The Last Emperor focuses on Pu Yi and his relatives, while moving the political issues  to the background, makes this movie so 'uneasy' to look at. There is this wonderful story of a little lad who grows up in an ancient surrounding, but there is always the noise from beyond the walls he doesn't understand. He cannot understand why everything from beyond those walls (his brother paying him a visit now and then, Johnson, his tutor) seems to move on. Within those walls, time seems to stand still and everybody near him appears so eager to keep the 'real' world outside the walls of the Forbidden City. The music makes this movie complete. A movie without good music is half wasted. It matches perfectly with the emotions, time and location. Surely Bertolucci's best movie.",

His existence was only used to achieve other people's greed, such as eunuchs and the Japanese.His miserable lifetime was saying farewell to everyone close to him. He cannot meet his mother since he was an infant; his beloved wife left him in an unexpected way; his English teacher went back to the United Kingdom unwillingly because of the war. I could feel the powerlessness of Pu Yi. Although he was served by thousands of people, he was still unhappy and lonely, I could see through his desperate eyes.

Even at 218 minutes, the film doesn't drag, except maybe during the re-education scenes (and they dragged even in the short version). This longer version also makes it clearer exactly what was going on between China and Japan in World War II. Those who find the film uninvolving are missing the point. The movie is supposed to be cold, and you're not supposed to feel anything for Pu Yi, even though he is used and abused throughout. (In the longer version, he is less sympathetic.)And for the guy who was creeped out by the breast-feeding scene: it's SUPPOSED to be disturbing. Bertolucci's fondness for kinkiness is all throughout this movie, while still keeping a PG-13 rating. And yes, there are flaws. The four actors playing Pu Yi at different ages don't resemble each other. The kid playing him at 12 has an American accent; the one playing him at 16 has a thicker \"Chinese\" accent than John Lone. One additional comment about the DVD: the movie is in horrible shape! It is only 16 years old, yet it is full of blotches and age spots. Compare this to the recent release of CASABLANCA, which is 61 years old, yet has undergone a stunning restoration. You'd think that whoever was editing the directors' cut of LAST EMPEROR would have cleaned up the print as well. Also the sound is only digital 2.0. They couldn't have remixed it for 5.1?",

But the plot is lacking.Perhaps because of the sheer amount of material the movie tries to compress into two hours and 40 minutes no particular scene of the movie stands out. In fact, it seems as if as the movie gets longer the drama and energy are stretched thin. As Vincent Canby said in his review in The New York Times, \"It contains just enough information to send one looking for 'From Emperor to Citizen,' Pu Yi's autobiography\u0085\" It seems like this film lacks the emotional attachment to hold one's attention for the full run time. Yes, Pu Yi's life as a puppet emperor is interesting, but somehow the movie shows like a documentary. It has the sort of appeal that an interesting documentary does as well. The characters seem more like simple historical figures than people with whom one can connect. Note that Mr. Canby said it contained enough \"information\" to pique one's interest in this time period. He did not say it held enough appeal to make one fascinated with Pu Yi's struggle. And it doesn't.That being said, The Last Emperor as a documentary would outshine every one ever created. It is the perhaps the most visually spectacular movie in history. The way director Bernardo Bertolucci uses color delights the eye. The present, in a Communist Chinese \"reeducation\" camp, is in dull, muted colors, while the past is shown in vibrant reds and yellows. The scenery is outstanding, particularly the shots of the Forbidden City. And one can appreciate the impact this movie had, both on cinematography and history. But what The Last Emperor amounts to is a beautiful piece of art that is as detached from its subjects as Pu Yi is from his. This is not an awful movie. It is simply too average.",

            "content": "I must say this film is very well done. It shows a deep respect for the book it followed \"From Emporer to Citizen\" written by Pu Yi himself. Everything from the Elegant screen captures to the Actor's that portrayed Pu Yi. I believe no one could have directed or accomplished anything better on screen about the Forbidden city and Pu Yi's life better than Bernardo Bertolucci. The movie kept me well informed and emotionally concerned for the Emporer's life and what would happen to him. His life was a sad one i believe but not forgotten (in my opinion). Most of the Movie was completely flawless, i do think though that the sexual imagery could have been dimmed down a bit, obviously in scenes where Pu Yi did not witness such acts, so how could he write about it. The movie could also have moved more faster, Believe me when i say i loved this movie but it took me 2 days to watch because it took my attention away at times, especially when you know whats going on, ... you do not need 5 minutes of watching someone in bed or slowly roaming down the length of entire loooooong table. Those moments should have been avoided. But none the less this film brings out much history of that era and remains to be a beloved story as well as a witness to sympathetic tragedy.Very rarely do you get to see the whole life of someone and their struggles - from child to death. So much information, so much Beauty and so much Old culture, this still is not a movie to ever be missed, definitely see it as it is sure to captivate your imagination.",

            "content": "\"The Last Emperor\" is based largely off the autobiography of Pu Yi, the last ruler of the Chinese Ching Dynasty. The film covers the years 1908 to 1967 where we follow Pu Yi's journey from Emperor, to prisoner, to political puppet, to his transformation through the \"re-education\" under the Mao Communist Party. It is an incredible piece of film making and an intriguing look at China's modern history.Bertolucci's historical-epic, biopic is not a character study, it is a fascinating glimpse at the tumultuous modern history of China told through an incredibly unique perspective. While the titular \"Last Emperor\" is the protagonist and audience P.O.V character, the film maintains a cool distance creating a sense of objectivity that lends greater credibility in the eyes of the viewer to the film's depiction of Pu Yi. We can at times sympathise with his dramatic displacement and disillusionment and then feel disgusted by his lust to regain power and his inhumane indifference to others. It is however important to recognise there is a difference between the film language conveying a sense of objectivity and true objectivity, the script was after all based largely off the Emperor's autobiography and it would be near impossible for the book or the film to truly capture his character wholly and without judgement.The scale and ambition of this film is undeniable. The real locations, perfectly reconstructed sets, amazing costuming and multitude of extras feel authentic and convey the immense power and opulence of The Forbidden City. The image of a baby Emperor standing atop high stairs overlooking thousands of subjects is such a striking image that it stays with the audience all throughout the film. That impression is evoked within the mind of the viewer repeatedly during the film as the long wide-angle shots are mirrored, juxtaposing the changed Forbidden City as it rapidly declines in its grandeur. It is both beautiful to look at and a great example of visual storytelling, the Forbidden City becomes barren and seeing the Emperor small and alone we feel his isolation.The attention to detail and meticulous craft of this only recently lost world has a strong feeling of authenticity. This is unfortunately undercut by one of the films strangest creative decisions, that being the choice to have all the characters speak English. The otherwise quality performances are diminished by the actors delivering understandably stilted dialogue in what is clearly not their first language. This awkward delivery robs the film of much of its' intended emotion. To cover such a large story and span of time, covering complex issues the film is forced to gloss over some of the finer details leading to a potential misrepresentation of some historical events. Whether this was intentional or not the film glosses over the civil unrest within China during the reign and fall of the dynasty, the horrific acts that followed the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, and the conditions within the \"re-education\" camps which were used for brainwashing and forced labour were accounted to be far more brutal with many prisoners suffering from starvation and few prisoners ever being released.Despite the clunky dialogue, historical inaccuracies and very long run time, the film remains an incredible achievement. Telling an enthralling epic about a lesser known side of modern history put to screen with beautiful design and purposeful cinematography. Imperfect yet impressive.",

It is a long film ,but three hours or so is about right to portray years of complicated and fascinating history and also to keep the viewers attention ,although to cover this aspect of Chinese history more comprehensively it would take several more hours .

It's understandable for it has not so many layers as masterpieces he made before (La Luna, Il Conformista) which makes this less intelligent and more consumable for a wider audience. For that i could be considered a new attempt to make something like his other masterpiece Novecento. So the life of Pu Yi is told from the beginning to the end. As with so many biography-movies that leads to a bit of a And then, And then, and then\u0085etc-plot. So the plot is not what does make this a great movie but the camera-work really saves this. It's beautifully photographed and widely recognized as one of the films you should see on the big screen. In the Netherlands there even was a commercial where they used The Last Emperor for a cinema-advertising-campaign: The big screen, the big difference. I must say that since the introduction of the DVD i seldom go to movie-theaters any more (no noisy public, no going through bad water, at home you can smoke during a movie and stop the DVD to make a sanitary stop. Luckily it also Works great on the TV-screen. So not his best movie but for the beautiful cinematography it gets 8 out of 10 points (very good, buy the DVD)",

            "content": "We see his life as one unlikely person, the one person that one would have most expect to have been insulated, in a gigantic tragedy -- that of China between the chaotic beginning of what might have been a long reign and the destructive Cultural Revolution of Mao, with coups, warlord rule, World War II, and the Marxist Revolution culminating in the rise of Mao. One recognizes that the pathologies of imperial China never truly died, but merely took new forms in the cult of the Leader. That the scenery is beautiful and hedonism among elites is rife hardly conceals the fact that China was a political Hell.Pu Yi, once the Emperor of the great (but decrepit) Chinese Empire, becomes Emperor of the Forbidden Palace in 1912 before he is expelled in one of many violent revolutions (this one in 1925) in China. We see him doing a few things right, like reforming the Palace bureaucracy from a den of thieves into something honorable. He gets a superb adviser in Reginald Johnston, who gave him the confidence to be a political figure -- even a good one -- in the happiest time of his life. Johnston leaves as Pu Yi is expelled from the Palace, and eventually falls under the spell of the Japanese, who rip Manchuria from China and find someone willing to rule it in an enlightened manner -- himself. The Prime Minister of his choosing is killed, and Pu Yi becomes a puppet ruler of a contemptible entity. It's just like the old days, only the intriguers are worse -- far worse. The decrepitude of the system sets in at the first moment. As Emperor he can only accede to what his Japanese overlords demand.At the end of the war he is arrested by the Soviets because he dallies too long on unfinished business -- and after the 1949 Revolution he is sent back to China as a war criminal and traitor. Rather than being executed (as one might expect) he is sent to prison as a convict.As a prisoner he is incarcerated with some of his former underlings -- war criminals of the Manchukuo puppet state -- who have learned to ape the ideology of their captors, and he runs afoul of those 'fellow' inmates. Ex-fascists make the most fervent communists. All in all, he simplifies and becomes a very ordinary man in a society that punished anyone who challenged anything that the regime didn't want people to challenge.Pure puppet? Not quite. A dupe who never left when the going was good -- if the going was ever good -- and that is exactly what the Imperial role made him. In childhood the ruler of the greatest empire (in population size, that is) on Earth -- in a premature old age, a cipher. Then again, what else did most Chinese ever become in China during the first two thirds of the 20th century become -- ciphers, old before their time, wrecks of no fault of their own, just to survive.",

            "content": "I define this work as: a realistic biography of Puyi in the form of film.The film is very depressed, too lonely, from the age of three he enter the Forbidden City, he was doomed to the tragedy of this life. From the age of three to fifty-four, he was almost under house arrest all his life. He was put under house arrest in the Forbidden City before he was a teen , in Manchuria after adulthood, and in ideological labor reform during his middle age. He is a human being, but he is like a doll. He is played by the times and tied by fate. It was not his decision that he ascended the throne when he was a kid. After he ascended the throne, he found that the world was not belong to him. The world outside was ever-changing, but he was separated by a wall. When he finally left the Forbidden City, warlords were fighting, his family's bones were dug up and burned, so he had to take refuge in Japan. Who knows that he became a puppet under house arrest under Japan. Later, the times changed again, it was the Communist Party, he was locked up in the ideological reform. All the changes in China are affecting his destiny, but he has nothing to do.Because of his status, he is the emperor, but he has no power. Many people were born ordinary people, but it took him a lifetime to become an ordinary person. In his later years, he became a gardener, but he had to buy tickets when he went back to his home. I really like the Surrealist shooting of the last scene, which he got the cricket at the age of three, and finally he gave it to the son of the security guard. The cricket is just like him. He had been locked in the box all his life. He gave the cricket to the kid. The cricket climbed out and he disappeared.The scene of the red guards fighting was also ironic. The red guards holding the portrait of Chairman Mao and calling Chairman Mao long live is no different from the scene of the Qing Dynasty when they took up the sedan chair to worship the emperor. The only different is just that the times have changed and the rulers have changed.Another point I want to say is that the Chinese people's servility has remained unchanged for thousands of years.At the beginning of the movie, Empress Dowager Cixi is dying, and everyone is still afraid of her. Thousands of people kneel down to Puyi, who is three years old, with a serious face. Puyi asks the man to drink the ink, so he really drinks it. Even at that time, the whole Qing Dynasty had no ruling authority. Everyone is willing to perform such a play. Even later, Puyi was displaced, and the servant was willing to tie his shoelaces at the reform centre. That's because everyone thinks he is an emperor after all.In the feudal rule of China for thousands of years, everyone has been instilled with the idea that heaven and earth are the Dynasty and the son of heaven. The change of Dynasty is not important. It doesn't matter who the emperor is. As long as you are, I will obey. The Chinese have always been subconsciously obedient to the so-called high-level officials. Even after the founding of the people's Republic of China, the rulers would still be put on the altar to praise. Everyone shouts \"revolution is innocent, revolt is reasonable, don't revolution roll back to the garbage...\" All people still keep the old servility, the ruler says 1 is 1, you think 2, then you are guilty, that is the so-called political correctness. In fact, it's the same now. This kind of servility is engraved in DNA and can't be changed in decades.",

Bertolucci is a master storyteller who reveals the tragic personal story of the young emperor while giving a fascinating Chinese history lesson for all the ages.If you have the slightest interest in Chinese history, the movie will amaze and educate. The fact that China began a major resurgence since the movie's release in 1987 only makes The Last Emperor even more relevant to global audiences.

A 3h40m movie (please, watch this extended version) that won 9 Oscars (including Best Director) and showed us in a flawless way the transition from China's Imperialism to Communism.\nBased on the life of Puyi, the last Emperor of China, and filmed inside the Forbidden City, this epic biographical drama is an historical and technical lesson from Bertolucci on how to use locations, costumes, colors and extras to create the everyday reality. A blend between unique scenarios or clothes and loneliness or sadness. A tragedy that tells us how lonely it can be to live in a world where there are only walls, and we all know that very well... Like his tutor would say: I think the Emperor is the loneliest boy on Earth. An isolation that lasted 18 years and didn't prepare Puyi to what was to come. Lost between tradition and modernity, Puyi is not able to make his ideas flourish and gets expelled from the Forbidden City, starting a swirl of events: from playboy in Tianjin, Japan to Emperor in Manchukuo, the puppet state.\nA movie about the eccentricity and peculiarity of a man that was crowned before he knew who he was and that had to run away when he realized that the world is too complex to try to understand it. Beautifully scored by Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Byrne (Rain - I Want a Divorce, is a true gem), this picture didn't aim to introduce any heroic figure but instead to show the man itself with all its flaws. A title flushed by irony and a life that was torn apart by his incapacity to adapt, losing his mother, nurse, home, wife and at last, his power.",

Beautifully shot, acted by some of the most amazing actors around & benefiting of a good budget, this film is from another age, a time when cinema was still able to transport you into another world & make you dream.Bertolucci has created a masterpiece, a must see for any cinephile out there wishing to enlarge their personal culture.",

            "content": "The harsh and unique life of Puyi, the last emperor of Qing dynasty in the drastically changing modern China. The plot is not based on the fact but It helped to describe his whole life in an appealing way. His growth, frustration and arrogance are well expressed. When it comes to cinematography, the scene of coronation is breathtaking. Even if its not completely based on the fact, it's better to know some basic knowledge about East Asia within around 1900 to WW2. It helps you to understand the situations Puyi is facing.",

            "content": "To give one an impression of how amazing this film is, I could barely hear the dialogue but the music and visuals were clear. The imagery in the Forbidden City will floor you. If gravity ever stops working for some reason, we will just have to display the scene where Puyi is three and runs out to the courtyard of his thousands of subjects bowing. Its enough to keep anyone mounted to the ground.And Talking Head David Byrne did the music! It can't stress how wonderful a film this is. I am truly surprised it isn't on IMDb Top 250. It was actually a film of its year that deserved the cluster of Oscars (9 in '87).beautiful and devastating like a Shakespearian tragedy",

            "content": "I like history and politics very much, especially some mysterious events of the history and the history of the Qing Dynasty . This film just provides me with such a good opportunity. This film is a mixture of the narration from Pu Yi in his prison term and the life when he was still an emperor, so at first, I was a little puzzled, just the same as the feeling when I was watching the \"The Da Vinci Code\".But a few minutes later, I catch the clue. In the estimation of the world, the life of an emperor is wonderful: luxurious, comfortable, sovereign\u0085\u0085 In a word, it is ideal, and what all of us are dreaming of. However, it is an exception in this film. Yes, Pu Yi will never be worried about his physical life and he will never know what is the poverty, but his owning of these things is in expense of his freedom, which, in my opinion, is the most valuable thing to a person. Pu Yi was an emperor, but to be more exact, he was just a prisoner, a tool of those western governments. So Ifeel a little sympathetic with him.",

            "content": "The movie The Last Emperor shows in the year 1987 as a 166 minutes film. The director of this film is Bernardo Bertolucci. He is an Italian director. The movie The Last Emperor is a China, Italy, the United Kingdom jointly produced movie. It tells the story of Pu Yi. He is the last emperor of China. This movie is the first fully cooperated with the government of mainland China and shot in mainland China to complete the production Western film since the Chinese Communist Party to hold the reins of government in 1949. This movie has created several Chinese film and television history: the first in the Forbidden City viewfinder feature film rather than the piece of information, and is completely cleared to remove the fence framing. This is the first time Bernardo Bertolucci tells the story of China. This film won the 1987 Academy Award nine awards. And this film is the first film about China which won the Academy Award. This film is the first time Chinese people did not make any restrictions of movie content. The AIXINJUELUO Pu Yi is the last monarch of the Qing Dynasty, since the emperor Qin Shi Huang established system. I think the movie The Last Emperor is a great momentum, rich colors, and the scene was spectacular, superb skills epic. The storyline of the film is according to the memory of Pu Yi. The film begins in the winter at the year 1950. In this year, Pu Yi as a war criminal from the Soviet Union was escorted back to China. Pu Yi believed that to survive, so he slipped into the bathroom, and attempted to commit suicide. Then Pu Yi caught in a memory. Then movie began to tell us the story of Pu Yi also in winter at the year 1908 as he was 3 years old. From the film we can easily find though Pu Yi is a monarch, but when he began to reign he was just 3 years old. So when held enthronement, he just pay attention to the grasshopper, he cannot see the civil and military ministers. Then the shot came back to he stand trial, accept the prisoner's life of transformation. So he met his brother Pu Jie, then he retrospect 40 years before. At that time, he knew that he had the supreme powers, so he began to wanton tease and maltreatment eunuchs. In the year 1919, Pu Yi began to accept the influence of Western culture. For this his life style has been changed. Then the shot came back again, as he was required to tell the whole his stories, then the film go on to talk about the things in the year 1924. When he was telling his stories, the shots always back to the prison. From these we can see the change of Pu Yi, he from a do not know how to wear clothes emperor to one can take care of himself and engage in light work of civilians. In the year 1959, Pu Yi was special amnestied, then he was working in the Beijing Botanical Garden. Emperor it represents a \"royal prerogative\" paramount right lines in the movie is: \"Long live, you can do anything.\" But the identity of the emperor never bring true happiness to him, childhood, he is the most lonely child inside the walls, until he became manipulated by the Japanese puppet emperor, he never really be able to call the shots for themselves over, everything is not of his own choosing, even the woman he married. Pu Yi's life is the ever-changing period in China's political and ideological. From the color of Forbidden City oil painting of red and golden, the light of the National Government faint light and pale, the color in posters of the Cultural Revolution green and red all implied this. In the film can find something wrong, at the beginning of the film there appears a painting \"to in Jinggangshan enter\" in 1950, but in fact, this painting was created in the 1970s. Maybe because the director is a Italian, so he do not know in the Qing Dynasty, they call mother is eniang, not the mum. And in part of the year of 1931 in the film, you can find there appear simplified Chinese, but in fact at that time, China was using the traditional characters. I think these points appear was because they do not know too much of China, so they may not find these mistakes.",

This movie describes cultural and political changing of China Empire successfully, though describing of changing countries and cultures is way too diffucult thing in history as a branch of science. Bertolucci approaches the subject as though he is a historian. Fans of history and biography must definitely watch this movie. I heavily recommend The Last Emperor. 10/10 in point of history and biography.",
