            "content": "\"Caddyshack II\" tries to continue the comedy of the first, but never does really come together the way it was intended to.  Chevy Chase is the only returner from the original and this hurts the film.  Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Jonathan Silverman, Dyan Cannon, Randy Quaid, and Dan Aykroyd do their best, but the material is just not present.  The direction is also poor as few viewers will really care what happens by the end of the movie. 2 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Every time I watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes. Yes, you read that correctly: I've watched this wretched, foul thing more than once.Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to tinker with the script, Bill Murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it, and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better.I can't help but think of Dyan Cannon in this and wonder why she's perpetually laughing and smiling. The only conclusion I can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil. Stay with me a moment. She must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them. She may also have been extremely drunk. That's what I need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind. If I'm lucky it'll be washed out forever.I have seen this film several times. I blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim-witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. Perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is funnier now ... guess I was just dull. Caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that. It WAS. It IS. It will only get worse with time.My reasons for going back to this film, mercifully, are becoming fewer. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle. We see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland. Randy Quaid acquits himself well, and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic, he was it.Maybe that's the trick of the movie. It has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it, are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them. Years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats.Jackie Mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness, I'm not sure he deserves it. He's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. That's who the movie was written for but I'm not sure even he could have saved it. Ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction, bad editing (shall we count continuity errors?) and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing.Dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by Randy Quaid's bulldog determination. It isn't even bad enough to laugh at. I've definitely seen worse, but trust your memory -- this one is a dog. If you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and I salute your excellent judgement.",

            "content": "After all seeing the very funny movie Caddyshack, I was looking forward to seeing the sequel, but I have to admit that I was nervous because I heard a lot of bad things about Caddyshack 2. I was also reading on the internet how this was voted one of the worst sequels of all time, which is sad. But I wanted to see the movie still, just at least see if it was really that bad. So I rented it anyways and watched it the other night. Now, I agree, this movie is really stupid, but it's a funny stupid that's very light hearted and has a few really good laughs. I know Randy Quaid can be annoying at times, but he really steals the show and his comedy is outrageous. I didn't like how they were trying to replace certain characters from the first film, but I let go and ended up laughing and having fun with Caddyshack 2.Jack Hartounian is what you might call, \"New Money\", but he's a very successful in construction and is worth millions. He's a bit out there, personality wise, and dresses a bit crazy, but knows the hard work of the common man. His daughter, Katie, begs him to join a golf club so she could be with the upper class elite. But he makes a fool of himself and wants revenge on those who made fun of him. He buys the club and turns it into an amusement park! But this doesn't stop the elite from trying to tear him down.Caddyshack 2 is stupid at times, like the gofer, they took the joke a little far. And Dan Aykrod's character, I love Dan so much, but it's like he took on Bill Murray's character from the first Caddyshack and made Dan really annoying. Jackie Mason is a bit out there and can't stand up to Rodney Dangerfield. But Caddyshack 2 still has a few good laughs, I mean, if you couldn't laugh at Randy Quaid and how he delivered his lines, check your funny bones. Caddyshack 2 is a silly movie, but it's all in good fun, but if we are just going to keep comparing to the first movie, then you're not going to have a good time.5/10",

            "content": "Here's another example of a sequel that falls into \"the too late, and why bother category\". It has one asset: Jackie Mason. He's a classic, and rightfully likable guy, where Bushwood won't accept him, so he retaliates and that he does with personal malice, by planning to knock it down and put up an amusement park. All the magic to the original Caddyshack has gone, save for a couple of original stars, including that notorious gopher who we see more of, in this. Chevy Chase chatting up some hotties, uses some rude, tasteless lines that kind of mirrors how this quality whole movie comes across. Dan Ackroyd, donning a real high squealy voice, comes across as really annoying, a pain in the butt, which is where he gets shot with an poison arrow. Watching Weekend At Bernie's Jonathan Silverman at the start, getting used, by a snotty heartlss bi..h, that has him running many yards to fetch her a soft drink, made me thirsty, which had me thinking later, this scene was pointless and unfunny, although I'll always remember it. Mason and some hotties are really the only things, this movie has going for it, oh, and that gopher. Off by many tees.",

            "content": "While this one certainly is not the original, it certainly isn't bad enough to be on the list of worst movies ever.  I found some of the jokes to be funny and it wasn't a complete waste of time so I just don't see how it has such a low ranking.  Well maybe I do.  The main problems I had with this one are the story and its focus.  This movie really has nothing to do with caddies, other than Silverman's character there are no other caddies that are focused on.  In fact, other than the fact it is a country club, Chevy's character is back, and the gopher it really doesn't have much else in common with the original.  Jackie Mason is the focal point here taking the Rodney Dangerfield role from the first.  Here is one of the problems; he isn't nearly as funny or likable as Dangerfield.  The scenes with his daughter also get annoying as it gets somewhat serious at times.  Chevy reprises his role as Ty, but other than the fact he goes \"nananana\" he almost is a different character.  Dan Akroyd sort of takes the place of Bill Murray's character and has a few funny lines, but his performance will not make anyone forget Bill Murray from the first one.  Also, you do not have special appearances in a movie, when that appears it just makes your whole movie seem a bit generic.  Also, both Chevy and Dan were in the movie more than say Marsha Warfield who is listed ahead of them.  There are some good performances though...I liked Randy Quaid's character and Robert Stack was rather good too.  It is good for a couple of laughs and I do not really think it is all that awful, but if only they could have done a better job with the central story in this one.  I just don't think Jackie was very good and he kind of pulls the movie down a couple of notches.",

It hurt me deeply, because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason, and Dyan Cannon. The writing was just terrible! I thought Chevy would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did. There was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie. I went into it wanting to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh but nearly cried. In the beginning credits it read Special Appearance by Chevy Chase. This worried me from the start. Chevy is actually in more than I thought he would be. It's more than a \"special appearance\". Too bad the appearance wasn't special. Mason's character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main. I would rather have seen more (much more)of Dyan Cannon. At least her character was fun, if not well written. I also missed the gratuatis teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him.I take it back. Try..to watch half of this movie, then...remember the Alamo, the Maine, and CaddyShack I.",

No, a bizarre and whiny Dan Ackroyd, in what has to be the worst performance of his career.

Randy Quaid is just awful (surprise!) as is Dyan Cannon, Jonathan Silverman and Dina Merrill. The script could have been written by a high school drama class (and probably was), the direction is tepid and unfocused, and the whole thing is a limp and deadly mess.Save your time and money and brain cells.

            "content": "Have you ever heard the old expression \"you can never go back\"? Well, regardless, the saying definitely holds true when it comes to \"Caddyshack II\"...a film that fails in every way to capture the magic (such as it was) in \"Caddyshack\". Part of the problem is that this sequel came out eight years later....the other part is that almost no one from the original film is in this one. The sole person playing the same part is Chevy Chase...and he was the worst part of the original film!In this story, a young girl from humble roots has inexplicably made friends with a cold and nasty spoiled brat. The brat's father runs a countryclub and so the girl's family is invitied to visit the place. However, the Hartounians are anything but the types for countryclubs and Jack Hartounian (Jackie Mason) soon ends up making a mess of everything with his low-class ways. All this results in great embarrassment for the Hartounian daughter who wants to fit in with the nasty rich jerks that are members of the place. And, it results in the club members not only giving Jack Hartounian the cold shoulder but trying to destroy his business...out of spite. And, naturally, Hartounian returns the favor!Because of the dearth of original actors who reprised their roles, the filmmakers made a very bad decision. While the cute groundhog was one of the best things about the original film, here in the sequel they elevate its part significantly....which is NOT a great idea when you're talking about a puppet! Now, the puppet can actually talk (a bit) and its antics are no longer cute but boorish and stupid. Add to that lots of farting, a horse that laughs. the most idiotic golfing scenes in history as well as joke after joke after joke that fall completely flat because they aren't funny, and you've got a film that is a chore to watch.I would have to agree with comments like \"it's the worst sequel ever\"....as I can't think of a worse one off the top of my head. However, it has a few tiny laughs here and there so it manages to eke out a 2...hardly a glowing endorsement for this mess! It's inept on every level...and especially where it counts...with the god-awful writing. As for the acting, it isn't good...but Dan Akryoyd is simply god-awful....worse than he was in \"Dr. Detroit\" or \"Neighbors\" or even \"Nothing But Trouble\"!",

I'm not a quitter.What happened here?  What somehow made the original a classic lies with the filmmakers' decision to toss the script more-or-less and rely on the improvisational genius of the veteran comics.  Here, the viewer is dragged though a lifeless, by-the-numbers 80s light comedy PLOT and left feeling hurt and confused and certainly not filled with mirth.  Oh sure, you've got the talents of Jonathan Silverman AND Marsha Warfield (I keep waiting for some forward thinking, cutting edge network to bring back her talk show) vying for your attentions IN THE SAME MOVIE!  And you get to see Jackie Mason in a lead role!  That's not enough?  Well, the two returning characters, Chevy Chase's Ty Webb and the gopher certainly pull their weight.  Chase has no shame and everybody knows it.  Robert Stack could make Hooked On Phonics sound like Crime and Punishment, so there's no fault there.  Quaid and Akyroid are annoying as always....Oh, I thought of something good!  The Kenny Loggins theme song is fantastic! Far superior to his contribution to the original Caddyshack.

            "content": "It took eight years for a sequel to Caddyshack to get made, perhaps the greatest \"hijinks ensue\" movie ever made. I say that phrase because it's such a simple concept: a quick statement like \"A day in the life of a golf course...and hijinks ensue.\"The beauty of the original film is that despite the out there characters like Chevy Chase's Ty Webb and Rodney Dangerfield's Al Czervik, the story is really about the struggles of Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a working-class kid forced to follow the whims of the incredibly rich in the hopes that he can work toward a better life. It also comes from actual life, as writer Brian Doyle-Murray, his brothers Bill and John, too -- was a caddie at Indian Hill Club in Winnetka, Illinois. His brothers Bill and John Murray, and director Harold Ramis had all been in Danny's caddy shoes at one point. Most of the people in the movie were all based on actual members of the clubs that they had worked at.Ramis told the A. V. Club that he went in with the right intentions: \"They said, \"Hey, we've got a great idea: The Shack is Back! And I said, \"No, I don't think so.\" But they said that Rodney really wanted to do it, and we could build it around Rodney. Rodney said, \"Come on, do it.\" Then the classic argument came up which says that if you don't do it, someone will, and it will be really bad. So I worked on a script with my partner Peter Torokvei, consulting with Rodney all the time. Then Rodney got into a fight with the studio and backed out. We had some success with Back to School, which I produced and wrote, and we were working with the same director, Alan Metter. When Rodney pulled out, I pulled out, and then they fired Alan and got someone else. I got a call from co-producer Jon Peters saying, \"Come with us to New York; we're going to see Jackie Mason!\" I said, \"Ooh, don't do this. Why don't we let it die?\" And he said, \"No, it'll be great.\" But I didn't go, and they got other writers to finish it. I tried to take my name off that one, but they said if I took my name off, it would come out in the trades and I would hurt the film.\"This moment of wondering why this movie is being made and feeling is that it's the wrong idea? That will come up throughout the discussion of this movie.So instead of Rodney, we get Jackie Mason. Sure, they're both older Jewish comedians who married much younger women late in their lives, but that's about all they have in common. Rodney's character was an everyman who seemed to be using the audience as his therapist, bemoaning the way he was treated with lines like \"I know I'm ugly. I said to a bartender, \"Make me a zombie.' He told me that God beat him to it.\" To me, Mason always felt like he was lecturing the audience, somewhat above it*.Dan Aykroyd is one of my favorite actors, but he's basically coming on to be Bill Murray. And while Jonathan Silverman and Michael O'Keefe are somewhat interchangeable, there's a large divide between Robert Stack and Ted Knight. And that's no slight to any of these actors, but when you're placed in the same exact role as a movie that is beloved, you're going to get compared. After all, Ted Knight is my favorite villain in any movie. He's perfect in his role. And while I love Robert Stack, I can only see him in heroic roles or parts that make fun of his heroic nature.I mean, I love Randy Quaid, but his role was written for Sam Kinison, who would have destroyed audiences with that part.To be fair, Dangerfield was to be in this, but a month before production, he bailed, realizing that it wouldn't work. He kept adding to his contract, demanding final cut and royalties and getting everything he wanted, except to be released from the film. This all ended up with him facing a $10 million dollar lawsuit.But there still needed to be a movie.As for director Allan Arkush, he told Sports Illustrated \"I should have never made this movie! What was I thinking?\" He told us -- in an interview we were honored to get to conduct -- \"You should never make a movie for the wrong reasons. You should only make movies about something where you know no one else can make it better than you.\"So what's it all about, you may ask.Kate Hartounian (Jessica Lundy, who was in Bright Lights, Big City and Vampire's Kiss the same year this was released), the daughter of real estate developer and working man Jack (Mason), seeks to improve her social status by following the advice of her friend Miffy Young (Chynna Phillips) and asks her dad to join the Bushwood Country Club.Of course, seeing as how her dad builds housing that normal people can afford, he doesn't fit in with club members like Chandler Young (Stack), his wife Cynthia (Dina Merrill, Operation Petticoat) and Mr. Jamison (an always welcome Paul Bartel).Sure, hijinks ensue, but it's hard to get behind the blustering Mason, who strangely attracts Diane Cannon, making this into something of a science fiction movie. The gopher can now talk (someone get Frank Welker in the booth stat!) and Chevy Chase shows up for all of five minutes, most of which consists of him being a sexist boor to scare off multiple women in a scene that may have seemed funny in 1988 but seems beyond gross in 2021 (I know, I know -- let's not place our modern values on movies from the past; I'm also the guy who brings you all sorts of aberrant Italian and Spanish gut-churning filth, right?!? But maybe I just agree with the \"medium talent\" assessment of Chase).The hardest thing to deal with in this movie that it's made by incredibly talented people placed into a thankless struggle to make something halfway decent. I mean, Harold Ramis and PJ Torokvei (who wrote Armed and Dangerous, Back to School, WKRP in Cincinnati and Real Genius) wrote the script with rewrites by Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman, who wrote Who Framed Roger Rabbit together**.The thing that really sticks out to me is that Caddyshack works whether or not you play golf, but if you love the game, you can see the nuances and enjoyment of the sport within the movie. In the sequel, golf just seems to be something in the background, other than the miniature golf course finale that closes the movie.I guess you should add the phrase, \"Don't remake Caddyshack\" to other important lessons like \"Never fight a land war in Asia\" and \"Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.\"In our aforementioned chat with the director, this movie was summed up quite simply:B&S: So why Caddyshack II?ALLAN: Yes, exactly. Why Caddyshack II? There are no more questions to be answered.*Indeed, Arkush said --after seeing Mason perform two nights in a row -- \"I started to get a very different impression of him. The thing that occurred to me was that he didn't connect with the audience in any sort of personal way. That's not necessarily a good thing for someone who's supposed to be your lead. At least when Rodney says, \"I get no respect,\" there's an empathy that he evokes from the audience.\"**To be fair, they also wrote Wild Wild West and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so perhaps...",

I mean, this here is often what happens when you have a hit film but that's not exactly the case here because this came eight years after the original so they certainly had time to come up with something better. You can read the various production problems elsewhere and you can also read the plot summery elsewhere. No matter what you read or see, CADDYSHACK II is without question a horrid film that lives up to its reputation as one of the worst sequels ever made. Chevy Chase is the only person back and then we have Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon, Randy Quaid and Dan Aykroyd basically playing rip-off characters of what were seen in the original. Again, it's clear that this here was a horrible idea right from the start as the cast and writers have freely admitted this. It's still shocking to think that the studio wanted something like this but I guess they thought it would be easy cash. The entire screenplay is just so unfunny that you can't help but wonder why anyone signed onto it. The entire finale dealing with a competition runs way too long and it takes forever to get where it's going. There's really nothing working in this picture, although there might have been one or two small smiles throughout the entire running time. The cast are just annoying and you know you're in trouble when a fake gopher gives the best performance.",

AS an adult, rewatching, I have the same reaction. There are moments-like Murray eating the Baby Ruth that just chased everyone from the pool when he realizes what it is-that are laugh worthy, but too few and far between. The rest of it is just overacting silliness that tries to hard and flops. And this second movie is much the same.

            "content": "Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack.I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively.Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.While I'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.Characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.All things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying.

Only Ramis isn't in the chair this time (surrendering the honors to sitcom director Allan Arkush), but he did pen the script.The only returning characters are Ty Webb and Mr. Gopher. There were supposed to be more but Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield hated the script and Ramis would not let them make their own changes, which I think was a huge mistake and quite arrogant and out of character for Ramis. Taking Murray's place is Dan Ackroyd as Captain Tom Everett, a mentally-scarred war vet turned mercenary, and Jackie Mason as Jack Hartounian, another boorish, blue-collar millionaire property developer. He's entertaining, but he's certainly no Al Czervik.Ted Knight passed away in 1986, so Judge Smails couldn't return either. Instead we have Robert Stack playing the villainous Candler Young. Again, I like Stack, but he just can't live up to Ted Knight.Hartounian agrees to join the prestigious Bushwood Country Club to please his teenage daughter who is desperate to fit in. The snobs don't take too kindly to his unsavory humor or his connections to the local working class. Together they conspire to shut him down, but Jack Hartounian doesn't give up easily.Almost everything that made Caddyshack so good is dumbed down in this sequel. The R-rating, the raunchiness, the complex character interactions...all gone. Though they somehow still managed to squeeze in a single F-word (courtesy of Randy Quaid's obnoxious lawyer Peter Blunt) in a PG, which is very rare. Caddyshack also had dozens of speaking roles and didn't care if the audience couldn't keep up with it. Those kind of quirks make it endlessly watchable, while Caddyshack II is merely good for a laugh only once in a while.The theme of the working class clashing with greedy snobs who have had everything handed to them might be a little more relevant today, I just wish that they hadn't comprised the film so much. Had there been more continuity with the original we could have had another classic.Not as bad as its reputation suggests, and there are a decent amount of laughs.

            "content": "Caddyshack 2 is a study in god awful sequels. Along with Blues Brothers 2000 and Beverly Hills Cop III, CS2 is in the trinity of terrible sequels to 80's comedy classics.The basic plot of CS2 is the same as the first: a vaguely ethnic new-money guy crashes the WASP-y Bushwood Country Club. There are subplots about a groundskeeper and a gopher and young people learning to stand on principle, and it all climaxes in a golf match. But the original Caddyshack felt like a raunchy celebrity roast; the sequel feels like a lame afterschool special. CS2 was rated PG while the original was rated R. This highlights sequel kiss-of-death # 1: the studio wanted it to appeal to a wider audience (read: something for the kiddies). No part of the first Caddyshack is for kids; even the Gopher is more like a good acid trip (does anyone else see that dancing gopher?) \u2013 than a family friendly puppet. CS promoted sex and drugs and a contempt for authority. That's because it was directed and headlined by comedians who also promoted sex and drugs and a general contempt for authority. But the studio wanted a family accessible sequel since the PG rating is generally seen in Hollywood as better for box office returns. And so there are literally Looney Toons cartoon characters in Caddy Shack 2. Instead of Rodney Dangerfield's hilariously profane Al Czervik, we get a cornball Jackie Mason as a developer-with-a-heart-of-gold. Instead of the class warfare middle finger of Caddyshack, CS2 brings a saccharine \"Up-With-People\" message about self-acceptance. Bill Murray's brilliant comedic menace as the burned out Carl the Groundskeeper, is replaced by a grating Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd is best as the straight man (Elwood Blues on SNL, Joe Friday, Louis Winthorp ). When he goes for zany like he does in CS2 he is like the unhip but well-meaning uncle at a family gathering who likes to do funny voices for the tots but then uses the same shtick when coming over to talk to the adults. CS2's second sequel kiss-of-death is the lazy attempt to recycle the original film. Even though Chevy Chase was the only original cast member to return, CS2 limply retreads most of Caddyshack's other character types. Robert Stack is no Ted Knight and Jonathan Silverman is too bland to fill Michael O'Keefe's shoes in the Danny Noonan role.Coming back as Ty Webb, Chase's one stab at edginess in CS2 is a bizarre and unnecessary scene in which he chases off a table full of attractive women in the club's lounge by propositioning each of them with silly euphemisms for sex. The joke falls woefully flat and is out of character with the charming Ty of the original. The third sequel kiss-of-death plaguing CS2 is its troubled development history. Harold Ramis, who co-wrote and directed the original, was reluctantly coerced into scripting a sequel. Rodney Dangerfield initially pushed hard for a sequel, but later pulled out over creative differences with the studio. Ramis also dropped out and urged the studio to let the sequel die. Instead the studio brought in other writers and director Allan Arkush who had more experience with TV than big screen filmmaking, (which may explain why CS2 feels like a made-for-TV project). Other than Chase, none of the original cast wanted anything to do with the sequel. Lawsuits popped up over the use of characters and unfulfilled contracts. All indications were that CS2 was a project that should have been terminated in early development but, as is the case with many Hollywood disasters, the suits saw dollar signs and ignored the warnings of the creatives. Caddyshack 2 is simply unacceptable. It's only redeeming value is as a cautionary tale for future filmmakers and studio execs about how to kill a comedy classic's name by attaching an abominable sequel to it.",

The residents resent this because they do not what lower class people living among them so they push for an injunction, based on a historical horse shed which is only seventy years old, to have the development stopped.The daughter of the developer is the member of a country club in the area that is also frequented by the upper class people of the area. She is welcomed among them, but her father does not like these people. Instead he prefers to play poker with the builders and loose so that they might have extra money to take home. He was one of the proletariat who though a lot of hard work managed to become incredibly wealthy, yet he still considers himself one of the proletariat. He does not hoard his money, but is rather willing to loose it.He is contrasted with the rest of the country club. It is a community of people with a lot of money. They are portrayed as the bad guys. They do not want the poor living in their area and will do anything to stop it. They hoard their money and this is seen with the slave auction where $5000 was raised for charity the previous year even though a lot more could have been made. The quote is that the slave auction is held when they feel guilty about the amount of money that they have, yet they are not willing to let go of it. The developer does not consider his money as his security blanket and thus is able to let go of over $110,000 to purchase all of the people. He then puts them to work on the building site: which shows their incompetance when it actually comes to hard work. Stack's comment about not know what work really is like is contrasted with this scene where he simply bumbles everywhere. He claims to know real hard work, but the workers on the building site are true workers. He simply lounges in his exclusive country club.Robert Stack reminds me of Troy McClure from the Simpsons. It is hard to imagine him in anything else other than Unsolved Mysteries (the US version of Australia's Most Wanted, except they also focus on the supernatural). It is funny seeing him playing a role in a movie, and even then it is one of the rich bad guy.It is interesting though to wonder if the makers of this movie really to consider the rich to be like this and are more like the developer, or if they live this way yet criticise the rich for living like that. It makes one wonder if the filmmakers of Caddyshack II are in fact hypocrits or not.",

They try to duplicate everything from the first movie.  Now, in a few cases this work. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight, when they play essentially the same character.  I actually like Randy Quaid, who is no more or less offensive than Bill Murray in the original.  But Jackie Mason is no Rodney Dangerfield, and worse of all, C2 demonstrated once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time.  There is very little that I like him in, and C2 nailed the coffin shut on his \"comedic\" career as far as I'm concerned.  He seems to feel the same, sticking more to tuffy like Driving Miss Daisy and hosting Psi-Factor.  Other than that, it's mostly, \"been there, done that\" for Caddyshack 2.  Watch the original twice rather than each version once, and you'll get more for your rental money.",

Not a bad film but it could've been much better especially if much of the talent from the first film had returned here instead of miscasting a bunch of series newcomers. This sequel was aimed at more of a family audience than the adult oriented original and that may be one of the problems. Live action family oriented comedies that cast people who are known for their levels of raunch barely ever really work. Still, some fair laughs are generated in this tale of a snobbish millionaire (Jackie Mason) who figures that he can easily buy a country club but instead he winds up in heated battle with its current management who is not willing to sell it to Mason's terms. His idea is to combine a miniature golf course and amusement park along with their regular golf course. It causes some disagreements. Chevy Chase is the only returning cast member but his role here is much less showy and Dan Aykroyd attempts to fill in the void left vacant by Bill Murray and only moderately succeeds. Letting the gopher return to the golf course as well provides more boredom than laughs because he's not really funny anymore. His presence is unnecessary. Still, it's an OK sequel but the absence of much of the original film's success often makes the viewer think about what could've been.",

            "review_title": "Why?",
            "content": "Caddyshack II is one of those pictures which makes you ask 'Why?' As in; 'Why was it funded?': 'Why was it made?' and 'Why was it released into the public domain?'.To say the least it's a bad film. It serves little purpose but to underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a 'New money' land developer attempts to buy out the establishment's golf course sanctuary. Right off the bat making the follow-up a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre. I mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so. But leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up, or poor imitation as this is, so your sort of obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual contributions by the actors who made the first one so memorable. But there's little if any of this.Instead we get cheap imitations. Okay the passing of Ted Knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable Judge Smails but Robert Stack's inclusion as 'Chandler Young' (a fellow WASP elitist akin to the Smails character) is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that made Knight's turn so watchable. Jackie Mason's 'Jack Hartounian' is a feeble attempt at recreating the non stop wisecracks delivered by the Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) character of the first. While Dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable Mason's is completely forgettable. Bill Murray's laughably ridiculous groundskeeper 'Carl Spackler' and his war of attrition with the pesky local gofer is substituted for his Ghostbuster's co-star Dan Ackroyd's role as the militant 'Capt. Tom Everett' who's high pitched voice just splits your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughter.Randy Quaid , brilliant as Cousin Ed in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, is quite the opposite here playing Hartounian's unstable lawyer. The looks of disbelief shown by the actor's looking on at Quaid's character's intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience. Your not laughing. Your just asking 'What the hell is he doing?'Chevy Chase shows up, all be it occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster that's perpetrating itself around him,as club pro 'Tye Webb' in the films only direct reference to the original not withstanding the golf course itself that is. With his deeply tanned skin and loud Hawaiian shirts Chase looks like he's just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck. He distances himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some, all be it little, credibility still intact. Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter 'Kate' takes over from the 'Danny Noonan' role of the original as teenager struggling against class divides. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic from a blue collar family) and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant dominated world of the golf club mover and shakers was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being dismissed by the resident Lutheran Bishop as well as being mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment of her father's inability to fit-in is hinted at being because of his Jewish roots. That aside it may also have to do with him being a classless moron but such intricacy's are swept aside though I stopped caring long before they were resolved. At the end of the day Noonan was trying to get ahead in life. Miss Hartounian's biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to like her multi-millionaire father so that she can get a date with the club's prodigal white kid. Or so I gathered. Anyway in summation its poorly written, badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent. Indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to it's conclusion. It really is a penance. There is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals. Maybe they just weren't asked. Or perhaps I suspect they actually read the script. Stick to the original!!!",

No. But he is funny. The rest of the cast falls in line as being decent, but not outstanding.

Almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of his greatest roles as Ty Webb for a second time and plays it great. He is not only the funniest character in the movie, he is the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on Comedy Central. The movie might have been better if Ty Webb(Chase) had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became Jackie Mason(Who??)

PLEASE- DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE A SEQUEL TO PART ONE!!

This sequel to the semi-modern comedy classic is closer to a follow-up, or rip-off, lacking the laughs and likeable slobs and the fun to hate snobs. You've got a professional cast hired to replace the late Ted Knight and the non participating Bill Murray and my favorite, soap matriarch Lois Kibbee, who was a perfect Margaret Dumont like straight woman to Dangerfield's insults. Chevy Chase participates in a limited role (owner of the Bushwick Club), but it's just his schtick and unimportant to the story other than to come in here and there and ultimately humiliate the new set of snobs. The gopher's back too, and he needs to end up in the country club kitchen as dinner.Wealthy contractor Mason wants to join the country club but is snubbed by the wealthy Robert Stack, who wants to keep Mason out, aided by his charity head wife Dina Merrill and the stuffy, dislikeable Paul Bartel. Mason attracts the attention of fun loving rich lady Dyan Cannon who seems to relish these types of roles as a pretty lady who has a thing for funny men whose looks are funnier. She lacked out on the funny part with Mason who is far too forced to really get the audience in the palm of their hands.For the teen audience, there's caddy Jonathan Silverman, abused by Stack and Merrill's daughter Chynna Phillips (a big block of ice on film) yet liked by her friend Jessica Lundy who turns out to be Mason's daughter. Merrill seems to enjoy being knocked around and doing things you wouldn't expect one of the world's wealthiest heiresses to do (like being chased by a giant steam shovel, forced to do manual labor and get knocked into a truck of manneur bags) so she comes off fine, but comic gems like Randy Quaid and Marsha Warfield seem to be thinking that they don't get paid enough to look ridiculous. Dan Ackroyd is eye rollingly unfunny in a variation of Murray's role, truly embarrassing. Like \"Airplane II\", this ends up being one of the worst sequels ever to a classic comedy.

I also blame the editor. The Warner Brothers DVD runs 99 minutes and should have been cut down to 89 minutes at the very, very most. The sticking point, of course, is which scenes to cut. For a starter, we have far too many unsympathetic characters and these are made up of just about the entire male cast! And personally, I didn't take to the animation sequences with Mr. Gopher either. They were well staged, but I didn't think they were particularly amusing. When you are editing a movie \u2013 and I have enjoyed some experience in this field \u2013 you have to ask yourself, \"Is this scene really necessary?\" Preferably, each scene should advance the plot or reveal some aspect of the characters, and yet be amusing, gripping or suspenseful in itself. This simple dictum was not followed in this film. I'm sure the producers \u2013 and there are three of them, would you believe \u2013 said to themselves, \"Everyone who saw the original Caddyshack will want to see this one too, so it really doesn't matter!\" Available on an excellent Warner Brothers DVD.

The characters in the sequel don't go by the same names but are quasi-replacements of the original characters (except for Chevy Chase). Now this is a good thing and a bad thing as at first it seems very weird to do such a thing, but I think they made the right choice. To replace the actors and keep the same named characters would have been a much bigger mistake and would have been sacrilegious so they made the best of a bad situation and made that decision. Robert Stack, Dan Aykroyd, Randy Quaid and Jacky Mason aren't Ted Knight, Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield but they're not chopped liver either and that's my case for the sequel. While it's not the original it has it's moments so give it a swing and see if it's a hole in one, a bogey or just above par.",

Yes its a film that should have never have been made, but this was the eighties, and these films with this plot and narrative were made every couple of months, you know the one, the rich people want to keep the club for themselves, and the outsiders want to share it with everyone.No, I didn't laugh once, but it never bored me. That's because it's such a wonder of a film. Chase and Ackroyd show up for extended cameos, and add nothing but more curiosity to see it, and while Mason is fine, he is no foil to Rodney Dangerfield, but is watchable never the less.The rest of the cast are there, but nothing more than caricatures of better characters we have seen before in better films. Quaid is the one stand out, absolutely going balls to the wall with his performance, and really, he should be in a different film altogether.So all in all, it's a complete disaster, but it's one of those films that has to be seen to be believed.",

In this film, (or should I say 'piece of work'?) Arkush reintroduces us back to the intense situation from the first film, but this time with different characters. With some show stealing performances from Sid Conrad, Ben Hartigan, John MacBride as the naked men, Diana James, Trish Ramish, Mary Stavin, Tamara Steffan as the girls in bar, and the unmatchable Carlos Cervantes (I), Dennis Bowen, Mark Christopher Lawrence, and Kenny d'Aquila as the construction workers, Arkush has managed to maintain sobriety and kept a cool directing hand during production.There's no film that can better it...",

The film is to stupid to enjoy, no funny jokes at all, and if it's a sequel where is the original cast? We got Chevy Chase and that's it! We got the gopher but he is not needed at all. Jackie Mason is to obnoxious to be enjoyed and Dan Akroyd as a soldier paid to help the villain cheat at golf, he is totally gay in his part. The cast is up in the air with bad talent! A few good performances here and there like Randy Quaid or the gopher but the film lacks! Nothing original. It just ends up the same with Jackie and the villain playing golf with the bet on leaving the golf club at stake and it's totally predictable. Jackie wins, woo who! But here's something the last film didn't have, special affects! We have Jackie using weird mechanical golf clubs that look totally cheesy, like they're wrapped up in tin foil, and they come with special tactics that look like crap! The Special Affects are cheese, not good at all. I loved the original Caddyshack but this film is a total bomb. Where's the plot, where's the original cast, where's the entertainment? Down the tube. This film gets the big 4, they tried but they tried with little effort. Avoid this film, not recommended unless you like to get a good nap.",

I didn't have such high expectations that it would be as good as the original. Well, it isn't as good as Caddyshack of course, but it is good on it's own merits, & very funny at times. I thought Jackie Mason was just terrific in this, he has great comic timing even when his jokes are old ones that I'd heard before. Even his delivery or his mannerisms make me laugh. The supporting cast were all real good for the most part, especially Chevy Chase who had some great one-liners, & Dyan Cannon was real good & fun to watch as usual. She looks really beautiful in this, considering she was in her early 50s. The girl who played Jackie Mason's daughter was pretty good too, & really nice to look at. The worst part of this movie was the Dan Akroyd character. Bill Murray would have been so much better. Also, the movie is just too silly, and just plain dumb at times, the gopher is used too much, and Marsha Warfield is in it (but thankfully, not too much). So, if you don't expect much, you might enjoy it. It's not a great comedy, but it's not embarrassingly bad like most people say it is. The problem with those people is they want to compare it to the original. You can't really blame them for that. But when you watch it, try to forget about the original and accept it as something separate from that. I wish Rodney & Bill Murray were in it too, but they're not. So what? I wish John Candy was in it. He would have been great too. But he's not, so what? It's still pretty funny. Hey, if I liked it than it can't be that bad. My standards are pretty high.",

This movie is not good as any of the movies that came out in 1988. The only good one I seen that year was Willow. The main problem was that it did not compare to the first. The cast in this one did not have same type of cemenstry that the cast in the first one had. First of all they replaced a red head Michael O Keef w a dark hair cool new comer Johathan Silverman, then they Replace Bill Murray who save the first one w another Ghost Buster Dan Aykoyd, then they replace Roddney Dangerfeld w an obnoxious Jackie Mason. And then Harold Ramis decides to give Allen Arkush the directing job and has not directed another movie since this one. The rest of this film was just slow and dry. Just remember that this was one of the first movie that Warner Brother put a new thing called DVD. The DVD cost $5.00 at Walmart and there no special feather. Just the movie in full screen along w chapter names.Food for thought. If its a nice and sunny day and its 70 degrees outside. Instead of spending $5.00 or or watching this movie. Why not go out the country club and treat you and your friends to a nice game of gold. Or if its a nice and sunny Sunday afternoon.

It has its moments, but it isn't the original.*May contain spoilers*A mere 8 years after we first visited Caddyshack, all of the original members are gone except for two (the first hint that it won't be the same). We meet Kate Hartounian, a college girl and daughter of a wealther- not to mention goofy- building contractor, who is hoping that a membership at the posh Bushwood will net her some badly-desired popularity. The people she is trying to impress just happen to be suing her father for some apartments he is building near the country club, so they turn down his membership and he vows to get revenge...in his own goofy way.The film has some bland humor. The only two original characters that came back in this one are Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and the gopher. Fans of the original will find three very different things about this film, compared to the first: The movie is Caddyshack 2, yet we aren't seeing anything about the caddies as we did before. The movie isn't racy at all, except for one hot little dance number, and finally, the gopher is present but he doesn't play any kind of \"major role\" as he did in the first one. He makes a few cameos to do something funny, but that's it.

He's known for being a comic's comic. Even Howard Stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.The accussation that Mason is no Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known for having been a huge Mason fan. Dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following Mason's shows. That is when Mason provided Dangerfield with inspiration for his, \"get no respect\" routine. While I think Dangerfield is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see Mason is the better comedian.",

The only real problem with it is unlike its predecessor it just isn't very funny. I maybe laughed two or three times compared to lots of genuine laughs that its predecessor had. Granted since Chevy Chase is the only person from the first movie to return for this sequel, (even though it says special appearance he was in the movie more than I expected) the rest of the cast tries it's best to make this a good movie so their effort is there, they are failed by a script with practically no humor in it. Jackie Mason just isn't a match for Rodney Dangerfield's over the top irreverence. Robert Stack tries to recapture Ted Knight's snobbishness from the first film, and even though he was very funny in Airplane! he had a script with genuinely funny lines and visual gags in that movie, which he has none of here, and as a result he is just a total wasted bore. Dyan Cannon is underdeveloped and more opportunity for her character to do something could have made this a much better movie, same with Randy Quaid as Mason's lawyer. Dan Aykroyd steps in to Bill Murray's role and does horrible. Granted, I blame the script and direction for that. He could have been a great substitute for Murray if those things were better. Chevy Chase's schtick you saw in the first film and much better at that. According to Harold Ramis who wrote and directed the first movie the studio begged him for a sequel with Rodney Dangerfield returning as Al Cszervick from the first movie. Dangerfield wanted to do it but he got into a fight with the studio and dropped out of the project. Had he accepted this could have been one of the few sequels better than the first because he made the first movie the classic it was in my opinion, but he backed out and other writers decided to do the final project that is this inferior sequel. They also wanted to broaden it for a wider audience. The first was an adults-only R rated comedy whereas this is an edgy PG rated flick. By abandoning the irreverent crude humor this film failed. If Caddyshack was supposed to be a franchise, they needed to remember the irreverence that made the first so funny and carry it over to the sequel. By abandoning that the film was just desperate for humor, and we have barely a laugh to be had and actors trying to bring life into lousy material and failing. Its not as bad as you have heard but stick with the first film only and pass this one up because unlike the first this just isn't that funny. They should have scrapped this when Rodney Dangerfield decided he wouldn't do it.",

He carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 over the top.  Jackie Mason  is the `new' Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even though their comic deliveries are way different.  Dan Aykroyd was great but not in the film enough.  He should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time Bill Murray got in the first one.  Robert Stack (Airplane!) was good in the `new' Ted Knight/Villian role.  (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have been back.  So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later.  Bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did.  Instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the main focus like they were in the first one. When you watch this film, keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy.

I see other people on here giving it a one or a two, and that's uncalled for. There are far worse movies out there, and Caddyshack II has a couple of funny moments, (especially those with Dan Aykroyd). True, the storyline is weak, and Jackie Mason, (although funny), is no match for Rodney, this movie does not deserve all of the criticism it gets. It's still mildly amusing. However, I will agree with others on these following aspects: Randy Quaid was terrible and incredibly annoying in his role, the story with Hartonian's daughter added a sappiness to the story that was so trite and predictable, the carnival idea was definitely not funny, Chevy Chases cameo seemed desperate and detached, and it was too long. At least Aykroyd was funny, and was maybe, dare I say it... as funny as Bill Murray. Thats right, I know it sound like blasphemy to Caddyshack I fans, but when he said \" I read you loud and clear Mrs. Esterhouse\" I almost fell of my chair. That was funny. The rest of the movie... not so much. Just don't knock it until you try it, but don't expect a homerun, or in this case a hole in one.",

Those who opted out of doing the sequel like Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray chose wisely and avoided this cinematic flop. If it wasn't for Chevy Chase reprising his role as Ty Webb, this movie would have ZERO connection to the original, but despite this, Caddy Shack II is still faaaaar removed from the original.The fist major flaw, which totally threw the movie for me is the congruence - it's painfully obvious that Bushwood Country Club is in a entirely different locale than the first movie. It is my understanding that the first Caddy Shack was filmed at a country club in Florida, and the entrance gates of the club shot on Sunset Blvd - so would it have been that complicated to at least send a second unit film crew to the original locations to at least capture various footage to use in Caddy Shack 2? And while you all are at it, get some shots of Ty Webb's Zen pad, as he never lived in a castle on a mountain. Seriously. Both the club locale and where Ty Webb lived ruined it. And the only reason I stuck it out watching is for Ty, who was quite the ladies man in the first Caddy Shack, but totally came across like a creep to women in II.But in final - Caddy Shack II story line was literally a re-hash of the first version; country club vs.. Real estate developer. WTF? I could continue my rant of other things gone horribly wrong about Caddy Shack II - but I think the other contributors at IMDb.com have it covered.",

Caddyshack II uses the same script and character basis as Part I, thus not expanding on a story but rather making a sorry attempt at recapturing the laughs and good feelings that the original generates. Jackie Mason, starring as Jack Hartounian, makes a pitiful attempt at retracing the steps of Rodney Dangerfield, who played a very similar role in the original as a havoc-raising real estate owner. Jackie not only fails to par up with Rodney's performance, but degenerates the film even more when he inserts his own style of humor into the sequel. His lack of energy, perhaps a result of age, kills any power that the other characters may have been trying to produce. Caddyshack II is flashy and fake, while the original Caddyshack seems to express realistic emotion. What am I referring to? Take for example the improvisational comedy scene between Bill Murray and Chevy Chase in the original. Their chemistry is that of long time friends, thus their stage time really shines. Chevy and Bill, or Ty Webb and Carl Spackler, work well with one another while the sequel's characters' relationships' lack the flare that makes the dialogue and scenes come alive. Caddyshack II is like an animated Disney film. it greatly represents the film fashions of the 1980s, and since Caddyshack was made in early 1980, We can safely declare that the film may have been preserved from a Hollywood style that may have done more damage than benefit.",

It also comes from actual life, as writer Brian Doyle-Murray, his\u00a0brothers Bill and John, too -- was a caddie at Indian Hill Club in Winnetka, Illinois. His brothers Bill and John Murray, and director Harold Ramis had all been in Danny's caddy shoes at one point. Most of the people in the movie were all based on actual members of the clubs that they had worked at.\n\nRamis told the A.V. Club that he went in with the right intentions: \"They said, \"Hey, we've got a great idea: The Shack is Back! And I said, \"No, I don't think so.\" But they said that Rodney really wanted to do it, and we could build it around Rodney. Rodney said, \"Come on, do it.\" Then the classic argument came up which says that if you don't do it, someone will, and it will be really bad. So I worked on a script with my partner Peter Torokvei, consulting with Rodney all the time. Then Rodney got into a fight with the studio and backed out. We had some success with Back to School, which I produced and wrote, and we were working with the same director, Alan Metter. When Rodney pulled out, I pulled out, and then they fired Alan and got someone else. I got a call from [co-producer] Jon Peters saying, \"Come with us to New York; we're going to see Jackie Mason!\" I said, \"Ooh, don't do this. Why don't we let it die?\" And he said, \"No, it'll be great.\" But I didn't go, and they got other writers to finish it. I tried to take my name off that one, but they said if I took my name off, it would come out in the trades and I would hurt the film.\"\n\nThis moment of wondering why this movie is being made and feeling is that it's the wrong idea? That will come up throughout the discussion of this movie.\n\nSo instead of Rodney, we get Jackie Mason. Sure, they're both older Jewish comedians who married much younger women late in their lives, but that's about all they have in common. Rodney's character was an everyman who seemed to be using the audience as his therapist, bemoaning the way he was treated with lines like \"I know I'm ugly. I said to a bartender, \"Make me a zombie.' He told me that God beat him to it.\" To me, Mason always felt like he was lecturing the audience, somewhat above it*.\n\nDan Aykroyd is one of my favorite actors, but he's basically coming on to be Bill Murray. And while Jonathan Silverman and Michael O'Keefe are somewhat interchangeable, there's a large divide between Robert Stack and Ted Knight. And that's no slight to any of these actors, but when you're placed in the same exact role as a movie that is beloved, you're going to get compared. After all, Ted Knight is my favorite villain in any movie. He's perfect in his role. And while I love Robert Stack, I can only see him in heroic roles or parts that make fun of his heroic nature.\n\nI mean, I love Randy Quaid, but his role was written for Sam Kinison, who would have destroyed audiences with that part.\n\nTo be fair, Dangerfield was to be in this, but a month before production, he bailed, realizing that it wouldn't work. He kept adding to his contract, demanding final cut and royalties and getting everything he wanted, except to be released from the film. This all ended up with him facing a $10 million dollar lawsuit.\n\nBut there still needed to be a movie.\n\nAs for director Allan Arkush, he told\u00a0Sports Illustrated \"I should have never made this movie! What was I thinking?\" He told us -- in an interview we were honored to get to conduct -- \"You should never make a movie for the wrong reasons. You should only make movies about something where you know no one else can make it better than you.\"\n\nSo what's it all about, you may ask.\n\nKate Hartounian (Jessica Lundy, who was in Bright Lights, Big City and\u00a0Vampire's Kiss the same year this was released), the daughter of real estate developer and working man Jack (Mason), seeks to improve her social status by following the advice of her friend Miffy Young (Chynna Phillips) and asks her dad to join the Bushwood Country Club.\n\nOf course, seeing as how her dad builds housing that normal people can afford, he doesn't fit in with club members like Chandler Young (Stack), his wife Cynthia (Dina Merrill, Operation Petticoat) and Mr. Jamison (an always welcome Paul Bartel).\n\nSure, hijinks ensue, but it's hard to get behind the blustering Mason, who strangely attracts Diane Cannon, making this into something of a science fiction movie. The gopher can now talk (someone get Frank Welker in the booth stat!) and Chevy Chase shows up for all of five minutes, most of which consists of him being a sexist boor to scare off multiple women in a scene that may have seemed funny in 1988 but seems beyond gross in 2021 (I know, I know -- let's not place our modern values on movies from the past; I'm also the guy who brings you all sorts of aberrant Italian and Spanish gut-churning filth, right?!? But maybe I just agree with the \"medium talent\" assessment of Chase).\n\nThe hardest thing to deal with in this movie that it's made by incredibly talented people placed into a thankless struggle to make something halfway decent. I mean, Harold Ramis and PJ Torokvei (who wrote\u00a0Armed and Dangerous,\u00a0Back to School,\u00a0WKRP in Cincinnati and\u00a0Real Genius) wrote the script with rewrites by Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman, who wrote Who Framed Roger Rabbit together**.\n\nThe thing that really sticks out to me is that Caddyshack\u00a0works whether or not you play golf, but if you love the game, you can see the nuances and enjoyment of the sport within the movie. In the sequel, golf just seems to be something in the background, other than the miniature golf course finale that closes the movie.\n\nI guess you should add the phrase, \"Don't remake\u00a0Caddyshack\" to other important lessons like \"Never fight a land war in Asia\" and \"Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.\"\n\nIn our aforementioned chat with the director, this movie was summed up quite simply:\n\nB&S:\u00a0So why\u00a0Caddyshack II?\n\nALLAN:\u00a0Yes, exactly. Why\u00a0Caddyshack II? There are no more questions to be answered.\n\n*Indeed, Arkush said --after seeing Mason perform two nights in a row -- \"I started to get a very different impression of him. The thing that occurred to me was that he didn't connect with the audience in any sort of personal way. That's not necessarily a good thing for someone who's supposed to be your lead. At least when Rodney says, \"I get no respect,\" there's an empathy that he evokes from the audience.\"\n\n**To be fair, they also wrote\u00a0Wild Wild West and\u00a0How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so perhaps...",

As a PG movie, I'd recommend this if you have a young kid around and you are looking for something to watch together.  I think this movie gets a worse rep than it deserves because it is not the same kind of movie as the original \"Caddyshack\".

Plus, the film is essentially a retread of the first film, although with a different cast. Set at Bushwood Country Club, local Jewish businessman Jack Hartounian (Jackie Mason) and his daughter Kate (Jessica Lundy), apply for membership at the club, but Jack's reputation of building low-cost housing for poorer families doesn't go down well with the snooty members, including Bushwood President Chandler Young (Robert Stack). But, Jack gets the last laugh when he goes to Ty Young (Chevy Chase), and buys his majority share in Bushwood, and decides to open it up to general public turning it into an amusement park, much to Young's absolute disgust, so he hires Captain Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) to put a stop to it. While there are one or two laughs here, it's just the same as the original, with Chase doing little more than an extended cameo, it smack of studio compromise and cynical cash-in.

            "content": "Before seeing Caddyshack II I had never seen Caddyshack, and considering how many Golden Raspberry Awards Caddyshack II was nominated for it would clearly have to be poor material. But I figured watching it before Caddyshackwould make it of slightly lesser poor quality.\n\nCaddyshack II doesn't have enough golf for a sports comedy, or enough laughs for a good comedy, so it's a failure as a sports film and as a comedy film. To put it simply, Caddyshack II is a failure and I'm certain it worst quality is that it bears the name Caddyshack in its title when its predecessor is such a critically acclaimed comedy classic.\nThe concepts in Caddyshack II are clearly unoriginal and dull, and the entire film is laugh free. The script and storyline are uncreative and there is nothing new that it brings to the table like the first Caddyshack did. All it supplies is lame actors at their career low points trying to capture the dying spirit from the comedy classic Caddyshack but failing abysmally most of the time.\nAnd the production team were clearly a bunch of gophers, because whoever they hired as the voice actor for the horses needs to get a different career pattern, because it was so unconvincing, pathetic and unfunny that it just brought down Caddyshack II's already low credibility. If it was Frank Welker then I blame the director, because bad voice acting can never be his fault.\nCaddyshack II suffers as a terrible and unfunny flim as well as being a bad sequel that suffers from all the issues that a bad sequel usually does, including the lack of fresh material that its predecessor supplied and a cast which fails to match the ensemble set up by Caddyshack, as well as characters that aren't interesting or worth paying focus to. Alan Arkush's inexperienced direction is no better here than it was in Deathsport, except that this time he is working with talent which he and his terrible movie manages to drag down, and his terrible direction is a serious cause of the blame here. But then again, so is Dan Akroyd's performance.\nDan Akroyd, well, whoever the hell told him to give an abysmal performance like that has suffered serious brain damage. If it was his idea, then clearly Dan Akroyd's comedic spirit must be in spirit prison. His voice itself is more ridiculous than the aforementioned terrible horse voice, and it gets very annoying to listen to very fast. It isn't funny, its Golden Raspberry Award material. Luckily they realised that and awarded him the Worst Supporting Actor award, and hopefully that would help the filmmakers distinguish between good comedy and utter stupidity.\nThe only real good qualities of Caddyshack II are that the puppetry of the gopher and the silly dynamics that he goes through are both decent, and the presence of Chevy Chase again is genial because he gives a decent performance. Caddyshack II is also shot well on some good locations and features fine cinematography to back it up.\n\nBut really, nobody could have thought that Caddyshack II was a good idea, yet it didn't stop the money grubbing producers who must have learned their lesson from this Golden Raspberry Award winning box office bomb.",
