            "content": "No matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.If you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a B**ch!If you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining.  As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie.  This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre.  Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable.  The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid.  I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21.  Give me a break, I am 25 and I look younger than any of them.",

These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy), but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica.  They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, one suspects.  There's no real plot - just \"goblins - kill!\" and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience.",

And there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire. Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire. Along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song.

            "content": "There is a bizarre reverse synergy at work in \"Hobgoblins\". I've seen movies with poorer acting (\"EEGAH!\" and any number of Italian rip offs of American hits), worse writing (\"Castle of Fu Manchu\"), more pathetic sets and effects (\"Future War\"), and more repellent performers (\"Teenagers Battle the Thing\"). I've seen movies which were more badly conceived and executed (\"Deafula\"). But \"Hobgoblins\" is something truly special in the Annals of Suck.Watching this movie, I kept rubbing my eyes and smacking myself on the side of the head, thinking that maybe something was wrong with my optic nerves or focal lenses and if I could only get them jarred back into place, \"Hobgoblins\" might resolve into something made by human beings. Alas, this turned out not to be the case. Everything up there on the screen is there on purpose, and rarely have people collaborated to make something so completely wrongheaded and goofy.The kids who play the leads have no frigging idea of what they are doing on camera. None. Zip, zilch, nada. (On the positive side, they seems to know their lines, and there isn't too much obvious reading from teleprompter and cue cards.) I hate to trash them too badly, because it was someone else's decision to cast them in the first place, and the director apparently had an attitude of \"I just point the camera and let it roll\". I'll be generous, and rate their performances slightly above those of the wives of Manos during the nightgown wrestling scenes in \"Manos: The Hands Of Fate\".I've seen better monster SFX in home movies filmed by ambitious 8th graders. There are several scenes where the camera is pointed straight at one or more monsters, with nothing to disguise or soften the view, and they are so obviously stuffed puppets being shaken or held against the actors by someone's hand (just off camera), that your job drops beholding the sheer incompetence of it. Seriously, low budget soft core porn movies do a better job with their effects, and no one expects those films to even try in the first place.The script throws in every clich\u00e9 you can think of: weenie kid discovers his inner hero and becomes a man and gets the girl, shy girl has an inner slut just dying to come out, army jock is a bully, and later becomes a killing machine, old caretaker hides a dangerous secret, magical creatures doom you by granting your fondest wish, underground dance club is the scene for danger and adventure... The plot staggers drunkenly from one story element to the next, slobbers on a given theme for a few seconds and then goes on to another theme and slobbers on that one for a bit. Not one scene, not a single story thread, is ever dealt with in a convincing (or even entertaining) matter, and in the end all the viewer is left with is some vague memories of stuffed puppets and shrill trollops who resemble Lorraine Newman and a geek who whines a lot.The first 2/3rds of the film is deliriously bad. But the inanity ramps up to unspeakable levels once the story moves to \"Club Scum\". This increases the number of people who don't know what they are doing in a scene from 4-5 to dozens, and the results are too appalling to describe in a family-oriented web site. I especially hated the bouncer character and the MC/announcer - they camp it up outrageously, and the viewer wishes a horrible death upon them as punishment for their sins. And the so-called band performs a song during all this (\"Pig-Sticker\"?? \"Sh*t Kicker\"?? \"Pit Licker\"?? \"Sick Liquor\"??) that qualifies as the least believable music performance in a film since the concert scene in \"Howard the Duck\".You have to see this film to believe such a thing exists. I rank it as one of the most idiotic and goofy film experiences ever, and I've seen \"Deafula\" and \"The Magic Land of Mother Goose\".",

            "content": "After Gremlins hit box office gold it must have seemed like a really good idea to rip it off. Unfortunately Hobgoblins lacks some of the key ingredients of Gremlins, notably the likable characters, plot, credibility and effects, and Gremlins was quite funny in places whereas Hobgoblins just isn't.In fiction good writers try hard to make you like the main character, that's how fiction has worked ever since some Greek guy put a mask on and pretended to be someone else. So what character have you got to bond with in Hobgoblins? How about a whiny henpecked little weasel in a dead end job with a totally frigid girlfriend and a bunch of friends that are more irritating than having Vanessa Feltz sewn into your face? His friends include a rake-fighting military tough guy, some weedy gay guy in red shorts and a girl so sexual that the mere sound of her boyfriends car horn causes her to lift her skirt up in anticipation.The film has one good idea, basically these hobgoblins can bring your every fantasy to life. Sadly this good idea is squandered by the actors sheer inability to act as well as plenty of scenes where they hug plush toys to themselves and try to act scared. There's not much logic to it either, the hobgoblins are supposedly locked safely away in a vault with a cage around it. But when we see it neither are even shut. How much effort would it have taken to shout at a stage hand to close them? Too much for this movie unfortunately.I couldn't escape the feeling that the people responsible for this film put in the very least effort they thought they could get away with. The poster (shown to your left) depicting a 50's pinup being bummed by a gremlin is pretty tacky too.",

            "content": "There can be no questions of spoilers for this movie, the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways.A blatant rip-off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films. It ends up a sleazy waste of time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them. They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening. It's painful to watch, and not helped by the mental 80's fashions worn by the cast.Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement, and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds. The guards new recruit, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, gets his gang of 80's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem... Hobgoblins.All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock, his 80's slut girlfriend, the 'hero's frigid and prissy girlfriend, and the young hero, lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway.First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene, where the ex-military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours. Then there's some running around, terminating in a real pie-fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand-grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them. Then the film sorta ends, and alls well that ends well.It's not. This is like watching a train wreck, you cant take your eyes off it, it's so bad. Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater, but god-awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut. The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast, and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight. This scores 2 out of 10 at most, on a good day.",

Aliens mastered intergalactic space travel, but they don't know how to push an unlocked vault door open, yet can push open a door being held shut by five people.3. Old Security Guards know how to get a hold of C4, and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason.4. Apparently, US Army boot camp, in the 80's, involved several sessions of \"garden tool combat\", including the pirouette spin of death.5. To impress your prudish girl friend, you have to \"save the world...err...neighborhood\" from aliens.6. All women are sluts, either openly or secretly.7. Scummy night clubs look like bad diners.8. \"Scummy\" waitresses double as dancers for The Fontanelles (how did they get talked into this?) who can only do bad 60's dance moves.9. Army privates secretly dream of being Rambo.10. Grenades apparently have a setting for \"flash-bang\". 11. Being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms.12. US Army Staff Sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area.13. Aliens apparently always \"go home\", which means back to the vault they were un-locked in.14. Aliens are attracted to bright lights, which apparently means in the Los Angeles area one would assume, the protagonist's house is the most brightly lit thing in the area.15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience clamor for more.16. Vans from the 80's apparently have horrible suspension systems.17. Comedy is supposed to happen in this film.18. Horror is supposed to happen in this film.19. Spoofs and homages are supposed to happen in this film.20. This film cures insomnia.21. Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used, not just in fights (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this).The simply truth is this film just came out wrong. Period. There isn't much meat on the bone, nor does it do anything really well. Even average. It's just bad. However, I've seen far worse, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold, intentional or otherwise.2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse then this. At least the film never took itself seriously.",

This is difficult when the director, Rick Sloane, forgets what film he was making half-way through and only gives enough of a damn to hand his camera over to his eight-year-old imagination. *Spoiler* Rick was molested as an eight-year-old.This movie starts off in an abandoned movie lot (sigh) where the protagonist, Kevin, starts his new job as an undoubtedly small- genitalled night-watch man. The old-hat night-watch mentor guy tells Kevin that he can't open the vault for no particular reason. At some point, the vault gets opened and the hobgoblins escape. The hobgoblins are capable of making people's wishes come true and funnily enough *spoiler* every character's deepest wish costs less than twenty-dollars and never involves naked boobs.

We never find out what 'something' is, but it's only mentioned about twice before the script runs out and the cast improvises the rest of the film. There's a rake-fight in there somewhere and something to do with a nunchuk bikie fight(ish) so that Kevin can impress his hag girlfriend. The best part is the end *spoiler* when the hobgoblins go back to the vault for no reason all and the old security guard blows it up because, well, screw the audience, they've stopped watching anyway!If I may be so bold as to use my own rating system: /10 when drunk: 7.5 /10 when sober: -smart",

When young guys are given jobs here as security guards, they have a habit of dying--and the old guy working with them doesn't do a whole lot to stop this until our hero (i.e., a big wuss) saves the old guy and the oldster tells him about the hobgoblins that live there. These creatures grant people whatever wish they want but end up killing them in the process. A not particularly good deal if you ask me. When these things get loose and attack the neighborhood, it's time to destroy these malevolent pests.The film is an obvious knock-off of GREMLINS, though with practically no budget and actors who are ALL worse than Zack Galligan!!! But the most hilariously bad part of the film are the hobgoblins which are nothing more than cheap puppets--not much more realistic than ones kids might get from Toys R Us!

The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.The \"hobgoblins\" are, as you probably know, \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film \"Tangents\" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The \"sets\" were utterly laughable. \"Club Scum\" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The \"spacecraft\" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her \"proud of him.\" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film-making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D.

Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced (such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so... rarely given attention (hence the MST3K riff about a \"law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers), that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen. Worst movie... ever.",

A loser named Kevin (Tom Bartlett) is trying to make his annoying and non-supportive girlfriend proud of him, so he takes a job as a security guard and unleashes a band of stupid-looking puppets called Hobgoblins, who kill people by giving them what they really want. The way this leads to people getting killed is very idiotic. The hobgoblins go on a rampage which results in one guy getting hurt a little and a car getting destroyed. The ending is also stupid and not worth bringing up.The acting is the worst I have ever seen. None of the actors went anywhere after this movie, nor did any of them deserve to. The special effects, if you can really call them that, were unforgivable. The hobgoblins themselves are the most fake looking puppets I have ever seen.Unless in MST3K, this movie should be avoided at all costs.

Hobgoblins even fails to deliver some good ole-fashioned nudity, even when the story provides clear opportunities for it. The ultimate insult is when Amy, the main character's overly prudish, incredibly demanding and all-around despicable girlfriend, possessed by gremlins and overcome by her real subconscious urges to become a superslut, performs an impromptu strip act at Club Scum and (this is the insulting part) ... doesn't show any skin! What a failure. I would have subtracted five stars for that letdown alone were it not for the marvelous use of grenades that follows shortly after, a fantastic display in which one character gets blown up at point-blank range, and another goes up in flames and runs around screaming while on fire.There are enough hilarious moments here to amuse trash seekers, though not enough to place Hobgoblins anywhere close to the top of their list.

Ah, the 80's!The next night, Kevin chases a burglar into the film vault where he releases the hobgoblins, which his boss reveals are aliens that crash landed years ago that he's guarded from people for decades. They have the power to make people's greatest fantasies come true, but then they kill them.Of course, following exploitation film logic, the hobgoblins head to Kevin's house where his friends are already partying. His girlfriend Amy really is the worst girlfriend for Kevin, as there's no way he can handle her fantasy of being a stripper. Everyone heads to Club Scum to rescue her, but the furry little guys soon attack, turning the rub and tug club into chaos.Soon, everyone has to battle their fantasies and the beasts themselves, but of course, everyone makes it out happily, even Nick who seemed to have been blown up earlier. The movie studio gets blown up real good and everyone has sex, except for the dork, who calls a girl for phone sex.This is a movie that has a woman newly released from a mental hospital operating the puppets and a budget so low that they couldn't even get John Carradine to be in the film!

The Hobgoblins can cause people to see things but other people can see someone else's illusion which is solid to other people to. This is easily one of the cheesiest movies i ever saw The beginning is weird the middle is Boring and unintentionally funny and the End has to be seen to be believed MCcreedy could have blown up the vault at any time so he's responsible for the whole movie.

Yet after I watched it I couldn't brought myself to give it a 1 because of its entertainment value.

This is among the movies ''so bad they are good'', so bad that you can also have a laugh or two for its inaniness.The movie is as you can guess even from the poster a knock-off of GREMLINS. It begins in an abandoned movie studio, where one of the young watchmen helped by the old watchmen (who looks very similar to Buddy Ebsen) discovers about some monsters called Hobgoblins, that have the power of making wishes come true. But, there is only one BIG problem; when the wish finally comes true, the hobgoblins kill the ones that asked the wishes.

The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept \"Club Scum\" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another.

Yes, this movie is every bit as to be expected given the synopsis and the rating it has received.The story is about some aliens who are confined to a facility, where they are accidentally released from captivity as a new security guard opens a vault that is supposed to be off limits.This is from the late 1980's, so of course expectations should be set accordingly. But even for a movie from this age then \"Hobgoblins\" was pathetic.The acting in the movie was amateurish at best. I am not sure if it was because of the lack of having a proper script to work with, or if it was because they had opted to go with talents not really up for the task of acting.And the creatures, well let's just take a moment here to talk about them. While they did have some good conceptual ideas for their appearances, then the creatures just didn't work out so well on the screen, especially since it was so obviously clear that they were just puppets without movable parts. It was embarrassing to witness.Before I forget, I should also mention the editing and cutting of \"Hobgoblins\". Wow, that was just abysmal to watch.

The human beings at which the camera is pointed try plaintively to convince us that something scary is happening. The film's attitude towards women (or all human beings for that matter) is beyond reprehensible. Every last character is suicide-inducingly annoying. Every single line of dialog is either wooden or whiny, or both.I could go on, but in the immortal words of Todd Barry, \"This is like shooting fish in a barrel.

Nothing works. Why am I not surprised to discover that the four lead \"actors\" (and I use that term very loosely) have one other movie credit between them? I suppose a better question would be just how was director Rick Sloane able to find a job directing anything after helming this abomination of film-making? The special effects consist of the director throwing stuffed animals at the cast. There are more continuity errors in Hobgoblins than in a dozen Ed Wood movies.

            "content": "I can't review this without mentioning MST3K, since even a tenth of the reviews and responses this film has received would not be here if Hobgoblins hadn't been featured in their 9th season. As of this writing, it's still available on DVD in Rhino's MST3K volume 8 boxed set. While there's no official consensus, I believe that this it the only true \"Maw of Hell\" caliber film they did for Sci-fi channel (see the Amazing Colossal Episode Guide). While most movies in that category tend to come from the the mid 60s (the oily period), this one from the 80s was far more excruciating for me since that was the decade of my childhood. Nearly every positive memory of 80s pop culture was unearthed, beaten with garden tools, urinated on, and then reburied in a humorous position. And I wasn't even one of the badly scarred viewers.Since there are already over 150 reviews of this film on this site, they probably don't need another synopsis of this movie. To explain just how bad this movie is, I need to tell a story of the second time I saw it with a group of people, in the spring of 2000. I'd already shown these three friends half of Rhino's then released tapes, including Manos, Eegah, and Red Zone Cuba, all Maw of Hell caliber. It was a Friday night, so we stopped after the first quarter to watch Space Ghost, and the second for Gundam Wing, so the wretchedness unfolded upon them slowly. With no show to pause for after the third quarter, I made to fast forward through the commercial, only to be halted by their cries, begging me to stop. The youngest among us was actually curled into a fetal position, shuddering. They implored me to just give them a few minutes to recover, to which I responded, \"Oh, well I know it's bad, but I guess I may be a little desensitized since...\" Now these people were close friends with whom I had shared much, like confessing attractions to various cartoon characters as 3:00 AM, and my most bizarre substitute for toilet paper I've ever resorted to story. So I had freaked them out routinely in the past, but when I finished that sentence with \"...I've already seen this 3 or 4 times.\", that was the only time in my life that I have looked into the faces of other human beings and seen genuine horror. If you were just going by their reactions, you'd have sworn I'd said something more along the lines of, \"Well, I know live puppies SEEM hard to chew at fist, but after my dog had her third litter...\" And this was the MSTed version. I shudder to think of the effects of the uncut version, especially for the MST crew themselves, who had to watch this 10 times in a week. I'm not sure the show completely recovered after this; a little of the love seemed to be gone.So like I said: read other reviews for a synopsis. The point of mine was to warn all novices to watch as many other MST3K episodes as possible to soften the blow of this one. I've seen evidence of short-term mind-warping in viewers who made this their first MST, and long term trauma in those who actually watched the regular version. Follow these guidelines, and you'll find it a least as funny as it is painful.",

He then has the job of finding them and stopping them as they have the ability to seemingly make peoples dreams come true. This though for some reason is highly dangerous to them.This film is in every sense of the word, dire. It has some of the worst acting and terrible lines ever muttered in a motion picture. The hobgoblins are without a doubt the cheapest looking creatures I have ever seen in any film ever. This film doesn't even manage to be good on a so bad its good level. It's just to boring for that. There are so many stupid and pointless scenes. The hobgoblins space ship that they arrive on earth in has to be seen to be believed, as does the many attempts at kicks and punches in the film that miss by a good few feet. The kids in the film are some of the most one dimensional I have ever seen. We have the slut, the frigid girlfriend, the sex crazed military boyfriend and a guy who I can barely explain who has a fetish for sex lines themed on zoo visits. There are so many obvious mistakes in the film that are so clear even I spotted them and I never spot goofs. For instance at one point you clearly see a crew members are push the terrible hobgoblin puppet onto the actor. Another scene sees the same footage of a guy throwing over his own table shown 3 times.The worst thing about the film is the ending. Well the ending and the terrible puppets that have no movement at all apart from then half of them are off screen so they can be obviously moved by crew member from behind sofas and out of frame. The ending is unbelievable. For some unknown and stupid reason they just decide to go back in the vault themselves of their own accord.From what I have read director Rick Sloan has yet to make a half decent film ever. This film must only be watched in its MST3K version and with friends.1/10.",

            "content": "Having just watched Hobgoblins, I now have a new entry for my most hated movies. It's an unbelievably pathetic rip-off of Gremlins which combines the worst parts of a horny teenager movie and a dead teenager movie. It was made for no other reason than the (futile) hope of making a quick buck by director/producer Rick Sloan, who obviously never met a teenager or saw a movie before making this one.The 'hero' of this picture is Kevin, the new assistant security guard at a near abandoned movie studio. He's joined in this worthless enterprise by his girlfriend Amy, a frigid nag, her friend Daphne, a vapor brained nympho, and Daphne's boyfriend Tony (at least I think that's his name) who belongs to an unspecified branch of the military and who or may not be related to the guys on Jersey Shore. Plus there's Kyle, who's only attributes are a vague resemblance to Carl Wilson and a tendency to call naughty 1-900 numbers at the least sensible times, and an elderly security guard who is absent for most of the movie.The titular hobgoblins are small, toothy, extremely ugly aliens who make all your wildest dreams come true, right up until the point where they kill you. They're unleashed onto the world and unsuspecting audiences by Kevin, who accidentally releases them from the vault where they've been imprisoned for the last thirty years. It seems that the old security guard has dedicated the last three decades of his life to making sure they never escaped, but somehow neglected to put a lock or even a warning sign on the outside of the vault. This is only slightly more inexplicable than the fact that despite knowing more about the creatures than anyone else in this travesty, he stays back at the lot after giving some instructions on how to catch them.So Kevin spends the rest of the movie chasing the ugly little buggers while they work their evil magic on him and his friends, granting their fantasies of being a war hero, being a stripper, actually meeting a woman, etc. Their pitiful capers take them to exotic locals such as Kevin's house, the inside of Tony's van, and the aptly named Club Scum, which looks oddly like a Rotary hall. The hobgoblins are eventually vanquished, although unfortunately without killing any of the people in this movie.As you hopefully realize by this point, there's no acting of any kind in this movie. There are also no real sets, no real plot, and no real budget. The titular critters are cheap hand puppets that mostly appear at the edge of the screen or partly obscured by furniture, the better to hide the puppeteer's hand. In the few instances where they directly attack someone, it's painfully obvious that the actors are just rolling around with plush toys. The fight with the octopus in Bride of the Monster was more convincing than this. At least the puppet wrestling has more plot significance than an earlier fight with gardening implements between Kevin and Tony, which takes place for no discernible reason except nagging from their girlfriends.What's worse, Hobgoblins constantly tries to be sexy, but has no idea how. The characters talk about getting it on with such earnestness and regularity that we can be certain whoever wrote their lines has never been past first base. Fifth graders know more innuendos and euphemisms than these bozos. And when Kyle dials up the local phone madam, her spiel comes off not so much erotic as schizoid. She used few complete sentences, and kept changing the pitch and volume of her voice, but apparently her routine has something to do with a mass breakout at the zoo.Nor does Club Scum offer anything remotely sexy. The lights are too dim to see anything clearly, most of the girls look like they crawled out of a gutter, and Amy's 'striptease' looks more like a spastic cheerleading routine, and shows amazingly little skin. It's telling that none of the items of clothing thrown into the sparse audience have any resemblance to the ones she was wearing. Halfway through her act, I began to wonder why a place called Club Scum would have no stripper pole, but dropped this line of inquiry to ponder why a bouncer would hurl someone into the club while yelling at them to get out.I could go on and on about how pitiful this movie is. I could spend page after page describing its utter stupidity and abysmal quality. I could fill an entire page ranting about the music alone. Bottom line, Hobgoblins is utterly worthless and there is no reason for anyone on earth to see it. A blank screen shown for the same amount of time would have been a vast improvement, and I would surely have gone mad had I not been watching the MST3K version. Even Joel, Tom, and Crow had a hard time with this one. Anyone foolish enough to watch Hobgoblins after reading this will deserve what they get. Zero stars.",

He's cocky and arrogant and he challenges the main boy to a fight, but this isn't no ordinary fight, it's a fight with gardening rakes! They just bang the rakes together until the military guy decides to take a hit on the boy. The girls then cheer on the arrogant military dude and after want to have sex with him.

Awful effects... - The quality of the sound and picture is goddamn awful! And the directing, *gak*, a monkey in a wheelchair could of directed this better... - Most of the scenes are dull and pointless - e.g. the long and tiresome garden-appliance fight in the back garden.

            "content": "This is a horror movie that should not be watched un-MST 3000. And by horror, I mean the sheer terror of watching the whiny people trying to act.This plot is simple, complicated and full of holes at the same time. Basically after the opening scene where a young security guard is killed, the old security guard hires a replacement, our hero : Kevin. They secure an abandoned film studio. The vault is the forbidden area. No one is suppose to go in there. Apparently, 30 years prior (this is all explained in a flashback by the old dude), these things (could be aliens, could be demons) appeared and slowly killed everyone in the studio. The old dude captures them and puts them in a vault. One night during the middle of a break-in, the \"Hobgoblins\" escape. Let me rephrase that. Our hero, Kevin, \"accidentally\" releases them. Boredom and stupidity ensue.This movie is full of new and interesting pain-inducing methods. From the dialog, to the sets/locations (the inside of a warehouse, Reputation Road and Club Scum stick out in my mind), to the outfits, to the music, the fight choreography, innumerable scenes of cars parking or stopping and the special effects all scream out for a giant bowl of cyanide Kool-Aid. The first fight scene is a duel between Kevin and his \"friend\" returning from basic training, Nick. This involves a hoe and a rake (Battle of the Gardeners or something). Now think of the fight scene, in the original Star Trek series, where Kirk and Spock are locked in a duel to the death. It is nothing like that. If Shatner and Nimoy were drugged up on sleeping pills and bottles of alcohol maybe these two scenes might be similar. The fight choreography on Star Trek (being almost 20 years older than this movie) is far superior to anything this movie can muddle through. The nunchaku scene at the end (or as Crow likes to refer to it as flares tied with electrical tape) is the proverbial cherry arsenic on our anthrax cake.The dialog does not help. It goes from worse to much worse. Classics lines such as: (Amy)-\"You would never show me a rated X movie. Would you Kevin?\"The other characters are equally as inspired. Kevin's girlfriend, Amy, is a frigid, know-it-all. Nick is belligerent and a sex fiend. Nick's girl, Daphne, is also a sex fiend and wears different neon pants with different see through skirts. Kyle is the androgynous, useless 3rd and 5th wheel, accordingly. The old dude looks like he needs a change of adult diapers and some El Dope. Finally, there's the stars and name-sakes of the movie : the Hobgoblins. They appear to be hybrids of gremlins, ghoulies and critters. And by hybrids I mean cheap imitations. They literally look and act like dolls. The actors even have to pretend the \"stuffed dolls\" are trying to attack them. Their powers seem to consist of appearing out of nowhere and biting people, unless they're bored, in which case they telepathically project the desires of their victims. To what end ?? I don't know, since no one seems to be hurt by their brain illusions. Just like gremlins, hobgoblins also have rules attached to them. Actually its just one rule : they are attracted to light.Under no circumstances are you to watch the non-MST 3000 version. Also try to contain your desire to watch this movie alone. This movie is not recommended for unsupervised viewing. Get a friend and some really,really good medicine.",

HOBGOBLINS was just one of many GREMLINS rip-offs that took place during the 80s and it's rather amazing to think that there was an actual market for stuff like this, TROLL and GHOULIES.

The special effects are certainly laughable as the hobgoblins are just hairy little creatures that are certainly never scary.

From now on they need to do a quick punchability test before allowing people to be in movies. Walk them through a public area and ask people to rate how badly they want to punch the actor in the face (1-10 scale), its hard to take anyone seriously while you are thinking about how satisfying it would be to punch him in the face. The plot isn't really worth mentioning outside of the fact that at one point the guys in the movie face off in a battle of masculinity by swinging rakes at each other. I was going to attempt something humorous about the rake fighting but I thought the fact that they were rake fighting is funny enough. No need to call the retarded kid stupid I guess. I fail to understand any of the character but I suppose its all for the better. One girl is a prude and yet her boyfriend stays with her? One girl is a slut but has a puchability rating of 8.4 not to be confused with her hitability rating of a mere 4.2, sad. The macho guy as proved via mild garden tool swinging is a pain in the ass military guy with a Scooby-Doo van. Finally the main character is a skinny kid who needs to brush up on his rake skills and has a shocking punchability of 9.8!! nearly perfect for face punching! Then some other stuff happens and it all sucks That's all",

The story centers on these cheesy and pitifully unconvincing tiny furry hand puppet sub-\"Gremlins\" alien creatures who escape from their prison in a film vault on an old abandoned studio lot and go on the rampage. It's up to a quintet of hideously bland and unlikable young adult drips -- a wimpy, but eager security guard, the guy's chaste, demure girlfriend, an obnoxiously macho military blockhead, the dude's insatiable nymphomaniac gal pal, and, perhaps the picture's most grossly unappealing character, a pathetically passive geek who's addicted to phone sex hotlines -- to stop the evil beasts before it's too late.Golly, where do I begin with pointing out everything that's wrong with this worthless offal? For starters, writer/director/editor/producer/cinematographer Rick Sloane shows not even a smidgen of talent or ability in any of these departments. The dreadfully static direction, insipid editing, flat, ugly cinematography, sloppy, unfocused script (it takes about twenty-five laboriously drawn out minutes for the creatures to break loose and even then the little buggers disappear for lengthy periods of time as if they were tossed into the flick as a hazy afterthought!), slack pacing, witless, groan-inducing attempts at painfully sophomoric humor, irritatingly abrupt ending (WARNING: Possible *SPOILER* ahead - The monsters voluntarily go back into their film vault prison and are blown up by an elderly security guard who just happened to be in munitions when he was in the army!), paltry rock bottom production values, and horrible acting from a horrendous charisma-barren cast are all uniformly putrid. The soundtrack of annoying New Wave punk songs and Alan Der Marderosian's redundantly droning hum'n'shiver synthesizer score are likewise quite ghastly. Worse yet, there isn't any graphic gore or gratuitous nudity to alleviate the brain-numbing severity of the stupefyingly lame'n'tame tedium that's grimly abundant throughout the grueling duration of this unbearably dreary'n'draggy clunker. Enjoyably bad movies have a certain chintzy charm and trashy verve to them which make the films themselves entertaining.

After a lengthy but suspenseful tour through the corridors of a mysterious storage facility, a group of frightening creatures known as 'hobgoblins' are released from a wicked bank vault within the facility. These demonic beings posses the ability to take the lives of humans by making their innermost wishes come true, hover at human shoulder height at will, and drive golf carts. What follows is a twisted ride into the psyche, as a gang of hormone-laden teenagers witness the horror of the hobgoblins, and their own inner selves.Writer/Director/Director of Photography/Editor/Producer Rick Sloane allows the audience no pause from the terror of the sickening creatures, and the atmosphere and execution is overall spot on. Forgivably Freudian, the movie posits that when the primitive urges of the id infect the aspirations of the superego, what wishes we hope to fulfill will inevitably doom the self, but through the use of rationality and technology, even the most misguided soul can be retrieved from apparent demise.Unfortunately, the film is held back from inducing true insight in its audience due to some unfortunate use of prosthetic eyebrows on Mr. Culver. This distracting little mishap did cost the film one star in this review.In the end, \"HOBGOBLINS\" left me with an optimistic view of humanity. For if we can successfully survive the onslaught of such abominations that attempt to let our darker selves consume us, what else is there that could truly destroy us? I found the title ultimately an impeccable choice, since as we all know: hobgoblins are more introspective than regular goblins.*********/10 stars.",

They are more likable and lifelike than the film's humans, though. Our \"star\" is Kevin, who is starting a new job as a night watchman at an abandoned movie studio. His elderly supervisor (who looks like a middle-aged man in old-age make-up; later, in a flashback scene, he looks like a middle-aged man in young-age make-up) warns him of the Hobgoblins who are trapped in the film vault. Kevin accidentally lets them free about five minutes into his new job. For no reason the titular imps head straight for Kevin's friends, who are across town dancing to bad eighties music. Kevin chases the Hobgoblins around while they make people's fantasies come true (as long as the fantasies could be made dirt cheap).Despite the old man's warnings no one dies, except for one butt-ugly blonde guy who fantasizes about being a rock star in the pre-credits sequence. And there's an over-abundance of annoying characters just asking to be offed. There's the slutty Daphne, who is clad in the brightest of late-80s/early-90s neon spandex. There's Nick, the van-driving muscle head who fights Kevin with a rake. There's Roadrash, the lovable bouncer at Club Scum, played by the guy in \"Pulp Fiction\" who kept the gimp in his basement. Oh, and there's so many more: the effeminate Club Scum MC, the B-52s-looking waitress, the gung-ho and Gnomish army sergeant, the frigid girlfriend-turned-stripper. All are terrible in their own way, but for me this movie was stolen by Kyle, a virginal, red shorts-wearing phone sex-addict, and his  fantasy hooker/girlfriend with the gravelly voice and skin-tight pants. These two actors will tingle your senses like no other. Repulsion, nausea, revulsion- you'll run the whole gamut of emotions. And yet, they don't die. No one dies in this stupid movie! It's really aggravating!At the end, the Hobgoblins simply return to the vault of their own free will, after killing no one. Then the old security guard, who had been guarding the hobgoblins for decades, blows them up. One might ask, \"Why didn't he just do that years ago?\" Unfortunately, director Rick Sloane didn't.I saw this on MST3K and I can't imagine watching it in it's original form. It's so poorly paced and all the action is implied, with lots of scenes of people looking at things off-screen. There are painfully long, drawn out scenes where nothing happens, terrible acting, and a pretty bad rock song that goes on too long. And if there's one thing that makes a bad movie worse, it's failed attempts at comedy. I can stomach most bad horror movies, but bad comedy is probably the hardest film sub-genre to sit through without feeling dirty. In short, this movie was not very good.",

Their chosen victims are Kevin (a total puss who still knows how to fire a gun blindly into the air to scare off burglars), Amy (Kevin's ice cube of a girlfriend who remains unimpressed with everything he does), Daphne (a slut outlined in spandex who refuses to watch any movie without a XXX rating), Nick (the jerky military brat trained in garden tool warfare), and Kyle (the lovable pervert hopelessly addicted to phone sex). While Kevin's elderly boss goes on for hours about how important it is that the puppets be stopped, the little devils have already attacked Kevin's friends (accompanied by a lyric-less dance song that also goes on for hours). Then Kevin stops Kyle from being taken in by his fantasy moments before his car plummets off a cliff (unfortunately, neither of the two characters are in the car at the time) while Amy goes off to discover her inner skank at Club Scum. After a rousing performance of the punk rock hit \"Pig Sticker\", Amy takes the stage, only to have her big night decimated by Nick's delusional war fantasy involving comically weak hand grenades and people that turn their own tables over in order to save the explosions some work...and then some other stuff happens, but by this time I had wandered off in desperation for human contact.This is one of those cases where you know the director made this movie for the sole purpose of putting in nude scenes. Of course, such scenes were excised for the MST3K version, leaving us with a story that the director couldn't care less about. I can sympathize with the emotionally scarred Tom Servo and Crow as they bolt for the theater exit over and over again during the opening credits. This movie gives Hal P.

There's an older guy there who warns him not to go into a certain area but doesn't say why. Of course, he does go there and releases little hand puppets, I mean creatures, that run amok. Turns out the old guy had locked them in there 30 years ago when they arrived from outer space. They somehow have the ability to grant wishes, but they kill you.

His girlfriend Amy is a prude who secretly wishes to be wild. Nick is an ugly airhead who just got out of the army and yearns to prove his manhood by challenging other guys to front yard showdowns with garden tools (wtf?).

The hobgoblins (and this designation is arbitrary) are only two feet tall but manage to attack peoples' upper body when the camera pans up. You can actually see an arm supporting the hobgoblins a couple of times. When grenades go off, they only yield fireballs, no explosions and nothing goes flying through the air from the impact. My favorite is the sounds editing - they dub these sounds at certain points that sound so artificial you can't help but laugh. During the mortal kombat in the front yard, every time the guys hit rakes there's a \"boing.\" Same with the times (oh yes, it happens more than once) in which Nick and Daphne go right in front of their pals into a van to engage in amorous activities - \"boing-boing-boing-boing-boing.\" GAAAHHH This movie is as bad as Troll 2 in many ways but I have to give the edge to Troll 2 because that movie has so many hilarious lines that you can take from it.

But Hobglobins is so stunning in its awfulness that it belongs in its own category, far removed from all the other bad films you've seen.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, works in this movie.It starts out as if it wants to be a cheapie horror flick, but soon changes its mind and decides to become an extremely bad teen comedy. Unfortunately, the \"horror\" sequences are not remotely scary or even interesting, and the \"comedy\" scenes are painfully bad.  And the fact that there is not a single likeable character in this movie does not help matters much.  Even the character who is apparently supposed to be the hero is annoying, which would have led me to root for the hobglobins if I could have deluded myself into pretending they were anything other than puppets.  So all the people are badly written jerks, the monsters are obvious lifeless props . . . what's the point?It amazes me to think that some people actually paid to see this upon its original release.  I wonder what the target audience was supposed to be -- clueless teenage morons, like the characters in the film?  I don't know, but if there are worse movies than Hobglobins somewhere, I don't want to know about them.",

The cheap production takes place in a car park for half the time and involves various obnoxious, irritating characters encountering a handful of cheap puppets which proceed to attack them.

It's just another marketing scheme from a desperate movie producer to create monstrous dolls to sell, but unlike E. T., Gizmo and the other gremlins and even the \"critters\", the creatures here just aren't interesting enough to attract movie audiences let alone convince them to buy an ugly toy.This has one of the worst ensembles I've ever seen in a movie, such hideous performances that to use the term \"actor\" is an insult to the most critically despised trained actors in film. The monsters are barely on screen so most of the action focuses on the young security guard who has been hired at the studio where the creatures live, his prim girlfriend, the nerdy but horny best friend, a sleazy trollop friend and the dumb as a rock boyfriend of the floozy fresh out of basic training. There's also a 976 phone operator the nerdy friend is desperate to bed and the veteran security guard who hid the monsters in the first place.The house where the hero lives highly resembles the home of Bela Lugosi from \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\", an ironic metaphor. The dialog is unbelievably horrendous and the delivery of the lines makes the acting in a John Waters movie seem like a prestigious Shakespeare stage company. So not only do you get a rotten rip-off of the critter genre popular in the mid 1980's but a completely trashy atmosphere that isn't even remotely cute. It's another film that is so bad, I wouldn't use the DVD as a cocktail coaster.",

And then Satan himself (or as I like to call him, Rick Sloane) hocked a big loogie on it.

I am not saying I never have, I have cried at movies because it was sad, I have cried at movies that have made me happy. However, Hobgoblins made me cry many times. Not because it was sad, but because it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. Not even the MST3K version of the film could make me admit to enjoying this abortion of cinema. I have to say a big thanks to Rick Sloane though. He is the only man who has made me cry so much...all because the end credits began to roll.To start off, the acting was akin to watching a room full of manikins fall over in a comedic fashion. It was so laughable it made me bust a gut. No, seriously...surgery is pending. The fight scene with the gardening equipment may be a crowning achievement in cinema as the most uninteresting event ever captured on film. The old man that guards the abandoned film lot walks in such a fashion that it almost appears as though he has an small invisible donkey helping him walk around all the time! Another thing with the film lot...it's out of business, it's abandoned, and yet it has a security guard. To make matters even worse they are in the proceeds of hiring a second guard!!! Why!? Not so much a plot hole as it is a plot pit fall. A man who lies on a grenade you would think would disintegrate when it set off, right? Wrong, he flies across the room, gets set on fire, only to come back later on in the film with nothing but a pair of crutches and no burn marks. The crutches which, he swiftly throws aside at the end of the film so he can go and have sex with his slapper of a girlfriend. I have similar experiences of enjoyment to this film, namely, using a drill as a cotton bud. I'm not saying the film was bad, I'm simply saying that it might actually be the cause for all disease. In short, watch this film and die. Almost like the Ring, only not worth watching. If you own a copy I suggest using it as fire lighter material.I think Rick Sloane should be put in front of a firing squad. A firing squad with really bad aim that would probably miss all his vital organs and continually shoot him in places that would hurt and yet not fatally wound. For some reason Mr Rick Sloane, feels that his original film of Hobgoblins was not enough to scar the world, and so 19 years later a sequel is being made. I would like to urge all readers to bow their heads in prayer to the mighty bat gods, in the hope that they will swiftly extinguish him in the night. I beg of you all not to watch this film, it will not only steal your soul, but it will make you suicidal. Save some time and kill yourself having never watched it and at least you will die soul intact.",

The only difference here is that this might actually be the worst of the entire classification (not an easy task, especially considering all the \"Gremlin\" hybrids were huge bombs). An old studio security guard has been hiding the titled creatures in a film vault for years. Really from outer space, they allow humans to live out their deepest fantasy and then immediately kill them when the dream ends. The concept would not have been so bad if it had been conceived by 2nd or 3rd graders, but keep in mind that adults were the ones who come up with this idea.

They seem to have a magical power to find a person, tap into his/her mind and create wild yet dangerous fantasies, however they are attracted to bright light and can be killed but they have be destroyed before dawn or else it's too late.A movie so bad that it makes \"Leonard part 6\" look like an Oscar winner, Rick Sloane should be ashamed for making this piece of crap rip-off of \"Gremlins\". Thank the good lord that MST3K crew riffed on this garbage, maybe they have suffered for this worst sin of a movie to hit the screen no thanks to Rick Sloane.If you want a fun \"Gremlins\" inspired movie, see \"Critters 1 & 2\" instead but watch this ONLY in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version which i give a Five reels out of and the Un-MST3K version Zero reels.",

Worse are the hobgoblins themselves; immobile puppets that have to be held and shook by the actors to create the illusion of menacing life. Hard to believe that anyone in this mess made it out unscathed, but watch for Duane Whitaker (Pulp Fiction & The Devils Rejects) in the ridiculous Club Scum sequence.Cheap, idiotic and painful.

            "content": "Once upon a time, back in the 50s, a young security guard named McCready is working the night shift at a movie studio when a spaceship lands off-screen. Through the fog produced by a machine, we see barely visible fishing wire pull back the top of the plastic spaceship. Inside are two Gremlin-like puppets. Flash forward 30 years, McCready is now an old man. He's saddled with one irresponsible partner after another. Unfortunately, none of them last too long. Why? Because the Hobgoblins are still around, living in an old film vault. See what the Hobgoblins do is tap into their minds and create their wildest fantasies. But once the fantasy ends, the victim dies. One night, his current whiny young partner Kevin lets the monsters out. Now, Kevin must find a way to stop them. To sum up in seven words: HOBGOBLINS is a cheap rip-off of GREMLINS. And not an overly good one at that. The filmmakers even stole the growls of those beloved disgusting, yet hilarious creatures. Sure, you could tell everyone was just having fun making it, but sometimes a movie needs more than that. What we have here is a group of not-so-gifted amateurs. Cinematography is pretty ho-hum, but I did like the lighting. We get a wild pastiche of blues, oranges, reds and greens. The title characters are obviously puppets. One of their heads even starts falling off in a scene. The humor usually rings hollow, like the characters are in on the joke but we're not. Most of the acting is pretty wooden. Though, I did like the actor who played Mr. McCready. He clearly has talent. Sadly like in most bad movies, a good actor is reduced to only a few scenes. Cool trivia note: Duane Whitaker, who plays Road Rash in here, later went on to mild success as one of the rapists in PULP FICTION. Logic is thrown right out the window. Case in point, it's just been established that the Hobgoblins are drawn to bright lights. In the very next sentence, we're told that all the Hobgoblins must be destroyed before dawn because once it's daylight, it's too late. When I heard that, I found myself scratching my head. Huh? The music rocks too, even if it's bargain basement material! MST3K showed this one and I think it's one of their best episodes. If you can, watch it with Mike and the Bots.

The mystery, the suspense, the comedy. The Oscar worthy performances and sepecial effects. This film had it all. One referred to it as Titanic for the 80's and I couldn't agree more.Some Spoilers (Movie in a nutshell) Young man takes job as a security guard at Movie Studio (no doubt the Warner Bros. or Fox lot) and is warned by his elderly mentor/supervisor on the job to not open the vault. Unfortunately he is a hard learner. The Hobgoblins escape and wreck havok on the town (specifically the new young guards home which coincedentally is the first house they travel to - Oscar worthy screenplay, perfect execution) The chaos that ensues as the small ankle high creatures attack (somehow at face height - another mystery of the Hobgoblins that will leave you boggled), and the creatures ability to enter the mind (and not really kill you - pressumably to toy with you a bit then kill you eventually somehow - the writers do it again), the climax at Club Scum (where the Hobgobs run amok and somehow manage not to startle the all the club goers who continue to drink as if the hobgobs aren't there - another mind trick no doubt. Still trying to unravel that mystery)... I could go on and on. I'm overwhelmed with the sheer magnificene that is Hobgoblins. Please rent this film. From what I understand M. Night got his Surprise ending idea from this film. A must for up and coming filmmakers 10/10. P.S. - I heard the Director of this film (R. Sloane) passed on Titanic. Huh after this film he had the power to pass on anything. Hobgoblins was every Director wishes they could reach (I'm talking to you Spielberg, Scott, Cameron).

In explaining this movie in as great of detail as possible, I hope to prevent the necessity of your watching it.)This movie is beyond bad.  It's a terrific failure on so many levels that it sadly must be seen to be believed.  The plot is pathetic, the acting is atrocious, the effects are worse, and there is not one appealing character in the piece.  Not one.  I counted.So there are these Hobgoblin creatures, which are very low-rent Gremlin puppets capable of creating a person's wildest dream and then killing them with it.  An old security guard, who for some reason does not see this as a reason to destroy the creatures (maybe he's anti-death penalty), has instead kept them shut away in a very poorly guarded and, oddly enough, UNLOCKED film vault.  Naturally it takes the creatures all of thirty seconds to escape, and we need a hero to stop the Hobgoblins.  Sadly, all we get are the five most annoying youths of the '80s: whiny, ineffective security guard trainee Kevin, his snooty girlfriend Amy (who makes the women of the 14th century seem enlightened and progressive), Amy's slutty and fashion-challenged friend Daphne, Daphne's horny army boyfriend Nick, and even hornier fifth wheel Kyle.Our not so-intreped band takes on the Hobgoblins, but not before Kyle is entertained with his loser fantasy (apparently involving a phone-sex girl pushing him over a cliff), Amy is inspired by the Hobgoblins to run off to Club Scum, (overseen by a Hell's Angel wannabe and a \"Caberet\" Emcee wannabe) where she performs a strip dance slightly less risque than the average high school production of \"Gypsy,\" Nick blows himself up (but survives with minor scratches) and Kevin gets into a fight with the third runner-up in the Esai Morales Look-Alike Contest.In the end, the Hobgoblins get blown up, Kevin gets Amy, Nick gets Daphne, and Kyle gets phone sex.

One of the characters has just returned from the army, and to prove what he has learned, he engages his friend in combat - with rakes. This is the best/worst scene of the movie. Its funny because its so dumb, but at the same time you're like \"wait, they were being serious here; they are really trying to imitate what a battle with rakes would be like,\" and then you just kinda feel bad overall.Now for the plot, I'm gonna make it quick. The hobgoblins are aliens who have been living in a vault for the last couple of decades at a movie studio. The security guard on duty when they arrived from space locked them inside; for some reason they decided not to kill him. 30 years later, the newest security guard lets them out by accident, so its up to him and his friends to stop them before the sun comes up. I don't remember why, but apparently it hits the fan if they are free during the daytime. In the end, they run back to the vault and the old security guard returns and blows it up. Why he didn't do that 30 years ago, no one knows.On a final note, I watched the MST3K version of this movie, and it still left me feeling nauseas. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",

Well it's a great horror anyway, nevermind being a film. There's plenty of horrific acting in \"Hobgoblins,\" but the worse is the main guy named Richard, who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for.  Well, when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, on a less than shoestring budget, no less, this is what will happen. Oh well at least the MST3K version was hilarious.

Well Some how..... Just trying to explain this super cheese fest of a movie is bad enough, so work with me here. A \u00bd of 10 review is too good for this movie. Many people will probably think this is a rip off of \"Gremlins\" or \"Critters\", But in order for it to be a rip off it needs a story, plot, and the creatures are just pain ridicules. about 90% of this movie the director probably just said screw it and just started filming random stuff. But I'm getting away from the story. \"HAHAHA\" I said Story...\" Hobgoblins & Story should never be used in the same sentence. Let me try to focus here. This so called secret totally secure area in which these 2 security guards must protect, Has a giant Safe and is being locked by a twist tie lock. Yes, I said twist tie the same thing that holds air out of your bread. Heck a 2 year old could sneak in this safe. But hiding in this safe are creatures so horrible and deadly, they have the power to warp people in a deadly fantasy illusion which eventually kill's the idiot victim, But what they mostly do is run away and drive in golf carts. \"Wait it gets better\" The director obviously couldn't figure out how to make these little creatures actually move/run/walk and film at the same time so how you know they get from here to there. All you hear is a scamper noise and the terrible actors in this $h1t fest look at there feet and go, wow did you see that! Yes Horrible and deadly is right to your eyes. These creatures spend all the time running and trying to cause mayhem to places you wouldn't give two $h1t's about. Then to end this super cheese fest which can be seen in the picture on the page, They have a mini pod space craft which magically appears out of thin air. I really have nothing good to say about this movie, except the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" group made fun of this horrible movie making it at least someone enjoyable to watch.

After some sexual \"jokes\" that feel like hydrochloric acid on your groin, stupid actors chase Hobbies into \"Club Scum\", where Main Character's girlfriend has become a slut, and discovers that the only way to get men to like you is to be a slut.From there, the stuff (not plot, stuff) goes downhill, runs over several pedestrians (the viewers), and crashes through three playgrounds and hits five puppies and finally hits a tree, which is the begginging of the movie. \nThem some more stuff happens.

BIRDEMIC and JACK-O are good examples of this, they really tried, but luckily for us, failed miserably.

For every really great film made, there are 100 really bad films that are basically about the same thing. For example, Scrooged starring Bill Murray is about an evil business man who goes through a change of heart at Christmas time and becomes a loving caring man who loves Christmas. Santa With Muscles stars Hulk Hogan as an evil businessman who gets amnesia and thinks he is Santa Claus, becoming caring and loves Christmas. Movies with similar stories, but whereas Scrooged is a brilliant film, Santa with Muscles is not. Hobgoblins seems to be, to me, a really bad Gremlins clone featuring lots of annoying kids and evil ugly furry little creatures, like the Gremlins. However whereas Gremlins was a brilliant and funny movie, Hobgoblins is not.It does have its moments, like the first time we see the Hobgoblins, one of the funniest moments i have seen in film - truly dire example of film, but funny because of it. The acting is very low quality, and the characters are intensely annoying and badly written. The film has a nice concept of the Hobgoblins being evil little creatures who use a form of telepathy to control people and allowing them to act out their deepest most carnal desires, or in some instances, forcing them to act out on carnal desires that normally would make them physically sick. The only way to stop the creatures is to kill them all before dawn. It has the potential to make a good film and it is an interesting idea but unfortunately it is just very badly executed, with little thought being given to the characters, the script, the direction, sets, make-up, locations, editing, sound, props, and really everything you could think of. The continuity in the film is really bad, in fact it makes Spiderman look continuous. Especially the very end. Watch it and prepare to see something that is laughingly bad and just utterly unbelievable at the end. The only reason to watch this film is because, like with most truly awful films, it is so bad it's funny.It is just about possible to survive this film under normal circumstances, but i recommend watching this one with MST3K insulation as Mike, Tom and Crow make it a lot more bearable. (MST3K insulation is something that is familiar to people who have read my other reviews of bad films. Basically MST3K insulation means that Mike or Joel and Tom & Servo make the film bearable with their quips and riffs. They insulate you from the spirit-sucking soul-crushing badness of the film. MST3K insulation - never watch a bad film without it).Gets one star for being so bad that it makes you laugh till you hurt. Just about crests 2 stars for a half interesting plot.

I was bracing myself hard with my brother to see one of the most horrid movie there is....And let me tell you, I haven't laughed this hard since....oh..since a long long time...This film is so ridiculous its scary and baffling to try and imagine how these people could actually have sat through a post production phase and actually decided to go to print.Where can I start : well, let's start at the beginning. The first scene is the one where I laughed the most.. There's this old guy and a kid in a studio who are supposed to insure the security of the place, arguing over a telephone call which the kid didn't pick up but should have, and the scene goes on and on about this, AND THIS IS THE INTRO !! I mean what were these guys thinking !! WHO CARES ABOUT NO ONE PICKING UP THE PHONE !! Is this relevant in any way to the story ???? (which I won't bother explaining cause there isn't any)The other scene where I had difficulty containing my laughter was the Rake fight scene. There's the hero who is called a dweeb by his girlfriend, and to prove his worth, tries to fight one of his so called pals in the front garden with rakes. And let me tell you, Darth Vader and Obi Wan are wussies compared to these two individuals. During at least 5 minutes, you can see the SAME ATTACK, WITH THE SAME DEFENSE MOVE, repeated and repeated while the girlfriends stand and watch 'in horror'..HAHAHA...There are so many scenes I could talk about here, it would take all day. If you have the god given chance to rent this one, DO IT! It's the best worst movie I have ever seen.",

She moves in a bizarre extended gait that tries (and fails) to register her horror at the appearance of the hobgoblins. The purported dive of a club across which she runs is actually some form of cafeteria, replete with plastic tables, a serving hatch instead of a bar and punctuated with advertisements for products such as 'beer' and 'sex' highlighted by tinsel.'Good day old chap. Can I have a beer and sex please?'It is at this moment that mentally I pack my bags and give up on Hobgoblins.Don't think I'm stupid, deluded or both. I went into this with my eyes open having read each and every one of the reviews posted on IMDb. For some reason though, I thought I knew best. Okay, so you all thought it was soul-splittingly bad, but I like bad films. I'll like it. I even took the bold decision to watch the non-MST3K version, so sure was I that it's badness would translate as good.Sadly, it isn't a question of simply bad or good.Obviously this film isn't good. The directing is beyond inept, the acting non-existent and there is no pacing, no tension and no humour to speak of.Technically however, I couldn't call this film bad either. For a film to be bad it has to try and fail but hobgoblins doesn't even try\u0085 anything. Any action, any opportunity for a set piece or anything which might further the plot simply comes and goes without event, solution or explanation. Take for example the scene in the house where the main characters first encounter the hobgoblins: They don't even try to pretend that they are actually being attacked, instead simply hold the puppets while delivering their lines dead pan.It took me some time to work out how to classify this uniquely unenjoyable experience but in the end I came to the conclusion that it isn't actually a movie. It's just a series of random scenes on DVD. Like watching a DVD of some paint drying.Other reviewers have mentioned bad parts of this film which to me sounded like they might be quite fun. For example the rake fight, the odious slut (who actually isn't even that), the horrible big-arsed bloke who's addicted to sex lines and the crappy puppets but the truth of the matter is that Hobgoblins is so profoundly meaningless and without personality that these inept features fail to even raise a derisive smile.Hobgoblins is a vacuum of an experience that I beg you to never, ever embark upon no matter what the temptation.",

With artistic abominations such as \"Manos\": The Hands of Fate, \"Space Mutiny\", \"The Wild World of Batwoman\" or \"Robot Holocaust\", our understanding of bad movies has changed completely - next to these pitiful excuses for motion pictures, Ed Wood's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" looks like sci-fi extravaganza, and \"Glen or Glenda\" like a serious contender for an academy award nomination. But just when I thought that movies can't get any worse than, say, \"Manos\", MST3K unearths another cinematic catastrophe that lowers the bar even further - if that even sounds like a possible feat. In this particular case, \"Hobgoblins\" was the movie that surprised in a most displeasing manner...But let me start with the, ahem, \"story\". Our protagonist is a teenager named Kevin, and life hasn't been too kind to him. Apart from being plagued by the most insensitive girlfriend imaginable, he has to make a living as a security guard on an abandoned movie lot, together with old McCreedy, who has been working on the lot for decades. One night, while walking through the halls of the studio, Kevin stumbles over a vault, and being the moron he is, he immediately opens the vault and thus releases...THE HOBGOBLINS! As McCreedy reveals, these small, green critters once arrived on the lot from outer space, but due to their unfortunate ability to kill people by making their fantasies come true, McCreedy imprisoned them within the vault (because, you know, killing and getting rid of the problem them would have made too much sense...). Now, it is up to Kevin to kill the creatures before they can do serious harm to his (utterly idiotic) friends or anyone else...From the moment you first see the Hobgoblins, you know that this flick is nothing more than a cheap rip-off of 80s hits like \"Gremlins\" or \"Critters\", and to be fair, this could have worked and provided us with mindless low-budget fun. But unfortunately, what we got instead turns out to be a disaster of epic proportions. First of all, what's with the design and look of the creatures? The makers of this film obviously didn't even attempt to make them look passable, since all we see painfully obvious hand-puppets that move in a terribly awkward manner and look absolutely pathetic. But trust me, they're not the biggest problem this movie has. Even worse is their peculiar ability. Honestly, it sounds like a decent concept on paper, but the fantasies the creatures make real are...well, unspeakable. Kyle, for example, a pitiful loser and friend of Kevin, is phone-sex addict, and thus the creatures lure him into a date with the supposed girl behind the voice. And to kill him, the illusion-girl (fittingly called Fantazia...) tries to push the car she and Kyle are in over a cliff...o-kay. As if that wasn't dumb enough already, we also witness Amy (Kevin's icy \"girlfriend\") fantasizing about becoming a stripper in \"Club Scum\" (no kidding) or sex-addict Daphne fantasizing about making sweet love to her army-friend Nick within his car...well, you can tell that the script-writers were not only inept, but quite naughty as well. Sure, it's just a sci-fi flick, so maybe I sound overly critical, but the story of this mess is just painful. It's full of logical errors and moronic characters acting dumb to advance the plot, and just wait till the end of the film...ugh.As I mentioned earlier, the creature design already reveals how ineptly made this film is, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Apparently, none of the folks involved had any knowledge about professional film-making. Pace, camera-work and storytelling are just chaotic, and the best example can be found during a scene in Club Scum: the characters are calmly sitting at a table and listening to a band performing. And this goes on for about 2 minutes. No kidding, we have the same camera angle for 2 straight minutes focusing on the stage, as if it was supposed to be a shameless advertisement for the band. No need to mention other action scenes such as the infamous garden-rake fight that is dumb in itself already and goes on for what seems like an eternity.And the actors? Don't get me started on them...throughout the entire movie, all you see are pure amateurs, stumbling awkwardly through this mess and delivering their lines in the worst way possible - just the icing on the cake in this film.Having seen the likes of \"Robot Holocaust\" and now this, I highly doubt that there are worse movies the 80s have to offer. This movie more than deserves its place in the IMDb bottom 100, and I'd go as far as saying that it should remain there for years to come...I refuse to believe that movies could possibly get worse than this.",

Those three films are brilliant masterworks compared to the brutally poor \"Hobgoblins.\"  I can only hope that writer/director/producer Rick Sloane is an unrecognized genius past his classical stage and into his abstract stage.  To loosely paraphrase a well-recognized theater critic who spoke of a similarly bad work:  \"There are now two types of people:  those who have seen 'Hobgoblins,' and the lucky ones.\"  May the gods of cinema save us from another film like this stinker.

A word about the puppets:  I can't imagine who thought those god-awful things were a good idea.  Did someone really think these bastard offspring of Alfred E. Neuman and the \"Lion King\" hyenas would scare people?  And the marionnation is wretched.  I'm guessing the puppeteer saw \"Fraggle Rock\"--once--and went from there.  I can't say enough about how bad (and funny) these things look.  Whenever I'm feeling blue, I just think of these puppets, and I feel better.",

This is about the point when it becomes less of a movie and more of an oozing, gelatinous mush. The director (Rick Sloane, who is obviously perminantly insane) seems to do a half-assed job on everything. It doesn't even succeed as a comedy!! The \"story\" has a tendency to disband from all logical thought (I.E.: A nerdy kid just barely escapes from the hobgoblins and ten minutes later dials up a phone-sex hotline, or the girl with the fantasy to be a slutty dancer at a place called Club Scum. But I thought that was everyone's fantasy. (sarcasm intended)PLEASE do not watch Hobgoblins unless accompanied by Mike and his robots, or you have a few friends over to help you bash it's general stupidity.

It's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (I'm guessing this...) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world:\nSpare yourself, spare your time, life, and money, by NOT--I repeat, NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie. This movie is so corny, it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You might actually admire it. (Like I said before, IF you have a one-digit IQ)With about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap.",

The lighting is atrocious, the dialogue is incomprehensible (of course, that's a good thing, right?), and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. I would watch \"Hobgoblins\" without MatB and still enjoy it. But...shudder...\"MAGG,\" even WITH JatB is like torture of some sort. So I proudly give this movie a thumbs up. Everyone unite, put \"Monster A-Go-Go\" where it belongs! \"Hobgoblins,\" \"Space Mutiny,\" \"Soultaker,\" etc...these movies aren't THAT BAD compared to the horror that is \"Monster A-Go-Go.\"",

Although every time a joke which wasn't funny was made i would laugh, just because of the way they were delivered badly. In fact the film as a whole is delivered badly and i laughed pretty much throughout it. This is a budget film, and at first you can't understand what is going on, but if you can make it through the first 10 minutes you are in for a fun and entertaining film. Just fast forward through the music scene. And watch out for the classic grenade scene.I am not sure whether this is supposed to be a comedy or a horror.

Peter Jackson's \"Bad Taste\" comes to mind. More often, one gets an embarrassing pile of junk like this work.
