            "content": "For sheer goof-ball exuberance, you needn't look any further than \"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\". Leslie Nielsen remains forever associated with the role of inept Lt. Frank Drebin, who always tries to do the right thing but always makes a mess of everything. Here, he's trying to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth. Since this is from the people behind \"Airplane!\", it means that much of the humor derives from twisted dialogue and things popping out of the background. To crown it all, there's even a guest appearance by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic as himself. Also starring are Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy, O.J. Simpson, and Ricardo Montalban.And to think that Leslie Nielsen started out in movies like \"Forbidden Planet\"!",

            "content": "The movie itself is funny.  \"The Naked Gun\" is without a doubt the best skewering of all cop movie cliches available in this day and age.  It works on every conceivable level and a few that haven't been conceived yet.But what puts it over the top is Leslie Nielsen.It's amazing: he was great in \"Airplane!\", another classic from the ZAZ team (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), and in the lamentably short TV series \"Police Squad!\".  But here, he spreads his wings and flies to new heights of insanity and delerium.  With jaw set square and tongue firmly in cheek, Neilsen makes the role of Lt. Frank Drebin all his own and the movie-going public's collective life is all the more enriched because of it.He's aided and abetted by greats like Kennedy, Presley and Montalban (who knew?) and the movie even finds good moments for John Houseman and Reggie Jackson.  As I said, the movie takes off and finds great things to do with police cars with a mind all their own and goes on from there to take on such cliches as car chases, illegal searches, the cleaning out of the desk, the trip to the police lab, shoot-outs, the lax housework of a single police detective, etc., etc., etc.....And what other cop movie in the history of the world has a music video in the middle, courtesy of Herman's Hermits?Just one.Ten stars and a Dugout Dog for \"The Naked Gun\", the film that answers once and for all - can Leslie Nielsen do comedy?I think you know the answer.",

            "content": "Fresh from tackling terrorism in Beruit, with his own unique hands on style, Lt Frank Drebin is immediately called onto the job to investigate the near fatal shooting of a fellow officer. Det Nordberg was gunned down investigating a case in the docks and Drebin's investigation begins with the company that Nordberg was undercover with \u0096 that of pillar of the community Vincent Ludwig. As Frank falls for Ludwig's PA, the beautiful Jane Spencer, he uncovers proof of a dastardly plot by Ludwig \u0096 but who will believe him?If there is a man, woman or child on this earth who can say, hand on heart, that they just don't find Airplane, Naked Gun, Police Squad and the like funny then I would very much like to meet the sad sack just to discover what it takes to elicit a smile from them. Needless to say, this sort of film is very much my type of thing but not to the point where I cannot spot a good one from a bad one. In fact one of the big downsides of this film is that it did create many copies that just couldn't do it as well \u0096 so we have had spoofs of all sorts of genres recently, but too many have more hits than misses.It is to this films credit that it has a very high hit/miss ratio and I enjoy it so much because the laughs keep coming. The material is very silly but it is the constant straight face that it delivers it with that is perfect and makes it work. Other films of the ilk have been overly silly without keeping this straight face. However, our characters here seem oblivious \u0096 apart from the odd one who gives the other a funny look etc, and this makes the goings on even funnier. The plot is silly but that doesn't matter as you will be laughing too much to really care. Having seen it so often I have stopped roaring the way I did the first time but I still chuckled all the way.The writing and direction is spot on \u0096 delivering sharp lines that make me laugh due to their sheer unexpectedness or the way they are so very out of place as well as sight gags that are imaginative and clever. However lets not forget a delivery by a very talented cast who make the material work. Praise goes to Nielsen in the lead; he may have worn his role thin over the years with typecasting and, shall we say 'less than perfect' material but give him the tools and he'll do you a job. He can be straight, he can dither or he can just be a clown and he does them all here \u0096 his delivery is great whether it's action or reaction shots. Likewise I felt the rest of the cast did well even if most of them are given reaction shots to Drebin. Presley is straight and funny for it while Kennedy seems to fit into the material with ease. OJ doesn't have as much chance to be funny and seems a little stiff in the scenes he is in, but he is still good \u0096 just pales a little when next to the others. I love Montalban and he uses his ooze really well in this film \u0096 and his reaction shots are very good. The support is all good but it is Nielsen doing his (now) time-honoured turn as spoof-master than steals the show.Overall I love this genre and consider this film (indeed the series) to be up there with Police Squad and Airplane. It is not as hilarious as Airplane but it has way more hits than misses and is relentlessly funny. As a film it isn't perfect but anyone watching this who complains about plot holes, lack of character development or lack of narrative really have missed the point.",

And the writing is if not good, great that never lets up (even through the finale baseball game with Reggie Jackson). \nBut what really gets this film up there is it's main characters.  Leslie Nielson has never been better and probably won;t ever be this good ever again.  He brings an insane type of humor from a cop that hasn't been seen since Clouseau.  The supporting characters are good also, including Priscilla Pressley, George Kennedy, Ricardo Montebaum, Nancy Marchand and (odd to see him in a movie today) OJ Simpson.  There zany characters and added with a great script make this a treasure in cinema comedy.  One of the best films of the 80's.  A++",

            "review_title": "What we can learn from this film",
            "content": "The real question that \"The Naked Gun\" poses is not why it's one of the funniest spoofs ever made, but why virtually no subsequent movie in this genre has been any good at all. I used to adore this sort of movie when I was a kid--\"Airplane,\" \"Top Secret,\" and the six-episode \"Police Squad\" show, which became the basis for the \"Naked Gun\" series, were among the funniest films I knew. When I first saw \"The Naked Gun\" in the theater when I was eleven, I was in uncontrollable laughter for the first few minutes. That was my standard of great humor at the time.But the following decades gave us a variety of similar spoof films, some of which involved one or more of the Zucker-Abrams-Nielsen team, and none of these films were even remotely in the league of their predecessors. These included \"Hot Shots,\" \"Loaded Weapon 1,\" \"Jane Austen's Mafia,\" \"Spy Hard,\" \"Wrongfully Accused,\" and \"Scary Movie.\" These films would typically feature some funny stuff, but you'd walk away indifferently, wondering what the overall point was. Seeing a ponytailed Leslie Nielsen imitating John Travolta's dance sequence in \"Pulp Fiction\" is funny for a second, but there's nothing enduring about such humor. An entire movie filled with such scenes doesn't amount to much. What's the big deal about such jokes, anyway? There's nothing intrinsically funny about making references to other films, even if you do it in a silly way. At what point did the genre go wrong and become such a dreary, uninspired affair? Is it that I've just outgrown this sort of humor?I have another theory. When I first watched \"The Naked Gun\" at age eleven, I had not seen many of the movies it was spoofing, such as the early James Bond pictures. I was vaguely familiar with some of the clich\u00e9s it was making fun of, but many of the political and sexual jokes went right over my head. And the celebrity cameos meant nothing to me. So what was it about the film that appealed to me so much, that made me laugh till my sides hurt?The answer is simple: it was the film's utter silliness. Think of the scene at the beginning when we discover that Ayatollah Khomeini secretly sports a mohawk underneath his turban. Or the opening credits where the police car goes on the sidewalk, inside buildings, on a roller coaster, and so on. None of this makes any sense, of course; it's just an exercise in pure absurdity. I loved \"The Naked Gun\" for pretty much the same reason I loved the Three Stooges or Bugs Bunny cartoons. Even as an adult, I appreciate unsubtle cartoon humor when it is handled effectively. As long as it makes me laugh, who cares that it's not \"sophisticated\"? For example, the scene where Lt. Drebin breaks into a building and tries to be as quiet as possible, but then inadvertently sets off a player piano, is masterfully filmed.Thus, \"The Naked Gun\" is farce as much as it is satire. As I grew older, I would gain a greater appreciation for the one-liners, like \"You take a chance getting up in the morning, crossing the street or sticking your face in a fan.\" To be sure, many of these jokes are dumb. They're supposed to be. That's the whole point. What I understood even at age eleven was that the movie was essentially playing games with the audience. When Lt. Drebin looks in a drawer and says \"bingo,\" I knew immediately that the drawer would reveal a bingo board. I was used to this sort of humor, because I'd seen it in the earlier Zucker-Abrams films, where the jokes had a definite logic to them, and trying to predict them in advance was part of the fun. They have far more to do with audience anticipation than with trying to make us laugh at bad puns.The modern spoof films have forgotten all this. They've forgotten that making a good spoof requires a measure of invention, even if much of the plot is ripped off from elsewhere. Car chases may not be original, but \"The Naked Gun\" is, as far as I know, the first film in which the chase is conducted by a student driver. This type of cleverness is largely absent from the modern spoofs, which assume that they have no reason to be creative when their ideas are based broadly on other films. They've forgotten that the most effective way to make fun of a clich\u00e9 is by coming up with an ingenious twist. Even the characters in films like these matter, and Lt. Drebin is crafted in the grand tradition of other inept lawmen like Inspector Clousseau. This is what gives the film its own personal stamp that makes it more than an exercise in movie references.",

This is one of those movies in which you can go crazy by trying to count the gags in the first ten minutes. Airplane did disaster films, this one does police dramas.Frank Drebin (Leslie Neilsen) is a respected cop with gravel for a brain. He is part of a police force called Police Squad, who the security of Queen Elizabeth has just been handed to for her visit to Los Angeles. Frank bumbles through several hilarious scenarios in trying to foil an assassination attempt on her, and catch the attempted murderer of his best friend Nordberg (OJ Simpson). Meanwhile, he starts going out with the beautiful Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley).This movie goes from one hilarious situation to another, from commandeering a car that's being used for a drivers test, to trying to save a valuable pen from a fish tank. Leslie Neilsen's comedic timing is brilliant. His facial expressions during the slapstick sequences are priceless, as are his dead-seriousness of delivering one liners. Some of his quotes are so hilarious, that I have trouble figuring out how he could have possibly kept a straight face during filming. This is another classic in the same style as Airplane, which means hilarity. This gets a 9/10.It is rated PG-13 for Crude and Sexual Humor, and for Some Language.

The picture contains an unstopped string of gags each thirty seconds and silly jokes ; from start to finish the up-roaring comedy and humor result to be interminable , that's why the viewers will laugh uncontrollably . Habitual quirky and lunatic roles , especially reincarnated by Nielsen as a deadpan , idiot detective . Most of the laughs and sight gags galore work acceptably , particularly the jokes with the Queen's reception fiasco ; however, the overlong gags about the baseball are dull and boring . The picture is well screen-written and realized by Jim Abrahams and brothers Jerry , David Zucker (ZAZ) , parody pioneers and longtime collaborators with successful work making their own comedy troupe . Rated PG (parents guide) for some sexually , gags with occasional adult content and profanities . Followed by two inferior sequels with similar actors , elements and characters :\u00a8The smell of fear\u00a8 and \u00a8The final insult\u00a8 .

            "content": "Leslie Nielson's death last November was a big shock to me. Sure he has been in some bad films, such as 2001:A Space Travesty, but he had also made some quintessential classics such as Airplane, the only film of his career I consider better than this, and the Naked Gun series, of which this is the best. Whatever the outcome of the film, that doesn't stop me from considering Nielson a comedy genius.The Naked Gun:From the Files of Police Squad! is fast, furious, zany and most importantly, enormous fun film. While it looks great, is wonderfully directed, brilliantly paced with seldom a dull moment and has energetic music and a fun story, it is the humour and acting that really makes this film so good.The dialogue is deliciously dry-witted, and the plentiful juvenile gags never cease to be hilarious. Nielson gives one of his career's best performances in a wonderfully deadpan characterisation as an likable inept character. The support performances from Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy and OJ Simpson are equally great, but special mention has to go to Riccardo Montalban who just oozes cool.Overall, a hilarious film. Forget rubbish like Disaster Movie, 2001:A Space Travesty, Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie and watch the classic spoof movies like Young Frankenstein, Airplane, Galaxy Quest and this.

            "content": "\"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\" is the first movie based on the 1982 cult classic TV sitcom \"Police Squad!\" And this movie stands up next to \"Airplane!\" as one of the funniest movies ever made. That's no surprise, since the same team (Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker) that made \"Airplane!\" made \"The Naked Gun\". This movie is quite similar to \"Airplane!\" in the way it presents its jokes. Rapid fire, and you can't stop laughing. My kind of comedy. \"The Naked Gun\" has some of the biggest laughs in a movie that I've ever seen. Leslie Nielsen is perfect in his return to the role of inept cop Lt. Frank Drebin. Priscilla Presley is very funny in her film debut. George Kennedy, Ricardo Montalban, and even Nancy Marchand (a decade before \"The Sopranos\") get big laughs amongst the craziness. And love that opening title sequence. Very original. And unlike the \"Police Academy\" series, \"The Naked Gun\" sequels lived up to the original 1988 film. The first one is still the best, but \"Naked Gun 2 1/2\" and \"Naked Gun 33 1/3\" were very funny too. That's why \"The Naked Gun\" series is the funniest movie series ever made.

            "content": "Like the 1980 comedy classic \"Airplane!\", the first of the \"Naked Gun\" movies is a gem. It isn't an excellent film like \"Airplane!\" was, but it sure is an improvement over \"Airplane II\" which stalled the Zucker/Abrams films for almost a decade. A major part of \"Airplane!\", but other than flashbacks, absent from \"Airplane II\", Leslie Nielsen is back, this time in the lead and repeating his role of Lt. Frank Drebbin from the brief TV series \"Police Squad\". His squad team is new for the movies, and it includes a very funny George Kennedy and the accident prone O.J. Simpson whose mishaps will create hysterical laughs more for his personal life than for the funny way his basically decent character is abused.The opening shows many long deceased world leaders being confronted by Nielsen in a very funny way, and from there comes in the opening credits, basically the same from the T.V. series, only with the title changed, and missing the special guest star credit that was a gag in every episode. (My personal favorites were Florence Henderson doing a Wesson commercial and being confronted by a disgruntled fan and Abraham Lincoln reacting to a shooter while at Ford's Theater.) The theme of the credits would remain a part of the series and were often some of the funniest bits in the show, including a bit of T&A (for those who like that sort of thing) and sometimes even a celebrity cameo that parodied their real life.There's a great villain, played by real-life good guy Ricardo Montalban, and a gorgeous heroine, played by the angelic looking Priscilla Presley. Sexual innuendos provide laughs, and even if they could now be considered bad taste (particularly Nielsen ending out on a ledge of Montalban's condo complex, accidentally assaulting one of his neighbors with a concrete phallic symbol), you would have to be rather prissy to be offended by it all. Jeanette Charles, who more than just slightly resembles Queen Elizabeth II, is the victim of an assassination attempt, first seen in an encounter with Nielsen that puts her in an embarrassing \"position\", and later at a baseball game where she finds herself rather \"inconvenienced\" by passing sodas and hot dogs down the line in the royal box. The wonderfully imperious Nancy Marchand is hysterically funny as the mayor of L.A. (female and white, quite the opposite of L.A.'s then mayor Tom Bradley), and I longed for her in the next two movies where other imperious women replaced her in similar parts.This is a film that you must see at least every couple of years, not only for the gags that you've forgotten, but for those you may have missed along the way on previous viewings. Certainly, this is what was considered a \"popcorn\" film back when the movie theaters were loaded with those (and not overwhelmed with noisy special effects), but it is definitely a crowd pleaser. Back in the time of its release, it probably was a film that guys dragged their girlfriends to (revenge for being dragged to chick flicks), but sometime tells me that even the ladies in the crowd could laugh at the delicious un-p.c. themes of the story, which slight at best and predictable, always keep you on your feet. The conclusion with the villain getting their come-uppance is delightfully disgusting, and of course, the best is saved for O.J. who could only scream \"It Hertz!\" as he takes lump after lump. Oh if only justice had been served that way during the trial of the century, but fortunately the \"Naked Gun\" movies allow us to laugh at him, as well as with him, because no matter how much he is hated now, you can't help but agree that he was a good sport.",

I just have to shake my head.I like these kinds of films where the sight and sound gags come a mile a minute, they have a way of keeping the viewer on his toes. It's all nonsense of course, like the sign in a warehouse stating 'Attention - All employees must wash hands before using restroom'. You really have to seek that one out, aware that the film makers didn't always draw direct attention to them but did some of their work with a subtlety to be admired.And then there are the gags that come at you like a hammer blow, like Lieutenant Drebin's (Leslie Neilsen) ill fated attempt to infiltrate Vincent Ludwig's (Ricardo Montalban) office, filled with fine art and exotic collections. Then at one point out of nowhere, we get treated to Herman Hermit's hit 'Somethin' Tells Me I'm Into Somethin' Good'. The kicker of course when it comes to hindsight, is the appearance of O.J.

Zucker has even written the film along-with his legendary combo of Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams & Pat Proft.

The Writing is absurd, funny & lively. It succeeds by holding your attention completely, from start to end. The dialogue, are outrageous, but so very innovative at the same time.

Simpson) and soon gets involved with the attempted murder of the Queen. For my money this is one of the greatest, side splitting comedies ever made and it hasn't lost any of its charm in the twenty-years since it was released. What's so amazing to me is that the movie spits out one gag after another and most movies that attempt this end up having the jokes be hit and miss. I don't think I'm overstating this but to me this movie hits the mark on each joke it tries and that's why this will remain one of the greatest comedies ever made. It's really hard to explain any of the jokes or why they're funny because there's no doubt that they are childish and dumber than dumb itself. Just as you start laughing at one joke before that laugh is over you'll be starting over again on the next one. The jokes are rapid fast and Nielsen handles them with no trouble. His comic timing is perfect for the character and you can't help but feel that Drebin really is that stupid. The supporting characters are all wonderful as they perfectly set up all the jokes for Drebin to bat around. George Kennedy, Priscilla Presley and Ricardo Montalban are all very good and even Simpson comes off quite funny and that's especially true during his opening scene where he gets shot up. What really makes this film is classic to me are its final twenty-minutes, which usually leave me with tears in my eyes from laughing. Being a baseball fan it's priceless seeing Drebin getting involved in a game he clearly knows nothing about.",

The obvious thrust in the plot lampoons James Bond super-spy stuff, which is underscored by having the Queen over to visit and a suave, exotic villain. I think it's with the second mode that Abrahams/Zucker really stumbled onto something\u2014film noir.In the film, Drebin imagines himself as the cocksure Philip Marlowe guy, there is the snappy noir voice-over, the Double Indemnity quotations, the alluring woman, the glistening pavements and neon night atmosphere....but from our position as viewers, we know he is a bumbling buffoon who sleepwalks in his own illusory bubble\u2014most importantly, the woman is not a femme fatale as he suspects\u2014so the surreal situations that develop, which are a staple of the noir nightmare, are his own illogical doing.Because the film is a comedy, these are played for laughs, and the buffoon has to be shown to triumph, but this is a smart, interesting reworking.

He also has to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth. This is one of the best spoofs I've ever seen. It fits in all the clich\u00e9s from the \"tough police officer\" investigative crime thrillers. The Zuckers know exactly what they're doing... varying the marvelously written and planned jokes and gags, at times having only a single element in a sequence be \"off\"(and thus everyone else react realistically, and the laws of physics behave as they should, other than this one thing) so that the contrast heightens the impact, and, in the midst of all of this, there's actually a plot, and we do care about the characters, we want to see the good guys win and the bad guys burn. Sure, we're laughing on account of the slapstick, silliness, clever lines and wordplay, still, we also want to see what happens next, how it progresses(even for it following the simple formula of the genre it's referencing). And somehow, even when it goes where we expect it to, we're immensely entertained by the trip there(which might surprise anyway, in some of the details). I mean, when Leslie, already having been established as being clumsy, is told that this fish in the tank is expensive and rare, and that that pen is priceless, and tolerant of everything but water, we know where the bit is headed. There is a little moderate to strong language and sexuality, as well as brief female nudity. I recommend this to any fan of parody. 8/10",

It's a laugh-a-minute gag fest which delightfully spoofs movies in general, so the more you've seen, the funnier it becomes.It's also one of those films that everyone seems to have seen countless times, so to recount the plot would be a waste of time. Leslie Nielsen has never been better as the bumbling Frank Drebin, a cop who creates chaos wherever he goes in the best slapstick tradition. Supporting him are George Kennedy as the straight man and Priscilla Presley (ex-wife of Elvis) as his love interest, while O. J. Simpson proves unexpectedly amusing as another cop.The movie's scattershot approach means that the gags come thick and fast, so even if you don't enjoy one you'll soon forget it as another will be along almost straight away.

            "content": "\"The Naked Gun\" is a hilarious adult film that is a \"modern day\" slapstick comedy. Not since the mid-20th century had there been a slapstick film in the ilk of those of the silent and golden ages of Hollywood. The Marx Brothers and Three Stooges were the last of such films. Some may see this as slight spoofing of the police and crime films and series that were so common into the final decades of the 20th century. But, it's not hard to imagine that someone would eventually capitalize on all the crime and mystery films and series by making a clearly slapstick comedy.The creators of \"The Naked Gun\" surely saw \"The Pink Panther\" of 1963. That film sort of opened the door to the main police character being something of a quirky character, if not an outright buffoon. The sequels with Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau reinforced the appeal of such comedy with audiences.This film has an extended title, \"From the Files of Police Squad.\" That's an obvious reference to the source of the material for the film. The 1982 ABC TV series, \"Police Squad\" ran just six episodes. But all the half hour shows were hilarious. British TV may have led the return of such slapstick with the BBC Comedy series, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" that ran from 1969 through 1974.There were other films that were clear spoofs of the great detectives of literary fiction and film. \"Murder by Death\" of 1976 spoofed all the best known and great detectives of fiction. Some comedies right after the \"Police Squad\" series were about police (\"Police Academy\" of 1984 and sequels), but none were on the level of slapstick in \"The Naked Gun.\" Nor were any others as funny.So, this film was not so much a satire of police forces or police and crime films. It was instead a plain, but riotously funny slapstick film about a police officer and his equally wacky cohorts and sidekicks. The cast for the film is superb, with Leslie Nielsen and George Kennedy providing the bulk of humor. The film is obviously adult, although it's rated PG-13. It borders on the edge of crass and crude in a couple of instances.Nielsen's character, Frank Drebin, is so unique that he's a police sergeant detective lieutenant. A sergeant-lieutenant? That's an unheard-of rank in the annals of police forces and military. Drebin's scenario as an umpire in a professional baseball game must be one of the funniest sports scenes ever filmed in a movie.This is one very funny film that most adults should enjoy. It's probably not for people who don't have much of a sense of humor or who can't laugh at everyday things in life.",

You could almost spend the whole film just watching for celebrity cameos (the best of which is Reggie Jackson as a brainwashed assassin: \"must kill the queen\u0085.. must kill the queen.\" Some of the jokes don't work and quite a lot of them are just stupid puns, but the physical comedy is generally well done. Presley makes a surprisingly effective \"straight man\". The jokes keep rolling in fast enough that even the ones that miss don't slow down the fun.Just by coincidence I saw the movie recently after seeing the Zucker's \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" just a few days before. So I noticed that they actually re-used one device from that film here, the botched break-in (which occurs in KFM during the extended martial arts sequence) where Neilsen goes into Montalban's character's apartment and smashes just about everything in sight (eventually starting a fire) while supposedly trying to sneak around.Not a classic film in my opinion nor am I sure it ever will be, but it's well worth a few laughs if you're in the right mood.",

            "content": "I first watched 'The Naked Gun' on VHS when it was released at the tail end of the eighties. I was much younger then and appreciated - how would you call it - more 'juvenile' humour. Now, some thirty years later, I was almost scared to watch it again in case it didn't live up to how I remember. All I can say is that it's either as funny as it ever was, or my humour never actually grew up. I think it's probably both, seeing as I also like the 'Jackass' movies.You may never have heard of, or never bothered with, the TV show 'Police Squad.' It wasn't on telly for very long and I believe it got cancelled after only one series. However, that didn't stop the producers from effectively reusing the story (and even some of the jokes) for their feature length film, 'The Naked Gun.' It follows the exploits of Detective Frank Drebin (played to perfection by a totally deadpan Leslie Nielsen) as he is tasked with foiling an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth when she visits his home city of Los Angeles, proving his partner Nordberg (creepily played by O.J. Simpson, before he, er, fell from grace - so to speak) and generally falling in love with the new lady in his life, Jane (Priscilla Presley).Now, all that sounds quite a lot to fit into what is actually quite a standard length film (roughly ninety minutes) and yet every moment flies by simply because it never wastes any time by NOT putting jokes in. In short... the gags comes thick and fast. In fact, sometimes you've only just finished laughing at one joke when another comes along. They're that closely packed in.I guess the only person who wouldn't get some amusement out of this would be someone who really despises slapstick and slightly low-brow humour. Many of the jokes are visual and revolve around the 'bumbling' antics of the leading man as he tries to unravel the conspiracy surrounding Ricardo Montalban's evil plot. And, if you've only really seen Montalban as 'Khan' from 'Star Trek II' and think he can only play things seriously, it's a treat to see him do something a little lighter than trying to hound Kirk to the ends of the galaxy.There are few films that stand the test of time and, in a world of comedies where many of the laughs revolve around 'pop culture' references, i.e. making the subject matter only funny if you 'get' the reference and it stays relevant forever, it's nice to see a film that will always be daftly funny, no matter how many years pass by.",

            "content": "I have to hand it to the Zuckers and Abrahams. This is really funny, a send-up of every crime movie you've ever seen, something about a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Los Angeles. It borrows from every place. There's a scene lifted directly from Don Siegel's \"Telefon.\" Some of the first-person narration quotes Raymond Chandler: \"Her hair was the color of gold in old paintings.\" Most of the jokes are original, though, and half loony. Some don't work -- a car pulls into a parking space at the docks and knocks a screaming man into the water. Others are so outlandish as to be almost surreal.In the opening scene, Detective Nordberg (a depressing but still effective O. J. Simpson) creeps up, gun drawn, to a door behind which a dozen hoodlums are negotiating the purchase of a horde of dope. He takes a deep breath and kicks against the door. The door doesn't swing open. Instead, Simpson's foot crashes through the panel and he must extract it and fiddle with the knob. By the time he gets the door opens and announces that everyone is under arrest, the gang has their own guns loaded, cocked, and aimed at him. They shoot him six times. Instead of slumping to the deck, he caroms around the walls, shouting in pain when he bunks his head against some pipes, when he puts his hand on a red hot wood stove, when he leans against a wall of fresh paint, when a window slams down on his hand, when he steps into a bear trap, and so on.Simpson winds up in the hospital. While preparing to visit him, Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielson) asks how he's doing. Nielson's boss, George Kennedy, tells him solemnly, \"The doctors say he has a 50/50 chance of living, though there's only a ten percent chance of that.\" In other words, there is a ten percent chance that Simpson has a fifty percent chance of living. To put it more simply, that's 1/20 or p = .05. I'd be happy to clarify this further by using base-8 math but I don't know how.The doctors tending Simpson tell his wife, \"We think we can save your husband's arm. Where would you like it sent?\" I don't think I want to go any farther with the plot because it's really insignificant, just a frame to hang a lot of jokes on. And I don't want to give any more of the jokes away.Well, one more. The voices tell me to do it. Nielson makes a harrowing escape across the facade of a tall building, hanging on to decorative human figures as he goes, breaking off the penis of one of the male figures, before he crashes through a window and into the bedroom of a half-dressed shrieking woman, and dizzily brandishes the broken-off tool. The mayor charges him with \"searching without a warrant, breaking and entering, arson, and assault with a concrete dildo.\" You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of them. It's ribald and hilarious.",

To me, nothing can really top his performance in that one because he was so deadly serious while all this insane stuff was happening. He was rather good here to as Lt. Frank Drebin as this character does his stuff rather seriously too. Though he does get a bit more goofy with this role than the one in \"Airplane\". This movie sort of came about thanks to \"Police Squad\", a very short running television show that I loved when I was a kid. It was just so funny with all the puns and crazy situations. This film is not quite up there with the show, almost just not quite. It has the same energy for the most part, but I thought it fizzled a bit in places too. The story has Frank trying to uncover a plot to assassinate the Queen of England. His main suspect is a character played by Ricardo Montalban who is really good in this one too. Along the way Frank meets Jane Spencer played by Priscilla Presley and they have a very romantic day suffice to say. The jokes for the most part come at a fast pace, I did not really like the ending baseball game all that much though. It was funny, just not like the rest of the film though I did enjoy the villain's demise. A funny spoof, kind of nice seeing O.J. Simpson really taking the punishment in this one too.",

            "content": "Leslie Nielsen was a leading actor by the late 1950s. He bounced between television and the movies all the way up into the 1980s. It wasn't until he did a little comedy film, a spoof on air disaster movies, called Airplane (1980), that made his star rise even more. Two years later, he was cast as the bungling Detective, Frank Drebin, for a television, comedy, spoof, called Police Squad (1982). The same group that did Airplane (1980), also did this show. Today, these guys are legends. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, created a new sub-genre of film spoofs. A sub-genre that is still tested even today.Police Squad was a brilliant television show. It capitalized on the same comedy that made Airplane (1980), a modern classic in comedy. Unfortunately, it was canceled after just six episodes, because studio executives made bad decisions on why the show couldn't last. Fortunately, those same silly executives thought the show would look great up on the silver screen. It took, however, six years before Abrahams and the Zucker brothers could adapt the show for the motion pictures. It was worth the wait, because Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad (1988), was a huge hit and matched the critical greatness, that Airplane (1980), had garnished.This film opens up much like a Bond film. It has a prologue in the beginning that matches Drebin up against the international political bad guys of the 1980s. The film then rolls into the credits, like Bond, then starts up the main plotline. The film revolves around a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. A rich businessman, who owns part of the dock front, Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban), becomes the center of Frank's attention, when he suspects Ludwig of being involved in a heroin ring. This is based off of info obtained by one of his detectives, Nordberg (O. J. Simpson). Rounding out the cast is Frank's boss, Ed Hocken (the legendary George Kennedy) and the object of Frank's desire, Jane (Priscilla Presley).This film was a hit when it came out. It is hailed as one of the best comedies ever. The intelligent artistry used to create such ridiculous situations is totally evident in this film. The execution of the script and jokes, totally makes the film roll along for you. From the beginning to the end of the film, any part of it that wasn't funny, was still entertaining. Some of the comedy was ahead of its time, some of it was right on target and some of it was perfect for the 1980s. This is a treasure trove of acting greats, who sell this film and the comedy. A classic from the past, made 35 years ago, that still is great today.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

I love this flick to death and it is my number 1 comedy. Every time I watch this action comedy flick, I keep laughing. The film features fast-paced slapstick comedy, including many visual and verbal puns and gags. The first film of The Naked Gun is the best one of the trilogy ever made, it impossible not to laugh. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) is the feature film adaptation of the cult TV series Police Squad!. Leslie Nielsen reprises his role as the bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin. The film's cast included George Kennedy, O.J. Simpson, Priscilla Presley, and Ricardo Montalban. The film was written and directed by the same team who made the original Airplane! and two sequels would follow: The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear and The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. This film is funny as hell and it is a classic I love The Naked Gun to death! They don't make comedy's like this one anymore! I want to see a comedy like is this film today. Naked Guns are actually one of my favorite trilogy of all times, I love all three movies. They are just fun harmless movies to watch on Saturday or any day you want to see them. \"Yes. Well, when I see 5 weirdos dressed in togas stabbing a guy in the middle of the park in full view of 100 people, I shoot the bastards. That's *my* policy.\" Plot: Those screw-loose creators of Airplane have done it again in this police-show parody. Police Squad's own granite-jawed, rock-brained cop, Frank Drebin, bumbles across a mind-control scheme to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Priscilla Presley, O. J. Simpson, a stuffed beaver, two baseball teams and an odd assortment of others join the wacko goings-on and blow the laugh-o-meter to smithereens. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors and writers on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models and effects. Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams David Zucker from Airplane and Top Secret! they created a beautiful comedy of all time. This was the second film in the trilogy I saw it, The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear (1991) was the first movie I ever saw as a kid and it become my favorite film, that was before I saw this one. I love The Naked Gun 2 1/2 but this one Is my number one favorite comedy in the naked gun trilogy including genre of comedy's. This is a parody film that also combine element from Dirty Harry films. I remember watching Police Squad! as a kid I haven't seen all episodes and the show was canceled after six episodes and that was all. Someday I might going to re watch them, but still rather watch the feature film because it has so much humor in it. Specially the baseball game I am not American so I am not a baseball fab, but this film was made before Major League (1989)with Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen was made. I absolutely love the song I Love L.A. by Randy Newman. Leslie Nielsen as clumsy Frank Drebin was awesome and this was his best performance in a movie ever. You also have a lot of shootings, like Frank shoots on his car, when his own car try's to run him down he he. He chases a doctor who was hypnotized to kill Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) in the hospital you have a car chases. You have a fight scenes in the beginning of the movie which are fun, the film is very entertaining, fast paced and funny as hell. Ira Newborn did a perfect score for The Naked Gun theme. Director David Zucker did a wonderful job directing the film and the writers did a wonderful jobs. Overall I am given The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! a perfect 10 you have a beautiful cast a lot's of comedy and beautiful baseball game and a lot's of funny actions. I love this comedy flick to death. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! is a 1988 American comedy film. The film stars Leslie Nielsen as the bumbling police lieutenant Frank Drebin. The film also stars Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy, and O. J.

So how did \"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad\" get the ultimate movie rating from me? By being so ridiculously over-the-top hilarious that it moved me to tears from laughing so hard and literally knocked me off of the couch when I saw it the first time. I remember the first time that I watched \"The Naked Gun.\" I was home alone, it was on HBO, and I figured that it might be a funny movie to kill a night with. I was chuckling during the opening scene but what really got me going was the scene in which O.J. Simpson attempts a drug bust on a ship. I laughed uncontrollably from that point forward, at one point falling off my couch from laughter. The jokes are non-stop; there is not a single serious moment in this movie, and the gags are so rapid-fire that you don't notice the unfunny ones because you are too busy laughing at the next one. The whole movie is hilarious, but two scenes stand out as absolute classics to me: the ship scene with O.J. Simpson and the climactic baseball scene. I have seen the movie a dozen times and those two scenes still have me hysterical every time. A must-see film for anyone who likes slapstick humor or just has a sense of humor in general. Leslie Nielsen is superb. 10/10!",

They had a great deal of success in the process, proving their status as masters at this particular brand of parody. Leslie Nielsen was brought back on board to reprise his role of intrepid and none-too-bright police detective Lt. Frank Drebin.After Frank has beat up and embarrassed various international despots in a priceless opening scene, he returns to L.A. He is soon investigating the attempted killing of his colleague Nordberg (with O.J. Simpson inheriting the role from Peter Lupus). This leads him to a suave, rich businessman (Ricardo Montalban, well cast) who is putting into motion a plan to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.Have no fear: despite not being the brightest bulb in the drawer, Frank *does* take his job seriously, and can often succeed despite his buffoonery. Nielsen is just so damn great and deadpan as a man who is indeed one of the dumbest officers of the law since the days of Inspector Clouseau. He's surrounded by capable co-stars: Priscilla Presley as his pratfalling leading lady, George Kennedy as his superior Ed Hocken (inheriting *his* role from Alan North), the slick Mr. Montalban as the confident villain, Nancy Marchand from 'The Sopranos' as the mayor, and players from the TV series such as Ed Williams (as lab man Ted Olson) and \"Tiny\" Ron (as Al, the detective so tall his head won't fit in the frame). Add to that hilarious cameos by a couple of famous faces, and bits by character actors such as Lawrence Tierney, Joe Grifasi and Nicholas Worth, and you have a cast that's compulsively watchable.The Z.A.Z. boys showed that they still had what it took to create a winning spoof, after their previous classics \"Airplane!\" and \"Top Secret!\". They are actually able to sustain their material for a lively and engaging hour and a half, even though the pacing DOES admittedly slow down during the big baseball game finale. They come up with absolutely priceless lines of dialogue and memorable gags. In the tradition of spoofs, there are gags included that a viewer might miss on their first viewing. A sequence where Frank attempts to get the goods on Victor Ludwig is just ONE of the highlights. Making his debut as the sole director, David Zucker guides it all in style; the Z.A.Z. boys also wrote the script along with Pat Proft, another veteran of this kind of comedy.\"The Naked Gun\" is bright and irresistible right to the end, with yet another setback occurring for the eternally hard-luck Nordberg.Followed by two sequels.Eight out of 10.",

But I wouldn't call it a laugh riot since most of the humor is strictly of the pratfall kind and the double entendre lines in the script are pretty obvious.Not bad for this kind of flick, but never rises above pure slapstick with all of it being a strain on credibility.

The plot elements from an earlier Zucker spoof also starring Nielseon, Airplane!, are in this movie: calm and serious characters delivering outrageous comedic lines and action; slapstick comedy like Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) falling down a flight of stairs and bumping into walls and Drebin getting bit by a $25,000 lion-fish; on-site gags like fences with automatic spray-paint to target graffiti vandals, stun guns coming out of cuff links, and Nielson harassing a concrete statue; and absurd, inside jokes.I first watched this film when I was a little kid and remembered it as being one of the funniest movies I've seen at that time, recalling such scenes as Drebin sending Queen Elizabeth flying across a table and the automatic piano in villain Vincent Ludwig's (Ricardo Montalban) office.With all the jokes, one-liners and gags in abundance, you wouldn't want to treat this movie seriously.

Actually, I can't decide between this and \"Top Secret!\". However, I do believe it's funnier than \"Airplane!\" for one simple reason. The disaster parody insisted a little too much on the romantic subplot, without providing funny gags to carry them, it was all the more redundant that the two leads were actually the least interesting characters of the whole film.The obvious scene-stealer in \"Airplane!\" was Leslie Nielsen and it's only fitting that he finally got to star in a ZAZ film before becoming their mascot, reprising his role as lawman Frank Drebin from the short-lived cult-series \"Police Squad\" in 1982. And who better than the late-blooming gray-haired actor with his deadpan expression delivering the most hilarious lines, to embody the humor of parody movies, which are movies that pretend to be serious about totally over-the-top and zany situations. Leslie Nielsen portrays the character of Frank Drebin as a no-nonsense guy evolving in a totally bizarre and nonsensical world. He becomes eccentric despite himself, and that's the mistake most comedies make, by having characters acting crazy in the first place.And Frank Drebin becomes a naturally comic actor, where almost each line can stand as a one-liner. Take the hospital scene where he's supposed to comfort his friend's wife, his remembrance of his ex-wife, his monologue \u00e0 la Dirty Harry or Humphrey Bogart, Nielsen, with an extreme versatility, manages to fit every kind of humor, verbal and visual. And this film is real tribute to his talent, supported by no-less deserving cast, such as Nancy Marchand as the Mayor, his friend Ed Hocken played by George Kennedy and Priscilla Presley as the villain's pretty secretary falling in love with his 'funny face'. Speaking of falling, her entrance is the perfect ice-breaking moment to viewers who wanted to picture her as a glamour model. And in all that nonsense, Montalban does a great job as plays the typical suave and sinister villain.Now, is it necessary to sum up the whole plot? Let's just say that it's all about preventing the assassination of Queen Elizabeth, and that this plot only matters as a vehicle for non-stop gags, that take you from a (slightly) anti-Arab trip into Beirut to the usual staples of cop movies, starting with the unforgettable opening credits sequence, from the hilarious openina vertiginous impersonation of Harold Lloyd with the weirdest thing to hang on, a romantic montage to a climactic confrontation in a baseball stadium and a romantic declaration that make an Arab and a Jewish man have a hug, a gag that kind of redeems the opening scene. Of course, the final scene provokes a superb final sight gag that might console those who have a hard time watching OJ Simpson in such a feel-good film, but let's just accept it as the only element that dates the film..And \"The Naked Gun\" isn't just a funny film, it's a film that is so daring and so obsessed by its mission to make us laugh that no minute is wasted, each one of them is full of say, one or two gags, and the rest is only quick set-ups. This is not just a watchable but a rewatchable and a re-rewatchable film as the probability to miss some jokes will be high especially if you're busy laughing out loud from the previous gag. It's a movie that, no matter in which mood you appear to be, will put a big, big smile in your face and sometimes, there's no more explanation needed. But I have personal reasons to enjoy this film, more than another.I never really heard about the word \"parody\" until I was 11 and there was a TV special classic parodies, starting with \"The Naked Gun\". I didn't really get the difference between that and the usual comedy, not until that scene where poor Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) gets shot by a bunch of criminal, and then endures many other unfortunate accidents such as burning his hand on a stove, putting his arm on a wet paint door, his head falling on a wedding cake or his leg caught in a bear trap. Within a minute, I got the idea, and I remembered I had already seen a few movies with the same comedic zaniness like \"Spaceballs\" or \"Johnny Dangerously\". But if anything, it was \"The Naked Gun\" that introduced me to the parody genre.And till now, I can't believe that this film wasn't introduced in the American Film institute's Top 100 Comedies while other films like \"Fargo\", \"The Graduate\" or \"Big\" are there. That's a parody of listing, if I might say so.",

We finally hit rock bottom with \"Disaster Movie\" ranked as the worst film of all time by the IMDb. Were people just thinking this movie was a tough act to follow? There have been zero spoof movies since that would be considered truly great. If nothing else, we can at least look back at this once great style. I heard \"Sausage Party\" was technically a spoof, but it still wasn't on the same level as these old ones. Modern spoof movies just have the characters fart and poop all the time, but these ones actually made us laugh.It is kind of weird looking back and seeing OJ in a good movie role. Of course, he does get injured in this movie a lot. This film is great from the very first jokes. I think my favorite part would be when he says, \"Bingo!\" and finds a Bingo card. This is another movie you have to pay attention to in order to get all the laughs in. I just love how this film escalates in its zaniness. Even if you've seen a compilation of best parts like me, there's still more to love. The madness doesn't even end with the credits. There's this gag where they list every person by labeling them with their dialogue! It actually does make sense, in a really amusing way. The pop culture references are a lot more subtle than other films and it works much better that way.This is what comedy should be. The slapstick is wonderfully timed. Everything comes together so well in this. There's always jokes that build up to each other and best of all, it has a coherent story. They do work hard to make these jokes relevant as to what is going on, not just random interchangeable gags. Even better is that I actually really do care about the main characters in this. I wanted them to get out okay! For all the laughs, there was good emotion here too. I didn't even know this was based on a TV show. I have seen some clips of it and it seems great too! I think the directors eventually split over arguments which is why their films have declined, ending with the worst, \"Scary Movie V\". While there are still great comedies, we'll never be restored to this level of quality in spoofs right here. May this film and its spirit live on forever! ****",

(1980),\" and most recently carried forth by raunchy music industry satire \"Stadium Anthems (2018).\"Gags in \"The Naked Gun\" rain down at a torrid pace; some deceptively high-brown, but most gloriously inane.

By a nose, the vote here is \"yes.\" While \"Airplane!\" also features Nielsen as a doctor (arguably even more straight-faced than Frank Drebin), that film's central character was the adequate Robert Hays, whereas \"The Naked Gun\" gives us Nielsen as the prime purveyor of every last morsel of hilarity.

            "content": "The writing team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker became a famous success after \"Airplane!\" made nearly 24 times its budget. Although \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" exceeded its own 33 times, it was their second film that gripped the attention of the critics and the public alike. They parlayed its success into the six episode show \"Police Squad.\" After \"Top Secret!,\" they went back to their short-lived television show and made the first of three \"Naked Gun\" films. Bringing back the show's star Leslie Nielsen and their signature machine gun paced humor, they crafted their finest work.Why did I spend 100 words, giving the background to this movie? The answer is that there is not much else to say without spoiling the hilarious content. I grew up on Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, and the Three Stooges; the first two are legendary and the third has a fiercely loyal following to this day. It has been difficult ever since for a comedy to impress me. There are only two comedies I have given a vote of ten stars. \"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\" is even better than \"Spaceballs.\"Inept Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) of Police Squad returns from abroad to the news that his partner (O.J. Simpson, when he was still funny) has been shot. We see it happen in the first of many sequences where we think the joke is over and then see it go on and on using wildly out-of-place props. Meanwhile, Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban), one of the most respected citizens in Los Angeles, has concocted an elaborate scheme to assassinate the visiting Queen of England! Thankfully, Lt. Drebin's boss (Oscar winner George Kennedy) and the rest of Police Squad have been assigned to protect her. That means Drebin must cross horns with Ludwig to prevent international disaster from culminatingat a Major League Baseball game! I am a *huge* baseball fan, and the climax is the most sensationally funny scene I have ever watched. I even saw my hometown team, although Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker clearly had no idea how bad the Seattle Mariners were at the time. They do prove that you don't have to know baseball to make it into the Television Booth.From an acting standpoint, \"The Naked Gun\" is about as good as it gets. Comedy is an entirely different discipline than dramatic acting. That is why you hear about certain actors simply as \"comedians.\" Some critics and acting teachers believe comedy is harder. Nielsen is the king of treating outrageous scripts like they are \"The Ten Commandments.\" He has been in many bad comedies, but with the right script, few are better at making even the best jokes funnier than they already are.Also notable is Ricardo Montalban. He publicly mentioned that he took the part for money to buy a new Chrysler. I immediately thought of Sean Connery upon reading this. After \"Thunderball,\" Connery grew uninterested in playing James Bond, possibly from the strain of four films in four years plus the deplorable Japanese media's behavior during the shooting of \"You Only Live Twice.\" In both that film and the later \"Diamonds Are Forever,\" a role he only took for the cash, his boredom is unmasked in the two worst lead performances of the series.Such is not the case with Montalban. His facial expressions during the seventh inning stretch of the baseball game and his conversation with a terrorist whose name I would never wish on anybody look like they come from a man enjoying the part. The ability to keep external factors off the screen or stage is one of the fundamental cores of acting that has been lost on many talented thespians through the years. Montalban is not one of them. Other actors should take notice.",

Also on his plate is discovering what happened to his closest friend Nordberg(O.J Simpson, before he did you know what), who was shot at repeatedly on a drugs investigation. Drebin soon discovers there's a link between the visit and the attempt on Nordberg's life and sets about catching a would be assassin before they get to the Queen.From the same writers of the original \"Flying High\", there is some comedy gold in here. While some of it has aged, there's plenty of good stuff in there still.

            "content": "This is one of my favorite comedies of all time as well as parodies in the Parody subgenre of comedy. It's also another one of the best TV to movie adaptations as this film is a continuation of the show \"Police Squad\" which was a hit at the time but unfortunately had a short life span almost about the same as the TV show \"Firefly\". I honestly feel this is something most TV show should do when they don't get to go the distance, jump on another track to get there which this film did.The film is sort of an adolescent gem of mine as in my adolescence I began to explore more of the parody genre. And as a kid I have seen the TV show \"Police Squad\" which was one of my favorite comedy shows.When I saw they made a silver screen film based on that show it really blew me away, though once I rented out and saw the film I was just blown away. It was a real gut buster, I just laugh so hard watching this film that it almost hurts, that's something I rarely do for most comedy films, let alone not that many that can do that with me but thankfully this film is one of them and still is.This film is really a smoothie drink of parody as it parodies on the detective/cop shows of yesteryear, noir but also the James Bond franchise. I know that last one seems like a stretch but not as the film has some of the elements and format you would see on a Bond movie, from the very beginning, a scene with Frank goes to the crime lab and is introduced to gadgets, as well as the whole assassination plot, you name it for any Bond fan it's all there.The film is fully loaded with visual and verbal humor and hits the target on both counts. There is just so much that even on rewatch I can always find some more that might have flew by me making the film funnier than before. The dialog in the film is just hilarious, the characters have some colorful even deliciously bad lines but also some clever lines that can really catch you off guard, but what makes the dialog funny is the fact that everyone is just downright serious as if what their saying and what is going on is more or less the everyday norm.There are so many memorable scenes of hilarity, I'll just say a few of my favorites as talking about them can't do the comedy justice and I don't want to give too much away.The beginning which is to me one of the best openings in movies in general, it's always a great way to start off a film with a bang. It's a bit similar to the beginning of a Bond movie where we see a meeting held by an organization of evil much like Spectre from James Bond with some of the scummiest people in history all in one table and all up to no good as usual. This is obviously a set up for the plot of the film. But of course, in the end it results in one of my favorite battles of all time as well as the most hilarious as Frank just beats the crap out of everyone in the room, which is something most of us think of doing to scumbags all in the same room.There is a chase scene which is just hilarious and slightly thrilling with Frank being in the one car in the chase which is the last one you'd want to be in which is a Driving School car which let's just say gave the trainee driver one hell of a crash course. But what really made it even more hilarious was a death scene that could make Michael Bay envious.The final half with the Baseball game is just absolutely hilarious as not just is Frank trying to stop an assassination but also, he's lets just say making Baseball history.I really like the music which is sort of an old jazzy score which fits the film giving it an old-fashioned noir vibe to it. I really love the theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, just really gives you that empowering theme that the good guys are on the way to help. But also, it's one of my favorite intros as we see only the top perspective on an old squad car with the siren going and that car just seems to have a mind of it's own as it is just driving in some of the most random places let alone fit somehow, one place I like is where it parks at a doughnut shop with a dozen priced 1.99; yeah that would be a dream come true.The supporting characters and cast are solid from George Kennedy as Ed the chief who is really a solid straight man that just really helps in setting Frank straight though in the world of parody even he himself has his quarks. Ricardo Montalban whom is an honorable mention in favorite actors of mine, he's just great in the villain role as usual because it's Ricardo after all where he is suave and charismatic but also has that quiet sinisterness that simmers before it boils to the surface.But of course, what makes the film is Leslie Nelson himself one of my favorite comedic actors; this guy is practically the king of parody comedy as there's never been another since. Really love his performance because he just plays it straight from beginning to end which makes him and the film all the funnier. I really love the Frank Drebin character who is another of my honorable mention in fictional heroes.Frank is pretty much an old-fashioned cop from yesteryear but transported to our modern decade. This guy is so serious and tough that it's strange. He's really not that good at his job as he can be clumsy sometimes, a little rock headed both things inadvertently in his defense. Not quite with the times as he has sort of that attitude of a person from a different time. All these things would make him inefficient but despite the inefficiency he's does get the job done all the same if not smoothly.What make him endearing is that he how determined he is in completing his mission and just his overall never-ending crusade in fighting crime. Despite how tough things get for him (some of that inadvertently caused by himself) he keeps with it all the same. He's always does what's right no matter what and however he can because there really is no other way or any time to find a better way because it doesn't always exist, he just simply acts which makes him all the more effective in saving the day. I like also that he's a person that has some little quirks and a warmth to him, which makes him a guy you would like to be friends with though you probably want to keep your valuables away from him.This is a comedy classic that's full loaded with hilarity.Rating: 4 stars.",

            "content": "Yes this is the one that kicked off that trio of infectious comedy slapstick. I actually like The Naked Gun's better than the Flying High's, only this time the brilliant Nielsen is at the helm, where he belongs. Lets face it, any film, that starts in Beirut is interesting. The great criminal here is Fantasy Island's Montalban, who has diabolic plans, ones that include brainwashing, which will aid him in assassinating the queen, where the queen really looks like the queen in this one. His captain is played by George Kennedy and like Nielsen, with being all so serious, he's created a likable character, where O.J. Simpson (yes, that's the one) plays his partner, to adequate ability (his only acting nomination is a bad one) more of a player than actor, you could say. Like the Flying High's the laughs keep coming, but here, it's at a more accelerated rate. Montage's have never been funnier, than the one you'll see here, especially, if you take pokes at Stone's Platoon, though that's kind of in bad taste. Taking pokes at Rambo would of been funnier. And this is the one, where Nielsen his eyes on the luscious Presley (God, if Elvis could see her now). She's sexy and really impresses with her character, Simpson an almost useless asset in these ones. Of course, there are those stupid moments, but that's expected in in slapstick. The brainwashing bits here, were the ones that didn't wash off. This really came at a time, we needn't something like this. It's slapstick, but it's original, smart, and fresh and garners laughs at a rate, that may'be even too quick. Excellent 89' slapstick comedy, never forgotten, and never watched once. Spawned two equally funny sequels.",

As Drebin's investigations continue he begins to suspect that respected industrialist Vincent Ludwig is connected to the plot and, against his superior's wishes he undertakes a lone crusade in order to prove his point.This is the best of the naked gun films and Leslie Neilsen's delivery is free from the over the top looks that so mark out his later turns in the role of Drebin, and the script unlike, the second film contains fewer references from the Police Squad series, with many good gags and memorable moments. As such this makes for an entertaining slice of hokum that leaves one with a smile of your face when you stop watching it.While it's not as good as the immense \"Airplane\" it is still worthy of a watch and very entertaining.",

Along the way he must also act as security for the Queen of England who is making a visit, which allows for more hilarious antics from one of the most funny actors in Hollywood.Nielsen is supported by a great cast including Priscilla Presley as his love interest Jane Spencer (the scene where they have \"safe sex\" is perhaps one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in a movie), Ricardo Montalban as the villainous Vincent Ludwig, George Kennedy as Drebin's kind-hearted superior Captain Ed Hocken, and Nancy Marchand who is terrific as the dismissive Mayor Barkley.\"The Naked Gun\" is not just a straight-comedy, there are literally countless spoofs littered throughout the film, as well as plenty of remarks on society. Aside from the \"safe sex\" scene other highly amusing scenes include Drebin and a learner driver, O.J. Simpsons blundered attack on some crooks, and Drebin destroying a valuable collection of artwork and statues.The main problem with the film though is that it seems to have aged. Several of the social context related jokes and themes seem lost in today's society, but were no doubt effective in their time. Being only 4 years old when the film was originally released it is a bit hard to remember though. Overall, an entertaining and enjoyable film.",

The aim of the film was obviously to draw laughter and all three Naked Guns achieve that with ease. Nielsen does a superb job. It's nothing new that he's a master in his craft when it comes to comedy and he's at his best here. Priscilla does a good enough job of matching wits.

It isn't long before Frank learns that Ludwig is involved in a plot to assassinate the Queen but unfortunately burns the evidence.Anybody hoping for a gritty drama will be sorely disappointed; this film features a series of gags that don't stop from start to finish. In fact the jokes come so thick and fast that if one gag doesn't work the next one will follow seconds later. The jokes are delightfully silly. Leslie Nielsen does a great job as Lt. Drebin; managing to keep a straight face in a variety of ridiculous situations. Ricardo Montalban impresses as the villain Ludwig and Priscilla Presley puts in a fun performance as love interest Jane. It is hard to pick out highlights as it is all pretty funny; I did particularly enjoy OJ Simpson's early scene where Nordberg confronts Ludwig's men, the scene where Frank ends up on top of the Queen and the final baseball game.

Basically Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is the clumsy and not all intelligent police detective working in the division of Los Angeles Police Department. When his colleague and best friend Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) is shot and recovering in hospital, the underground investigation leads him to suspect businessman Vincent Ludwig (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan's Ricardo Montalban) is up to something. He is planning to brainwash someone to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II (Jeannette Charles) visiting the United States, and he gets his personal assistant Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) to distract him from the case. Eventually, after many stupid mishaps and embarrassing accidents, Frank comes to the conclusion that the assassination attempt will take place at a major league baseball game the Queen will be attending. In the end, Frank stops the brainwashed player, Ludwig gets what he deserves, and Jane admits that she loves him for real, all just in time for Nordberg arriving fully recovered. Also starring George Kennedy as Ed Hocken, Nancy Marchand as Mayor, Raye Birk as Pahpshmir, Susan Beaubian as Mrs. Nordberg, Ed Williams as Ted Olsen, 'Weird Al' Yankovic as 'Weird Al' and Lawrence Tierney as Angels Manager. Nielsen is fantastic as the bumbling spy who says and does the stupidest things, but you can't help but love him, from the opening police siren with catchy theme music and onwards, the scripting is witty, and the slapstick, sight and gross out gags are hilarious, it certainly deserves it place in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a superb comedy. Detective Frank Drebin was number 47 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and the film was number 14 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Outstanding!",

The poster alone will let you know exactly what you are in for, and this first movie of the Naked Gun Series doesn't disappoint.Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) of Police Squad as been called in to investigate an attempt on his partner's life, and what he stumbles into is a conspiracy to assassinate Queen Elizabeth, who is touring America.

Frank gets into hot water with the mayor, so he must beat the clock to foil the assassination attempt, win the girl, and secure his place back on the police force.I think part of what made this movie such a hit with me was that I went in blind, not really knowing what I was in for. There was no built up anticipation or hopes, just a young couple going to watch a funny movie. It is your classic inept detective comedy in the vein of other classics such as the Pink Panther and the Police Academy movies, and others that would follow like \"Who's Harry Crumb?\" and \"The Other Guys\". The blue print works as long as the movie and the acting is done well, and \"The Naked Gun\" certainly did that.I highly recommend this film to any comedy enthusiast. If you haven't seen this one yet, I know you would enjoy it. The cast does feature O.J. Simpson before his trial, but if that doesn't bother you, then you should give it a go. This is a classic now, and all these years later, I will still watch it from time to time and laugh just as much as the first time I saw it. 8 stars out of 10.",

Worse is to follow though when Drebin discovers that the man responsible for the shooting is also planning on assassinating Queen Elizabeth 2 and sets to work foiling the mad man's plans in his own unique way...Sometimes even when films are made a long time ago they can still produce the laughs and the original Naked Gun film is one such example; it arguably uses the easiest approach to gain laughs (slapsticks and pratfalls) much like we used to see in the Pink Panther films, but it is mostly used to very good effect here and I have to admit that even after all these years I still found the film very very funny.One thing that I think has always made this film work so well is Leslie Nielsen; his dead-pan comic style and complete lack of awareness of all of the chaos that he is causing along the way is actually one of the things that makes what you see so funny. There's a sort of endearing innocence to Drebin (whereby the good intention is always there, but his approach leaves a lot to be desired).The plot is vague and only basically outlined, but in all honesty who really watches spoof or parody films for the plots. If you're just looking for laughs then this film has them in abundance - I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the film, but trust me there are plenty on offer.This is Leslie Nielsen's film all the way and he really steals the show here; the likes of George Kennedy, Priscilla Presley & Ricardo Montalban are good in support, but they don't hold a candle to Nielsen. OJ Simpson didn't have much screen time in this one which wasn't much of an issue for me as I always felt that acting was never really his forte.In these grim times - particularly in the UK where we're still in our 3rd COVID-19 lockdown :-( The Naked Gun is a nice piece of escapist fun that is still capable of bringing the laughs after all these years.",

Perfect example: Raymond Chandler fans will get a kick out of the reference to \"Farewell, My Lovely\". Upon his first meeting with Priscilla Presley's character, Leslie Nielsen (as Lt. Frank Drebin) notes in the voice-over, \"She was giving me a look I could feel in my hip pocket.\" This line is lifted directly from Chandler's novel, but it's so subtle and fits into the film so well that viewers who know nothing of Chandler won't feel left out. This, along with Nielsen's lovably goofy performance, is what separates the work of the Zucker brothers from knockoffs like \"Loaded Weapon\". Sure, you've seen \"The Naked Gun\" already...but see it again and you'll pick up on things you didn't notice the first time. (Single best moment of the film: O.J.

            "content": "Due to Leslie Nielson's tragic and untimely death, I decided to visit one of his many films I haven't had the pleasure of seeing. I saw Airplane many years ago, I saw Scary Movie 3 and 4 in the theaters, and saw Creepshow last fall. I didn't however see Nielsen's parody films which made him famous like The Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard. So I finally put one on to watch what I had missed...22 years later.It's true you don't know what you have until it's gone, and you appreciate it/them more when they're gone. I knew who Corey Haim was before he died and saw License to Drive a couple months before his death, but became somewhat obsessed with him when he died. Same thing applies with Michael Jackson, Greg Giraldo, and a number of others. Leslie Nielsen may be a victim to my awkward obsession. After watching this gem, he very well could be. If that's a good thing.Leslie plays Frank Drebbin a policy officer who likes to think he is doing a good job, when really, he doesn't know what he is doing, and when he tries to do something good, he gets himself and others hurt. Drebbin now has to protect Queen Elizabeth II from being assassinated at a California Angels baseball game during the seventh inning stretch. Although the plot sounds very serious, it delivers an uncountable number of laughs in the process.Going into this, aware of it being a parody/spoof film, I was nothing but skeptical. A parody film? Hasn't that genre been beaten, trashed, abused, and spat on by the duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? But in the eighties and nineties, David Zucker knew how to be funny and original simultaneously. Rather than cramming over thirty pop culture characters/references that, most of the time, lack a purpose or dimension, Zucker took in a cop that wanted to do the right thing but unknowingly made matters either unclear or even worse than they already were.The goal for a parody film is to make it play like a regular film. It's supposed to feel like an actual film, but it should poke fun at all of the movie clich\u00e9s (i.e. comforting wife when husband was in ER). One cop would never bring up the worst possible outcomes that could happen to the wife when her husband is in the hospital bed near death. So in a nutshell, when constructing a parody film, don't focus on setting a record for the most pop culture characters utilized in an eighty minute film. Make it like a real film and just poke fun at common clich\u00e9s.The Naked Gun is definitely a winner, and probably takes the cake for my favorite parody film. Leslie Nielsen's acting was memorable as well my first time seeing O.J. Simpson acting in anything. I never thought I'd say or type this but, we have a great parody film on our hands.Starring: Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley, Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n, George Kennedy, O. J. Simpson, and Nancy Marchand. Directed by: David Zucker.",

Frank: No, the worst.This review would be increased tenfold if I was to lay out (okay, fine, copy) all the fantastic quotes, but this is a great example of what you're getting yourself into. If you like the above, you'll love the rest of the movie.And if you have seen this movie, and it's been awhile, like for me, watch it again. I practically had it memorized from seeing it probably two dozen times as a kid, and still, I was cracking up and enjoyed every last scene. Yeah, even with OJ Simpson as one of the leads.Side Note: As much as I love pure slapstick \u2013 not the crappy Vampires Suck and Disaster Movies of today - my only (SLIGHT) complaint is when they look at the camera to indicate even they think this is crazy. They do it a little too much in this movie \u2013 but not enough to downgrade the movie. Yes, my favorite comedy of all time, Airplane!, barely did it once or twice \u2013 but for 99% of that movie, it was a perfectly insane world.",

The problem with these types of movies is that once the initial novelty wears off, the movie runs out of ideas, leaving the last half of the movie quite lame. Naked Gun doesn't have this problem. It stays original, unpredictable and funny right until the end. It also knows when to end.Great performance by Leslie Nielsen in the lead role. Can't think of too many other comedians or actors who could have pulled off the role. George Kennedy is solid as the straight man to Nielsen's clown.Probably the movie that started the run of spoof genre movies of the late-80s/early-90s.

            "content": "From the goofs that created Airplane! and Rat Race (David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker), here comes The Naked Gun, based on their short-lived TV series (Police Squad!).Leslie Nielsen is dunderheaded Lieutenant Frank Drebin, who is part of L.A.'s Police Squad. He's been their for awhile, but isn't the sanest person in the sanitarium. When the Police Squad is called on to protect the Queen of England on her visit to America, Frank is the main man. Along the way, he meets someone who may be in a plot to assassinate her.This may look like a plotless comedy, and it somewhat is. Just like Airplane!, it manages to have lots of sketches while still in the plot (unlike Austin Powers, for instance). Like the scene in Ludwig's office when Frank, let's say, changes it's decor. Nielsen is like his other films-the type of character who doesn't think he's funny but he is. Some jokes are tasteless (like the statues), but some are full of taste. Well, now that I think about it, there weren't many tastefull jokes, but The Naked Gun still made me laugh.There weren't as many funny parts as Airplane! (which was one huge laugh), but some scenes were side-splitting. The ending momentum slowed down some at the baseball game finale, and his checking the players got old after awhile. It was just in to stretch the running time to 85 minutes (which was a perfect length, by the way). Besides what I did, there's not much more to say about it except it's really funny and recommended.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for sex-related humor.",

He takes everything completely seriously but manages to make fun of himself in the process somehow anyway. It's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.Ever since \"The Naked Gun\" was released in 1988, it's been one of those movies I watch every once in a while when I just want some mindless entertainment or when there's nothing else on, and it never fails to disappoint.

That's not to say the bigger gags, such as the part where Detective Nordberg is shot or the thing with the fish don't work, but it's the film's attention to detail that is most definitely it's main asset.The Naked Gun opens with an utterly hilarious sequence which sees a police siren, obviously atop of a police car parade through all sorts of areas that it isn't supposed to, all done to a backdrop of very farcical music. From this point on, you know you're going to be in for a lot of silliness, and if it's silliness you want, The Naked Gun is definitely your film. The plot of the movie is largely irrelevant, and serves only as a means to spoof several clich\u00e9s of the police thriller genre; which is all the plot should serve as in a gag based comedy such as this.Leslie Nielson is the perfect man for this sort of film, as he has proved over and over; even when he's stood doing nothing he looks silly; he has a look that is made for comedy, and this is his finest hour. This movie is also the finest hour for the ZAZ team; unlike with the messy and largely unfunny \"Airplane!\", they've managed to get almost everything spot on here. The jokes are funny; for every one that doesn't work, there's twenty that do, the lead man is on top form and the situation is silly enough to provide lots of room for gags, and that room is filled as far as is possible.If you're more a fan of intelligent comedy, then I recommend checking out The Naked Gun anyway because I very much doubt that anyone can sit through this movie without laughing. Forget \"Airplane!\", THIS is the finest ZAZ comedy.",

This opened the door to them for other projects. So, to the small screen of Television Land they did travel.Utilizing the same type of \"tongue in cheek\", verbal punning and sight gag loaded spoofing humor as AIRPLANE, they chose to launch a double barreled assault on the Cop Show. The result was POLICE SQUAD!(1982).The series produced a grand total of six(6) measly episodes, but what a six episodes they were. Each was a little gem on its own, and would have worked well as those \"old time\" 2 Reelers Comedies once so popular at the theatre, featuring the likes of Laurel & Hardy, The Three Stooges, Edgar Kennedy, 'Joe McDoakes', Pete Smith, etc.Well, some joker with a position as an Executive at the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) TV Network pronounced the series as a candidate for the 'old Axe' because \".....you have to pay too much attention to the episodes on your TV.\", or some such dribble.So away went \"POLICE SQUAD\" with Captain/Lieutennant/Sergeant Frank Drebbin(Leslie Nielsen), ne'er to be heard from again. WRONG! In 1988, the concept with Leslie Nielsen starring rose again as THE NAKED GUN: From The Files of Police Squad!( Paramount, 1988). It was a feature film, one that required viewing at a movie house and paying an admission. Well, with 2 sequels following, it's kinda obvious that it was successful, where it counts, with the public!* The story opens up with a scene of a big meeting of America's Enemies. Among those being portrayed are Castro, Khadaffi, Arafatt, Idi Amin, the Ayatola Khomani and others. Their meeting being broken up by the sudden appearance of Frank Drebbin, on special Government assignment.Back home in L.A., he is met at the Airport by his boss, Captain Ed Hocken(George Kennedy)who informs him of the coming visit of State by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II to Los Angeles. A visit complicated by the Underground Operations by Some Murderous Gang of Drug Smugglers. The city Fathers are concerned over some Murders connected to them. Also, Detective Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) lies close to death in Hospital after attempting to infiltrate the Mob.The plot takes us on a merry chase, all 'round L.A., before winding up at the California Angels' \"Big A\" Ball Park in Aneheim.Without getting into particulars, let's just say that this is the Crown Jewels of the whole picture. We are treated to a succession of super gags, each as good or better than the last. The back-drop of a Baseball Game between the Angels and the Seattle Mariners provides the opportunity for Leslie Nielasen to perform a true Tour-de-Force of Comedic Performance that will remain unmatched for many a year!

They're consistently amusing and, pretty much, interchangeable. If you like one, you'll like 'em all. Priscilla was one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet in her prime and looks great in these films. The first two were hugely successful at the box office; the third one didn't do bad, but nowhere near as good. Whether or not you prefer one to another depends on the story and guest stars. In my opinion, this first one is easily the best simply because it's more consistently amusing and often laugh-out-loud funny, which explains my high grade.As for the two sequels go, I slightly prefer part 3, but all three come in handy when you want to turn off your brain and enjoy something silly.The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and San Diego.GRADE: A-",

The only real difference between this and 1980's \"Airplane!\" is that Lesley Nielsen takes command of this film as opposed to an all-cast effort.Nobody must be able to keep a straighter face than Nielsen. As Lt. Frank Drebin, the things he must do and say while remaining ignorant to their comedic value are absurd in quantity and quality. Drebin is when James Bond meets Inspector Clouseau -- he's completely oblivious yet he knows exactly what he's doing. As contradictory as that sounds, it's completely true. Nielsen does both incredible deadpan and slapstick, a highly specialized skill for a comedian, and unfortunately for the rest Nielsen's career, that's all he has. Nevertheless, it's perfect for \"The Naked Gun.\"Unlike \"Airplane!\", this film has to be a bit more plot-focused because the cop/detective genre necessitates it. \"Airplane!\" could descend into utter chaos, whereas \"The Naked Gun\" feels obligated to make sense in some regard. All you need to know is that O.J Simpson's character got shot and the investigation leads to the uncovering of a possible assassination attempt on the life of Queen Elizabeth II. The challenge for the viewer is to forget making sense of what's going on and pay attention to the small details that make these films even funnier. In some scenes this is easier than others and for the most part, the easier it is, the better \"The Naked Gun\" gets.A lot of the times these are the laughs that make you smile inside instead of laughing out loud, but especially toward the end when the humor becomes more slapstick, \"The Naked Gun\" really takes off ... pardon the \"Airplane!\" lingo.

Leslie Nielsen is Frank Drebin, the incompetent cop trying to thwart the assassination of the Queen, who's on a state visit to L.A. Ricardo Montalbian - a leading man for Esther Williams in his early days - is the crimelord, while George Kennedy plays Nielsen's sidekick. We begin with a particularly unfunny fight scene, but the film soon gets into its stride via a hilarious credits sequence and O.J. Simpson's slapstick dunking, before reaching a peak around the midway point, with Nielsen's dressing down by the mayor, the dockyard shoot-out (\"I can't hear you! Don't fire the gun while you're talking!\") and the banquet stop-and-search. The film draws on slapstick, satire and spoofery to similarly variable ends, aided by a cast that's ever-game, if only as good as the material.

The plot can be whatever it wants to be. This movie is about sticking as many slapstick set-pieces as humanly possible in every single frame and every single moment. It's live-action Looney Tunes.But still, what is it about? Well, it's about the incompetent and delusional police Detective Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) who must foil an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Take a time to absorb the last half of that sentence and get used to it. Sudden escalations are this movie's bread and butter. They also add up to making this one of the funniest movies ever made. And it should be, considering how much it defies any notion of continuity or just plain sense! The humor is everywhere--both up front and center represented by Debrin's cartoon-level ridiculous misadventures and in the background hidden as easy to miss Easter eggs. I am sure that on my only viewing of this I've missed some things.Timing is everything when it comes to comedy, but director David Zucker--who also contributed to the writing--takes his fellow writers Jim Abrams and Jerry Zucker and refurbish their \"Police Squad\" television series into sustained humor. Every bit of it is as ridiculous as it is funny. Take the scene in which Drebin forgets to apply the hand-brake to his car which then starts running off on its own and literally blows up. Such incompetence would have him kicked off from the force, but here, it's treated like it's not out of the ordinary and the show goes on. The pace is relentless, its supposedly serious noir, only being present because stuff happens to go on at night sometimes and its dialogue punchy, unforgiving with a generous quantity of dry but smart PG-13 humor.Yet with comedy putting itself on the pedestal of political responsibility, there is a genuine question of social innuendos and commentary. I am delighted to say there is none. While at first I found the way the movie it's bullying the Queen a supposed joke brought on by the opposing political views of the US and its UK buddy with which it has well-known history, the ending took place at a baseball game--a religion in the US, and it was as cruel to it as it was to the Queen itself. This is Zucker making it clear that the movie will harass anything for fun, including numerous terrorist leaders/organizations--pure comedy.",

            "content": "\"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\" tells the story of a very motivated, yet very chaotic inspector at the police forces, who is hired to take care of the Queen's safety during her visit in the United States while having to battle a gangster boss whose aim it is to turn innocent people into cold-blooded killers.The movie is in many parts a great parody of the countless police action movies that have been around and inspired similar modern approaches such as \"Austin Powers\" or \"Johnny English\". I have to admit that, though I'm normally not a big fan of slapstick, many of the gags are presented very clever and show a very decent humor instead of just going for the easy laughs. Nontheless the plot remains nonsense of course and thus you shouldn't expect a great movie in terms of tension or story. On the other hand, those parts are clearly not in the focus of this title and so I think we can all live with this fact.All in all this is a great parody that still convinces with clever humor even decades after its production. It is, however, not a great film in itself and so I'll give it a medium rating but still advise to give it a try.",

Frank Drebin of Police Squad a special division of the police force. He bumbles his way through investigations in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Peter Sellers' Inspector Dreyfus.This movie is actually a continuation of the show Police Squad! They kept much of the same cast but made it a little more mainstream. Give this movie a watch and then if you liked that, find a copy of Police Squad! and watch that too.",

They just come so fast you have to watch carefully to keep up with it. What gets me is that for the first thirty years of his career Leslie Nielsen was a dramatic actor.

Or maybe it's just my sense of humor, or the the fabulous acting of Leslie Nielsen, I laugh every time when I watch it.Leslie Nielsen plays Drebin, a detective, who spills out hard boiled inner dialogue and keeps his stone cut expression no matter what. He fights crime to the last. And with Drebin the crime wont last: it churns up into a chaos. Priscilla Presly is Jane Specner, a secretary of Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) the bad guy of the film. Jane also is the la fem fetal whom Drebin falls head over heels. There is a plot about assassination of Queen Elizabeht II, but as this type of comedy works, the over all plot is pretty meaningless. And that's okay, at least for me: It's the humor that counts in this type of movies.David Zukcer has managed to milk everything from the movie, it is as funny as it could be. I can't see any way to improved the film, it has gags for everyone, be them fast sight gags or verbal juggling, or even slap stick comedy. The bests scenes are, when someone is doing something seemingly important while Drebin or some else goofs up in the background, leading up in sheer stupidity and situations so absurd, that you just cannot help but to laugh",

Fresh from the days of Police Squad!, Leslie Nielsen stars in this film about a cop named Frank Drebin getting clues about something with the Queen... in a humorous way! However all of this leads up to some antics at a baseball game. His poor friend Nordberg got into an accident, causing him to be injured throughout the film. Leslie Nielsen, outside of Airplane!, is at his gold here. He handles each and every scene oh so well. There was hardly a moment when he made a joke that I didn't laugh at it. And him being a white haired gentlemen that was getting elderly made it even more hilarious. Unfortunately the Queen doesn't play the Queen here. Instead it's Jeannette Charles, who does do a rather good act of her. I loved how she was so stuffy throughout the entire movie, politely waving and being highly disgusted by mild things. Perhaps one of the funniest moments in the entire flick was when Frank ended up taking the role of Enrico Pallazzo and started singing the National Anthem in a grating tone and incorrect lyrics. That scene was absolutely hilarious! But not nearly as hilarious as when the woman was trying to make a speech, and after Frank drank some cups of water he left his microphone on making his peeing audible during the entire thing. All in all, I must say that this was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves comedy movies such as this!",

You must see this sort of bizarre non-sense to believe it! When Police Sergeant Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nielsen) first appeared on American TV screens back in about 1980, we weren't quite ready for the humor that came \"without a cuing laugh track\". A few years later \"The Naked Gun\" gave us another chance. This time it \"took\"! The one-liners and come backs in this film are hilarious, as the clumsy Drebin \"always gets his man\". Pricilla Presley is wonderful as the \"agent for the enemy\" who soon becomes Drebin's love interest.The scenes where fellow police officer Nuremberg (played by O.J.

It is mainly a spoof of detective movies from the 50s, what with the confident detective who narrates and speaks in the macho tone. Unfortunately, this detective is so clueless that everything he does is a major screw up. The humour in this movie isn't really intelligent humour. It's stupid humour that is so ridiculous it's funny. I can't really think of much else to say besides this movie is hilarious. It features one of my favourite kinds of humour, and that's word gags. Most of the jokes come from the way people speak to each other rather than visually.Leslie Nielsen is a great comedian, and this movie is no exception.

An unlikely revival of a short-lived TV series that's pure slapstick 101; goofball comedy in its most condensed form, with equal parts love and scorn for the long line of self-serious detective shows it shamelessly lampoons. Like the Zucker brothers' previous comic jam, Airplane!, this is largely an excuse to spill jokes, gags and puns at an incredible pace, with zany antics and wacky laughs piled so high that I'm impressed they found room for a story in-between. Granted, it's not much of a story - the nonsensical villainous plot involves mind-control bracelets and the Queen of England - but it's enough to connect the dots, to feed the writers with fresh material for new riffs and keep the whole production from growing stale.Leslie Nielsen appears in his best-remembered role, standing tall as the hard-boiled, yet totally brainless, police detective Frank Drebin. Not necessarily the first stop in his transition from dramatic roles, but certainly the moment where the dam broke and he slid into full-time, high-profile comedies. He's the anchor that holds the whole rocking boat in place, a real pro at maintaining straight faces in the most trying of circumstances. The supporting players are less consistent: Priscilla Presley sure wasn't hired for her acting, and it's awkward seeing OJ Simpson in a sympathetic light (though, at the time, it was a good casting), but George Kennedy is excellent as Frank's long-suffering partner and Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n clearly relishes the chance to get slummy and slimy with a loose villainous role.Bottom line, The Naked Gun doesn't aim to be more than a silly, light flood of themed punchlines, and it nails that bullseye. Repeatedly. Not every swing is a smash hit, but the sheer volume of material ensures a side-splitter or two in most scenes, with a few achieving near-legendary status.

And the primary reason was the inconsistencies that were seemingly prominent in its writing.Whilst Zucker Brothers' Airplane had me uproariously cracking up throughout its runtime, The Naked Gun failed to maintain its laughter ride for the entirety. The first half is good, it served me enough in terms of comedy and dumb, stupid entertainment; but right after the romantic interest was given an introduction the element of fun came to a standstill.Do not get me wrong, I am not suggesting that was completely unnecessary, even Airplane earlier had a romantic reconciliation to exhibit but that somewhat seemed pertinent, it had a direct bearing on the outcome of the narrative whereas here in this case it felt nothing but a trivial addition of inconsequentiality.Anyways, Leslie Nielsen was fantastic and I cannot wait to see more of him.",

Oscar-Winner:George Kennedy appears in a supporting role as Ed Hocken from the Police Squad.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an digitally remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an entertaining commentary track by David Zucker, Producer:Robert K. Weiss (The Blues Brothers, Dragnet, Tommy Boy) and Host:Peter Tilden. DVD also includes the original theatrical trailer. \"The Naked Gun:From the Files of Police Squad!\" is one of the most memorable spoofs ever made and it was certainly one of the funniest comedies made in the 1980's.

I found it as hilarious as ever, like most of the Zucker and/or Abrams schtick.People who hated Airplane or deplored the Marx Brothers will hate this one (and its sequels), too. Those who enjoy a good satire of the traditional formula police story, as well as some nifty sight gags and puns, will love it.Leslie Nielson was born for the role of Frank Dreben. Viewers who may have grown tired of his straight-faced hijinx, which has grown into a chiche after three NG movies, Airplane, the short-lived (but awesome) Police Squad TV show and numerous commercials, should be reminded just how funny the man was when the schtick was new.George Kennedy is a perfect foil for Nielson, as Allen North was in the TV series. Priscilla Presley is solid as the love interest. The movie might be even better without the long romance segments. The Zucker/Abrams crew, though, is no doubt making just such a point about the police/detective shows and movies they are spoofing. I did get a kick out of the fun day montage, showing them walking out of a theatre, laughing heartily, then the camera pulling back & showing that they had just watched \"Platoon.\"So many gags are really enjoyable. Nielson and Kennedy searching the distinguished couple at the queen's reception is priceless. With Kennedy behind the man, Nielson frisks him, then reaches for his pockets. Instead, he reaches too far & pulls Kennedy's gun out of HIS pocket. Convinced they have a hot one, Nielson sticks another hand in the man's pocket (so he thinks; actually it's Kennedy's pocket again) and pulls out Kennedy's wallet. One expects them to accuse the man of impersonating a police officer. Instead Nielson gasps \"Ed, he's got a picture of your wife in his wallet!\" after which the normally reserved Kennedy promptly belts the poor man in the mouth!Of course Ricardo Montalban was great in virtually everything he did and is outstanding as the villainous Vincent Ludwig The entire cast is strong and the baseball game is truly memorable. Dreben impersonating an international opera star and the home plate umpire are classics. I also loved the fake footage being seen on the `Angel Vision,' including a player run over by a car in the infield and a baserunner attacked by a lion at second base, followed by Mel Allen's patented `How ABOUT that!' lolThe move is at least as good as I remembered it being. Rent it or buy it - and, by all means, find a copy of the six `Police Squad' TV episodes! They're hilarious, too!",

Still, there was enough low-brow and physical comedy to crack me up, and it was one of my early favorite movies. And while I've outgrown a lot of stuff I liked at that age, I can still watch The Naked Gun and laugh, and I even get the jokes that went way over my head as a young'un.The film, subtitled From The Files of Police Squad!, couldn't be simpler, and that's the way they want it.  Lt. Frank Drebin has to to clear the name of his partner Norberg (The now ironic OJ Simpson) while protecting the life of Queen Elisabeth, in Los Angeles on a tour of America.  For ninety minutes, the movie exploits, and frequently ignores, the plot in the name of jokes.  Just plain and simple, this movie is out to make you laugh, and it will sink to any depth to get there.  Everyone has their favorite Naked Gun moment; mine has to be Leslie Nielsen performing the worst rendition of the Star Spangled Banner in history.  His fireside monologue about a lost love who played the harp is priceless as well.Kudos also to Ricardo Montalban's  performance as real estate tycoon Vincent Ludwig.  So ridiculous is his accent and accentuations that he makes even straight lines funny.  I'll never get tired of him saying to a frightened Priscilla Presley, \"It was easy my dear!  You forget I spent two years as a building contractor!\"  Stupidty at its funniest.This is not a classic, and it didn't change the face of comedy (It is after all, a simple application of the \"Airplane!\" formula to cop movies), but The Naked Gun is funny, and it never loses its charm no matter how many times you watch it.",

However, knowing that \"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\" was a lot more popular (as I'm sure you can tell by comparing the IMDb ratings), I watched it with relatively high expectations. I found virtually no laughs in \"Spy Hard\", but found many in this police spoof, which proves that the mediocrity of SH has nothing to do with Nielsen's starring role.Detective Nordberg, a member of Police Squad, is shot multiple times during an investigation, and is nearly killed! While he is in the hospital, a fellow member of Police Squad, the clumsy Lieutenant Frank Drebin, must investigate this attempted murder. While on the case, Drebin eventually finds proof that Vincent Ludwig, a local businessman, plans to have the Queen of England assassinated during her visit in L.A.! Unfortunately, Drebin accidentally burns the proof of this assassination plot (he ends up burning a lot more than that), and Ludwig is a very well-respected individual, so how will the clumsy detective convince anyone of this sinister plan?!A ton of slapstick is featured in this spoof, and as big a fan as I am of the type of humour, I have to admit that this film may overdo it a bit at times, making some of the gags a tad too predictable. Fortunately, most of the movie doesn't have this problem. In fact, the jokes are often hilarious, whether they are physical gags, or comical lines! For better or worse, there are also some tasteless gags here and there, such as in the scene early in the film where Lieutenant Frank Drebin visits Detective Nordberg in the hospital. If you're into silly spoof movies and slapstick, and are generally not irked by raunchiness and/or tastelessness, I highly recommend \"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\" for you!",

Everything from words to visual jokes (like the beaver and bingo jokes and the hilarious scene where he's out on the ledge of the building after setting Ludwig's apartment on fire). Priscilla Presley is delightfully funny as his love interest (the safe-sex scene was cute). George Kennedy and Ricardo Montalban are funny as well. And before his controversial trial O.J. played Nordberg, who has a very bad streak of luck (unlike the real O.J.). Also look for Weird Al Yankovic's cameo as himself and the late Nancy Marchand as the mayor.Doesn't beat Airplane! which will forever be the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker classic, but is very very funny.",

I have seen it many times before but this is the first time I've attempted a review. The trouble with reviewing the work of someone that has recently passed is that you feel you don't want to say anything bad about them. I will, however, try to keep my impartiality. Here's a short summary of the plot before I get into it (summary haters please keep an eye on that crazy baseball umpire while I write the next paragraph).Undercover policeman, Nordberg, has been shot and it's up to inept cop Frank Drebin to find who's responsible. Add to that the fact that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is visiting the city and Drebin has his plate full. The finger of suspicion falls on respected businessman Vincent Ludwig and Frank decides to pay him a visit. There he meets Jane Spencer who has been persuaded by Ludwig to get close to Drebin so he can discover what the police know. During his investigation Drebin discovers a plot to assassinate the Queen during her visit. Can Frank find out who shot Nordberg and also stop the assassination attempt on the Queen and maybe even get the girl? So many questions, so little time.A pretty well made film with a very high gag (in the comedy sense) ratio. For me there were surprisingly few 'laugh out loud' moments though. I put it down to the difference in culture between the USA and the UK. We may speak more or less the same language, but what makes us laugh is very different. That isn't to say there were any bad performances, far from it, Leslie Nielsen was excellent as Frank Drebin, Priscilla Presley put in a stellar performance as Jane Spencer and Ricardo Montalban was excellent as Vincent Ludwig. Honourable mentions must also go to George Kennedy as Ed Hocken, O.J. Simpson as Nordberg and Nancy Marchand as the Mayor.I used to love the TV show but I'm afraid it doesn't translate too well to the big screen. It's still pretty good, but I don't think the humour comes across as well when you are bombarded with it for 80 minutes solid. So, over all, not as good as the TV show, but still recommended if only for Leslie Nielson's performance, he will be missed.My score: 7.6/10",

Simpson (The Towering Inferno, Firepower) in this TOTALLY HILARIOUS movie.The funny parts are so imaginative and creative and belly-laugh-bringers. Leslie Nielsen plays Lt.

That doesn't make him weird. He's hilarious and he's a very gifted actor that brings belly-laughs in every single movie and TV show he has been in (all 223 of them, he'll be starring in three more movies, two in 2007, which are Music Within and Lipshitz Saves the World...and one in 2008, which is Scary Movie 5!!!) Anyway, this movie is for almost all ages (11 or older) I'd have to say because there is a lot of strong off-color humor and some border-line strong sexuality (but mostly sexual humor) and is not for younger children.See this movie! You won't regret it! **** out of **** 10 out of 10 stars My MPAA rating: PG-13: Off-Color Humor, Sexual Content and Dialogue, and for Some Language",

In the beginning of the movie, he busts a meeting filled with \"evil\" world leaders including Idi Amin, the Ayatollah Khomeini, and Gorbachev (\"I knew it!\" Drebbin yells as he rubs off the mark on Gorbachev's forehead). But when he suspects that a shady character named Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban from \"Fantasy Island\") is plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth, nobody except his captain, Ed Hocken (played by another serious actor who shows a great ability with comedy, George Kennedy) is willing to take him seriously. His retractors include the mayor (played by Nancy Marchand, later of \"The Sopranos\"), who after a series of pratfalls that make Drebbin look like an idiot (it's not hard) takes his badge. But Drebbin is determined to prove his case, even if it means posing as opera star Enrico Pullazo and an umpire to do it, and prevent the assassination of the queen.There's a love story between Drebbin and Jane Spencer, played by Priscilla Presley, who is also not ready to accept that her boss Ludwig is a murderer, and O.J. Simpson provides support (and some of the funniest scenes in the movie) as the hapless Det. Nordberg, who can't seem to avoid getting hurt time and time again. Admit it, it's a hoot watching these scenes now and imagining that the real O.J. is the one nearly being killed.The movie was made by Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker, the team also responsible for \"Airplane!\", and is based on the cult classic TV show (cancelled before its time because, of course, it was too much for the dumb TV audiences to be able to follow) \"Police Squad!\" I think it can be easily argued that it's because of the material provided by these geniuses that Nielsen is so funny; God knows he can't be in anything not created by them. But let's give Leslie Nielsen some credit; NOBODY does deadpan like him. And he gets strong support from the rest of the cast. There are some hilarious one-liners and sight gags here; one of my favorites is the final scene with Nordberg (\"Oh Frank! Everybody should have a friend like you!\"). Also notable are the cameos throughout, including \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Reggie Jackson, Dick Vitale, Dick Enberg, Dr. Joyce Brothers (as a baseball announcer!), and best of all John Houseman in his final screen appearance, playing a driving instructor in a car Drebbin has to take control of for a chase; the poor teenage girl is still driving, and Houseman is calmly directing her on how to do it, as they speed down the highway. This is classic stuff, and even though its not a serious role, I'm glad he had something so memorable for his last movie.\"Naked Gun\" isn't as consistently funny as \"Airplane!\", but it's still one of the funniest movies ever, and further proof (with apologies to Mel Brooks) that the Zuckers are the greatest spoofmakers of all time.",

The story is simple:Detective Frank Drebin tries to uncover a plan to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II (who is on a state visit to the USA). The main suspect is Vincent Ludwig ,a man (hired by Papshmir, a recurring villain) who has a way of turning anyone into an unknowing assassin at the press of Ludwig's beeper; it appears that the victims are responding to a post-hypnotic suggestion, but the film makes no effort to clarify the point.As he works on the case, Drebin meets and falls in love with Ludwig's assistant Jane Spencer. It is eventually revealed that Jane knows nothing about Ludwig's plot, and after the pair spend the night together, she helps Frank with his investigation.The laughs are more than you can count I can assure you.This spoof of cop movies is excellent watch it immediately.For me the three movies are the greatest comedies of all time.",

And there are few actors better at playing dumb, or at remaining straight faced in the midst of travesty than the late, great Leslie Neilson. When you put them together, the results are nothing less than spectacular. Case in Point, The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, which is one of the most outrageous, side splittingly hilarious comedies ever made.Neilson is perfectly cast as LAPD Lieutenant Frank Drebin, who surely must be related to the legendary inspector Clouseau. After socking it to America's enemies in the utterly ridiculous pre-title sequence, Drebin must save Queen Elizabeth II from an assassination plot at the hands of the dastardly Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalbon). This would prove impossible for the spectacularly incompetent detective if not for one small fact: everyone else in this movie is nearly as clueless as he is. Rarely does a movie combine as many comedic devices, or use them to such effect, as this film. Naked Gun joins together the slapstick of Keaton, the manic energy and one-liners of the Marx Brothers, and the sheer ridiculousness of Monty Python, then dials them up in a way that only the Zuckers can manage. The slapstick sequences build and build, linking together one mishap after another in a way that defies all logic. Their dialog utilizes a one of a kind mixture of double entendre, mixed metaphors, monologues, and self-negating sentences that produce some of the most quotable lines in cinema. Speaking of quotes, watch for delicious parodies of some of the best known lines from famous cop dramas.And before the movie ends, they manage to skewer practically every clich\u00e9 known to the cop genre. The shootouts, the chases, the interrogations, the tearful meeting with the partner's wife, it's all here. They even managed to spoof the opening credits of practically every cop movie ever made. And no-one understands the comedic power of overstatement more than they do. Their car chases don't end in a massive fireball, they end in three. When they introduce the requisite romantic subplot, they take you through every possible variation of the semi-obligatory lyrical interlude. And when the hero's heartfelt statement of true love comes, it's so moving that it ends the Arab/ Israeli feud. While they were at it, the Zuckers also managed to spoof the Bond franchise, and to include possibly the best sports scene in any non-sports movie. It may not be subtle, or entirely tasteful, or contain any twists that a third grader couldn't predict, but Naked Gun is just about the most fun you can have at the movies. There is not a single moment that passes without a gag, and you'll be laughing so hard you'll hardly have time to breath.",

Leslie Nielsen becomes the funniest man alive when put in the directing style of David Zucker. Although Airplane is a great Zucker movie, this movie is the best. The movie also spawned two sequels: The Naked Gun 2 1/2 The Smell of Fear and Naked Gun 33 1/3 The Final Insult. Leslie Nielsen is the spoofmaster king and he is such a joy to watch.

He fakes his orgasms, loves a nice stuffed beaver, and laughs through comedies like 'Platoon'. Fresh off of kicking terrorist butt in Beirut, Drebin returns home to an empty apartment and a broken heart. Everywhere he looks, there's something to remind him of his old flame: in the smiling faces of happy couples, or a pair of twin breast-shaped nuclear reactors in San Onofre.Enter Jane (Presley), the lovely assistant of real estate tycoon Vincent Ludwig (Montalban), and the woman of Frank's dreams. \"How 'bout dinner?\" he asks her. She can't make it, but offers a rain-check. \"Well, lets just stick to dinner,\" he replies. They hit it off immediately, but Frank's got bigger fish to fry. Queen Elizabeth II is coming to Los Angeles, and it's up to Drebin and Police Squad, an elite unit of the LAPD, to keep her safe. Ludwig is the villain, and the movie makes it no secret -- by the 10min mark, he's already pumped Frank's partner Nordberg (Simpson) full of bullets. Luckily, Nordberg survives, albeit hospitalized and in critical condition. It's up to Frank and Capt. Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) to counsel his crying wife: \"I think what Frank's trying to say is, as soon as Nordberg's better, he's welcome back on Police Squad,\" Ed explains. Drebin interrupts, \"Unless he's a drooling vegetable -- but that's just common sense.\"If it seems like I'm pumping this review full of quotes, I am. This is one of the funniest movies ever made. I can't count how many times I've seen it, and I die laughing each time. Directed by David Zucker, from a script he co-wrote with his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams, The Naked Gun is based on a failed TV show the three of them produced for NBC, called 'Police Squad!' That the show was canned after only four episodes seems criminal. The ZAZ Boys, who also masterminded such comedy classics as 'Airplane!' and 'Top Secret!', are gifted comedians with a penchant for exclamation marks. Their gift is in casting accomplished dramatic actors to play everything straight. Kennedy was (and still is) an Academy Award winner; Montalban was one of cinema's great villains, playing opposite William Shatner's James T. Kirk in 'The Wrath of Khan'; Presley had been a prime-time soap star for years. Dead-panned, the words and sight gags speak for themselves -- and they speak volumes. Think I've ruined the best bits? Not even close, and you notice something new every time.FINAL SCORE: 9.3 = AThe movie lives and dies by Nielsen, and Jacques Clouseau's got nothing on this hard-boiled doofus. Kicked off the force, Drebin bites his lower lip and says, \"Just think...the next time I shoot a man, I could be arrested.\" This is classic comedy through and through.",

What he actually does is difficult to explain, but he does it all well enough to be the hero by the end of the movie. Among the sketches in the movie is perhaps my favorite series of events, when the Queen visits a baseball game. Why the Queen of England visits Dodger Stadium to watch the big Seattle Mariners-California Angels game, that's anyone's guess. But between the 7 announcers at the beginning of the game, to Enrico Palazzo singing the national anthem to the umpire frisking all of the players during the game, it is my favorite 20 minute stretch of any movie. Hilarious! The rest of the movie is filled with wonderful moments of comedy, never taking itself too seriously.

I suppose it was because a lot of the American films are the usual run of mill Hollywood bore, but this was better in many ways. First of all it wasnt rubbish, second of all it had actual actors in, third of all it had hilarious jokes in.This sums up a perfect film! The funniest part was when two men were searching Leslie Nielsen, and one of the men held his arms behind his back, and the other guy searched his pockets but he accidently reached into his mate's pocket and got a wallet! he opened it and shouted to the man whose wallet it was: \"Hey hes got a picture of your wife!\" the man turned Leslie Nielsen around and punched him in the face! See hilarious comedy... should not be missed!This film was great in many ways but always there is a bad point in which you must loose a mark out of 10 for, this is the acting, but in lots of comedys you cant act you must be funny so no comedy would be likely to get 10/10. All because there are either people voting who have no taste in pure hilarious comedy. Or because of the acting in which has to be poor to make it funny.Leslie Nielsen also made a laugh echo over britain and the US as he played a characteristic comic character in Airoplane! Thats what he should be: a comic character. His passionate flirting was almost pathetic although it worked! He has the power to catch the viewer and then take them into never never land (then leave them behind). Basically he catches your eye you sit down laughing, laughing, and laughing and youll be left there with out noticing!Yes Im referring to what happened to me!

Leslie Nielsen is one of the best comic actors of all time (my goal in life is to have seen all of his movies by the way). George Kennedy, O.J., Priscilla Presley, and the like also have funny roles. Some very funny lines (i.e. nice beaver), funny moments, and some great cameos (Dr. Joyce Brothers as an announcer). Plus, we get to see Leslie Nielsen goof up the national anthem, which is something you don't see every day. This is a funny movie, and everyone should see it.

Over the years, there have been many imitations, but few can match the sharp wit and pitch-perfect delivery of David Zucker and the rest of the team of writers (Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker and Pat Proft). The film is filled with hilarious gags that aspiring comedy writers and directors can learn from. This is not a hit-or-miss comedy. Either the jokes are funny or hilarious. There are very few bad apples in this bunch. First of all, the casting of Leslie Nielsen was genius. It's a shame that we don't see much of him anymore. His timing and delivery are impeccable. Nielsen started out as a serious actor, which I think makes his performance even funnier. If Zucker were to cast a Jim Carrey type in the role, he would try too hard to milk out the comedy in each scene. What makes Nielsen so funny is that he doesn't seem like he's trying to be funny, and as I say time and time again that's how you're supposed to do comedy! It must be done with a straight face! My favorite gag is the one in which Nielsen hangs off the ledge of a building and grabs onto a statue's penis to stop himself from falling down. That scene had me laughing so hard that I was running out of breath! I literally laughed for about 5 minutes straight! Yes, it's that funny! I like the sequels, but the original \"Naked Gun\" is the best of the bunch. A must-see for comedy fans!",

Then there's the phenomenal script, which starts out with Drebin kicking the crap out of terrorist to Nordberg being shot, burned, caked, toasted, bitten, and stabbed on a ship, but the big plot fills in with the attempt of assassinating the Queen of England (Reggie Jackson makes a cameo here)But the dumb jokes and one liners is the icing on this cake. Examples: \"Everything will be alright Mrs. Nordberg, your husband will be fine.\" \"Unless he turns into a mindless vegetable.\" Drebin being hit with a pillow and he screams as though it's alive. \"Don't worry Mrs. Nordberg, nothing will stop me from solving this crime. There is no time to waste! Now lets go get a bite to eat.\" The whole student driver sequence, the love video with Frank and his girlfriend, and the villain giving a demonstration with the Queens death with his secretary.

The film essentially takes the unfairly short TV series, Police Squad, to the big screen often merely lifting jokes and scenarios from the latter. The manner in which this transition succeeds must largely be thanks to the lead actor Leslie Nielson who plays Lt. Frank Drebbin the unwittingly chaotic police officer.The storyline doesn't really matter (an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth II using mind control), it merely contextualises the Zucker and Abrahams format of incessant humour - indeed such is the barrage of jokes that one needs to watch it several times to get the often interwoven layers of slapstick, innuendo, smut, and wordplay on offer here.The aforementioned Nielson is cast superbly as the lead role as he was in Police Squad but unlike the TV series I believe the supporting cast in Naked Gun is better chosen. Simpson, Pressley and Kennedy all play off the lead, who is in almost every scene, and the result is a fabulously funny spoof film that retains its humour nearly 20 years on.",

This is not because it was taken from a TV series (\"Police Squad\"), or that the name of the series was changed for the big screen. Rather, it is because Leslie Nielsen's character is turned around with respect to what he was on television. The world of \"Police Squad\" (all six episodes of it) is like that of \"Airplane,\" one in which, for example, a female witness can ask detectives to wait while she \"changes\" and come back a completely different person, or where the scientist down at Police Squad headquarters can demonstrate ballistics by showing how far a bullet can penetrate through a row of Barbara Walters interview tapes. Nothing quite make sense to us, but it does to them, which is one reason why the series was so hilarious.On \"Police Squad,\" the occasional exception to this state of affairs was Lt. Frank Drebin (Nielsen), who seemed to be the only one who could perceive that a statement was too ludicrous even for his universe (which he would indicate by pausing, grinning slightly and saying \"Well . . .\" and then moving on).In the movie, however, Frank becomes something of an Inspector Clouseau: clumsy, accident-prone, annoying to his superiors. This is not at all what he was in \"Police Squad.\" There he was the ultimate good cop: loyal, smooth-talking, respected by his colleagues and bosses downtown. The viewer must judge for himself which version he likes better. I, of course, preferred the old version, mostly because I am just old enough to remember why Nielsen was chosen to be in \"Airplane,\" namely, because the straightness of most of his roles up to that point only served to emphasize the zaniness of the script.Yes, this is probably too much analysis for a simple comedy. I just miss the television series. In brief: \"Naked Gun\" is entertaining fare, though it is certainly no \"Airplane\" or even \"Police Squad.\" Too much slapstick, not quite enough wit.But excellent opening credits.",

This movie gets a 8/10. It was ranked down for some real repetitive jokes, doing the same thing over and over just gets lame after awhile.

How can a film which features a scene of barely disguised sadism right at the start, (which involves an ordinary cop being burned, shot and humiliated), takes in many sexist jokes, then finally takes pleasure in an act of unintentional cannibalism be funny? Leslie Nielsen doesn't act in this movie, he merely remains stubbornly wooden, then falls down when the script requires it. The real problem about this \"comedy\" is that it doesn't care about its characters. Even farces, such as this, should treat their protagonists with a modicum of respect, and not to do so makes laughing at them seems cruel, rather like kicking a puppy who can't walk properly yet. This is crude junk, a smear on film history, and is a waste of your time. Watch it if you want to feel depressed.",

            "content": "Before I move on with this, my fifth review for IMDb, I'll run you down on what my star ratings mean. 1 star (which I gave to \"Batman and Robin\") means that a film is abysmal or worse, and has virtually no redeeming qualities. 2 stars (which I gave to \"AVP\") means that I found the film to be terrible, and only has one or two small (sometimes very small) positive attributes. I gave \"Alien3\" 4 stars, which means that I found a film mediocre. A film that receives 4 stars has some good things going for it, but has serious problems that hinder it from succeeding, and I overall don't like it very much. I gave \"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" 7 stars, which means that I thought the film was good. While it has a few obvious problems, I still think it has enough good qualities to outweigh them, and overall I find it solid. My next target is \"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad\". Because this is a spoof, I have to judge it on how funny I thought it was, and how good the comedic performers are. I\"m giving this film 9 stars because it made me laugh myself silly.The Positives: -In the vein of their previous films, the Zucker brothers have given us a film where the jokes either hit or miss. For me, I don't recall any moments where they missed. -Leslie Nielsen is in his prime here as Lt. Frank Drebin, and he sells every laugh without breaking a sweat. The entire supporting cast (even O.J. Simpson!) perform admirably here.The Negatives: -Sometimes, the jokes are so silly and/or juvenile that you feel guilty for laughing so hard at them. Seriously, you will laugh when Drebin's love interest falls down the stairs, even though you see it coming.My 3 choice words: Hilarious, Silly, Entertaining",

Everyone who wrote the script are comics who show their skill by making a completely funny movie.Leslie Nielsen is a cop, who falls in love. At the same time when his partner goes to the hospital, he thinks someone is trying to kill the Queen of England. That's what makes this movie great, it's structure.

For example, when Drebin is at the press conference and goes to take a leak and forgets to turn of his mic (hehe), something like that could actually happen. Compare this to some of the sequels in this series and those that came after it which have situations that are just *way* out in left field. Not that this movie doesn't have some of those, but it just doesn't seem so obvious. Some people compare this movie to Airplane, but I personally think Naked Gun is much better - a masterpiece.

(Did I somehow make it through youth in the 80s in the US without watching either, at the time? I think I basically did, though I'm sure they were on in the background at some point.) Tbh the series was snappier. The hammy nature of several of the bits was more hammy, because of episode-to-episode repetition. Norberg and Hocken have funnier stuff to do in the series and better dynamics with Drebin. The love interest in the movie has some funny moments but also a lot of dull ones. I'm sad that the shoeshine guy didn't make an appearance; I always looked forward to his part in Police Squad! All in all, the movie has a lot of really funny moments, but it also drags, and I kept wondering when / if it was going to pick up.\n\nI watched this as part of watching a series of cop shows; I was interested to try to understand more about this genre which has been so expansive in American cinema since the 70s, to try to figure out why it has been so compelling, in various forms, and whether it tells us anything about this moment of competing demands: to defund the police, to recall left-liberal prosecutors, to puncture the mystique of the police in the aftermath of an abject, sickening failure like in Uvalde. However, I am too lazy to deconstruct anything, so I mostly just watch the movies and shoot fish in a barrel. (I love shooting fish in a barrel! Sometimes, I get one! And it always makes me happy. However, it's kind of messy. I've been thinking about trying a net.)\n\nPolice Squad! and Naked Gun are interesting in this regard in that they sort of survey the tropes that had become standard over the 70s and early 80s in cop shows, boil them down, and exaggerate them for yuks. Honestly, I would have to think more about where some of these come from. The early 70s renegade cop movies I've been watching are great for understanding the bleeding edge of the ideology and the desire, but they don't offer the most boiled down version of the tropes that later became standard.\n\nOne low-key aspect of this first Naked Gun movie that I liked: when Drebin plays, for what seems like it's aiming at stupid fun, something that turns out not to be funny at all -- in fact, he killed five actors who were putting on a Shakespeare in a Park festival (and not just any actors, but good ones!), or he finds exculpatory evidence for a guy who was already sent to the electric chair, or he laments, upon the possibility of losing his badge, that the next time he shoots someone, he could be arrested. You could easily overlook these short, deflating moments, but they tell the truth about policing in a way that a lot of cop shows don't. All of this bumbling isn't *just* for yuks. Ok, it's 98% for yuks, but it's also maybe 2% serious about quietly planting the idea that all this bumbling might not be just fuzzy and endearing. Of course, the cops still get the bad guys, every time, and the Dirty Harry fanboys probably just kept laughing.",

Sure he has been in some bad films, such as 2001:A Space Travesty, but he had also made some quintessential classics such as Airplane, the only film of his career I consider better than this, and the Naked Gun series, of which this is the best. Whatever the outcome of the film, that doesn't stop me from considering Nielson a comedy genius.\n\nThe Naked Gun:From the Files of Police Squad! is fast, furious, zany and most importantly, enormous fun film. While it looks great, is wonderfully directed, brilliantly paced with seldom a dull moment and has energetic music and a fun story, it is the humour and acting that really makes this film so good.\n\nThe dialogue is deliciously dry-witted, and the plentiful juvenile gags never cease to be hilarious. Nielson gives one of his career's best performances in a wonderfully deadpan characterisation as an likable inept character. The support performances from Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy and OJ Simpson are equally great, but special mention has to go to Riccardo Montalban who just oozes cool.\n\nOverall, a hilarious film. Forget rubbish like Disaster Movie, 2001:A Space Travesty, Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie and watch the classic spoof movies like Young Frankenstein, Airplane, Galaxy Quest and this.

If you look away from the screen for even a moment, you'll miss like 3 different jokes going on in the background. It's not as hilarious as Airplane! or Top Secret!, but The Naked Gun is still a classic comedy with plenty of laughs.\n\nLeslie Nielsen can deliver any goofy or joke line in a perfectly serious deadpan voice and it is funny every time. He's so calm given all the strange and hilarious situations that I'm always entertained by Nielsen's shenanigans. Priscilla Presley is surprisingly funny and keeps up with Nielsen's absurd energy. You never buy their romance or like the endless string of sex jokes there for a quick crude laugh, but their comedic chemistry is more important. The Naked Gun has it all, even Top Secret! superfan Weird Al Yankovic!\n\nRicardo Montalban is excellent as the villain. His casual manner tells you everything you need to know with a more nuanced performance than some of the more colorful characters in The Naked Gun. George Kennedy plays a gung ho cop who just allows Nielsen to do whatever he wants with reckless abandon and it's great. I love how The Naked Gun cast O.J. Simpson just to beat the hell out of him.\n\nWriters Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Pat Proft make efficient use of their 86 minutes to tell a silly story with as much visual flair and comedic insanity imaginable. I will not spoil anything in The Naked Gun, so that all the jokes are fresh, but I will say that the breakin and baseball gags are glorious.\n\nIn short, The Naked Gun will always be a comedy worth revisiting for a series of rapid fire laughs.",

Putting aside his \"other side\" OJ Simpson plays the straighter man of Nordberg perfectly while George Kennedy takes the Captain Ed role into whichever corner Drebin leads him next.\n\nPriscilla Presley shows surprising comedic timing as Jane Spencer as she switches effortlessly from straight woman to second banana throughout - any scene with Neilsen is a delight. Watch out for Weird Al Yankovic's cameo (he has one in all 3 movies in the franchise) but don't let your attention wander too far otherwise you may miss another sight gag or quick zinger.

It has toilet humor, sexual humor, and a fair amount of dirty jokes in it and it's all done brilliantly.\n\tIn The Naked Gun an incompetent policeman named Frank Drebin sets out to prevent an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth the Second.\n\tThe funny thing about Frank is that he's not only incompetent but also flawed in many other ways. He has difficulty reading between the lines such as when he steps off a plane and assumes since he's one the first people off the plane that the microphones, and crowd cheering is all set up for him but it's really set up for Weird Al Yankovic since he was on the same plane. He also lives in a very poor manner. In his apartment he has lots of old outdated food in his frig.  \n\tThere's one toilet joke in The Naked Gun which involves Frank using a toilet, which is funny in itself because it's literally a toilet joke. It's a quirk in which Frank forgets to take off a radio mic during a press conference before he goes to the bathroom and this results in everyone at the press conference hearing him go to the bathroom.\n\tThe Naked Gun also has sexual quirks which is appropriate considering sexual quirks are generally associated with toilet humor. There's a hilarious quirk which involves Frank using a dildo and getting in trouble for it. There's also a funny moment in which Frank and Jane, his partner, decide to overly use protection for them having sex.  \n\tFrank ends up getting himself in lots of funny situations. He goes to a baseball game because he finds out that that's where the assignation attempt on Queen Elizabeth the Second is supposed to take place. The fact that Queen Elizabeth II is at a baseball game is funny because it's the last  kind of place that you would expect her to be because she's with a bunch of people who are the exact opposite of what she is because they're:  uncivilized, unsophisticated, and not very royal. One of the funny situations involves Frank going undercover as an umpire and he doesn't even know exactly what to do as an umpire at first. He goes undercover as an opera singer and gets in trouble for it. \n\tThe Naked Gun has off the wall funniness and it also has many situations that Frank and other characters get themselves in and the comedy in it is brilliant.",

It weaves out an intense sequence with such sincerity that you fall for it and then it mocks it away on all levels where you find yourself practically all giddy up for more. \n\nBut amidst all these tomfoolery it fiddles subconsciously with the viewers and somehow manages to reach a definite point that is put up front with crystal clear voice. With a zazzy yet incongruent background score, annoyingly loud sound effects, daft cinematography and amateur editing, it falls flatly on face on technical aspects. All the husbandry gags are just cherry on top that makes you root for it more and more as it ages on screen. \n\nTicking for around 90 minutes, the tightly packed screenplay never lets you wander off its sketchy world, it may be illogical but it's hilarious, it may be redundant but it somehow is feasible and it may overdo sometime but it works like a charm. Neilson's comic timing is off the hook, he hits a home run on every throw and its his expressive or inexpressive face is what fuels this comic into a bit more than one anticipates for. Because at certain points even writers may fall short but he delivers every time and every line. \n\nHis ludicrous attempts to not only convince others but himself too, is what makes him stand alone than any other actors in here, his strong belief in each and every gag is clearly visible through his mannerism and tone. Zuker's execution barely matters in here, it is good but armed with such an attention seeking script one rarely wonders about it. \n\nNaked Gun might be an attention seeker, but why not just give it to it, there won't be any regrets.",

Some of those moments still hold up and others do not. What was most surprising watching this film now is how leisurely paced it seemes compared to contemporary rapid fire comedies. It was also very odd to see O.J. Simpson playing kind mild mannered police detective Nordberg. Overall, this is still a worthy comedy and certainly worth checking out.",

When it comes to the Zucker Brothers being together, they tend to make some comedies that are a classic. So with this, it's also a classic that is just as fantastic as Airplane!. Leslie Nielsen is really good at taking things seriously in a very comedic way that brings out a lot of laughs. It's interesting to see that it doesn't entirely make it obvious about who the villain is, and even if it did, that's probably because he was in a film that was one of the well known films of all times. I like how in a detective spoof like this, it still has the interesting detective stories that could be taken seriously as a action detective film, but also doesn't give out the whole case out in the beginning, just the basis of it. The writing by Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Pat Proft give out a lot of jokes for us to handle, and they kept hitting the mark as I kept laughing so much in it. Frank Drebin is very likable and silly to watch that you can't help but find him enjoyable. The Naked Gun is a fantastic film that it's sad to see that this is the last film where the Zucker Brothers and Jim Abrahams were involved together.",

You have your Horror movies and then dramas and then action movies. We as audiences wanted something completely different. Now I'm not saying that I hate these kinds of films but I wanted new ideas instead of reboots. Thus The Naked Gun was born. Well I can't really say that this movie was original because was based on a TV show. But this gave us something new for audiences to sink their teeth in. Thus with The Naked Gun, the spoof genre was born cranking out film like Scary Movie and Epic Movie. The Naked Gun combines some of the funniest humor that you can get from a film. It's like the filmmakers of this movie were like \"If we're going to scoff all of these spy movies, then we have to do it right\"! And the filmmakers clearly show it. This film not only combines the best speaking humor, but also the best visual humor. And this movie is jam-packed with all of this kin of humor. Like in one scene Frank (Leslie Nielsen) says \"Nice Beaver\". The girl Jane (Priscilla Presely) says \"Thank you, I just had it stuffed\" She then pulls down an actual stuffed Beaver from the attic. When you watch the movie and see the joke you'll get it. The Naked Gun is a funny comedy and I totally recommend it.",

Sure enough this movie gets me laughing more than anything manufactured by the Wayans' brothers.  I must admit, though, that the first 2 acts of the movie struggle at times to keep a consistent level of comedy.  There are moments where the jokes fall flat, and it sometimes struggles to recover quickly because they keep working through those ineffective jokes.  However, when the 3rd act hits, this is easily one of the funniest movies I know.  From the second they arrive at the baseball game I am just in tears with laughter, and it does not stop until the credits roll.  In fact, I actually had to remind myself there were some slower parts of the movie as soon as I was done watching, because I'm on such a high from that whole final sequence.  I'll also quickly address the one reservation some people bring up with these movies: \"Isn't it weird/hard to watch these films with O.J. Simpson in them as a cop, considering what we all assume he did?\"  It could be, however, since his character (Nordberg) is constantly getting the crap kicked out of him in these movies, it kind of works.  In fact one could even consider it somewhat cathartic to watch him get shot, punched, and dropped so frequently.  Overall, I think the first Naked Gun movie is by far the best, and despite some slower moments that struggle with humor, it ends with a big bang that is seldom matched by other spoof movies including its own sequels.",

The movie is unforgettable for being chocked full of great gags that never compromise. Its plot is certainly silly, and the romance is cliched, but this is easily forgiven for it just serves as fuel for more laughs. The Naked Gun is hilarious and keeps viewers laughing, which is all you can ask of a comedy.",

For example, it's hilarious to me when they're on stakeout eating red pistachios and they have that red powder all over their hands and lips. And the Enrico Palazzo stuff is legendary. Throw in a younger Livia Soprano as the Mayor uttering the classic line \"Entering without a search warrant, destroying property, arson; sexual assault with a concrete dildo?\"  Such a great movie.",

The first movie 'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!' dates from 1988 and was directed by David Zucker. The storyline is about police lieutenant Frank Drebin, played by the brilliant Leslie Nielsen (Airplane, Spy Hard), who tries to stop an assassination attempt on Queen Elisabeth II who is visiting LA. I absolutely love the mix of different kinds of humor; slapstick, visual and verbal puns and of course the face of Leslie Nielsen! Starring Priscilla Presley (Dallas), George Kennedy (Airport films, Intensive Care), Ricardo Montalban (Spy Kids 2 and 3) and O.J. Simpson (The Towering Inferno). Entertainment guaranteed. Impossible not to laugh!\n\nWhen officer Nordberg (Simpson) unsuccessfully attempts to bust a drug operation on a boat near the docks, lieutenant Frank Drebin (Nielsen) and captain Ed Hocken (Kennedy) promise him to catch the one who is responsible for Nordberg's injury. The few clues lead Frank to the wealthy Vincent Ludwig (Montalban), who he suspects is planning an assassination on the British queen Elisabeth II. In order to gain prove Frank interrogates Ludwig's assistant the beautiful Jane Spencer (Presley). Can Frank and his police squad catch the bad guys?",

From beginning to end, it's just a hilarious combination of slap stick, visual gags and word play. Some of the jokes will take you by surprise, and others telegraph their arrival - but I would say the vast majority hit their mark in The Naked Gun.\n\nThe film's success is partly due to Leslie Nielsen's great dead-pan performance as Lt. Frank Drebin, but mostly its about the writing. The ZAZ team (plus Pat Proft) do a great job lampooning the detective crime drama genre, and turn every stereotypical plot device on its proverbial head with hilarious results.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've seen any of the spoof movies from the ZAZ team (Airplane, Top Secret), then you'll likely enjoy this too. The humor is crude, and even childish, but you're still likely going to find something to laugh at here.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThere's nothing tremendously visual about the film. You'll get the same enjoyment regardless of the device you choose to watch it on.\n\nBest moment:\n\nOne of the my favorite scenes is when Frank goes to get information from a local informant.

Put on the case to investigate the shooting of OJ Simpson, Detective Drebin conjures up a number of spoofy ways to hunt down the terrorist figure behind it all. As he gets deeper involved in what turns out to be a huge case involving drugs, assassination attempts, and simple old murder, the giggles arrive thick and fast in a wonderfully scripted comedy. Never over complicating the joke, it's plain old dad wit right throughout, with a hint of sexually related crudeness. I particularly like the 'nice beaver' comment , made as the character stands underneath a ladder that a woman is climbing, moments before she passes him the actual product of a taxidermist, commenting 'Thanks, I just had it stuffed'. Cringe worthy as it may sound, it's rib tickling stuff with various references to other films as it progresses, James Bond and his gadgets in particular. It's amazing how many modern films have still not surpassed the hilarity of 30 years ago, but I guess that's a matter of individual taste really. I would much prefer to see more of this genre, albeit what would sadly have to be without the late Leslie Nielsen.",

Frank Drebin, who is assigned to protect the Queen of England when she visits America. Drebin suspects rich hot shot Vincent Ludwig to have something sneaky up his sleeve and then meets his associate Jane, who Frank has an on and off relationship with throughout the film. As the film goes on, Frank must protect the Queen from an assassination attempt at an MLB game all while constantly throwing hilarious jokes and scenes at the viewers. The Naked Gun is a great comedy and is considered a classic comedy.\nLeslie Neilsen is superb at what he does, he was a great actor and he's even better at producing laughs. Lt. Drebin is such a likable character, too, he's such an idiot but you root for him as the film goes on. I wasn't too big of a fan with Presley's character, she's not the best actress around, but she did what she could. The film is hilarious and one you should watch more than once to laugh at all of the jokes, there's just so many great scenes and lines.

Not every single line and gag work, but with the abundance of them, the ones that work outweigh the ones that don't. Leslie Nielsen is perfect for this role. He's able to deliver those clever one liners with ease, as well as pull of the oblivious goofball character perfectly. Something I usually don't praise in movies is the runtime, but here the runtime was spot on. Spoof movies generally need to be about an hour and a half long, and this movie gets it just right.

The thing about comedy though is that is arguably the most subjective genre out there, and while I know plenty of people that like the Naked Gun series, what works for them doesn't necessarily work for me.  The jokes featured are very upfront (a lot of them play their hand too early), and I personally prefer a subtler delivery of humor.  But hey, these are the jokes, and I would be lying if I said I didn't get a few laughs out of this.  What works best are the random non sequiturs that are left unexplained, because they really do take you by surprise.  Also, it's hard not to like the deadpan Nielson, as he does have a lot of natural charisma.  For me, slapstick and pratfalls work exponentially better in silent films, but hey, different strokes for different folks, and there are certainly worse spoof movies out there.",

But that wasn't the first instance of that happening. 1988: The Naked Gun is released, 6 years after the cancellation of the TV series Police Squad! There were a number of character changes, like Officer Norberg, a caucasian character, becoming OJ Simpsons character, Officer Nordberg, but are we really complaining? After returning from taking down a terrorist act made up of famous leaders, in one of the films best scenes, Lieutenant Frank Drebin begins working on a case where his best friend and partner, Officer Nordberg, is hospitalised and framed for dealing in heroin. Along his investigation, Frank comes across his love interest, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) and her employer, Ludwig (played by Khan himself, Ricardo Montalban), with the latter involved in a plot to assassinate the queen through post hypnotic suggestions. When you read the plot, it sounds utterly ridiculous, and in any other movie, the plot would fail along with the film, but this movie makes it work. The Naked Gun knows exactly what it is, a slapstick humourous take on cop films, and it takes that ludicrous plot and makes it work, and it doesn't hurt that they add some hilarious moments. One of the films best ever scenes includes an encounter at the hospital which follows up into a car chase. Another brilliant moment includes Frank investigating into Ludwigs office at night, which manages to include fire, a concrete **** (i'm not joking here) and a possible sexual harrasment case against the poor lieutenant. The Naked Gun is also something which is rare nowadays: A good spoof movie. The reason it doesnt fail like the spoof movies which have been released in the past decade or so is because it doesn't try to spoof films directly, therefore not having any original or funny jokes. It spoofs a genre, police films, and makes its own way rather than recycling plot points form movies in the same genre, and it manages to make original AND funny jokes. The Naked Gun stars the late, yet great Leslie Nielsen as Lieutenant Frank Drebin of the Police Squad. He says some hilarious things and does a lot of slapstick throughout, but plays it all off completely straight faced, and it utterly works. Frank Drebin does some stupid things, but thanks to Nielsens brilliant performance, you can see that he doesn't acknowledge these things as stupid, just merely believes its all right in the line of duty. Oh, and you have to give props for this snippet of dialogue: \"When I see five men stabbing a poor man to death in plain view, surrounded by eyewitnesses', I shoot the bastards, thats my policiy\" \"That was a Shakespeare in the park performance of Julius Caeser. You shot five actors, good ones!\" I have never done this before, but this film deserves it. Below are a list of Youtube links to some of The Naked Guns scenes, if you want to see what the fuss is all about, if you want to revisit one of the best comedies of the 80s or if you just want a damn good laugh.

It's one of the best products of the Zuker, Abrahams and Zucker partnership (falling only slightly short of the brilliant Airplane!) and certainly the best film David Zucker has directed solo. Leslie Nielsen gives the performance of his career as Lt. Frank Drebin - his deadpan delivery and mastery of slapstick making him the perfect comedy anchor that holds the film together. Priscilla Presley and George Kennedy also impress as Frank's muse, Jane Spencer and exasperated police chief Capt. Ed Hocken. The film has a huge variety of gags - whether you love slapstick, wordplay, visual jokes or parody you'll find plenty to make you chuckle. There are a couple of jokes that don't quite hit the mark, but they hardly matter as there's always something else to laugh at before you've even had time to stop smiling. The film owes a lot to The Pink Panther in terms of comic style, and Frank Drebin is basically an updated Inspector Clouseau, but Leslie Nielsen is a fine comedian, just as Peter Sellers was, and he, along with Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker manage to make the Naked Gun films rival (if not exceed) those 60s and 70s comedy classics. It's quite simply hilarious, extremely enjoyable, and just as silly (in a good way) as it ever was.",

Drebin of Police Squad is suspicious of businessman Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n) after Drebin's longtime partner is put in hospital after attempting a drug bust, to disastrous but also hilarious results involving bear traps, wedding cakes and wet paint. The hilarity continues as he attempts to investigate basically on his own, and he stumbles upon a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II on her visit to Los Angeles.\rHe is helped but also hampered by the woman he immediately falls for, Jane Spencer, (Priscilla Presley) who works with Ludwig. As Frank digs deeper into Ludwig and his business, his discoveries soon lead him into very hot water with the Mayor.\rThe Naked Gun relies on visual gags along with the superior acting skills of Nielson, and in both ways it delivers on all accounts, whether its a simple name on a door that is back to front or suitcases being thrown out of the plane ands entirely missing the carrier, these background gags work best when have Nielson's serious face but bumbling personality of Drebin directly in front of you.\rA movie as absurd and often immature is indeed quite difficult to review and put into words what is trying to be said, you will laugh at the entire film and when it ends you will question what you were even laughing at, or you will simply not feel good about the fact you laughed. But this is perhaps the genius of the writers, observing the elephant in the room, they address exactly what is considered ridiculous, stupid and downright immature and throw it back in your face, here's a pie, lets throw it at someone.\rBut the film also turns many tricks and other films of similar genres to parody, a particular scene where Frank is coaxing information out of a man and they in turn swap the money that Frank originally had, it is silly, hysterical but also witty in its own way.\rThe Naked Gun deserves a status of one of the best comedies, it knows exactly what it is, never tries to be better and calls all its own shots, with Leslie Neilson at the helm, it was always aiming high, and for good reason too.",

The Naked Gun is a joke a minute satire that may be based around dirty jokes and gags, but it is entirely fantastic. It is a tad over the top, but that is the point. Much like Airplane, the pace is very very fast, especially when it comes to jokes, which leaves you laughing continously and having to pause the movie to stop laughing and catch your breath briefly. The great part about a comedy like this is that the plot is irrelevant. They try to establish one, of course, but really, it does not matter. The jokes cover up any type of plot and any cliches are entirely intentional. This and Airplane are clear pinnacles of comedy.",

It is a movie based on the TV series Police Squad. It is staring Leslie Nielsen who's greatest gift is staying dead serious in the most funny and humorous situations. He was so good that he was type cast in this role for the rest of his career. Believe it or not he had a long career before with only serious or no nonsense characters (Except maybe Airplane). This change has even created the trope Leslie Nielsen Syndrome. Then there are the 3 Producers Zucker / Abrahams / Zucker. They were really good together but would later go separate ways and never were this good again. For the story it is a parody of a police movie with hilarious humor and funny situations. It has so much creativity and smart jokes. I think all jokes work well and there is no misfire I can remember. While the more modern spoof movie just try hard to string jokes together and fail this movie archived consistency with a great comedic value. Nothing feels out of place and it is structured well. The actors are well chosen and deliver an excellent performance. Leslie Nielsen has created an arch type. Priscilla Presley, O. J. Simpson (yes that one), Ricardo Montalban and George Kennedy are an excellent addition.  There is a brief cameo by Weird Al Yankovic who is also pure entertainment himself. Overall this is an arch type of a good comedy movie and still worth watching especially when you have only experienced the trashy ones as the genre is pretty much dead by now.",

It weaves out an intense sequence with such sincerity that you fall for it and then it mocks it away on all levels where you find yourself practically all giddy up for more. But amidst all these tomfoolery it fiddles subconsciously with the viewers and somehow manages to reach a definite point that is put up front with crystal clear voice. With a zazzy yet incongruent background score, annoyingly loud sound effects, daft cinematography and amateur editing, it falls flatly on face on technical aspects. All the husbandry gags are just cherry on top that makes you root for it more and more as it ages on screen. Ticking for around 90 minutes, the tightly packed screenplay never lets you wander off its sketchy world, it may be illogical but it's hilarious, it may be redundant but it somehow is feasible and it may overdo sometime but it works like a charm. Neilson's comic timing is off the hook, he hits a home run on every throw and its his expressive or inexpressive face is what fuels this comic into a bit more than one anticipates for. Because at certain points even writers may fall short but he delivers every time and every line. His ludicrous attempts to not only convince others but himself too, is what makes him stand alone than any other actors in here, his strong belief in each and every gag is clearly visible through his mannerism and tone. Zuker's execution barely matters in here, it is good but armed with such an attention seeking script one rarely wonders about it. Naked Gun might be an attention seeker, but why not just give it to it, there won't be any regrets.",
