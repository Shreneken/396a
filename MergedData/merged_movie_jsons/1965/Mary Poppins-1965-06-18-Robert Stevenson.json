            "content": "This is a masterpiece of a film, I absolutely love this. Julie Andrews is more than splendid as the nanny, and I absolutely love her voice. Dick Van Dyke, despite the accent, should have gotten an award for his performance for sheer energy and enthusiasm, but I liked him marginally better in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. David Tomblinson is a blast as the father, as are the children. There is solid support also from the likes of Glynnis Johns, Hermione Baddely and Elsa Lanchester. (who I believe was Charles Laughton's wife) Plus Ed Wynn in a hilarious characterisation as Uncle Albert. The songs and choreography are what makes so timeless, as well as the outstanding animated sequences. One of my favourite scenes was the one on the ceiling, with the terrible jokes, but you couldn't help laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. In contrast Mr Banks walking to his financial doom ties with Feed the Birds as the most moving scene of the film. It also teaches some nice family values as well. I highly recommend this film. 10/10, without a shadow of a doubt. Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"Mary Poppins\" is one of that select group of films that can truly be called 'Classic', a project conceived in love and filled with so much child-like wonder that it will never grow old or 'out-of-date'. Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's remarkable career, both story-wise and technically, the film remains an unsurpassed achievement!Based on P.L. Travers' tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors' works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney's desire to make a definitive, truly 'special' film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed 'pet' project, \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings.With Travers' grudging approval, casting began. While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent. Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from \"The Three Lives of Thomasina\") as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.But it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly 'made' the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, \"My Fair Lady\" (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in \"Camelot\" on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role. \"But I'm pregnant,\" she told him. \"No problem,\" he replied. \"I'll wait!\"And thus a Classic was born!A multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including 'Best Actress' for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her \"Lady\" costar, Rex Harrison, who won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.With songs both silly and sublime, seamless intermeshing of live performers and animation as only the Disney studio, at that time, was capable of, and the undeniable magnetism of Andrews and Van Dyke, it is nearly impossible NOT to like \"Mary Poppins\"!",

Julie appears here in fine voice and is radiantly beautiful.The performance is more than deserving of the Oscar, especially considering that she had to act to blue screens and objects/characters from within her imagination. No easy task, certainly.I also love the way Julie, as Mary, refuses to acknowledge the free-for-all that is going on around her. She simply pushes her hair primly back in place and presses on, despite the dancing chimney sweeps and giggling uncles that surround her. \"I never explain anything,\" she blithely comments.The score is one of my favorites in all the Disney canon. The Sherman brothers outdid themselves with \"Stay Awake,\" one of the most under-appreciated lullabys ever written, and the hauntingly winsome \"Feed the Birds.\"The Disney animators have created a visual feast as bottomless and surprising as Mary Poppins' carpetbag. The Peter Ellenshaw matte shots are breathtaking. My favorite visual moments? Bert and Mary's live-action reflections in a pond are eddied by a family of cartoon geese. I also love when Bert, Mary, and the children ascend a staircase constructed only of chimney smoke. Brilliant!There are a few drawbacks: The film's a little over-long, especially in the final third where Mary's but an afterthought in all the plot resolution. In addition, Van Dyke was an excellent choice for his singing and dancing (and popularity), but his cockney accent does grate after a while.But all in all, this is a tour de force for all involved!",

He is now a young man, and little brother is a teenager. I am going to buy the DVD for their children, who may not be born for ten more years. I'll watch it myself until then. It's that good. We all have opinions, and mine is that, in the long list of Disney classics and masterpieces, this one is at the top. It is the perfect combination of story, song, characters, actors, whimsy \u0096 you name it. I believe it is one of the best movies ever made in any genre.Need proof? How many songs can you hum in the car or sing in the shower? Chim Chim Cher-ee; Spoonful of Sugar; Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (thank God for copy and paste); Let's Go Fly a Kite. What about songs that put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye? Feed the Birds. Great composing, great fit to the story. And Julie Andrews is as good a singer as you will find.More proof? What about delightful scenes? A tea party on the ceiling. The fox hunt on merry-go-round horses. Dancing on the rooftops of London.Memorable characters? Bert, even with his horrible accent, is a blast. Old Mr. Dawes. Uncle Albert. Mrs. Banks, that independent woman (as long as it did not annoy Mr. Banks). Jane and Michael having the experience of a lifetime. And poor Mr. Banks, so concerned with being the lord of his castle but learning the important lessons in the nick of time. His illusion of control begins to unravel the moment that Poppins woman walked in the door, and he never figures out who she is and how she did it to him.Neither do we, really. She is both the cause of much madness but the stability within it as the story moves along. It is one of Disney's greatest talents to craft movies and stories that operate on multiple levels. Children love dancing penguins and fireworks. Adults may as well but they can register the message here of what is truly important in life. Poppins has the answers. It is better we don't analyze who she is \u0096 and or course she never explains anything. The Banks family is just glad she was there for a while, and we should be glad that Walt Disney left us with this masterpiece.",

It just lifted your mood with it's cheery songs, beautiful lead actress Julie Andrews and her lovely voice and was just a magical film. But does it stand the test of time, that as adults we could still watch it with that same feeling of being a child? Oh, yeah! I still watch Mary Poppins to this day, how could you resist this wonderful movie? The songs are fantastic, the whole movie is made wonderfully and has fun energetic characters, some with the worst accents of all time *cough* Dick Van Dyke *cough!*, but that adds much more laughter that is needed for this good time. Mary Poppins will melt it's way into your heart, I promise you.We are introduced to the Banks family, headed by the cold and aloof George Banks and the loving but highly distracted Winifred. Jane and Michael draft their own advertisement asking for a fun, kind-hearted and caring nanny, but Mr. Banks tears up the paper and throws it in the fireplace. Unnoticed, the remains of the note float up the dark chimney. Mary Poppins floats down and enters the residence. As Mr. Banks puzzles, Mary Poppins employs herself and begins work, saying that she will stay for a trial period of one week, before deciding if she will take a permanent position. The children face surprises of their own: Mary possesses a bottomless carpetbag, and makes contents of the children's nursery come to life and tidy themselves by snapping their fingers. They continue on a magical journey with the \"practically perfect in every way\" nanny as their stuffy father learns how to love and the family reunites together.Mary Poppins is a classic family film that I cannot wait to show my children one day. I still go crazy with energy when \"Steppin' Time\" comes on the screen, what a great dance number, so filled with life and gives you the best time. \"Feed the birds\" is one of the most beautiful songs put on film and can make the toughest convict cry like a baby. Julie Andrews is just too wonderful as Mary Poppins and deserved that Oscar rightfully. Dike Van Dyke may have one of the worst accents of all time, but during his scene with \"love to laugh\" he was just irresistible. He brought such a wonderful time to the film, both he and Julie had great chemistry, they were so charming together. I really have no complaints about the movie, it is a perfect family film that any would could fall in love with at any age. Plus it's against the law if you do not let your children watch Mary Poppins, it's a necessary children's movie.10/10",

            "content": "Inventive and enthused with quality all thru it, Mary Poppins holds up well over forty years since its release. The story is based on the Mary Poppins books written by Pamela Travers, and what a crackerjack story this adaptation turns out to be.Mother & Father Banks advertise for a nanny to tend their rowdy children. The children, after being less than impressed with previous holders of the post, decide to write their own advertisement. But Father Banks tears it up and puts it on the fire place ready for burning. The torn paper mysteriously floats up the chimney and finds its way to Mary Poppins who glides down from the sky with her umbrella to fill the vacancy. It's evident from this point that Mary is no ordinary nanny, and all she comes into contact with will have their lives changed for ever.Mary takes the children on a series of delightful journeys that take in meeting an array of interesting people and animals, and it's thru these wonderful escapades that we the audience live vicariously thru. The film has all the hallmarks of a Disney classic, wonderful songs from Richard & Robert Sherman, animation fusing delightfully with live action, colour to dazzle the eyes, and of course a charming and career making performance from Julie Andrews. Much has been made of Dick van Dyke's woeful cockney accent, and in truth it's almost cringe inducing, but his performance is so brim full of gusto and effervescent fun, we should surely let it go in the name of splendid entertainment values.The restoration job done on the 40th anniversary DVD does the film proud, and it's hopefully opened up the film to be seen more by the modern day audience, because Mary Poppins is an ode to joy, an ode to good behaviour, and basically an ode to being practically perfect--just like Mary herself actually.Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 9/10",

            "content": "Years ago a friend excitedly told me 'My Fair Lady' was being restored, and my immediate reaction was to think that the only worthwhile restoration would be one that replaced Audrey Hepburn with Julie Andrews.But Shaw's loss was P. L. Travers' gain and Andrews was practically the only thing about this glossy, overlong travesty that never leaves the studio that Travers liked. (Although Disney did her the courtesy of giving her a credit as ''Consultant' it's unlikely that she got consulted much, and what she really thought of the end result is evident from the fact that she never authorised a sequel.) Another thing that Travers did like, however, was 'Feed the Birds'; which moved me to add another point to my rating.The one moment in the entire film that captures the rather remote and mysterious Ms Poppins of the original book - and one of the few understated moments in the entire movie - is the first appearance of Mary seen from behind in long shot sitting on a cloud; but already the noisy music score signals what to expect.The special effects now look primitive, but CGI will probably look even more dated in sixty years time; and at least the camera isn't constantly swaying about in steadicam the way it is today.Dick Van Dyke's Cockney accent has been much mocked, but the gusto with which he throws himself into the part amply compensates; and if you can buy dancing animated penguins, singing suffragettes (featuring rather earlier than they did historically since the film is set in 1910), mechanical robins and a talking umbrella, what's a silly accent between friends?(P. S. Van Dyke as the bank president manages to look even older than he now does at 95; and this must be one of the very few films from the early sixties in which three of the four leads are still with us.)",

I was 7 when it came out, saw it twice in the theaters at the time, and of course have seen it over and over since then. I'm going to get the 40th anniversary DVD soon. You can argue about Dick Van Dyke playing an Englishman, about Julie Andrews being too sweet and young compared to the character in literature, about the fact that the whole thing was obviously shot on a soundstage. But just imagine being 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or anywhere near there, and not getting out of your small town in the rust belt of the U.S. except maybe a few times a year on holidays, and you can imagine what seeing this magical, albeit Disneyfied, look at another world must have been like. Every time I see it, I think back to the beautiful old movie theater in which I saw it (a block away from the Catholic school I then attended, no less), to getting my mother to buy a certain box of cereal so I could get the Mary Poppins prize inside, to gathering on weekends with cousins to listen to the soundtrack and try to dance like Bert.

I loved the animated sequence and I was scared of (and bored by) the chimney sweep sequence because of these soot-faced sweeps shouting and dancing, I couldn't tell if they were friends or foe. Years later, I watched this in HBO, and I've had a chance to reevaluate it. Brimming beneath Mary Poppins's prim nanny exterior is mischief, subversion and anarchy, and I love the idea she goes around England teaching children to have fun under the thin guise of \"proper British behavior\". The key song is \"Spoonful of Sugar\", which is an almost zen-like attitude, with the correct leverage, your finger can turn a boulder into powder, with the correct attitude, an ant can move a rubber-tree plant. However, the song that made me fall in love with the movie forever is, \"Feed the Birds\". Compassion for the useless is precisely the point. There is no pragmatism in love. I've been a teacher for four years now, and I've never cracked a joke with a smile yet, though I joke all the time. I always try to earn that delicious half second while the students process, is he joking or is he serious? It's my pale imitation of Andrews as Poppins.

            "content": "Although I loved this film upon first seeing it at the theater in '64, it wasn't until I was an adult that I began to appreciate and be amazed by the sophistication of the writing. Sure, the special effects and the music and the visuals are what grab the attention, but the script itself and the lyrics offer just as much brilliance. I would even assert that this isn't a \"children's film\" at all, but a film aimed at adults under the guise of a kids' film. And that type of subversion is exactly what you'd expect from Mary Poppins. Her method from day one is to use reverse psychology on anyone she is trying to manipulate--in a good sense, of course. She teaches the children to give money to the poor by suggesting they \"feed the birds\". She gets them to fall asleep by sweetly singing \"Stay Awake\". She gets Mr. Banks to take the kids with him to work by acting as if it was his idea, and complimenting him for thinking of it. (A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.)The film's main character, dramatically speaking, is not Mary, nor the children. It is the father, George Banks. After all, he is the one who makes the film's primary transformation brought about by the presence of Mary Poppins. She is there to show him that his children are more important than money or his job, and once she has completed her task, she moves on. And that is the sort of message that the adults in the audience need to learn, not the children.As further evidence that this is a film aimed at adults, take a look at this line from \"Jolly Holiday\", when Mary sings to Bert:\"You'd never think of pressing your advantage. Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed. A lady needn't fear when you are near. Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!\"In these days when studios tend to pander to young audiences, desperate not to add anything that might bore them or be over their heads, it's refreshing to return to the days when films like \"Mary Poppins\" trusted in the integrity of its material.",

It's a light-hearted comedy and a delightful movie that is so much fun to watch. The movie looks dated for today's standards, but it is undeniably charming. In fact, its old-fashioned charm is timeless. It's a good movie and a classic, so the fact that it looks dated is not a major problem.It's easy to understand why \"Mary Poppins\" is such a beloved classic: its simplicity, its magic, its special/visual effects, its beautiful songs, its good morals, its charm, its characters, its classic humor, its combination of live-action and animation and great actors. The way how this combines live-action and animation is very good. Amazing for its time and keeps working out fine.The sceneries and landscapes of London city are stunning when Mary Poppins is floating on the air (angles of view never seen before or after this, not even in Peter Pan's movies). The walks through London's streets also allows us to know this beautiful city better, as well as its monuments and respective wonderful architecture. The landscapes through the roofs of London are simply amazing and the dancing numbers are excellent.\u00abSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\u00bb is the longest and strangest word I've ever heard. Definitely a nonsense but charming word. In fact, I had to practice this word for about a month. Now I can say it easily, but I had serious difficulties to say this word at first.\"Mary Poppins\" is an amusing and magical tale, with some valuable morals about family, education and stuff like that as well, combined with light humor.The characters are interesting in general. Bert is a very cool guy which a cheerful personality, a fine artist, an excellent dancer and speaks with a cockney accent. Dick Van Dyke is awesome as Bert and the way he dances is incredible. He was in excellent shape here. He really dances like Ray Bolger.The Banks children (Jane and Michael) are absolutely adorable. They're both sweet, innocent and so cute. Michael Banks is the funniest of the two, with his goofy faces in an adorable way and his hilarious way of being \u00abextremely stubborn and suspicious\u00bb. And they're portrayed by two of the most charismatic and talented child actors of all time: Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. It's really sad that Matthew Garber went to Heaven so young (at the age of 21).Mary Poppins is \u00abthe perfect nanny\u00bb. A magical woman who is also firm and serious but kind and cheerful. Great performance by Julie Andrews, one of her very best. Winifred Banks is a lovable mother, greatly portrayed by Glynis Johns. George Banks is a workaholic, impatient, cold and very serious father most of the time, but at the end of the movie he changes radically his attitudes and becomes a jolly and lovable father. Good performance by David Tomlinson.Uncle Albert is a character with a minor role but a strong presence. He's very jolly, maybe a little too much, but he's simply hilarious. Ed Wynn is awesome and hilarious as Uncle Albert, a role that resembles somehow the Mad Hatter from \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951) - a funny coincidence, because he was the voice of the Mad Hatter. I admit that at first the whole \"I Love to Laugh\" sequence was a little too much for me, but I quickly got used to it and ended up finding it great fun.The soundtrack is gold. There are so many lovely songs that it's difficult to chose a favorite. I have many favorites: \"The Perfect Nanny\", \"Let's go fly a kite\", \"Stay Awake\", \"The Carousel Horses\", \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\", \"Jolly Holliday\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", \"Sister Suffragette\", \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" and \"Penguin Dance\". On the other hand, \"A Man Has Dreams\", \"Step in Time\" and \"The Life I Lead\" are nice too, but my favorites are definitely the ones I listed first. The only song I don't like very much is \"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\". The only part I like in that song is \u00abYou'll see, Michael, you'll be part of railways through Africa, dams across the Nile, fleets of ocean greyhounds, majestic, self-amortizing canals, plantations of ripening sea\u00bb.Oh, I love the merry-go-round and the carousel horses of this movie. They're all beautiful. The merry-go-round has a very nostalgic effect for me - it reminds me about childhood. The merry-go-round was so much fun to be in. I also like the animated characters, especially the penguins and the fox.",

Had they seen the same film I had?Of course they had: it's just that someone had got it wrong; and as it turned out, it was me.  I still think that anyone who calls `Mary Poppins' Disney's finest is being silly - Disney's finest hour was clearly the one that saw `Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo' and `Bambi' - but what we have here is a fine, clever film, NOT overly sweet.What won me over was the ending.  David Tomlinson changes from a mechanical banker to a human being with surprising fluency.  It's not any one scene: it's the entire extended sequence, from the run on the bank to the end credits.  And it's not just Tomlinson's acting, either, but the long, lingering shots of him standing and walking in darkness, and a use of music that's far more sophisticated than I'd first supposed it to be, the general intelligence of the script.  The last lines given to Mary Poppins I'd missed the point of the first time round.  She's a riddle throughout the film which the film's conclusion partially, but only partially, unravels.Considered as a musical `Mary Poppins' lacks something.  WHAT it lacks is revealed when we hear the Jane and Michael tramping around the house singing `Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' (a great song, by the way) - and they GET THE TUNE WRONG.  They get it wrong in exactly the irritating way that children WOULD get it wrong.  This may be an inspired touch of realism, but it surely violates the ethos of musicals, as do the deeply pedestrian songs `Stay Awake', `Sister Suffragette' and `A Spoonful of Sugar'.  This was the side of `Mary Poppins' I'd remembered.  I'd forgotten the haunting quality of `Feed the Birds' and `Let's Go Fly a Kite', and the punch of the score as a whole.So anyway, I'm now a convert.  I can't find anything to seriously object to except Dick Van Dyke's ludicrous accent, which makes him sound almost, but not quite, like Bugs Bunny.",

However, as I got older and saw it again, I realized how delightful the film was--and am glad I gave it another try. Now, many years later, I have seen it several more times--including today. And, it still manages to make me smile.The film has many nice things going for it--some of the best songs of any of the Disney films, fine acting and a nice family-centered plot. Julie Andrews is just great, though I have heard that Brits actually often laugh at Dick Van Dyke's accent in the film--as it's apparently not even close to being correct. Still, if this is the big complain about the film, then it's hardly worth mentioning. Exceptional in every way.Now I am going to point out something that bothers me. Because I love this movie so much, I took my oldest daughter to see the play \"Mary Poppins\" when we were in New York. Although the play is wildly successful, we both disliked it a lot. Now the folks that acted in it were great and the sets were the best we've ever seen in a play. But, the characters themselves were NOT who they were in the film. Mary Poppins was more cold and self-centered and Mr. Banks physically abused the kids!!! Whose sick ideas were these?! And, while the play kept many of the songs, it skipped some of the best ones and introduced a few new ones instead--ones that just weren't as good. For example, they dropped \"I Love to Laugh\" and this entire subplot. Now you'd think maybe this was because of technical issues involving staging this live--but they then added a wall-walking scene that was VERY difficult to do. Odd. I DON'T recommend you see the play--just buy the film and save yourself some money--and have a better time as well.",

The new nanny is the wonderful and magical Mary Poppins, played by the beautiful Julie Andrews.Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is a street artist who knows Mary Poppins. She and the children meet him when they take a walk in the park and the four of them take a trip inside one of the paintings made by Bert. This painting is really painted and therefore this world is in animation. The way animation and live-action are combined in these scenes is wonderful. When it starts raining they have to leave the painting and return home where everybody is happy except the strict father George.A lot of other magical things happen with Bert, Mary Poppins and the children and in the meanwhile their father is having some trouble with his job. May be this gives him the time and the possibility to care for his children a little more.'Mary Poppins' is a delightful movie with great musical numbers. Some of the songs have become real classics. The special effects are very good, considering the time this movie was made, and the whole world of Mary Poppins looks great. The children are not annoying, something you see in a lot of movies. They do a pretty good job. David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns and of course Dick Van Dyke are very good and Julie Andrews is wonderful in every scene. This is a true classic.",

It's great fun, and its packed with amazing performances especially from the multi-talented and beautiful Julie Andrews.I saw it again recently, may be I have more capacity to understand the double sense of things now and found out that this film has so many subliminal great messages that are enriching for the mind and soul...As a little girl I never cried on this film, but it has got so many reasons to cry for(I'm crying now)because it truly is beautiful. The film can be good for children because it actually can stimulate the imagination, and the creativity of a kid, I for example tried to arrange my room by making sounds with my fingers at some point of my life! Still the film contains some messages that can be quite interesting and useful for any other person of any other age.SPOILERS***** Besides it contains some great effects, especially when you consider the time it was done(1964). Great dancing sequences, and especially those gorgeous songs(each one of them great). The animation part is brilliant, takes a genius to make that and coordinate those dancing penguins with the Bert character.And I think that all the words that I could possibly say about this film are over, except tat this film is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

            "content": "After watching MARY POPPINS RETURNS, the BankofMarquis was itching to check out the original 1964 Julie Andrews/Dick Van Dyke/Walt Disney production of MARY POPPINS to see if it holds up as well as my memory has held it up. I was a little nervous when I put the DVD in the player and hit go.And I shouldn't have worried, for MARY POPPINS is...pardon the expression...\"Practically Perfect in Every Way\".Based on the series of books by P.L. Travers and set right around 1900, the film tells the tale of the London Banks' Family - Mr., Mrs., Jane and Michael - who need a new nanny. Both parents are too busy to spend time with their children - he with his job at the Bank (get it - Mr. Banks works at a Bank) and her involvement in the Women's Suffragette movement. Into their lives flies (quite literally) Mary Poppins - a nanny with magical qualities who, along with her friend and cohort Bert, casts a spell on the children - and the Banks' family.Julie Andrews earned the Oscar for Best Actress for her feature film debut - and it is richly deserved. Her Poppins is stern, smart, brassy and loving - oh...and a marvelous singer and dancer. Just as strong as Andrews is Dick Van Dyke as Bert (though some will quibble with his Cockney accent). I say...don't worry about his accent and watch the wonderful comedic timing, dancing and joi de vivre that Van Dyke brings to this film. He is the \"secret sauce\" that makes this work. Julie would not be as good - nor would this film be as interesting - without Bert by her side.EVERY major player shines in this film from David Tomlinson's befuddled, straight-laced British Gentleman Mr. Banks to Glynnis Johns as the enthusiastic supporter of Votes for Women, Mrs. Banks, to the children - Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Special notice should be made to Ed Wynn who's one scene/song/cameo as Uncle Albert - the \"I Love To Laugh\" scene - is pure gold.Even the smaller, supporting roles are stellar. Reta Shaw and Hermione Baddely as the \"domestics\", Arthur Treacher (yes - he, of FISH AND CHIPS fame) as the Constable and Reginald Owen (Scrooge in the 1930's version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL) as Admiral Boom are all fun to watch and match the energy and timing of the leads in their limited screen time.And...the music...Oh, the Music! Written by Richard M and Robert B Sherman - these songs are classic. Starting with the Oscar Winner for Best Song - Chim Chim Cheree and continuing through Feed The Birds, I Love To Laugh, Jolly Holiday and Let's Go Fly A Kite - ALL the songs are magical and lend a hand to the story - they serve a purpose and are not just a distraction. This film is worth watching just for the rooftop Step-In-Time song and dance number alone.But the thing that makes this film go is the story - the characters, settings, costumes, songs and dances - are all in service to a touching, sentimental (but not cloying) simple story of a family coming together. It is charming in it's simplicity and leaves everyone with a heart full of joy.Surprisingly to a modern audience, the special effects (especially the \"Live Action and Animation\" sequence) holds up really, really well. It is amazing to me how strong these effects are - even over 50 years later.This is a wonderful, heartfelt family film that deserves a re-watch if you haven't seen it in awhile.Letter Grade A+10 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",

Julie Andrews was right on target when she received her academy award and thanked Jack Warner for turning her down in the film version of My Fair Lady. She conveys both dignity and warmth as Mary. Dick van Dyke had the chance of a lifetime to demonstrate the breadth of his talents, especially his dancing, which could not be fully exploited on his TV series. Disney gave real depth to the film through his use of Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher, Reginald Owen, Ed Wynn and (especially) Jane Darwell (who is cited in the IMDb biography as best known for her cameo portrayal of the Bird Lady, despite her 1940 Academy Award for one of the great all-time performances in Grapes of Wrath). I computed the ages of the five as reaching 418 years when the film was released; their film careers covered 193 combined years, with stage careers going back as far as 1905. Disney's casting of these, as well as a group of accomplished British actors of stage and film demonstrated what should be meant by \"supporting cast\": it gave strong support against which Andrews and Van Dyke could perform without being under to carry the entire film. Finally: If someone wants to appreciate the care that went into the film, s/he should purchase the new 40th anniversary DVD. Viewing the interviews and other documents enabled me to increase my already great enjoyment. They do not \"murder to dissect\"; quite the contrary.",

She works wonders on the family, in particular taking the children on a number of adventures with Bert (Dick van Dyke), the local Jack-of-all-trades.Everybody has seen this movie, but I'll review it anyway; it is a bona-fide classic, not because it is an old film, but because it has endured. The film isn't a dirty picture and will delight the little ones, yet underneath this, there is something for adults to obtain. Just as their kids will, they will love the songs, be blown away by the novelty animated segment and will marvel at the special effects, which hold up even in today's CGI obsessed world. Yet adults will also be able to unlock the endearing layers of the story, which are simultaneously simple and complex and thoroughly beautiful.

After the first half hour I thought, \"Wow, I can see why this is such a beloved movie\" but after that it started to lag in a number of areas and the songs were just too numerous. It seemed to go on way too long. Yet, it's a good film worthy of anyone's collection. In my case, I may just skip over some of the songs, such as Ed Wynn's laughing on the ceiling scene with goes on forever, or Julie Andrews singing the kids to sleep. Condensed a bit, this 139-minute movie would be more watchable.The DVD transfer is very good: nice rich colors and reasonably sharp for a 40- year-old film. Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing. The kids are kind of stupid-looking, as are their parents.The other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression. However, on the DVD, one can use the English subtitles when he speaks. Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent.

The chimney sweep number alone is worth the price of admission and songs such as \"Chim-Chim-Cheree\", \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" and \"Let's Go Fly A Kite\" are integrated wisely into whatever sequence they grace. The wistful \"Feed the Birds\" (sung by Julie as birdlady Jane Darwell does just that) is one of its nicest ballads.Furthermore, the comic contributions of DICK VAN DYKE (as Bert, the chimney sweep), GLYNIS JOHNS and David TOMLINSON as the confused parents, and a brood of other lively characters, are not to be underestimated.By all means, the kind of family entertainment that will fascinate any child who has ever fantasized about taking magical trips to other places rather than just a trip to the zoo.JULIE ANDREWS fully deserved her Oscar as the world's most wonderful nanny, as popularized in the novels of P.L. Travers. Her success in the role makes it even more of a shame that Jack L. Warner decided not to cast her as Eliza in MY FAIR LADY. However, winning for POPPINS was Julie's trump card.",

We should all have nannies like Mary Poppins as Julie Andrews realizes her.When the wind changes Mary Poppins answers a call and in this case a nanny for the Banks household in Great Britain before World War I.

David Tomlinson is a banker with a banker's precise habits and mother Glynis Johns is a kind woman, but wrapped up in her cause for women's suffrage. These kids are neglected, but not for long.When Mary Poppins answers the children's request for a nanny after some magical elimination of other candidates. Julie Andrews takes the Banks children on her own kind of magical mystery tour aided and abetted by Dick Van Dyke as Bert, a most resourceful chimney sweep. Disney's imaginative mixture of animation and live action on these excursions was never better.From both sides of the pond this cast was assembled and the whole ensemble was never better. If the Academy was giving an award for ensemble performances, Mary Poppins would have copped six Oscars instead of the five it got. Such people as Don Barclay and Jane Darwell gave their farewell performances in Mary Poppins. Ed Wynn was a player that Disney put to good use in his last years and never in better use than as Uncle Albert the laughing flying fool.Mary Poppins took home five Oscars for Original Score, Film Editing and Special Effects. The Sherman Brothers score got an additional award for Best Song as Chim Chim Cheree was singled out. Although it is identified with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke actually sang it more in the film. And of course Julie Andrews won for Best Actress. This and The Sound Of Music established her as a movie legend just as Camelot and My Fair Lady cemented her legend on Broadway. To this day I'll never understand why Jack Warner chose Audrey Hepburn over her for My Fair Lady, but Warner's loss was Disney's immense gain. Besides the five wins Mary Poppins racked up eight more nominations from the Academy.The music, the acting, the animation, the special effects. It doesn't get better than this.

In turn this affects their parents who end up loving the kids AND paying attention to them.I want to make this clear--I DO love Disney movies. \"Bambi\", \"Fantasia\", \"Aladdin\", \"Beauty and the Beast\" are all classics. This one, however leaves me cold. For starters it's far too long--140 minutes. Just try to get a kid to sit that long through a movie. Also Andrews doesn't work. She sings beautifully (of course) but she plays Poppins as firm (VERY firm) and always telling the kids what to do. She almost never even smiles! The kids themselves are annoying, Johns plays her part WAY too broadly and Tomlinson doesn't even try to act. The story meanders all over the place and has a LONG dance number involving the chimney sweeps. While I don't deny that the dancing is incredible it adds nothing to the story and brings the movie to a screeching halt. On the plus side the special effects are incredible (even by today's standards) and there's a beautiful elaborate sequence where Andrews, the kids and Dick Van Dyke spend time in a world where everything is animated. Van Dyke overacts to an incredible degree but his singing and dancing make up for it. Also there are the songs that have become classics--\"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Supercalifragilisticeexpialidocious\" and \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\".

            "content": "Christmas is a time when the TV channels normally wheel out classic family movies, and this Boxing Day I caught \"Mary Poppins\", one of my favourite films as a child, but one which I had not seen for many years. The story is set in the London of 1910. Mary Poppins, a mysterious, magical figure blown in with the wind, takes a job as nanny to Jane and Michael, the children of George Banks, a well-to-do banker. Mr Banks hopes that Mary will reform his occasionally unruly children's behaviour, but it soon becomes clear that it is really their parents who need reforming. George, a stern Edwardian paterfamilias, pays more attention to his work than he does to his family, and his wife Winifred is too preoccupied with political good causes to have much time for her children. This was the film which Walt Disney tried to make for over twenty years. In the 1930s he had promised his young daughters that he would make a film of their favourite \"Mary Poppins\" books. For a long time, however, it appeared that Disney would be unable to fulfil his promise. The main obstacle was the author of the books, Pamela Travers, who disliked the idea of her books being filmed, especially by Disney whom she considered a vulgar showman; when she finally relented in 1961 it is said that she was prompted more by financial difficulties than by a genuine change of heart. The story of Disney's battle with Travers is told in the recent \"Saving Mr Banks\". I have not read Travers' books since my childhood, but I recall that her Mary was a rather strict middle-aged figure. Here she is played by Julie Andrews as young, beautiful, gentle and kind-hearted. Now it is a truth universally acknowledged in Hollywood, that a single woman in possession of youth, beauty, gentleness and a kind heart, must be in want of a husband, or at least a boyfriend. Universally acknowledged, that is, by everyone except Pamela Travers. Disney wanted to introduce a romance between Mary and Bert, the Cockney jack-of-all-trades played by Dick Van Dyke, but Travers resolutely vetoed this, so their relationship had to remain platonic. Two battles Travers fought and lost were over the Sherman Brothers' songs, which she disliked, and over the use of animation, which she loathed. (She was even badgering Disney to remove them during the party after the premiere; he replied laconically \"Pamela, that ship has sailed\", and walked away). I think we can be glad that she lost these battles. The musical score- cheerful, lively, witty and bursting with great tunes- is one of the film's best features; every time we saw it my sisters and I would be singing \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", \"Feed the Birds\" and \"Chim-Chim-Cher-ee\" for days. The Sherman Brothers, in fact, threw themselves energetically into their song-writing duties; they produced more than 30 original songs for the movie, most of which were never used. As for the animated sequences, they emphasise the fantastical, magical nature of the story, making it something more than just a mundane tale of London in the olden days. This is the film which made Julie Andrews, previously a well-known Broadway actress, into a huge international star. Her \"Best Actress\" Oscar must have been the most welcome form of consolation after her disappointment at being (controversially) passed over in favour of Audrey Hepburn for the role of Eliza in \"My Fair Lady\", a role which Andrews had created on Broadway. (The film as a whole was nominated for \"Best Picture\", the only such nomination Disney received in his lifetime). There are some good supporting performances, especially from David Tomlinson as George Banks, a man who beneath an outward mask of pomposity and severity is not quite the domestic tyrant he has always seemed. The weak link in the acting has traditionally been said to be Van Dyke, and this is one battle which I wished Travers had won. She wanted a British actor in the role, but Disney insisted on having someone familiar to American audiences. Van Dyke is good when it comes to dancing and general clowning around, but his attempt to sound like a Cockney has gone down in history as one of the worst cinema accents ever. Van Dyke could, in fact, do an acceptable British RP accent, as he shows in his cameo role as George's boss Old Mr Dawes, but our working-class and regional accents are notoriously difficult for American actors to imitate. Even Meryl Streep, Hollywood's resident dialect specialist, shied away from a West Country accent in \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\". The need to break the action occasionally so that people can break into song means that musicals generally take longer to tell their stories than \"straight\" films, and \"Mary Poppins\" is no exception. (Just think how lengthy it might have been had all those 30-odd songs made the final cut). The action does tend to flag in a few places; I felt that the \"Uncle Albert\" sequences went on a bit too long, both as a child and as an adult. Overall, however, it has stood the test of time well, and will doubtless entertain modern children as well as it did my generation. 8/10Some goofs.

The costumes, special effects, and charming scenery are all top-notch, and the Sherman brothers' songs have never been better. As a member of the board of the Hot Toasty Rag Awards, I very happily cast my vote for Miss Andrews in The Sound of Music instead. Hopefully she won't have hurt feelings that we \"righted the wrong\"; Mary Poppins did win Best Picture at the Rags.Ironically, I've probably watched Saving Mr. Banks more times than Mary Poppins, but seeing the struggles of how Disney created the film has given me a new appreciation for the 1964 classic. I didn't realize, until Tom Hanks spelled it out in the \"pseudo-prequel\", that David Tomlinson (why wasn't his part played by David Niven?) was the one who received the most help. I also didn't notice, until revisiting the movie as a grown-up, that Mary Poppins hardly does any work at all - it's Bert who has the great influence on the father!At two-and-a-half hours, the long running time makes it a perfect babysitter for your kids. You can wash the dishes, do the laundry, phone your mother, make dinner, clean all the bathrooms, and still make it back in time for \"Let's Go Fly a Kite\". Don't count on all that productivity, though. You'll have to stay to hear the opening music, and while you're still tapping your toe, Dick Van Dyke will charm you with his magnetic energy and sweet Cockney accent (why does he continue to apologize for it?). You'll figure you might as well stick around just until Julie Andrews shows up. \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" will remind you that the bathrooms do need cleaning, but it'll be more tempting to stick around for the chalk painting adventures instead. Oh, who are you kidding? The only times you'll leave the room are to make more popcorn.",

It came to my attention that the guy never had any dancing lessons. There are two showstoppers at least where my jaw dropped. The Disney animators were able to put him into scenes (way ahead of the advent of CGI) and allow him the freedom to do the most marvelous things. This is a very long movie for a musical comedy.

            "content": "The first time I saw Mary Poppins at the ripe old age of twelve, I was enthralled.  My sister had taken me to see it one evening using her own hard earned money.  The fact that admission was seventy-five cents when normally one could see a double feature for thirty-five cents as a kid was not lost on me either.   It meant my sister was treating me to something special and as it turned out it was most assuredly all of that and then some. \nFilms we view when we are young do not always hold the same appeal for us as we grow older.  As a youngster, I remember being fascinated by many films that I can hardly stand to sit through as an adult.  I loved anything with Jerry Lewis in it, yet there are less than a handful of his films I now find entertaining.   There were countless cheaply made horror films that scared the living daylights out of me that I laugh at now.  There were children films such as Pinocchio in Outer Space, even one with a mouse called Topo Gigio that are now long forgotten.  There are two films however that made an impression on me more than any others at an early age.  The first was the Cinerama presentation of How The West Was Won, the second was Mary Poppins. The question is whether or not I can view them in a favorable light as an adult.   I still enjoy How The West Was Won, but it has never had the impact on me as it did in Cinerama.   Today I viewed Mary Poppins again for the first time in a number of years and I can say that without question it is every bit as magical as it was back in 1965 when I first saw it.\nWhat is there not to like?  The story has heart, warmth, memorable characters, wonderful musical numbers, and a heaping dose of magic.  Mary Poppins is the nanny any child could hope to magically appear out of the sky with her umbrella and whisk us away to enchanted places that we can only dream of.   In this film, Mary Poppins comes flying down to earth because two children, Jane and Michael Banks, are being ignored by parents who are too preoccupied with their own problems.   It's not that they don't love their children, but they fail to recognize the importance of children being part of their lives, a message that forty years later still rings true for many parents.  Julie Andrew's Oscar worthy performance as Mary Poppins is perfection.  It would have been easy for the character to become either ridiculously silly or a caricature of someone in the mold of a TV. witch or genie.  The fact that we are able to view Mary Poppins as first and foremost a caring and loving nanny who just happens to have magical powers is what makes this film works, and can be attributed solely to Ms. Andrews.  The fact that Julie Andrews has one of the most magnificent singing voices to land on the big screen didn't hurt a bit either.David Tomlinson made two other films for the Disney studios, but his role as George Banks is the one for which he will always be remembered.  He too seems to strike just the right balance.  As the children's father, we are amused by his fussiness and his wish to achieve a perfectly ordered life, but put off by his ignorance in matters regarding his children.  The fact that we are able to see that despite his major character flaws he still loves his children keeps us from developing too much of a dislike for him.Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks is an odd kind of woman, especially for the early part of the twentieth century.  Her love for her two children also shines, yet her preoccupation with being a suffragette seems to override that fact.  Strangely though, she remains the loyal and obedient wife to her husband.  If there is one thing that always seems to be good about Disney films, it's the fact that Walt was able to find just the right child actors for any film.  As Jane and Michael, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are exceptional.  They appeared together in three films for the Disney studios and if you view this film you will understand why.There are many special effects sequences throughout Mary Poppins.   Some of them may be considered quite cryptic by today standards, but you won't mind. The animation sequence is done with bright, glowing colors, and the fact that someone in the costume design department matched up the perfect outfits for the live actors in the sequence helps add to the beauty of it all.  I'm still in awe of Dick Van Dyke's dance number with the penguins in that sequence.  The chimney sweep sequence which includes a walk among the London rooftops and a marvelously choreographed dance being done by chimney sweeps is remarkable.  You'll laugh along with Uncle Albert, and have a swell tea party on the ceiling. Even if you don't find the jokes particularly funny you'll laugh at the absurdity of the situation.The songs by the Sherman Brother are once in a lifetime perfect.  I can think of no Disney live action film where the musical numbers are so right from start to finish.   Chim-Chim-Cheree won the Oscar for best song but it could just as easily have been to the less catchy numbers Stay Awake or Feed The Birds in my opinion.  Both are beautiful, lyrical songs that show the depth and range of Julie Andrew's voice.It takes a very special film that one can love as a child; yet as an adult appreciate the craftsmanship even more.   That puts Mary Poppins in a class by itself. My score: A+",

Travers, Mary Poppins is the story of a magical super nanny who descends from the heavens to look after the Banks' children, Michael and Jane, while their father is struggling with work and life. Played by Julie Andrews, Mary transports the children into magical adventures in beautiful, often cartoon, Worlds. Occasionally Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, joins the adventures - he's a friendly chimney sweep who knows of, and believes in the legend of Mary Poppins. While the adventures are fun and the worlds are wonderful, there are usually hidden lessons and virtues in everything that Mary instils into the children, so while they are clinging onto the innocence and adventure of youth, they are also learning important life lessons.Mary Poppins is one of my single most favourite films of all time, partly due to being brainwashed as my mum used to put me in front of this or \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" to get some peace and quiet for herself. Some of the songs that featured in this film still just trickle off my tongue years (and years) later. Images of Mary and the places she visits have become part of modern culture - the image of a nanny floating to earth using an umbrella has made it into Olympic Games opening ceremonies and is an iconic image that has become synonymous with England. Ignoring Dick Van Dykes often parodied cockney accent, there isn't really much bad that I can say about this film, low points of the film are saved by charm and beauty or a catchy song. The added animation was revolutionary for me when I saw this as a child, and although dated now, it still holds up better than some modern attempts at mixing live action and hand drawn cells. Andrews and Van Dyke have such a wonderful chemistry on screen and bounce of one and other - it's clear to see why Andrews won a Best Actress award for her role. Mary Poppins is probably one of the finest family movies of all time and if you haven't seen it, I implore you watch it. I want it to be absolutely clear, my bread and butter in films is horror and action - but I am hand-on-heart confident in my appraisal of this movie as one of the best musicals, one of the best Disney films, one of the best family films of all time. Easily a 9 out 10 from me.",

            "content": "On the surface, Mary Poppins is a lighthearted saccharine sweet confection consisting of singalong tunes, wondrous fantasy, and energetic dance routines, with an enchanting tale of two children who wish only for the love and respect of their parents. Into their lives comes rosy cheeked paragon of perfection, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), a magical nanny who can turn their lives around with a click of her fingers.However, scratch off this candy-coated veneer, dig a little deeper and one will find a much darker message: that to accept reality and responsibility is dull and that it is far better to live a frivolous and care-free life. Whilst I agree that all work and no play certainly makes Jack a dull boy, Mary Poppins' idealistic philosophy is simplistic and, dare I say it, potentially harmful.Poppins' close pal, chirpy Cockney Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a waster with no ambition other than to do whatever the hell he likes, is presented as a cheeky and lovable 'working class hero' and someone to look up to, whilst the children's father, a hard working banker, is presented as the villain of the piece. With a skewed set of values such as this, why is it that Mary Poppins is so popular? Because the vast majority of people seem to be unable to see beyond the admittedly impressive dazzling musical set-pieces, the uplifting songs and the sickly sweet notion that, above all else, a parent must devote their lives to pleasing their kids.So, besides dodgy values, what else can one expect from this Disney 'classic'? First, the positives: The musical numbers are, as expected, top notch, with both Andrews and Van Dyke in fine form when it comes to hoofing it up in umpteen visually astounding set pieces (a rooftop chimney-sweep sequence getting my vote for best moment in the film); Andrews is great as Poppins, and delivers some memorable and catchy songs (she also looks pretty damn fine\u0097particularly in that corset!).Now the negatives: Dick Van Dyke's accent is excruciating to listen to, and makes the film painful to endure at times; the film is way too long and many moments could have been excised without harming the narrative; and a silly and implausible tacked-on 'happy' ending takes far too much swallowing.Whilst undemanding kids will probably find Mary Poppins entertaining enough, those parents forced to watch along with them will most likely find the whole thing too much to take.",

            "content": "O.K., she taught us how to snap. She let us know that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. She taught us that a very long word, even if said backwards, can really help when you've nothing else to say. She also taught us that it is really the parents' responsibility to raise their children and a true nanny is only good when she gets the sometimes too distracted mommy and daddy to realize this. Ironically, while it will be Julie Andrews who will always be identified with this, her Oscar winning film debut, it was Mary Wickes, the delightfully crabby nun from two Roz Russell movies and the \"Sister Act\" films who originated this part on television years before. So Mary isn't all rosy cheeks and prim and proper with a sense of fun in addition to the much needed discipline. In certain eyes, she was a bit crusty, but for the stage musical what did they choose? The Julie Andrews look, of course!That disappointing musical made the rather dark story even darker by the inclusion of Mr. Banks' former nanny, an evil harpy who feeds her wards brimstone and treacle in one of the worst new songs heard on Broadway since the beginning of the millennium. The movie was appropriately dark for what it was all about, and the night scenes of London are perfect for the \"gaslight\" era of Jack the Ripper and other sordid criminals. Here, Mary pops in out of nowhere when exhausted nanny Elsa Lanchaster walks out with barely a goodbye. Suffragette mom Glynis Johns is too busy fighting for votes for women to take care of the kids while pop David Tomlinson is a stuffy account manager at an even stuffier bank. Chimney sweep and all-around Mr. Fix-It Dick Van Dyke is Mary's old pal who sings like a dream, dances with Ray Bolger like rubber legs and encourages the kids thanks to his uncle Ed Wynn to laugh their way to a tea party on the ceiling.There are so many delightful moments in this, partially animated, and the Oscar-Winning Supercalafragilisticexpialidotious is certainly memorable, even if I prefer \"Feed the Birds\" as the best song in the film. Veteran Oscar Winner Jane Darwell is haunting as the bird lady in one of the most memorable cameos in film history. The \"Jolly Holiday\" dance is certainly one of the most memorable sequences ever on film, and the \"Step in Time!\" number, while well choreographed, seems pointless towards the plot. All of the performances are spit-spot dead on, from Andrews as the stern but loving Mary (who I think could use a few pointers in real affection from her next nanny role, Maria Rainer in \"The Sound of Music\") to Van Dyke, certainly as worthy of praise and awards as Andrews was to the cute little kiddies. Glynis Johns, long before begging for the clowns to be sent in, is a delightfully dizzy and busy mother, and Tomlinson memorably efficient as the father. Other cameos include Reginald Owen, Reta Shaw and Hermoine Baddley, and are very amusing.This is a film that has a great reputation but seems overshadowed by Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"The Sound of Music\" and \"My Fair Lady\". I don't think there's the extreme likability quotient of those two big movie musicals. Many people are disgruntled over Andrews' winning of the Oscar over Debbie Reynolds' Molly Brown, and I slightly agree. But if this is a charity prize for Andrews not getting to repeat her Eliza role in the movie version of \"My Fair Lady\", I can think of worse choices for the award that have been given the prize.",

Nor does one consider Dick Van Dyke to be more than the rubber faced comic who performed as the amiable Rob Petrie on the television show that bore his name.

And in doing so, show their business obsessed father how to be a Dad in a world that too often doesn't have time for it's youngsters. The film is a mix of classic Disney animation and joyful live action with a sprinkling of catchy tunes that you'll be singing to yourself for a couple of days afterward. I can't remember when or where I first heard them, but songs like 'Spoonful of Sugar' and that Super etcetera, etcetera one have a tendency to linger in one's mind for a considerable length of time. Julie Andrews was made for the role of Mary Poppins, and Van Dyke clearly is allowed to strut his stuff in a way that demonstrates his versatility as an actor. You only got a hint of that in that opening scene of 'The Dick Van Dyke' show when he dancingly sidesteps the ottoman in his way; here he's hopping all over the place. The only thing that made me go huh? in the picture was during that tea party on the ceiling scene. Ed Wynn was classic as Uncle Albert by the way, but it seemed out of character for Mary to be so down on the 'laugh out loud' aspect of Albert's character. Here she was trying to convey a sense of wonder and happiness to her two young wards, and frowning upon those ridiculous jokes seemed out of place. But that aside, I had a pretty good time with the picture, and if I had to pick a favorite scene, I thought the penguin sequence with Bert (Van Dyke) was very cleverly done.",

She is a magical nanny arriving one day on the East Wind and takes over a household of a very proper London banker . As the beloved and nearly perfect nanny, Mary Poppins, descends from the sky to lend a hand . As the good family is visited by the enigmatic Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) following other maids . Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend Bert , a pavement artist , she helps the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives. She introduces her two charges (Matthew Garber, Karen Dotrice) to her friends , the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke with a pawky cockney accent) and eccentric uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) . All of them embark on a magical adventure, and what is more exciting, they will even get to find happiness again. Is there anything that a dash of optimism can't cure? See It Again and Again with that Supercalifragilistic Music! . In a place we hold dear, where wonder once lived... but soon from above, a fantastic story begins. This Christmas, when you lose your way, just remember the magic always returns. It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!Based on the books by P. L. Travers taking the magic , adventure , happiness , optimism and good feeling from the fantastic novels . Julie Andrews in her film debut as the maid who changes the lives of everyone in the family , from her they learn that life can always be happy and joyous if you take the proper perspective . Andrews was unjustly ignored for the movie version of \u00a8My Fair Lady\u00a8 by George Cukor , in spite of Julie played on stage , being replaced by Audrey Hepburn , but Julie bounced back to win an Academy Award as the magical mystery nanny who changes the lives of of the Banks family for the better . Andrews is great in the title role and sings ever so sweetly , including charming songs being well composed by musician Irwin Kostal . The songs and dance numbers are attractively laid on , with Dick Van Dyke as Mary's Cockney beau , giving a fun acting and dancing splendidly , as well . Dick Van Dyke is awesome and dancing his way to movie stardom . Look for the marvellous sequence where Van Dyke as cheerfully resourceful sweep, and one-man band dances with animated penguins , along with the chimney sweeps on the rooftops . Support cast are frankly fabulous , such as Edd Wynn as uncle who floats when he laughs , and the likable parents : David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns are delightful. Don't forget to stay tuned for the last line of the credits . A Disney classic that hasn't lost any lost any of its magic . It displays a colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Edward Colman , Walt Disney's regular. The motion picture was stunningly directed by Robert Stevenson. He was a a prestigious director and writer, who used to work for Walt Disney factory , and known for Mary Poppins (1964), Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) and Tudor Rose (1936). He is the only director to be nominated for the Best Director Academy Award for directing a Disney movie. He has directed two films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant : Old Yeller (1957) and Mary Poppins (1964).Followed many years later by \u00a8Mary Poppins Returns\u00a8 (2018) by Rob Marshall with Emily Blunt , Ben Whishaw , Julie Walters , Colin Firth , Meryl Streep, Lin-Manuel Miranda , Emily Mortimer , Pixie Davies. This sequel to the 1964 Disney film 'Mary Poppins' opens in London, England during a time that is being called a Great Slump , the Great Depression of the 1930s.",

The wonderful Glynis Johns (who should also be honored with Damehood like Julie) is fantastic as Mrs. Banks. The children, Michael and Jane, are also great performers. I can't forget Elsa Lancaster as the last nanny before Mary Poppins. The film is a timeless classic for children and adults. I remember as a child watching it on television before the popularity of DVDs and VHS cassettes.

You are likely to enjoy the songs, the actors or/and the story. Those who have read the book/s may think of this as a little bit of a mess of P.L Travers's work, but of course if you haven't read them then you will definitely think otherwise. This film also has a good amount of humour, performed mainly by Julie Andrews and Glynnis John ( :-) ). Whatever you have read the book or not, you will love this film in at least one little way or another. If you do not, then I am sorry that I have failed you and maybe you like horror films or something like that. If I have not, then I am glad you enjoyed this and maybe then you will be interested in reading the book. Recommended to: Families and people who like musicals. Enjoy! :-)",

Instead of a cinema feature aimed for a long release at the best cinemas in the country, Stevenson obviously thought Disney's best bet was a quick salvage sale to TV. Nevertheless, despite Stevenson's lack of cinema craftsmanship and some obvious deficiencies in Dick Van Dyke's performance, this film is still a delight. It's packed out with catchy songs, eye-catching sets and superb, absolutely faultless special effects. The story provides a wonderfully magical combination of whimsy, fancy and fantasy - all of it superbly realized. Perhaps some of the cartoon creatures are a bit too cute, but the magnificent sets and rollicking choreography allied with the never-ending magic carpet of surprises and effects, plus such excellent performances and delightful singing...",

            "content": "A big part of me would like to describe this movie with the word \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\" Unfortunately, if I'm being honest, it doesn't warrant that kind of superlative. It's an entertaining movie, great for kids if a little bit long for their attention span, with a number of noticeable weaknesses carried along for the ride and featuring a cast who were all good, but who could all do better, as they would subsequently prove. The first thing that interested me was that although Julie Andrews was playing the title character as the mysteriously magical nanny who turns a prim and proper British household upside down, she wasn't really the movie's star. To me, that was clearly Dick Van Dyke as Bert, who injected most of the fun into the movie, albeit doing it with a pathetically phoney Cockney (?) accent. David Tomlinson was along for the ride as Mr. Banks, the head of the household into which Mary Poppins literally falls.Of the three leads, Andrews' talent was underused - as would become clear after \"The Sound of Music\" the following year, Van Dyke - while he injected fun into the movie - seemed to lack the energy that he displayed a few years later in the somewhat similar \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (which I thought was marginally better than this) and Tomlinson put on a better performance a few years after that in \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" (which I didn't think was as good as this.) As for the movie itself, there was some successful mixing of live action/animation (although that bit went on too long) and some decent enough special effects for 1964, although the sets weren't especially realistic. Overall, it's a good movie; one that I would describe as solid but not spectacular. 7/10",

MARY POPPINS is hardly an exception but at the same time it is too cute and bewitchingly edifying to dislike, it had also been a sensational triumph hark back to its time, what admiring is also the avant-garde technology in the film industry per se, the mash-up of real people and the animation, is my favorite and the dancing sequences of the chimney workers is such a scene without tainting its fame after more than half a century. After all it's a family film which I may have watched it belatedly and the cartoonish characterizations are outmoded, still its overwhelming victory in the Oscars (5 wins including a BEST ACTRESS win for the novice Julie Andrews) is too merciful for the film, for nowadays it is quite impossible to imagine a family-film could sweep like that, actually I think Dick Van Dyke's strenuous effort merits more applause indeed!",

            "content": "Watching Mary Poppins for the first time since I was a child, I began musing on the difference between watching this movie as an adult as opposed to the Wizard of Oz. Oz is, like most child-friendly movies of the 30s and 40s, a piece of entertainment focused on children but aimed at everyone. This is why it holds up so beautifully.Poppins, on the other hand, is focused not on children as subject (the children are simply participants in the lives of unusual adults) but on a child's eye view of the world. This works great if you're a kid, but as an adult, the movie's episodic structure, superficial characterizations and lack of real drama (Oz was a far more intense emotional experience) feels a little dull and definitely childish.Mary Poppins has some very good elements. Julie Andrews is excellent as the magical, no-nonsense nanny. Dick Van Dyke, in spite of the awful accent, uses his distinctive physicality well, especially in the marvelous chimney sweep number Step in Time (which I probably didn't care for as a child; I wasn't much into long musical extravaganzas). Performances are quite good, and there are amusing moments throughout.Mary Poppins is typical of the very kid-focused approach of their 1960s movies, which I loved growing up but which don't hold up to adult viewings the way movies like Miracle on 34th Street or Toy Story do. If I had a kid, I would certainly want them to see this one, but as an adult, I wouldn't care to watch it again.",

It is not focused on children but mostly on the grown-ups around them. Mary Poppins appears out of nowhere and leaves just as fast, dumping the children who got attached to her. Some of the songs seem completely unrelated to the story (the woman feeding the birds, etc\u0085) and are quite sad, Mrs. Banks has almost no part of the story, Mr. Banks has way too much, but he seems a deranged character. There are too many song and dance numbers, some very loud, most overlong. Some scenes are irrelevant to the plot development (if there is any) and there is a lot of banking and old men, none in the least entertaining.The only part I liked was the one with the animation, which I just discovered, was the one the author (PL Travers) hated most. Actually, she hated the whole movie, but for reasons different from mine.

I am no child now but i wish i was to enjoy the fantasy film keeping all the review stuff aside for a while. It doesn't really matter because i am 28 and i still loved watching Mary Poppins. I just wish i had seen it in childhood and it would have became one of those nostalgic memento of my life. Although Mary Poppins is a fairy tale, many people believed the main message came out of it. Life is a busy horse and one must learn to rein it on right time. Walt Disney's fantasy world seems quite enjoyable with delightful music and meaningful lyrics. The art direction and editing at some places is treat to watch. That one entire scene of Painting World is absolutely marvellous. Julia Andrews get an unforgettable feature film debut as she looks elegant as Mary Poppins just as they required Rosy cheeks, blue eyes and Kind. Divk Van Dyke does some terrific dancing moves and thoss childrens Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber brings the naturalism into thier cute characters. David Tomlinson as strict and driven father looks convincing while Glynis Johns as his wife is Decent. Director Robert Stevenson made a few changes in the script from the original book but got all of them right, also he presented a live action animated film so accurately for that era. The film won 5 Oscars competiting another Musical Classic 'My Fair Lady' and that says so much about it being awesome. Overall, Mary Poppins is a pleasant musical fantasy that can be enjoyed by all ages and I wouldn't mind if it comes true in my life.\nRating- 7/10*",

            "content": "I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good.London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life.Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube.Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!",

            "content": "Warning do not read unless seen movie.One of the things I love about the fantasy genre is how in some of the positive stories it really can give you a good feeling even in times when you down, by showing you there really is a bigger world out there beyond your own sight or your own current existence. This is another one of my favorite fantasy films of all time, I've seen this when I was about 7 years old I loved it them and even as an adult I love it now. As a kid as I said I was really into the fantasy genre, seeing a lady flying with an umbrella, being this fantastic being, and taking kids on an extraordinary fantasy adventure it really blew me away.The setting is unique as it takes place in London in the 1900 which is a perfect setting as it's was the turn of the century, a time of great change when new ideas and ideals were on the rise and certain old customs and thinking was starting to go out of fashion. Really like the story which is sort of the guardian angel motif but here it's done in a sort of quirky fairy tale like fashion. I really love the concept of the hidden fantasy world in the contemporary existence which was unique at the time, though now common place in the genre with shows like \"The Adventures of Pete and Pete\", \"Sailor Moon\", etc.Julie Andrews is just perfect as Mary Poppins, this is my favorite role from her as she truly is this character much as Christopher Reeve is \"Superman\" or Gene Wilder is \"Willy Wonka\". Anyway, she is just perfect (the measurement tape she carries of course justifies it.), she's a person that is really stern and serious but she's not oh so serious, deep down she's really a quirky strange warm hearted individual but she doesn't let it show, she keeps it hidden with that mask of sternness, but she does take that mask off little by little as she grows close to the kids and some of her time with her friend Bert. I just love how she just has this dry sense of humor and wit about her, she's got a lot of memorable lines and charisma and as usual she has that lovely singing voice. She was the kind of person I really wish I had as a babysitter as she not just helps show the kids a good time and fantasy world but just bonds with them beautifully and is understanding of whatever trouble them.Dick Van Dyke is just great as Bert this is my favorite role from him, as he just like Mary he's just as strange and has magic powers like her. Though he's a bit the opposite as he's a person that isn't so prim and proper, he puts out what he thinks and feels he doesn't feel the need to keep it all in. One thing I really like about him is that he's not a person concerned about looks, despite how dirty he may look or how he dresses, he's a person that simply likes to do things that make him feel good.It's great when we see both Mary and Bert together, they both have just great back and forth together and in a way really are good for each other as Bert really brings a sense of fun and humor to Mary's seriousness and even though Mary doesn't want to show it she really does have a good time with him, I get the feeling he's probably the only guy that really makes her smile and possibly laugh. You also get the feeling that both could be more than just friends, your never quite sure but there are little suttle hints throughout the film. And of course, both bond with the kids well, in a way their both the aunt and uncle they never had.I really love that both are people that are down to Earth like anyone else and yet there not. In a way are sort of like the Time Lords in \"Doctor Who\", like with The Doctor they take the kids whom you can say are the Earthbound companions temporarily to where ever. And like the Doctor there is this great enigmatic quality as we never really know who they really are and where they come from, both could be aliens for all I know, Mary did come from the sky after all hmmm. Their both always full of surprises as we discover little bits of depth and constantly develop which to me keeps these characters interesting and likeable, as opposed to characters in some TV shows have that fundamental problem of become overdeveloped or overexposed to the point of being less interesting.The effects are good, I wouldn't say anything mind-blowingly extraordinary but are effective all the same at giving the illusion that both Bert and Mary Poppins have some magical abilities but also the hidden fantasy world that exists around them. Really like the snapping effect which is of course the simple reverse photography method, I though it was really could that you can get things done by simply snapping your fingers much like the clap on lights. Though my favorite effect believe it or not is seeing Bert, Mary and the kids jump into Bert's check drawings and we see they all are in a world of animation which I though was cool I which I could do that with the comic books and manga I read.The songs are all memorable, their the kind I could listen too on my iPod sometimes. The sequences are all well done and choregraphed. I'll just say three of the songs and sequences which are my favorites. First one is \"I Love to Laugh\" that scene is just one you can't help but laugh toward, it reminds me of those laugh gas scenes you would see in movies or sitcoms it's just so infectious as it is ridiculous. Just seeing Mary's Uncle Albert whom is of course played by comedian Ed Wynn, he was just funny as he just floating around because he laughs a lot, and of course we see other character join in. Though it's even funnier as we see how they get down which shows how tragedy and comedy can really go together.Second is \"Chim chimney /Stepping time\" alright I know it's a bit of a cheat but both the song and the dance number sort of go together. The song is such a calm nice yet fun and catchy song, it's fun when we see Bert along with Mary Poppins and the kids go up on the roof tops with him and their riding a smoke cloud and then hearing Mary sing the song making it even better. The Stepping Time dance number was just a lot of fun and a little exhausting to watch at the same time as it is just constant activity, I really love how well choregraphed it is as we see the Chimney Sweepers and even Bert and Mary do all different kinds of dance formations like popping in and out of chimneys, going into what looks like a bit of a ho down, the list goes on. It's gets even more fun, wild and funny as the sea captain character whom makes his roof into a ship and even runs it like one (I'm not kidding) mistakes them for Pirates and shoots fireworks at them, even see Bert hit one like a golf ball (also not kidding) and they all retreat and continue the dance elsewhere. Though all admit this whole sequence as fun as it is, it also kind of made me want to take a shower from the amount of black smoke and seeing how dirty everyone is, though I'll admit Mary still looked good despite how dirty she looked.Though of course my favorite song is \"Supercalifragislistic expalidoshious\" this one is just so much fun and full of energy and catchy, let along the longest nonexistent phrase ever. Just everything about this scene is perfect as it's not just song and dance chirography that is spot on, both Julie and Dick look like their having fun, but just the use of both live action and animation together.Despite all the fantasy this film really does have a heart as we see Mary Poppins and Bert we're just there to help the Children but were also there to help the father George Banks played well by David Tomlinson whom is a person on the overly strict side of things, he's not a bad father at all just on the wrong track. We see throughout things George begins to realize despite his pursuit of success he's missing time with his family but also missing out on life. The film does have a good message on realizing what's more important in life but also to experience the joys life has to offer no matter what age you are.Mary Poppins flies high in the sky and into our hearts.Rating: 4 stars",

This is one of them. At the time of its release, it was a masterpiece of special effects, combining animated with live action cinematography. Also, the music of the Sherman Brothers was outstanding and the latter one remains an untouchable holy grail of songwriting today. But for the rest of the movie? Sigh.What you are about to witness is nothing, but an incoherent mess. One scene bunched after the other, just for the purpose of getting from one song to the next. Nothing makes any sense at all - besides from a loose conceptual framework of two kids being neglected by their parents - the whole movie consists of only singular events, everyone of them seemingly going on forever, without any connection, a greater story, character development, nothing has anything to do with anything.The successor, Disney Bednobs and Broomsticks, again with music by the Sherman Brothers and following the same concept of mixing animated with live cinematography, is another matter altogether and showcases, how to do it right. A beautiful story, brilliant songs, weaved careful together while the movie progresses, characters connect with each other and the audience and the music itself is not decoration, but integrated core of the plot.If you leave nostalgia behind, this movie really fails in every aspect of simple movie-making ABC and the author of Mary Poppins, Pamela Travers, rejected this movie in total for good reasons. Today we can understand that she had every right to criticize it. It simply does not justify the original book. Worse, it barely has anything to do with the stories from the book. And even worse, it does not even hold up as a good movie by itself.Don't bother watching, get Bedknobs and Broomsticks instead.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a film with high technical quality across all cinematic crafts and trades ... this is it. The screen story, set in 1910, about a magical nanny who comes down from the clouds, literally, to care for, and be the nursemaid of, two English children, is original and engaging. Humor and low-intensity conflict propel the plot to a finale that is appropriate, given Walt Disney's objective of entertaining the audience. Characters are sympathetic and likable. Taken as a whole, the story clearly foreshadows the woman's liberation movement of the 60s and 70s. And the plot contains occasional tributes to vaudeville.Long before CGI and even this film, Disney's innovations in animation and special effects enhanced the movie-going experience. In \"Mary Poppins\" those innovations reach a zenith, not only because the technical complexity is so adroitly concealed, but also because the animation and special effects contribute to the story, instead of being the story. Mary Poppins, the lady, is a magic nanny, but \"Mary Poppins\", the film, is also nanny magic.Aside from the screen story, other traditional movie crafts also excel in this film. Stevenson's direction is fine, given Disney's objective. The plot zooms along at a nice clip. Production design is lush; costumes are intricate; and the acting is wonderful. All the songs are marvelous, and several of them have retained their popularity to this day.My only disappointment relates to the film's somewhat shallow theme. If Disney had been so inclined, and clearly he was not, he could have made a few changes that would have rendered a film with deeper, more metaphysical, import. A good analogy here would be \"The Wizard Of Oz\", a children's film wherein the symbolism and metaphysics could fill a bottomless pit. As is, the theme of \"Mary Poppins\" goes no deeper than the optimistic notion that a little bit of effort can fix a serious problem. That theme expresses itself via \"A Spoonful Of Sugar\" and \"Let's Go Fly A Kite\". I would have preferred a cryptic theme, via the more mystical \"Chim-Chim-Cheree\".Be that as it may, \"Mary Poppins\" is still a great film for kids, and can be enjoyed by adults, too. It's a quality act, all the way. It's a film whose music is so original and melodic that it's hard to get some of those catchy tunes out of one's head, especially, for me ... \"Chim-Chim-Cheree\".",

She was enchanted, as was I for the second time, with the entire thing. The songs by Richard B. and Robert M. Sherman are simply divine to listen to whether it's \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius\", or the Oscar-winning \"Chim-Chim-Cheree\". Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are a wonderful singing and dancing team here. By the way, Mr. Van Dyke maintains his charm despite having perhaps the worst fake British accent in motion picture history! Oh, and those animated sequences are some of Disney's best. Perhaps one can quibble that the musical sequences tend to be long for a family film making the whole thing possibly a chore to sit through sometimes. Still, there's so much to be amused and entertained by that this version of P.L. Travers' MP books can still be something to marvel at. Walt Disney really did himself proud here!

            "content": "Mary Poppins hasn't aged well to me. I know this is heresy, but I have always thought the movie over-long, forced, and too paint-by- the-numbers. Julie Andrews isn't that appealing of a character. Dick Van Dyke seems smudged (his soul, not his face). The kiddies are tedious, the dad's a jackass, and the only face I want to see is Glynis Johns. She was a radiant 16 in The 49th Parallel and a high- beamed knockout in Vault of Horrors (1973). Every time I've sat down to watch Mary Poppins, I've gotten bored. One set piece of singing and dancing and mixing live action with cartoons and dammit, those penguins are cute!But about the 300th number, I'm asking how many kids actually made it through Mary Poppins? I know I lost the climax of The Sound of Music when I was a 7 or 8 year old. I had to wait until NBC showed it in November, 1976 before I could watch the last 25 minutes or so. By then, I could appreciate how hot Heather Menzies was, and how, if you looked sideways and squinted, Julie Andrews could exude enough sex appeal to get the image of her in a nun's habit out of your mind.Maybe that's why I so dislike Mary Poppins. Even though it's a children's movie, the adult characters have to be appealing. Van Dyke looks hungover throughout the film--nothing for the girls. Andrews seems peeved and a tad screechy in that Victorian outfit. She reminds me of women I've known who were attractive until you looked into their eyes, and there was no laughter there. Yet, what does it matter? The movie premiered 50+ years ago, has been shown on VHS and DVD and, of course, TV about a million times. Folks loved and love it. Heck, I've got the Supercaliwhatever song in my head right now. I can hear Ed Wynn giggling. Tuppence, Tuppence! What the Hell is a Tuppence, anyway?",

Julie Andrews sung a majority of the movie's songs and she was absolutely brilliant. I also enjoyed the combination of live action with animated sequences - neatly done special effects and, combined with Mary Poppins' extraordinary powers, they let your imagination run wild. Which children wouldn't want to see a nanny gliding up and down the stairs and rearrange furniture in mid-air? Aside from the songs and animation, I thought the overall movie was pretty boring - lots of fillers and dragged-out drama and not enough adventure and fun. I thought Dick Van Dyke's portrayal of Bert was somewhat annoying, trying too hard to be over-zealously happy, and I thought the Mary Poppins character could have been more nurturing and kind-hearted to the children. She was, unfortunately, portrayed as somewhat cold and very stern to the kids.Overall, I thought this was an average film. Might be billed as some of Disney's best, but I think there are better live-action Disney movies from that time.Grade C",

Mind you, it's no \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\", but \"Cool Wold\" is the only other movie I can think of at this moment that even has that.There is quite a bit of establishing scenes, but that was common enough in 1964. The writing, if wonky, is actually structured quite well, we're shown reason enough to care about the character, when we're meant to (maybe not the staff...possibly the wife), but we're either offered joy or gruffness early on.While Mary Poppins is presented as a magical character, not all of the characters are quite aware that is the case (in fairness, no one tries to burn her as a witch either), and quite let her have the run of it: the father being the most, if poorly, resistant. It feels as though the movie has a message of being attractive enough can cause magical things to happen and you needn't worry about the reality of things, such as money. But I might be reading too far into it.When it comes down to it, this movie is a delightful, if weird, time with positive morals imparted on the audience, young and old.If you liked \"The Return of Mary Poppins\", then I suggest you watch this before they finally reboot this one.",

            "content": "Obviously, everyone knows about \"Mary Poppins\". The title character (Julie Andrews) is a practically-perfect-in-every-way-nanny in 1910 London. Answering an ad by the pampered children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson), she arrives in the house and teaches the children her philosophy: a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down. With the help of her chimney-sweep friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), she shows the children the magical world that they have been denied. The major challenge will be bringing their father out of his stuffy world.Most people treat \"Mary Poppins\" as a cute family movie, but I would like to analyze it further. First off, mother Winifred (Glynis Johns) is a suffragist. If it was nothing but a simple \"family movie\", they probably wouldn't have shown this (granted, it's good that they showed this). Oh, and about Mary Poppins' sugar-based philosophy: wouldn't that cause osteoporosis? Or at least tooth decay? But most important of all is Dick Van Dyke's attempt at a cockney accent: he did a terrible job. As I was watching the movie, every time Dick Van Dyke was on screen, I made some comment relating to \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\": Tripped over too many ottomans, Rob? Laura's not gonna like it if she finds you with this woman. What would Buddy and Sally think? Has Buddy made any comments about Cooley's bald head today? Dick Van Dyke's strength is in his dance numbers (he always has been good at that kind of stuff). I guess that overall, \"Mary Poppins\" was a worthy movie, especially since it spawned some spoofs: in one of Gilligan's dream sequences, Lovey is Mary Poppins, and the Simpsons once had a nanny named Sherry Bobbins.As for the other cast members, Ed Wynn plays tipsy Uncle Albert, who just floats around, and Mr. Dawes, Jr., is played by Arthur Malet, who later appeared on \"I Dream of Jeannie\" as Jeannie's cockney uncle Vasmir, who must decide whether or not Maj. Nelson will make an acceptable husband.Maybe it's not all that supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, but you might feel like flying a kite after seeing it.",

This set-bound Disney musical isn't very airy, with a narrative that is by turns happily frantic and deadly earnest. Andrews doesn't get lost in the plastic din, but rarely does she have a genuinely moving moment (even the lullaby sequence is less a sweet break in the action than just a preamble to more chaos). Casting Dick Van Dyke as a Cockney chimney sweep doesn't pay off--his accent is deplorable, to be charitable--but the kids are cute and Julie doesn't overdo her twinkle. Acting like a common sense anchor, Andrews makes a fine substitute teacher, however I would've preferred a bit more magic and a tad less sermonizing. **1/2 from ****",

Dick van Dyke's cockney accent is horrible. He sounds like an American imitating a Londoner trying to imitate a cockney. It's bloody awful! While I find his singing and dancing admirable and entertaining, his speaking voice is nails-on-slate. Had the producers just dubbed his speaking voice with that of Michael Caine - a real cockney - I wouldn't find this so annoying. This is tune out number one.2. The film is too long. Some judicious cutting, especially of a couple of the lesser musical numbers, would have been in order. Also, the final boardroom scene in the bank goes on for far too long.This is outweighed by the utter charm of the whole thing and the near-magical presence of the splendid Julie Andrews - a performer worthy of admiration if there ever was one. This is a woman with talent, incredible personal charm, and true charisma. She is a leading lady, pure and simple. She more than makes up for the aforementioned minor problems for every second she is on screen is magic.One glaring omission from all the reviews I've read is an appreciation of the two ladies who played the elder servants in the household - the American character actress Reta Shaw and the British Hermione Baddley (sp?). Both lend top-notch support and are quite wonderful, especially Shaw, who was one of the most popular and talented character actresses of her era. (She is best remembered for her semi-recurring role on TV's BEWITCHED and for her presence in most of Doris Day's films.) Shaw was a skilled song-and-dance performer with a deep voice and commanding presence and a master scene stealer.",

I defy anyone not to emerge from the theater (or from the tablet) singing \"Supercallifragilisticexpiallidocious\" or \"A Spoonful of Sugar,\" or \"Let's Go Fly a Kite.\" I defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat as Julie Andrews sings \"Feed the Birds,\" or to enjoy the sheer brio of the sequence celebrating \"It's a Jolly Holiday with Mary.\" Julie Andrews is quite simply breathtaking; one understands from her performance just how good she must have been as the original Eliza Dolittle in MY FAIR LADY (and how mistaken Jack Warner was in casting Audrey Hepburn in the film version). Van Dyke gives a jaunty performance, while David Tomlinson steals the show as Mr. Banks, the bank official who learns there is is much more to life than simply earning money. The film is the kind of thing that can be watched again and again - which is why it is endlessly repeated (and revived in cinemas as a companion-piece to SAVING MR. BANKS).",

After that moment or two, aroused out of my boredom I continued to endure those dreadful songs. I do not want to comment on the two leads but I enjoyed glorious Glynis Johns, suffragette and oppressed at home. Her performance out classed the rest by miles. As for the Disney section it was boring, long and the so called magic of this sequence is put to shame beside ' Alice in Wonderland ' and ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs '. Hermione Baddeley was also on form, but this long, long film has some of the worst songs I have endured in any musical. I immediately rushed off and watched the raunchy, amazingly sexy ' Take Me To Town. ' The songs are not great in the Sirk film either, but they do not pretend to be and how I would have loved to see ' Ann Sheridan ' as Mary Poppins. 4 for those who recall with love and pleasure.",

            "content": "I had never seen 'Mary Poppins' but in this the 50th anniversary of that movie, and the recent Disney film 'Saving Mr Banks' with Tom Hanks, I knew I needed to see it to complete my enjoyment of the recent movie. Fortunately I found this on 50th anniversary Blu-Ray at my local public library. The picture and sound are remarkably good, as you would expect from such a special movie.Julie Andrews, still in her 20s and adorably cute, is Mary Poppins. The movie doesn't actually tell us much about her but as it opens we see her sitting in some clouds above London's Tower Bridge so we know there is something mystical about her. Then, when the Banks kids' torn-up note flies up the chimney and ends up in the possession of Mary Poppins we are assured there is something mystical about her.Being a Disney musical there are lots of songs and production numbers, a recurring phrase \"a little bit of sugar makes the medicine go down\" becomes the metaphor for the story, that a proper amount of fun and joy in life helps us cope with all of life's struggles. Mr Banks is a well- off London banker and too serious to have fun with his family, including his small son and small daughter. The mission of Mary Poppins is to save Mr Banks, to have him realize the importance of fun in life. After her mission is complete she presumably goes off and awaits another opportunity.A key scene in the middle has the kids going to work with their dad, the son has a tuppence (two pence) and wants to spend it on seed to feed the pigeons, but Mr Banks and the 5 other old men of the bank spend lots of energy trying to convince the boy to invest his money instead, it will help build bridges and railroads. Dick Van Dyke has two roles, first as Bert who is a sort of one-man band in the street, performing for tips. It is clear he has already knows Mary Poppins and has some sort of mystical powers also, but his character remains a bit unclear. In heavy makeup he also plays Mr. Dawes Senior, the senior banking executive. I knew Van Dyke mainly for his later TV roles, and it was a joy seeing him sing and dance as a younger man.David Tomlinson is good as Mr. Banks and Glynis Johns is good as the wife Mrs. Banks, always busy going off to one event or another and leaving the house and children to the maid, the cook, and the nanny.",

I loved this film when I first saw it in original release and remember the 'I love to laugh' floating in the air scene and also the \"feed the birds\" scenes of St Pauls which had a haunting quality. Seeing it again on DVD the film holds up well and my 10 year daughter loves it too so it still has the same appeal for todays kids.  Again a movie which very much needs to be seen on a big screen to enjoy it the most. Disneys film version of Travers books does make some changes that the author did not necessarily like however film audiences have enjoyed it for many years so who cares. Likely to remain 'Perfectly popular' for many years yet. A great fun fantasy ride for everyone. I think Dick Van Dykes best scenes were playing Mr Dawes of the bank. Julie Andrews in her peak years .It won't come round again. Enjoy.",

            "content": "Many have considered Mary Poppins to be among Disney's finest movies. Among the first films to simultaneously show live-action and animation, the film's settings and choreography are stunningly beautiful, and certainly represent a crowning achievement.However, Mary Poppins suffers from being over-long, having too many pointless songs, and expanding too much energy at once, which hurts the story line. Everyone is singing, giggling, or laughing on cue as if they have had too many \"Spoonfuls of Sugar.\" (pun intended.) Even the songs are a mixed review. \"Feed The Birds\" may be one of the most enduring timeless songs ever written. But jumping around to \"Chim Chim Cheree\" and the ever too long \"Step in Time\" dance sequence is WAAAAAY overdone.I also hate the \"I Love to Laugh\" sequence, probably because Ed Wynn's voice terrified me as a child and still gives me the creeps. He just looks and sounds like some dirty old man that your parents told you to stay away from.A point is that Mary Poppins has a song for every happy mood and it doesn't seem to end. I read that at one point over 30 songs were written for the film. Can you believe that? No wonder they had to cut the music down! The storyline is trite and obvious, \"Kids need love and attention, not just wealthy surroundings to be happy.\" Well, did we need 2 hours and 20 minutes to know that? Furthermore, anyone who has to endure Dick Van Dyke's HORRIBLE attempt at a Cockney accent should be rewarded.Tighter script editing without breaking into a song, dance, giggle, or laugh every 10 minutes, might have made for a better movie storyline.",

            "content": "Dick Van Dyke, whose amazing name should have been snatched by a half-dozen porn actors (and actresses) by now, does one of the worst cockney accents of all times. A little later, Glynis Johns, a bad mother only concerned with her goofy feminist cause, comes home and starts singing some silly, badly written tune with non-rhyming lyrics. Her two maids join in (fearing being fired, perhaps, if they didn't). Her husband looks like Angela Lansbury; he's the uptight banker.MP gives a strange taste of its occasionally dubious morals early on. Merry Poppings uses her Jedi powers to get rid of all the other applicants for the nanny position. The Dark Side bitch doesn't even have the decency to show up on time, unlike all the other women who came early, and then she simply blows them away! What an interesting message for the kiddies. The hypocrite that she is, she then teaches Mr. Lansbury a \"career isn't everything\" moral lesson. This coming from a woman who unkindly nudges her competition; Mary Poopins has no problems using HER elbows in the rat-nany-race.\"Never judge things by their appearance,\" this tricky Jedi Master says, and then just a minute later adds: \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever.\" What are the kids supposed to learn from these contradicting pieces of advice? Stop confusing them kids, Mary Poopins! Get your act straight. AND she's a narcissist. \"Mary Poopins: practically perfect in every way.\" So powerful is she that all the cartoon animals shower her with compliments, constantly. Could it be that they fear her wrath and powerful magic trickery? Those animals have no pride at all. \"A spoon-full of sugar makes the medicine go down\". Besides being a song about illness (her first song, and she goes straight for the jugular), I can personally attest that a spoonful of sugar makes the vomit reflex turn on. And \"chim-chim chiminey chim-chim charoo.\" What the bloody hell is that? What if I said \"hoobdaboop-doopery beep-beep nagrook-pa-nooj\". Can I write a Hollywood script too, please? Old guy: \"How long do you want your underwear? And he says: I want it from March to September! Ha-ha-haaa!\" Mary Poppins: \"You silly old geezer, that is the sh*tt*est pun I've ever heard.\" Now, that's the kind of Merry Poopings I'd love to see.In the end, Mary Poopings gets her employer fired, his ex-boss gets a heart attack and dies, and the kids' father gets his old job back! So Merry \"Grim Reaper\" Poopings succeeded in what she set out to do: get Lansbury to take more care of the kids and to put an old man into a grave (but not before letting him levitate for a bit). Merry Poopings is not so much a kids film as it's a girl's film. Little boys want to see death, destruction and pirates, not overly cheerful animals giving compliments to each other and getting along. Hence one could call this a \"kids' chick-flick\". No wonder it won so many Oscars, chick-flicks usually do. Plus the fact that these special-effects were state-of-the-art for the Stone-Age 60s, when this movie must have seemed like \"Star Wars\" when it came out. Nevertheless, between Dick's laughable English accent and the corny but colourful musical numbers, I wasn't bored. MP is fairly entertaining, if perhaps occasionally for the wrong reasons, and anyway immeasurably better than \"My Fair Lady\" which is one of the dullest turds in cinema's history.Who knows what other directors would have done with this story. I wonder.Pier Pasolini's version of MP: an incestual family goes to a church where they strip naked and watch the priest ejaculate.Ingmar Bergman's version of MP: a nanny can't get over her three miscarriages, later committing suicide in front of the kids.Spike Lee's version of MP: a ghetto nanny gets raped and hung by her white employer for trying to teach the kids about African history.",

            "content": "Odds are good you've seen Mary Poppins, it came out in 1964 and is a pop-culture touchstone. If you haven't seen it, go see it, I'm going to be getting pretty spoilery in this review. Go see it, that's the short version of this review.This was a hard one to review as I grew up watching this one frequently. I hadn't seen it in many years before this write-up and attempted to watch the movie with fresh eyes. That said, I've loved this movie since before I could walk, so there's my bias. I'll be as objective as possible, but it is what it is.The first thing that struck me upon re-watching this film was just how very weird it is. It has a level of quirk usually only seen in indie comedies these day. Think about it, there's a possibly homeless man who is the only character that recognizes the audience and communicates with them directly, but not as a narrator, as a friend. There are two men who live on top of a house and shoot cannons across the city; one is named, of course, Admiral Boom. The children's mother and their cook have a no-nonsense discussion about saving rotten eggs to throw at the prime minister. An umbrella decides to start talking 5 min from the end of the film, it was never really set up as a character, but it is now apparently! This is one odd duck of a movie!Another element that leapt out at me is just how full of herself Mary Poppins really is! She's a perfect combination of straight-laced confidence and cunning manipulator. Mary isn't here for the kids, they're not that bad to begin with, she's here to knock some sense into their father...to force him to BE their father. She's utterly amazing!The songs are catchy and occasionally moving, the antiquated visual effects still hold up incredibly well, and the story is equal parts fanciful and emotional. There's a mix here of kid-centric material, such as an entire sequence linking loss of gravity to uncontrollable laughter, as well as sequences that will hit adults right in the feels. The section of the film where the children's father, Mr. Banks is walking to work late at night to his own career's end is heartbreaking. The camera angles, the music, the lack of dialogue, this is one of my favorite parts of the movie.The movie often gets distracted by it's own rabbit trails, which can lead to some portions dragging a bit. Some of the songs go on far too long but, perhaps it's my bias, I find myself disappointed when these bits end. From a strict film-making standpoint, songs like \"feed the birds\" don't feed the story, but I think they go a long way towards establishing a feeling, a tone for the film. One that sticks with its audience long after the credits have rolled.The acting here is all pretty great. Dick Van Dyke turns in a hilariously bad attempt at a cockney accent but, once again this could be my bias, but it kind of ends up becoming part of the character and making him all the more crazy and charming. The kids are cute, but not too cute. Mrs Banks, Glynis Johns, is perfection as a staunch feminist in the streets and a subservient housewife as soon as her husband shows up. Her struggle to maintain both sides of her is underplayed to perfection and is one of my favorite character through-lines of the movie. Mr Banks is played by the ever-typecast David Tomlinson. This is the role he was born to play and he totally sells the overbearing control-freak workaholic who's entire life is crumbling around him.But the standout is, of course, Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews IS Mary Poppins and Mary Poppins IS Julie Andrews. I will never believe otherwise. From her deadpan delivery of hilarious lines to her angelic singing voice, Julie Andrews dominates this movie. She is the dark mysterious figure, frightening and strange. She is the warm teacher, pulling back the veil on just how amazing every-day life is to the entire Banks family. She is the relationship doctor, knowing exactly what's wrong, how to cure it, and how to bend the people in her way from enemy to unwitting ally. Mary Poppins is a force of nature and without Julie Andrews, this movie would not have half the impact and relevance it still holds to this day.If you love musicals, watch Mary Poppins.If you love amazing practical visual effects, watch Mary Poppins.If you enjoy interesting, comedic characters, watch Mary Poppins.If you have never seen Mary Poppins, watch Mary Poppins.If you've watched it many times, watch it again.In my opinion, Mary Poppins is \"practically perfect in every way\".-Josh Evans",

Even though the sound of adaptations sound atrocious, if you give this one a chance you'll find it's quite precocious. SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS! Based off the original trilogy (or more books?) Mary Poppins was about a magical no nonsense nanny who looks after the Banks' children and they encounter all sorts of adventures in the simplest places like parks, shopping, and visiting relatives. I've been reading the books and I'll admit I wish I could have seen Disney do more like the zoo at night, a traveling compass, and so on, but for what we got it was terrific. True that Mary Poppins, herself, has been disneyfied, but the directors don't leave out the fact that she's a grumpy character who for some reason is into magic, but later denies it ever happened. Aside from Emma Thompson (who probably wasn't available at the time - but played a different Mary Poppins) I can't think of anyone better to play the role other than Julie Andrews. She was excellent. I love Bert (even if he can't pull off a good British accent). Next to Mary Poppins, he is so charming and imaginative. I still love his one man band, and any of the song and dance numbers he's in. The kids are great, the father - oh I love him! Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, I'M GONNA DIE! Nobody could play a better flying, laughing guy than him! Oh and that laughter is CONTAGIOUS! If I go through the whole cast it will be too much, so in short, the cast was perfect! Don't ask me what my favorite scene is because it's too hard to choose! Almost every scene is my favorite! I love the kids with Mary Poppins, getting to know the family, the bank, chimney sweepers, and the kite scene. Every moment of the film had me wishing I was there, it even made cleaning up my room look fun (too bad snapping fingers won't help)! The songs? If you mention one verse from any of the songs to someone else then don't be surprised if they start singing the whole song out loud! They're hilarious, they're catchy, they're sweet, they're nostalgic, they're touching, they're upbeat, they're sincere, they're adorable, and so on! It keeps the balance of having cheerful moments but also having tender realistic moments. In fact Walt Disney's favorite song was Feed the Birds, because it talked about showing your care for other people. So as you can see it has a mixed message, but it keeps it in a perfect balance: it lets kids be kids, while at the same time teaching everyone young and old to not take life for granted. For example, there's a scene when Mr. Banks refuses to give tuppence to an old lady to feed birds, but scenes later when he decides to, she's gone. Not sure if that's suppose to indicate that she died or just left, but it shows that when you find a chance to show kindness you should take that chance because you may not have another chance. Yes the film didn't quite follow the expectations of the book, but in this case I say that it was almost captured the heart of the story even if there were added songs, scenes, and characters, but hey at least there are no forced morals or added villains. It's actually nice to see a movie without villains. Overall it's a great adaptations and one of few (or many) that stayed true to the heart of the story. It was practically perfect in every way.",

            "content": "It could be called a very good movie, as fairy tale, and on that count there is no doubt of its merit. However it missed the punch point, and probably that's why the author, Ms Travers, wasn't too happy with it. Of course I am not sure that could be the reason of the relation having deteriorated so much, that Disney didn't even bother to invite her for premiere? That was not only disrespect, but an affront. But the studios, most of all this one, had that ego, and the 'master of all' attitude, so nothing too strange about it. Probably that was one of the reasons, the great Bernard Shaw publicly told, and carried it out too, that he won't have anything to do with Hollywood. The point won't have been missed, had that not been mentioned, and that too quite significantly, in the movie. It is I would say, all the male, head of family's lament, right or wrong, immaterial. That he grinds himself, to take care of the family, silently, whereas the family isn't, \"cares\" about him. That part is depicted well here too, the wife is a socializing woman, the children, probably due to his hard exterior, are scared of him. No one really dares, or cares, to enter his psyche. This isn't always his fault, but under the circumstances, he thought, he must be like this. To shatter this shell was important. This isn't the first, or only movie, where this subject is brought up. Philadelphia Story is another one of many. But in none of them, the solution, or even the right message is brought out, the conversion of the family, to melt the wall. This aspect had always been buried, and a passing remark, in the main story.But what happens when this is the raison d'etre of the tale? This particular fact was twice mentioned by Mary Poppins, with significance. But practically I couldn't find, the children doing much about that. The Mary Poppins series, was reportedly influenced by author's repentance, of not caring enough to help her father (who incidentally was too a banker, died while he was just in his early forties, reportedly demise hastened due to Alcoholism). Had they skipped to mention it, probably the movie won't have lost anything, in its story line. But retaining it, and doing nothing about it, really gives a wrong message, as if it is the father, who should break the mould itself. The Beast should become prince charming, without tears of Belle. Any good fairy tales should have an underlying message, for the children. Cinderella tells the children not to be despondent of the circumstances, with the persons who are kind (there would be a few), you could rise up. La Belle et la B\u00eate teaches not to be overtly scared or affected by the exterior, there could be something exquisite underneath, to be discovered. Little Mermaid tells, for someone whom you really care, no sacrifice is enough. Like that this too had a message, in fact may be all of the above together, which the movie version missed.",

I have to say that I don't disagree here: I think many of the effects were not that good, even by the standards of 1964: however, it was only a two-horse race that year.The other is, of course, Dick Van Dyke's atrocious cockernee accent. It is difficult to deny just how bad this is, but I think it is unfair to uncouple it from the rest of Van Dyke's performance. It is a major performance of great charm and exceptional physical ability (in terms of both grace and knockabout humour), and the inaccuracy of the accent is a minor negative against such great positives.We then have to add in the great songs, the wonderful art design, and Julie Andrews' luminous performance, and we arrive at a classic which fully deserves its classic status.",

Her background is not given but she is tasked with taking care of two active children. They seek adventure and thrills but Mary Poppins uses methods that make cleaning the bedroom and such a visual charm. This is a breakthrough triumph in visual effects with Poppins joining hands with the children and literally jumping into a sidewalk drawing for further adventures. Director Robert Stevenson is at his best but the true attraction is the wondrous presence of Julie Andrews as Poppins. Dick Van Dyke plays Bert, a sort of jack-of-all-trades who is familiar with Poppins and embraces her presence with charm and physical antics of his own. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Banks, strict traditional father who works at the bank. Glynis Johns plays Mrs. Banks who cheerfully fights for the up rise of women. Ed Wynn plays Uncle Albert who suffers from some laughing condition that causes him to float. The result is a heavily layered family film that teaches the importance of fatherhood as well as not growing up too quickly. Visually stunning with great songs about \"spoonfuls of sugar.\" As Poppins herself would say, this film is \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\" Score: 9 / 10",

All of the cast excel in this film. Much ado has been made about Dick Van Dyke's poor rendition of a Cockney accent. He slips in and out of it at times. It's quite obvious, but I think way too much is made of it. For a serious film or drama that would be a major detraction. But this is a film that has much whimsy, fantasy and fun in it. And, consider the rest of his character and performance. He has some good singing and comedic sequences and his dance routines are outstanding. He gives an excellent overall portrayal of Bert, and is hilarious in a second role as Mr. Dawes Senior. But for his poor Cockney accent, Van Dyke might have earned an Oscar nomination. David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, the rest of the adult actors and the kids all give very good performances. Much more should be said about Julie Andrews. Before 1964, she had appeared only in a few TV movies and series. Her lead in \"Mary Poppins\" firmly established her as a movie star. Andrews was a talented actress who later played in dramatic roles and mystery-action films. But, she was most known and loved for her singing in musicals. Four of her films will likely keep Andrews in the spotlight for the next few generations. Besides \"Mary Poppins,\" she made \"Cinderella,\" \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Thoroughly Modern Millie.\" This film competed with a host of excellent films in the 1964 Academy Awards. It won five Oscars and had eight more nominations. \"My Fair Lady\" took eight Oscars, including best picture and best actor (Rex Harrison). Among those won by \"Mary Poppins\" were best actress for Julie Andrews (see more about that below) and two Oscars for music. Richard and Robert Sherman wrote and composed all the music and songs for \"Mary Poppins.\" The Sherman Brothers worked many years for Disney and produced some of the best and most popular whimsical songs of filmdom. Three of their songs from this film became popular tunes: \"Chim Chim Cher-ee,\" \"A Spoonful of Sugar,\" and \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\"I enjoyed watching this film again after so many years; and one of the pluses on the DVD I bought is the background video it has about the movie. It includes a snippet from the 1964 Academy Awards. Andrews had starred in the stage production of \"My Fair Lady,\" and wanted to get the part in that movie. But Warner Brothers was wary of trying a relatively new actress for a major film and instead chose Audrey Hepburn for its lead. Hepburn was excellent in her role, but it was Andrews who won the best actress Oscar that year. In her acceptance speech, she complimented Warner Brothers for its excellent movie and thanked Jack Warner for his casting choice (which led to her getting the \"Mary Poppins\" lead instead, and the Oscar). The audience burst out in laughter and the camera panned to Jack Warner who was laughing harder than most. Finally, something should be said about the difficulty in the making of this film. It is based on the first of a series of Mary Poppins books written by Pamela J. Travers. She was born and raised in Australia as Helen Lyndon Goff. She later adopted her pen name and moved to Great Britain. Three years after her first book was printed, Walt Disney tried to obtain the movie rights. But Travers rejected his offer. He tried again a number of times over the years, and it was only in 1963 that he was able to get Travers to acquiesce. She did so with many strings attached, including her right to change the script and other aspects of the production. In the end, she is said to have not liked the film at all. The controversy was over her renditions of characters as she remembered them, and over the musical score and songs for the movie. One can appreciate an author's desire for accurate portrayals of characters from her work; but in this case Disney wanted to produce a musical fantasy from a fairy tale. Thus, it was something else entirely, but based on her stories. Many movies are produced that are based on or inspired by books, but changes often are made of necessity to make them more interesting and appealing to audiences. Another English author a few years ago wrote a screenplay based on the Travers-Disney spats over producing \"Mary Poppins.\" Kelly Marcel approached Disney studios about making the film, and it wound up as a movie in 2013. \"Saving Mr. Banks\" starred Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson as Disney and Travers. Of all the live-action musicals produced by 2015, very few had larger box office takes than Mary Poppins. \"Chicago\" in 2002 holds the record with $171 million in theater gross, followed by \"The Sound of Music\" from 1967 with $163 million. \"Mary Poppins\" had $102 million in 1964. Converted to 2014 dollars, the box office take for \"Chicago\" would be $224 million, for \"Mary Poppins\" it would be $777 million, and that of \"The Sound of Music\" would be $1.2 billion.",

I mean everywhere she goes everyone loves her, but she gives no reason to be worshiped so much. Whenever Bert or Uncle Albert is around to have fun with, Mary Poppins is always exasperated with them or the kids, and drags her feet before she relents to have a good time. Then just a few minutes later, she's quick to say the fun is over and it's time to go home. She's always rolling her eyes upward and sighing, yet Bert still thinks she's the greatest thing around. (Granted, she IS a stone fox and there no other women that seem to hang around the tops of chimneys.)And another thing! Why do they keep giving only the dad a hard time for not spending enough time with the kids? The mother is made out to be so loving and all, but she keeps going to women's rights meetings instead of giving the kids attention as well. If she wants true equality, she better take some of the heat from the father and realize she's neglectful too!Okay, okay, I'm overanalyzing. I really do like this movie. I've never read the books and I gather from one of these user comments the story's not nearly as dark as it's supposed to be. But the songs and dancing are terrific. It's one of my favorite non-animated Disney flics and I hope you realize my first two paragraphs were written a little bit tongue-in-cheek.",

            "content": "Pamela Lyndon Travers, the life and motives of whom we can get to know more usefully from the film SAVING MR BANKS, with her vision of Mary Poppins' character managed to instill certain understanding among the younger and older readers alike. By creating a subtle world of fantasy, she at the same time captivated us with 'a wonderfully agile spirit with a gift for expansion and fun' (Bosley Crowther about Mary Poppins). Dreams might be fulfilled, life may truly be beautiful, little minor things hold an almost immense significance: a key for happiness. Nevertheless, a literary vision filled with such rich imagination back in the 1960s must have occurred quite a challenge to be put on screen. How to handle the theme? Who to cast in the leading roles? How to develop the magnificent world of Mary Poppins within the possibilities of the medium at the time. One thing was certain: it was only Walt Disney who could dare that project.The success was smashing and the impressive number of awards the movie got proves that perfectly. But now, in the 2010s? With surprising effects, we can admit more than half a century later that MARY POPPINS truly belongs to the very best classics of the period. I would even daresay it may accurately be considered as one of the most absorbing, touching films ever made. This film has not dated whatsoever and though certain technical effects might seem a little bit naive, they are never and probably never will be laughable. Nothing of the sort! Quoting the words of the reviewer Martin Chilton who proves the film's universal appeal, this movie is 'curiously enjoyable to watch for the modern viewer.' Curiously...I would focus a little bit on this single word...curiously.We may come across many viewpoints these days that dare claim sentimentality is of no use in any form of art. Abstraction, pseudo-futuristic labyrinth of thoughts and perceptions, surreal confusion appear primarily superior to childish, laughable sentimentality. Here, one of the key ideas that Mary Poppins communicates is her famous utterance that \"practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their feelings.\" I think that one of the crucial reasons why this film is 'curiously' popular nowadays is its heart. In fact, the very core of the film is its message, it can truly address the viewers of today, is able to touch them and bring out the very best of them, as Mary Poppins does in relation to Mr George Banks, the banker. Bosley Crowther in his review on the film (1964), he calls MARY POPPINS 'irresistible' stating further that it can boast of 'the enchantments of a beautiful production, some deliciously animated sequences, some exciting and nimble dancing and a spinning musical score.' It would be hard not to agree with all those points, especially if one has a privilege to see the movie on the big screen in a restored version. The images are stunning, the animation memorable (much to the dismay of Ms Travers who wanted no animation whatsoever), particularly the hilarious penguins, dancing vibrant and dynamic and the score easily identifiable. But, primarily, these are the cast who made my day when I saw the film for the first time. Let me start with the woman who could truly 'become' the role she played with the most unforgettable childlike attitude and enchanting respect for the audiences, young and old alike, JULIE ANDREWS.Just before playing another of her milestone role in SOUNDS OF MUSIC (the film I called a movie of childlike hearts in my review), she portrays Mary Poppins with enormously heartfelt attitude. She plays her role with incredible ease and evident inspiration. 'Unrealism' of fantasy is combined with 'realism' of subtlety. Her scenes with the children are transparently affectionate and dynamic to the great extent. Almost, we get to a point that the illusion of cinema becomes the most powerful 'make-believe' though some scenes may be considered as 'ridiculous' to the eye of a 'down-to-earth' viewer. Ms Andrews has a power to employ various hidden emotions in her viewers and bring them out in the best way possible: to amuse, to soothe, to comfort.Others do play their roles with no less commitment. Van Dyke is marvelously funny as Bert and, later, the old bank proprietor supplying us with some hilarious moments of genuine amusement; Elsa Lanchester delivers certain memorable lines; Mr Banks is also believable as a character who undergoes the most 'unexpected' change of heart. Time referred to the cast of the movie as 'only a pinfeather short of perfection' and there is much truth in that statement.The songs generations know and sing, the ever present positive atmosphere of the movie make it a pleasure to watch now and will do so as long as there are viewers who don't merely watch something with their eyes.In short, MARY POPPINS may still soothe the stagnant gravitation of everyday routine and help us go fly a kite up to the realms of clearer atmosphere where heart and mind may find a state described by one simple epithet: 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'",

I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: \"Do you still like this?\" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers in the movie and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... And what's interesting about a character that's perfect in every way anyway? The character of Mary could have at least used some nuance. What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. At that point I was still convinced there was one or that a story would at least turn up at some point.Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to create visually at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. Luckily, there's Nanny Mc. Phee, a movie that successfully integrates the concept of a magical nanny in a more than decent story.",

No one is going to accuse the Sherman brothers of being Cole Porter - well they COULD but they'd look pretty silly when they had to back it up with hard evidence - but their knack for catchy melodies is undeniable even if their lyrics are a tad short of Porter, Larry Hart, Johnny Mercer, Frank Loesser etc, about from here to Guatamala short.

It is my sincere belief that it was Walt Disney's ultimate accomplishment. All of his best is here, including a great story, augmented with animation, music, fantasy, and humor. Everyone involved in the film's creation was at his or her professional peaks.To call 'Mary Poppins' timeless is truly an understatement. For a film that was released in 1964, it holds up as great today as it must have enchanted many on its original release. The integration of live actors with animation pre-dated 'Roger Rabbit' by 24 years. Bear in mind that this film was put together in an era that did not even envision a word like 'digital'. The imagery of live actors blends with artwork (like the fantastic matte paintings) flawlessly. 'Mary Poppins' received a much-deserved Oscar for visual effects.Walt Disney knew that in our hearts lives a portion of our childhood, and his 'Mary Poppins' touches that part of us. He knew what it took to make things wonderfully, putting together something for everyone. This is not simply a kid's movie, just as his Disneyland is not just a kid's amusement park. A film like this had to have a perfect cast. Dick Van Dyke was never better, and has not yet topped his performance as Bert. Julie Andrews is exceptionally beautiful here. I loved her in 'The Sound Of Music,' but this one is a notch above that. Her most striking musical accomplishment in 'Mary Poppins' was the 'Feed The Birds' segment. The song hauntingly delighted Walt Disney for the remainder of his life. Sadly, he passed on only 2 years later.The running time is a little over two hours. Most Disney features run around 70 minutes. I thought the 70-minute time was created because of the shorter attention spans of children. However, all of my young children stayed transfixed with 'Mary Poppins' entirely, including the end credits.Using the four-star rating system, this is easily '****'. It is a must-have for your DVD collection, not only for the visuals, but also for the superb soundtrack.George",

However, unlike in most US films, British spirit and background have been well understood and depicted.Music and songs are remarkable as well, but I still prefer The Sound of Music - more mature and interesting for the adults.Usually I am not into remakes, they are often bad replicas, but as for Mary Poppins, in my opinion, someone could give a try, using all the opportunities modern technology provides.

            "content": "I always considered The Lion King my favorite Disney movie, for it was the pivotal Disney flick of my convoluted childhood. Now, after several months of pondering, I think The Lion King is at an even tie with another Disney wonder, Mary Poppins. Based upon the series of books by P.L. Travers, Mary Poppins is a film we should be very grateful to have. It took Uncle Walt 20 years to obtain the rights to Ms. Travers' fantastic tale and the bold Australian born author was very strict on what could be included in the 1964 classic. While Travers would ultimately hate the flick with all it's Sherman Brothers songs and animated sequences, Mary Poppins would still be a critically acclaimed flick in the public eye and after all these years, it's still one of the greatest fantasy films of the last couple decades. I love it so much, if it was in an edible form, I would gobble it up faster than you could say \"Bob's your uncle\". Julie Andrews embodies Mary Poppins, similar to how Sigourney Weaver embodies Ellen Ripley or Carrie Fisher embodies Princess Leia. She's not as strict and hardcore as she was in Travers' original stories, but she is still stern and at times, very intimidating and bold. I sometimes think that Travers slightly based Mary Poppins off of herself, for she is not only no nonsense and outspoken, but demanding and truthful when she has to be. And Andrews also makes Poppins sympathetic and understanding at times, giving off that heartwarming smile that is debated to be the character's trademark. Looks like Mary Poppins went to the Oswald Cobblepot School of Umbrella Wielding, for Mary Poppins without an umbrella is like Indiana Jones without his whip. Dick Van Dyke is a clumsy, fun loving Bert. I am aware that some are not fond of his Cockney accent, but I think it's over the topness makes his character stand out. He's a jack of all traits, going from a one man jamboree to a sidewalk drawer to a chimney sweep to a kite salesman, and you can just tell that each job he takes part in, he enjoys doing what he does. He's also one of the most high energy characters I've ever seen on film, on par with Ray Bolger's Scarecrow or Charlie Chaplin. Every time Bert's on screen, you are guaranteed to get something off the wall, catchy and blood pumping. All the other characters are great as well. Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are innocent, yet optimistic as Jane and Michael Banks and the cook and the maid are great comic relief. David Tomlinson's Mr. Banks goes from a shrewd workaholic to a giddy, laughable goofball who realizes that we all grow up, but we can be children at heart. Even the Bride of Frankenstein, Elsa Lanchester makes an appearance as the children's first nanny, Katie Nana. The Sherman Brothers songs are fantastic. From \"Chim Chim Cheree\" to \"Spoonful of Sugar\" to \"Jolly Holiday' to \"Feed The Birds\" to \"Let's Go Fly A Kite\", the songs of this movie will be imprisoned in your memory banks for the rest of time. And I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Feed the Birds turned my eyes into waterfalls every time I listened to it. It was said to be Walt Disney's favorite song, and I can see why. What else can I talk about? Well, the animated sequences are wondrous and very Disney like and the \"Step in Time\" sequence you'll never want to end, but why talk about it when you could turn this review off and see the film for yourself. It will delight you, thrill you and even move you. Either way, it's one of Disney's marvelous triumphs. It's simply scrumptious. One of my all time favorites, most definitely.",

What a treat it was - no need to sit & watch everything (perhaps it was a bit longer than necessary), but some wonderful moments and great music in the background. I had forgotten just how beautiful Julie Andrews looked, and her voice was so pure. My only complaint was Dick VAn Dyke's accent, but his dancing was superb. Am planning a trip to DVD store to get a copy for when the grandchildren come to stay. This and the musical of Oliver (another recent TV treat)are so much more entertaining and memorable than the modern kids' movies.",

            "content": "I've always loved Mary Poppins ever since I was a little boy! Now I'm 18 years old and I still think it's a true Disney Classic! In the movie a magical nanny named Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) comes to take care of two children named Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) and to help their cold father George Banks (David Tomlinson) learn to love them. She also has some assistance from her good friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke) who sings one of the best songs in the movie Chimm Chimminnee. My favorite character in the movie was Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn who also voiced Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland) and I love the song I love to laugh! I's a very funny and wonderful song! But I think the best song of the whole movie is Feed the Birds and Julie Andrews just sings it very beautifully! Filled with wonderful characters, story, setting and music written by the wonderful Sherman Brothers Richard M. and Robert B. Mary Poppins is a true Disney classic that'll go on forever and forever as long as A spoon full of sugar can help the medicine go down! It'll always remain in my heart forever and ever! 10 0ut of 10!",

Recently, I found this one as an On-Demand selection and did not intend to sit through all two-plus hours of it. But the character actresses in the beginning (Glynnis Johns, Reta Shaw and Elsa Lanchester) had me hooked after three minutes and I decided to see if the picture was like I remembered it. I think what impressed me most was how beautifully filmed some of the musical sequences were. Like many Disney features from the period, there is plenty of focus on mystical happenings and strange occurrences. But the real magic is a scene like the one where Julie Andrews' voice sings on the soundtrack while Jane Darwell gathers more than a few pigeons into her care on a big city sidewalk.",

            "review_title": "\"Practically Perfect in Every Way\"...Still True",
            "content": "That's how the incomparably magical nanny Mary Poppins describes herself with nary a boastful smirk on a revealing tape measure in this still charming 1964 Disney classic musical set in post-Victorian London circa 1910. I was five years old when it was originally released, and I managed to convince my mother to take me to see it six times. I just saw it last night for the first time in over four decades on the big screen in a sing-along version similar to what has been done with \"The Sound of Music\". I still feel a genuine warmth about this movie as an adult. Such was the impact of Julie Andrews in her big screen debut, as she epitomizes the title character with equal quantities of starch and sugar.With her unyielding posture, coltish stature and perfectly clipped diction, Andrews found her archetypal role before she even blossomed as an actress, an intractable goody-goody image she sends up mercilessly 17 years later in her husband's savage Hollywood satire, \"S.O.B.\" There is no getting around the fact that she is ideal as the indefatigable Mary in charge of Jane and Michael, the two moppet children of neglectful banker George Banks and his flighty suffragette wife Winifred. With the help of devoted friend Bert, a Cockney jack-of-all-trades and one-man-band, Mary sets out to inspire the children's imaginations while keeping a firm though kind-hearted hand on their behavior. What I notice this time as an adult is how Mary wields a similarly positive influence on George albeit after much patriarchal consternation and sexist-driven protest.There are so many delightful scenes that it's hard to choose which to highlight, though one of the best ones has to be the fantasy animated sequence through Bert's sidewalk painting. This is where Bert dances with the penguins, Mary leads Bert and her charges on liberated carousel horses through a fox hunt and a horse race, and both sing two of the best songs, \"Jolly Holiday\" and \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\". Another wonderful scene is the \"Spoonful of Sugar\" room clean-up scene with obviously mechanized robins and a bevy of stop-action effects. Using an overemphatic Cockney accent as Bert, Dick Van Dyke - who was then starring in his classic sitcom - is an endearing presence and a dexterous comic dancer. He also clowns around in heavy make-up as the very aged president of the bank at which George works.David Tomlinson plays George with appropriate gruffness under his gentlemanly demeanor, while Glynis Johns lends her ingratiating quality to Winifred. The children are played without affectation by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Veteran character actors fill the rest of the roles expertly in what amounts to extended cameos - Ed Wynn as the eternally laughing and perpetually airborne Uncle Albert; Elsa Lanchester as Mary's frustrated predecessor, Katie Nanna; Arthur Treacher as the kindly Constable Jones; Reginald Owen as the delusional sea captain next door, Admiral Boom; Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw as the Banks's constantly flustered maids; and most touchingly, the 85-year old Jane Darwell (Ma Joad in \"The Grapes of Wrath\") as the bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.The songs by the Sherman Brothers, Richard and Robert, are truly enchanting and memorable after all these years, especially the haunting \"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\", the wistful \"Chim-Chim-Cheree\", and the almost \"My Fair Lady\"-sounding \"The Life I Lead\". I still have a few quibbles, for example, the \"Step in Time\" dance sequence is exceptionally choreographed but too darkly lit and goes on a bit too long to enjoy fully. Moreover, at 140 minutes, the movie drags a bit toward the end especially as George meets with the board of his bank. Regardless, director Robert Stevenson, who made many of the live-action Disney films of the 1960's, along with screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, have concocted what has to be one of the best family-oriented confections to come out of the Hollywood studios.",

Well now I have seen it and I was very impressed. The special effects are still effective today, the songs are known to everyone. I'm convinced that the makers were on heavy duty LSD, what with people appearing in pavement art and roundabout horses going walkabout. The only thing that drags it down is Dick van Dyke. Enough has been written about the teeth-grinding accent, suffice to say it never seems to come from the same country two scenes running, and his dance routine seems to be just that, routine. It's the same routine in very scene.That said, it's an enjoyable film and I can easily understand what so many people love it.",

A story about a nanny named Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), who helps a spoiled and upper crust English family. Nonsensical at first to the two children, she takes them on many adventures and makes a unique brand of lifestyle to make the family very happy.As a child, I first watched this film and enjoyed it, but a few years, I understood the praise it received and decided to watch it again just to relive that childhood memory. I did and it does hold up pretty well. It has a great story that teaches the moral family values really well; the special effects are solid for a film released in the 1960s, the music score is perfect and the songs from the Sherman Brothers are fantastic (including A Spoonful of Sugar, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, and Feed The birds). Even the animation sequence in the chalk-drawing world was well-done.The characters are likable. The two children are very charming; David Tomlinson does a great job as the strict, but turned into a loving father near the end and made me relate to him. Dick Van Dyke, despite his awful cockney accent, is also likable and does have some funny moments. The best character, however, would have to go to Julie Andrews. The actress, who continues to be very popular in generations, plays the nonsensical and strict, but nice and caring title character very well.Overall, Mary Poppins is a perfect classic to fans who grew up with it. To those who haven't see it, go watch it! :)",

It's just I don't know if it's possible to view it objectively without rose-tinted spectacles on.Two busy parents in London 1910 engage an engaging nanny Mary Poppins played by Julie Andrews to look after their two imaginative children; the nanny floats in without a cv but with magical qualities. Together with Bert played by Dick Van Dyke they help to bring joy and love to the children \u2013 and to their parents. Crockney Bert's adocious accent has long passed into British pisstake folklore but at this distance I wouldn't like his vice any other way \u2013 it adds another dimension to the proceedings wondering how daft they all were in passing it for human consumption in the first place.

Julie Andrews' vocals were lovely throughout and the Sherman brothers had written a wonderful score, but the highlight for me was the wonderful Feed The Birds \u2013 what nonsensical heartrending sentimentality!If you can criticise this for its beautiful sweetness and light and its splendid lack of gritty realism, I can criticise the porn that is so freely available on the internet for children to pore over nowadays - why isn't anyone worried as much by that?

Really, why don't people make films like this anymore? Recently I've been re-watching many of Stevensons other pictures, which are extraordinary creations; Bedknobs and Broomsticks and the Absent Minded Professor are similarly wonderful.

Travers. Basically set in Edwardian London, 1910, Bert is a cockney jack-of-all-trades Bert (Golden Globe nominated Dick Van Dyke), and entertains the crowd as a one-man band, he takes us to the Banks home on Cherry Tree Lane. The Banks children Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) have run away again, their disgruntled nanny Katie Nanna (Bride of Frankenstein's Elsa Lanchester) quits and leaves. The children are returned home by Constable Jones (Arthur Treacher), after finding them chasing a kite, but now father/husband George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, also voicing the Talking Umbrella), a bank employee, and mother/wife Winifred (Glynis Johns), a suffragette, are looking for a new nanny to look after their children. Jane and Michael write their own advertisement, which Mr. Banks tears up and throws in the fireplace, but the torn paper is gathered by a magical wind and taken up the chimney. The next day, after Mr. Banks has placed his own advertisement, many elderly, sour-faced nannies are waiting outside the Banks house, until they are blown away by a strong gust of wind. Jane and Michael then see a beautiful young nanny float down from the sky holding an umbrella, it is Mary Poppins (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Dame Julie Andrews). After confusing Mr. Banks with the restored children's advert, she hires herself, and convinces him it was his idea, and the children are also amazed by her magic. Mary Poppins helps them to tidy the nursery through song, before taking them on an outing to the park, where they meet Bert. Bert is working as a screever (an artist), Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of Bert's drawings and enter a cartoon world. There they ride horses on, and off, a carousel, Mary Poppins wins a horse race, and describing her victory uses nonsense word, this outing is ruined by a thunderstorm which returns them to London. On another outing, the children are taken to the house of Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who cannot stop laughing, which causes him to float uncontrolably, they join him for a tea party, telling jokes, until they make him sad by Mary Poppins saying they are leaving. Mr. Banks has become frustrated by the cheery atmosphere in the house, and threatens to fire Mary Poppins, but she interjects and convinces him to take the children on an outing to his place of work. Before bed, Mary Poppins tells the children a story about a Bird Woman (Jane Darwell) who sits on the steps outside St. Paul's Cathedral, asking for tuppence to give breadcrumbs to feed the birds. Mr. Banks takes Jane and Michael to the bank, ignoring their request to give tuppence to the Bird Woman, at the bank they meet Mr. Dawes Sr. (Dick Van Dyke), and his son. Mr. Dawes (Arthur Malet). Mr. Dawes Sr. and the other bank directors aggresively try to convince Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, snatching it from him, Michael demands it back, other customer hear the commotion and demand their own money back, causing a bank run. Jane and Michael run away, getting lost in London, until they run into Bert, now working as a chimney sweep, who takes them home. The children wind up magically transported up the chimney and onto the roof, Bert and Mary Poppins join them, and they venture along other rooftops to see London. The group have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, until eccentric Admiral Boom (Reginald Owen) and his first mate Mr. Binnacle (Don Barclay) shoot fireworks at them, and they swarm the Banks home. After the chimney sweeps leave, Mr. Banks receives a phone call from his employers to meet at the bank, before he leaves Bert tells him he should spend more time with his children before they grow up. Jane and Michael give their father Michael's tuppence hoping to make amends, he then leaves and walks through London, past many of the previous locations, and he sees the Bird Woman has gone. At the bank, Mr. Banks is humiliated and dismissed, he looks at the tuppence and starts to laugh, tells a joke, and happily heads home, Dawes Sr. finally gets the joke and starts floating in uncontrollably laughter. The next day, the wind changes, meaning it is time for Mary Poppins to leave, Jane and Michael are saddened, until their father calls them down, having fixed their kite, the family go out together to fly it. In the park, Mr. Dawes reveals that his father died laughing, he re-employs Mr. Banks as a junior partner, and with her work done, Mary Poppins flies away, Bert bids farewell and tells her not to stay away too long. Also starring Hermione Baddeley as Ellen and Reta Shaw as Mrs. Brill. Andrews gives a charming performance as the kind but firm nanny, and Van Dyke is wonderful as the cockney (with a naff accent) and the old bank manager. This was the last feature overseen by Walt Disney before his death, it a sweet and simple story of a magical young woman coming along to help a dysfunctional family, featuring the famous mix of live-action and animation, and wonderfully memorable songs from the Sherman brothers, an enjoyable experience for all ages, a brilliant musical fantasy. Featuring great songs including \"The Life I Lead\", \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Jolly Holiday\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", \"I Love to Laugh\", \"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\" (Disney's favourite song), \"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\", \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" (won the Oscar for Best Original Song), \"Step in Time\", and my favourite \"Let's Go Fly a Kite\". It won the Oscars for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music for brothers Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Director for Robert Stevenson, Best Music (Adaptation or Treatment), Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy and Best Original Score. Julie Andrews was number 6 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, \"Supercalifragilisticexpialodocious\" was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 6 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 25 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Family Films.

I learn that the most important responsibility people have is to their children, for their children. Being there for them, giving them something to meet life head on, and so they can be 'successful' at life.Pity the parents who have a 13 year old alcoholic, or drug addict; oftentimes--in fact, many times--it's not the fault of the parents but the child has a self-destructive bent. But parents are expected to give that spoon full of sugar to help the bitter medicine {of life) go down... And giving children the gift of music as lively as this is no small gift. Raising children is the most important responsibility parents/grown ups have; at the end of the movie Mr and Mrs Banks learn that thanks to their Nanny, Mary Poppins--her job is done and she can leave them to the task of being a family.There is a moral to the movie MARY POPPINS. The story moves seamlessly from song, to dialog, to dancing. When Jane Darwell urges tuppence a bag to feed the birds, there is no more gorgeous and evocative ballad than 'Feed the Birds'. But the ballad propels the story further into different layers. The tuppence Mr Banks wants invested in the bank is what Michael wants to spend on making pigeons fat--a point many viewers would heartily agree with. But the dictum was put forth with Chekhov: If there is a gun on the table in the first act, it had better go off soon. And that's what the movie does with no effort and accretion of detail--like 'Feed the Birds'--to tell a story with a profound moral.With the internet seemingly giving people permission to engage in the most outrageous behavior and offering no checks,this movie gives to children something vastly different and better. When values of 2012 seem to reject any value system, this movie asserts that parents--people who are flawed--still have responsibility to give their children values that will see them through life's struggle.

            "content": "It's an excellent film which served as the screen debut for Julie Andrews, and won this infinitely talented lady a Best Actress Academy Award for this role. Ironically, she only agreed to play the role if she wasn't selected to play Eliza Doolittle, which had made her a star on Broadway, in the film My Fair Lady (1964). Of course, most moviegoers should know that Audrey Hepburn got that role, playing it brilliantly (though her singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon), and was subsequently snubbed by the Academy even though that film won Best Picture.Though I've not read any of the \"Poppins\" books by P. L. Travers, I can't imagine anyone else doing the great job that Ms. Andrews did with the title role. She is simply a joy to watch - \"practically perfect in every way\"! In fact, all of the characters in this film are terrific as well, from:Reginald Owen as the eccentric Navy Admiral Boom who lives down the street on Cherry Tree Lane, firing his cannon regularly to mark the time (even Greenwich takes it's time from him)Arthur Treacher, in his last on-screen role, as Constable Jonesthe Bank's household staff including Elsa Lanchester, the nanny that quits at the beginning, \"Cook\" (Reta Shaw) and especially Hermione Baddeley as EllenMrs. Banks (Glynis Jones), the weak but sensitive mother who's preoccupied with women's right to vote as a suffragettethe kids themselves, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), are the model of incorrigible doe-eyed innocence ... love their singing of \"The Perfect Nanny\" song to their father; that same year, Dotrice & Garber also starred in Disney's The Three Lives of Thomasina (1964), about a catEd Wynn's laughing Uncle Albert (who's uncle is he anyway?) - the Bird Lady (Jane Darwell, The Grapes of Wrath (1940), in her last film)the employees at Mr. Banks' bankBut, other than Ms. Andrews, the person that ties it all together is Dick Van Dyke, quite literally a \"jack of all trades\", the talented actor plays two characters. The multiple jobs his character Bert takes on includes a one man band, a chalk artist, a chimney sweep, and a kite salesman - all of which he plays believably, and with such an endearing smile too. His elderly Mr. Dawes Sr. is comically credible as well.I particularly like the thread, late in the film, in which Bert explains their Father's responsibilities to the children which is then tied to his \"manipulating\" Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson) into realizing his neglect of them. In fact, Tomlinson does a terrific job in this, his best role (one year after he was in the Oscar winning Best Picture Tom Jones (1963), and he gets to say some hilariously un-PC lines like \"slipshod female thinking\" (which is balanced by the line that Mrs. Banks sings \"though we adore men individually, we agree that as a group they're rather stupid\"). The \"manipulation\" scenes of Banks by Mary are also a kick.Both Andrews and Van Dyke are singing talents and the film is loaded with an excellent (Oscar winning) score that includes: \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" (#36 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time list), \"Chim-Chim-Cheree\" (the Oscar winner), and \"Step in Time\" - the choreography in this segment is magical - among others. In addition to (and out of) these melodies, the film gives us many memorable lines:\"A British bank is run with precision, a British home requires nothing less; tradition, discipline and rules, must be the tools\"\"For every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. Find the fun and SNAP, the job's a game\"\"a pie crust promise ... easily made and easily broken\"\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"\"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith ... what was the name of his other leg?\"\"Though her words are simple and few, listen, listen, she's calling to you\", andLet's go fly a kiteThe only negative about the film is its length. It's weakest part, IMO, is the mixed live action and animation segment, when Mary and the children enter Bert's chalk paintings. Though very imaginative (and perhaps the chief reason the film won the Best Effects Oscar), it drags a bit during the uninspired song \"Jolly Holiday\". However, the sequence does end strongly with the \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" number. I also think the part with Uncle Albert on the ceiling (as well as the scene at the bank with its officers and the children?) is somewhat overlong too. The film itself runs over 2 hours and 20 minutes, and I can remember it \"feeling\" so even as a child.Overall all, though, it is an outstanding film which was recognized, in addition to Ms. Andrews' Oscar, with Academy Awards for Best Effects, Editing, Song (Chim-Chim-Cheree), and Best Music, Score - Substantially Original and also received nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Stevenson, his only), Screenplay, Sound, Best Music, Scoring of Music (Adaptation or Treatment), Color Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costume Design. It is also Walt Disney's most successful single film for this type of recognition. #6 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list. Added to the National Film Registry in 2013.",

            "content": "Based on P. L. Travers's beloved children's book and featuring an ensemble cast of some of the greatest actors of their era, including Julie Andrews in her film debut. The Banks family are looking for a new nanny, but the children's application is sent quite literally up the chimney only for it to be picked up by a no-nonsense woman sitting on the edge of a cloud alongside her bottomless bag and a talking umbrella.Widely considered to be the Disney Studios finest achievement, and for a good reason. It's nigh impossible to find a flaw in this film. Everything from Andrew's Academy Award winning performance to the animated segments to the score by the Sherman Brothers is amazing. Not to even mention the story. Thus, instead of looking for flaws, I shall discuss some of my favourite things in this film.First of all, the music. It's hard to find a movie where every single song could be the big showstopper number in a lesser film. But here they are. And they're not all loud and bombastic, though some certainly are. But others are quiet, almost solemn. Feed the Birds or the sudden whispering from Bert (Dick Van Dyke) near the start of the film. Overall top notch job from the Sherman Brothers.It's also technically impressive film, even today. The painted London backgrounds hit just the perfect balance between beautiful and real enough. The animated segments mixed with live-action look great. It would take over two decades for Roger Rabbit to improve upon this standard.But the best part of the film, and why people still love it, is the story as well as the characters. The whole world of this film, really. More than a little kooky, but able to go quiet and thoughtful in the blink of an eye. And at the heart of all that is of course Mary Poppins (Andrews), with her straight-laced attitude and strict manners, which still give way for oddness and exciting strolls over the rooftops of London. But as has been pointed out time and time again, this story is really about Mr. Banks, played by David Tomlinson. What a fine character. In any other film he would be the villain. A strict and distant father figure, from whom Mary Poppins arrives to save the children. But this film is better than that. Mr. Banks obviously loves his children, he simply needs to realize it.I did not see this film as a child, mainly because it's not dubbed very well in my language. But when I saw it as an adult, I was blown away. One of the best children's films I've ever seen. One of the best films I've seen, period.",

There is no edge for mature viewers and many adults are likely to become bored trying to sit through this. Julie Andrews is good in the title role-a role that has dogged her for most of her career. Dick Van Dyke is terribly miscast as the chimney sweep, and his singing fares no better. The simplistic plot has Miss Andrews playing nanny to the children of a bankers dysfunctional family. Sounds familiar.? She would repeat this role a little later in \"The Sound Of Music, but there is no comparing the two because the SOM is a far superior film.There are animated scenes combining animation and live action, but nothing that should worry Karel Zeman. It's all cutsey-poo and the sugary content is enough to send anybody over the age of 10 into shock.This is one of those movies that my mother dragged my younger brother and I to when we were small. I forgave her for it, and she took us to see \"Goldfinger\" to make up for it.Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down? It should be just a spoonful of medicine makes the sugar go down!

She's one of the classiest women we have today, as well as having some of the best films to her name, she is a very beautiful lady, and has maintained that even today. Mary Poppins is one of her best roles and one that I know many of us will never forget - it has earned a place in our hearts and having grown up with it has been lovely. She is the real Mary Poppins, and her version of the classic character is probably the most famous and most loved.With a fantastic music score, great performances, and a cute-as-hell story, there isn't much to not like! My favourite songs are \"The Perfect Nanny\", the catchy \"Spoonful Of Sugar\", and of course, \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" with the adorable animation and Dick Van Dyke. The only real problem I had with this movie was the length. It was quite long and the songs also went on for quite a while. Nevertheless, it is a great film, lots of fun, it is just the length that can be a problem.Dick Van Dyke was very charming in this movie. Although I admit he can't do a cockney accent :), he was good in his role and his goofiness added to the appeal of his character. Julie Andrews was as always, fantastic. She was startlingly beautiful in this film, so much that it is scary! She was \"practically perfect\"! But as well as giving her character Mary Poppins a lovable, sophisticated, and magical side, but she definitely added some grey layers, like she made sure that Mary Poppins was vain and also very spooky in a way. The children were also very sweet and contributed to the movie tremendously.Definitely one of the best musicals of all time.",

At the end when the credit is given for the actor playing Mr Dawes Snr I thought \"What nationality is that? Czech? Serbian?\". I laughed when the letters rearranged themselves to form Dick Van Dyke's name. That's what the film's all about. It makes you feel good from beginning to end. I will admit that if I was up on the ceiling with Uncle Albert I would groan and fall to the ground with an almighty crash when I heard Bert's jokes but I agree with the basic message. There's a lot to be said for laughter. Everybody does very well in the film. The special effects in the film look primitive now and when you see the robins (who cares that they're American robins in London) you can see how much animatronics have advanced. But this is a film that should never be remade.

            "content": "Starting with Johnny Tremain, Robert Stevenson made a career of directing some of the best movies that DIsney made, such as Darby O'Gill and the Little People, The Absent-Minded Professor, That Darn Cat!, Bedknobs and Broomsticks and many more. Of all these movies, Mary Poppins is the best considered.Beyond being a commercial success -- It was the highest-grossing film of 1964 -- Mary Poppins received a total of 13 Academy Awards nominations and won five: Best Actress for Julie Andrews, Best Film Editing, Best Original Music Score, Best Visual Effects and Best Original Song for \"Chim Chim Cher-ee.\" This would be the only time in Walt Disney's lifetime that he'd see that kind of recognition for one of his studio's films.Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights to Mary Poppins from P. L. Travers in 1938. Travers refused, as she didn't think that a film version would work. For two decades, Disney tried to make the movie until Travers agreed in 1961 with the condition that she receive script approval, finally being listed as the consultant to the film.She wasn't a fan of the film, feeling that it cut down too many of the rougher aspects of Poppins, didn't like the music and truly disliked the animation. The result? She ruled out any further adaptations of the later Mary Poppins novels.Travers was not invited to the premiere but managed to get an invitation from a Disney executive. At the after-party, she walked up to Disney and loudly informed him that the animated sequence had to be removed. Disney responded, \"Pamela, the ship has sailed\" and walked away.While the film is really about the redemption of George Banks as Poppins brings his family together, as I saw this as a kid at the Super 51 drive-in, it was really a chance to get a longer episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, one of my childhood favorites.It also had to be some kind of victory for Julie Andrews, who made her feature film acting debut after a successful stage career. She had just dealt with Jack L. Warner, who had replaced her with Audrey Hepburn for the role of Eliza Doolittle in his screen adaptation of My Fair Lady, despite her originated the role on Broadway. It's pretty amazing to do that -- Disney even held up production so she could have her first child -- and win the Best Actress Oscar.If you ever want to see the lasting legacy of this film today, take a ride on the Walt Disney World Monorail System, which this movie paid for. The safety system on all of the train cars is called the MAPO (MAry POppins) safety system and all Walt Disney World Railroad steam locomotives are fitted with a boiler safety device marked MAPO.",

The story of Mary Poppins will endure as the greater classic, because it has been around for so long and was the first to make Andrews a movie star. (She got the best actress Oscar for her superb work.) The songs, actors and plot fit together and really make it work on screen. Some of my favorite songs are \"Feed the Birds\" and \"Sister Suffragette\" (although \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" recieved the best song academy award..thats good too!). The story begins as Burt, a chimney sweep (or a hobo, I can't figure it out), sings songs in the streets of London to passer-bys for a little money, as he predicts the arrival of his good friend Mary Poppins by feeling the direction of the wind. ('Changing wind' becomes symbolic in the story.) Turing to the camera after his performance he greets the audience and helps us find number 17 Cheery Tree Lane, residence of George Banks, an upstanding, no-nonsense british banker type (I guess his last name is just a coincidence...) who believes that all children must be 'molded' and taught by very stern methods. Mrs. Banks, on the contrary, is a free-spirited, feisty women's rights advocate who relishes in throwing eggs at the prime minister and going to rallies. Their two children Jane and Michael (very cute) are left with nasty, old nannies who cannot stand them and so they run away and get in trouble. Trouble indeed ensues after the most recent nanny leaves, when Mr. Banks finds out about the situation he decides to put an advertisement in the Times and hand pick the next one himself. With a little bit of Mary Poppins magic, the advertisement that Jane & Michael write declaring that the new nanny should have \"rosy chheks\" and \"play games, all sorts\" gets reprocessed after Banks tears it up in the fire place, regarding it as rubbish. Mary Poppins of course answers it from her home up in the sky and over takes the household, making it a cheery and fun place to be. Her magic and charm pays off as at the end, after a lot of meditating on Banks part and some blows to his ego, he comes around and learns how to communicate with his children. The wind changes, and so Mary is off to help others in need of a spoon full of sugar to make the medicine go down. This movie is practically perfect in every way.",

Julie Andrews did a great job in her first ever cinematic role, she plays a magical nanny that comes to a rich man's house in order to bring the family back together. What I love about her performance is that she looks very confident and so straight forward and firm, not as playful as you may think. The film also has Dick Van Dyke in the role of Bert, who is a very good friend of Mary Poppins and also handles magic very well. That role was funny and very entertaining(the accent is a bit confusing though), and i loved all of his dance numbers, especially Step In Time, the dance on the roof-top. Another excellent performance was David Tomlinson, who did the role of George Banks, the father of the children. He is very firm and strict, but he can also be very clumsy and forgetful, which is another reason I liked him. His song The Life I Lead was also great. This film was prized with five well-deserved Academy Awards, for the excellent Film Editing, the Visual Effects, like the jump into the pavement picture, the tea party on the ceiling and the smoke ladder, the excellent score, the song Chim Chim Cheree, which may have not been the best song, but one of them had to win, and last but not least, the excellent performance by Julie Andrews.

            "content": "Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Travers' decent books and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time.The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family.What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. it is interesting how her character is never quite clear in her motivations, but that is also a great trait of her character. Andrews is \"practically perfect in every way.\" Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks.The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers (\"Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious\" and \"A Spoonful of Sugar\") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, \"Step in Time, \"A Man has Dreams,\" and the best song of the movie \"Feed the Birds\" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama.Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm and nostalgic, and also thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventureThis is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it.Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.",

With the help of Cockney jack-of- all-trades Burt, Mary and the children go on a series of adventures with the view to improve the family's relationships. The story is now extremely well-known, but that doesn't lessen its impact in any way and I think as a straight-up story it could not be bettered. I like how there's more going on than simply making the family better, with the whole idea of helping Mr. Banks himself. The story knows when to add more drama or add more fun and that's what keeps it so feeling so fresh.As a person who doesn't enjoy signing in films I have to admit I think every single song used in the film is fantastic. It's amazing how well- crafted and catchy all these songs really are, with the Sherman Brothers deserving acclaim for their work. The songs are all so good in their own ways, I love the serene 'Stay Awake', the emotion of 'Feed the Birds' and the sheer energy of 'Step in Time'. They are all classic tunes for a reason and they stay in your head in the most pleasant way that is possible.The performances were key and thankfully all the cast are excellent. Julie Andrews won an Oscar as Mary Poppins as she puts in a truly wonderful turn as the stern but sweet nanny. Everything from her firm delivery to her lovely singing hits the mark, she also has superb chemistry with the rest of the cast. It is hard to think of anyone else in the role. Dick Van Dyke presents one of the dodgiest Cockney accents of all time, but luckily his performance makes up for it. You won't see many actors put as much energy into a part as he does and that's what wins him over, his incredible dancing and comic abilities are put to full use here. He is also naturally likable and makes Burt someone we enjoy being around, a key piece as he acts as the audiences guide. Elsewhere David Tomlinson is brilliant as the strict George Banks, a man who cares about being king of his castle a little too much. He has a soft charm that allows you to understand Mr. Banks' plight despite his harsh actions. The sweet natured Glynis Johns is very amusing as Winifred Banks, always pushing for women's rights. Both Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are excellent as the Banks children, they avoid usual child actor traps as they are both very charming and have many funny moments. The support from Ed Wynn as the easily amused Uncle Albert and Reginald Owen as the eccentric Admiral Boom is top notch. These are all memorable characters that are impossible to dislike.The film is also a visual marvel. It shows the stunning production work that went into proceedings as the film was filmed entirely in Disney's California studios. It has such an authentic feel to it and manages to visualise the streets of Edwardian London in a style that is just beautiful to view. From the cobbled streets to the murky rooftops it all looks wondrous, not to mention the scenes showing the London skyline and the red sunset as they just look glorious. The scenes that involve animation blending with the live-action look very good, they have hardly dated to be fair and it's a technique that is somewhat enchanting. When you have Dick Van Dyke dancing with animated penguins then it is hard not to get carried away. There are so many memorable scenes to be appreciated. The visit to Uncle Albert's which ends up being a Tea Party on the celling, the merry-go round that leads to Mary Poppins winning a horse race or the already mentioned Step in Time scene which is so entertaining that you wish it would never end. The most poignant scene is certainly Mr. Banks walk to the bank for the last time, the sombre image of him walking through deserted streets is quite something, as the crisp lighting and beautiful music add massive amounts of atmosphere. It's great how the film allows there to be some deeper pieces as that offers it even more balance.I'd have to say Mary Poppins is a true classic. It really is a film that can appeal immensely to any age, as there is something here that anybody can relate to no matter what. It's so difficult to find any faults with the film and I think that is praise enough, nothing really needs changing because it is all so good. The performances of Andrews and Van Dyke cannot be praised enough, the support (especially Tomlinson) is outstanding, the music is so of the best put to film, the visuals are stunning and there is a real emotion to the story that draws you in. Mary Poppins is just a magical experience that can be enjoyed over and over again.",

What has the world come to that children are considered too sophisticated these days for this sugary tale? Personally, I would prefer that my children have a dose of Mary Poppins' sugar to help them deal with the medicine of everyday life, as opposed to a heaping plate full of most of the garbage out there that is supposedly tailored to modern kids. To dislike Mary Poppins is the equivalent of disliking apple pie, roses, fireworks, and cute cuddly puppies.This delightful tale tells the story (circa 1910) of a banker's two rather mischievous children, Jane and Michael, who are somewhat ignored by their preoccupied, prosperous parents, named Mr. and Mrs. Banks. They are in need of a new nanny, so the magical Mary Poppins appears, descending dramatically from the sky with her umbrella and proceeding to take charge. She is firm with her young charges but also fun, taking them on fantastic adventures, including a visit to her humble friend, Bert, the chimney sweep (endearingly portrayed by Dick Van Dyke). Naturally Mr. Banks does not always approve of this new nanny's methods.Mary Poppins is wonderfully portrayed by Julie Andrews, who deserved her Best Actress Oscar for the role. Not only her acting of course, but also her singing. The music in this film is wonderful, giving us such immortal tunes as A Spoonful of Sugar, Let's Go Fly a Kite, the haunting Feed the Birds, and the Oscar winning Chim Chim Cher-ee.It's a magical masterpiece, a tribute to the imagination.

Julie Andrews was truly a beautiful woman back in the 60's (and still is now) and her performance in this is nothing short of spectacular. Though this film somewhat feels more appropriate for Broadway, you really do get caught up in the movie.Now that I'm grown up and no longer a young kid, you really realise the messages that the film is trying to say. The importance of family, the importance of seeing past what your eyes can only see on the surface and also the importance of having an imagination at such a young age. The special effects are also pretty good and the whole cast is charming.The second half of the film gets more into the meaning and purpose of the film, which is simply Mary Poppins trying to fix up the family, especially the Dad who is extremely stubborn and who she has to find a way to work around.This is a magical film that all ages can enjoy.

The songs are quite remarkable, if not consistently silly. The story line of a hired Nanny (of the children's' wishes) fixing a family is both accessible and endearing. The fun is simply in learning a new attitude on how to deal with issues or problems, which is the only children's' movie that I can think of that successfully does so. Julie Andrews is great at not being super smiley while Dick Van Dyke is Cockney-annoying but coming out of the shadows at the end to earn his \"diamond in the rough\" MP moniker. The kids can't sing and that's great. In the days of singing star shows, reality works in the face of a magical experience. Following up with \"Saving Mr. banks\" 50 years later was also a treat.",

I have never understood why Julie never took Disney and him to task for perpetrating it upon us. She is, after all, a Brit so if she couldn't tell them who could? it was her first movie (I think) so maybe she was too overwhelmed to speak up. The film was far too long by about a half hour if not more and I grew impatient for it to end. My wife loathes Julie Andrews because her diction is so perfect - that trait repels and fascinates me at the same time.

This is one of those movies that does exactly that, and possibly the best example of that statement.\"Mary Poppins\" is a 1964 musical film based on the works of author P.L. Travers about a magical mysterious nanny who is summoned to take care of two children who have a father who is barely around them because of his job. The film takes place in London, and the previous nanny hired by George Banks, Esq. (David Tomlinson) quits because she is tired of chasing after his children, Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber), even though they were after their runaway kite. So George Banks, who is a strict father figure, and his wife (Glynis Johns), decide to hire a new nanny that will set their children straight. Surprisingly, this gets the attention of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), and she whisks down to take the job as nanny. Jane and Michael eventually find out that she is a magical nanny with lots of surprises up her sleeve, from possessing a bottomless bag of things to the ability of transporting the children into a chalk portrait that immediately comes alive as soon as they jump in. Though she is kind, gentle, and as perfect as any human being can be, she is firm when it comes to her job as a nanny, and all the more mysterious, which pops a lot of questions into the supporting characters' heads. Let's not forget the re- occurrence of Bert (Dick Van Dyke), who interacts with the audience most of the time he's on screen, even with his poor, yet hilarious English accent.The movie has gotten a lot of attention over the years, mostly from those who study film like myself and those who have children that enjoy everything made by Disney, both the good, and unfortunately the bad. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The movie today continues to captivate audiences around the globe with its Oscar-winning music and dance numbers, cinematography, and unique filmmaking techniques that Disney is often known for, to the point of mixing live-action and animation and that unforgettable song that only some can spell correctly.Even with its happy moments, there's also some moody moments as well. There's a scene in the movie where Andrews sings a song about a woman who is surrounded by birds and asks for change in exchange for bird food bags. The heart-hitting music and lyrics in the scene actually manages to pretty much move anyone to tears, from the camera work to the expertly composed orchestrations from conductor Irwin Kostal and the famous Sherman Brothers.\"Mary Poppins\" is a timeless film for the ages. As a classic movie, it's a masterpiece in filmmaking and musical direction. It went on to earn 5 Oscars, including a nomination for best picture. Unfortunately, it lost to \"My Fair Lady\", which was another musical. While I disagree with that decision, I will say that it more than deserved what it got.",

And using all the \"sugar\" that Disney can manufacture, it helps children in the audience to swallow some hard truths about adult life.**SPOILERS BELOW**I'm not proud to say it, but I will: I have been fired before.  And whether I deserved it or not, I felt awful.  And so I was captivated by what happened to Mr. Banks.At the beginning of the film, George W. Banks is a pompous buffoon, who doesn't listen to his wife and who ignores his children.  Almost always such buffoons get a pie in the face in the last ten minutes of a movie.  But this movie does the unexpected: it redeems George W.When he was told to report to the bank at 9 p.m., he knew what that meant. But he didn't make excuses, or try to shift the blame, either during that tense phone call or in person in the board room.  And he walked to the bank, without wife or children or even strangers to comfort him (the streets were empty), and yet Banks didn't run away.  Did anyone but me notice, he even climbed the cathedral steps to give Michael's tuppence to the Bird Lady, but she too was gone?  Buffoon he might have been earlier, but while walking to that 9 p.m. meeting, Banks was a powerhouse of a man.Meanwhile, Mary Poppins was planting ideas: in George's head that he should spend time with his children, before their childhoods ended; and Mary taught the children that their father might have problems he doesn't feel free to talk about.  Amid all the dancing penguins, these are ideas that real families can take out of the theater and use.I loved \"Mary Poppins\" when I was ten, the year it came out.  I saw it for the second time yesterday, at forty-eight.  It's still an exceptional film, perfect but for DVD's awful \"Cockney\" accent.  Fact is, I enjoyed it more this second time, because I found much more to appreciate.Two other comments about the movie itself: 1) DVD when playing Old Dawes did some great things with physical comedy, as good as anything Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, or Charlie Chaplin could have invented.2) Julie Andrews in this movie was, I heartily agree, a stone fox.",

A lot of the songs are catchy and memorable such as 'Chim-Chim-Cheree,' 'Sister Suffragette (the song sung by Mrs. Banks and the Maids I believe),' 'The Perfect Nanny,' 'Spoonful of Sugar,' 'Jolly Holiday' 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,' 'I Love to Laugh,' 'Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag),' 'Step in Time' and 'Let's Go Fly A Kite.' I also liked the nostalgic-sounding incidental music and the instrumental arrangements of 'Spoonful of Sugar' but there is a small handful of songs I find forgettable. The technicolor cinematography is wonderful and the animated sequence is fun to watch. The special effects, such as the nannies blowing in the wind and the smoke forming a staircase, are advanced for 1964 but the firework effects, although colourful, look cheaper. As well as the songs I found forgettable and the cheap firework effects, the other drawbacks are the bank scenes being a tad boring and the film being too long for my tastes but the pace was fairly swift and there are plenty of scenes to keep me entertained, especially the animated sequence in the countryside, the nursery-tidying scene, the floating towards the ceiling scene (it's funny when Mary says the people staying afloat are laughing like a pack of hyenas) and the 'Feed the Birds' scene. Mary Poppins is a magical and kind if firm nanny, Mr. Banks is initially strict but has a change of character towards the end, Jane and Michael are endearing children and Bert is great fun with his three different jobs (one-man- band, pavement artist and chimney sweep) but the admiral who stands atop the Banks' house is confusing and pretty pointless. I even found this film useful to watch as part of a written assignment at university where I have to produce a case study of the portrayal of London in film and 'Mary Poppins' depicts London as a dark and grimy place but the countryside as a colourful and cheerful place.Albeit the small number of forgettable songs, the boring bank scenes and the film's length, 'Mary Poppins' is a delightful slice of nostalgia with a wide variety of characters, an amusing animated sequence and the majority of the music being well worth listening and singing along to. 9/10.",

He cited Van Dyke's performance in Mary Poppins as an example of someone who could do almost anything superbly. He said, who cares about the accent when you can sing, dance and act like that? If someone like Hopkins who is one of the greatest actors of our time can see past the one teensy flaw in this multi-talented man's performance--for which I've always held he should have been nominated for an Oscar--how about the rest of us stopping obsessing over it?

Disney found that in P. L. Travers' book, and it was a two-decade journey for just getting the rights. Fate had scored the first point, Robert Stevenson would direct the film but there was more to work on. When you make a musical, you got to get the right songwriters.And I didn't even know, until now, that the Sherman brothers contributed to some of the most memorable Disney songs, from \"The Jungle Books\" to Maurice Chevalier's ultimate contribution in \"The Aristocats\", from \"Winnie the Pooh\" to the Disneyland theme. They did a terrific job with \"Mary Poppins\", enriching it with such classics as \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\", \"Supercalifragistliciexpialidocious\" (now, I can say it) or the haunting \"Feed the Birds\", an emotional highlight featuring Jane Darnell (Ma Joad) in her last cameo, a hymn for kindness and generosity that shed a few tears from the boss himself and became his favorite song.The versatility of the brothers allowed them to shine in every possible emotion and grab the very laughter and tears they mention in their iconic \"It's a Small World\". They believed that all their songs had a specific reason to exist within the story, and thinking about it, I don't think there's any song even in \"The Jungle Book\" that could be considered a filler, even the vultures' song was made like a barbershop quartet to make they sound friendlier. Still, even the best songs in the world couldn't have worked if it wasn't for the most crucial part: the casting. And if it wasn't for Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, I don't think the film would have been half the classic it is\u0085 or as beloved.Julie Andrews was the upcoming actress-singer but had no experience in movies and only made a name for herself from her sensational performance in the Broadway version of \"My Fair Lady\". But look how destiny was on the march, Disney discovered Andrews in a play named \"Camelot\", he loved her, even Mrs. Travers admitted that she had the right \"nose\", whatever that meant. But imagine if Jack Warner had picked Julie Andrews for the film adaptation of \"My Fair Lady\". I might reconsider what I said about the casting of Audrey Hepburn, I'm glad she was miscast because any other actress than Andrews would have been an even worse mishap. This is the role that gave her breakthrough performance, her Oscar and allowed her to twirl around the hills in\" The Sound of Music\".And as if things weren't good enough, another actor captured the right spirit for such a joyful and blissful adventure: scene-stealing Dick Van Dyke. He didn't have any experience in dancing but his act with the penguins and the chimney workers, his gravity-defying laughing part with Ed Wynn's Uncle Albert and his second performance as elderly banker make him one of the film's main driving forces, as a comic relief, a one-man band, or a one-man Greek chorus with the haunting and charming \"One Chimney, two Chimney\u0085\" . Van Dyke and Andrews elevate the film to summits that make \"My Fair Lady\" look like a bland TV movie. And driven by the extraordinary chemistry, it inspired Disney to make a souvenir out of this pair and have this enchanting journey in animation world with the penguins, the horses and the \"Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious\" song.Every once in a while, you have one Disney film that break the grounds and this is one of them, like \"Fantasia\" or \"Roger Rabbit\", one that push the envelope and proves that, the word 'impossible' doesn't exist in Disney's dictionary. The use of animatronics (from the same engineers who made the attraction in Disneyland) contributed to the delightful humming bird moment and the magnificent flying with laughter moments emphasized the whole dream-like escapism of the film, and it's funny since I mentioned the same for a totally different movie \"Crouching Tiger, and Hidden Dragon\", but the two show how utterly inspiring and poetic such moments are. As for the mix between live-action and animation, it isn't a revolution, actually, it even preceded Mickey Mouse, as Walt started with the adventures of Alice with a little girl evolving in an animated world.And it seems like with \"Mary Poppins\", Walt Disney had just come full circle with himself and made a last offering to the world, one that came close to win the Best Picture Oscar, the only Oscar he missed.Never mind, he'd achieved his last dream and with his inspiration, allowed many talents to combine and contribute to such a astounding and glittery masterpiece. And I feel so ashamed to have diminished the value of Disney's work in the 60's, \"Mary Poppins\" was the fireworks in the man's twilight. I could go on and on about Disney, but I think Sherman brothers said more about him with these simple and touching lyrics:\"A man has a dream and that's the start, He follows his dream with mind and heart\u0085 And when it becomes a reality, it's a dream come true for you and me\" Thanks, Uncle Walt for making your dreams coming true for us, and enriching our dreams with your inspiration, and your talent!",

The story and the effects (in particular the awful animatronic birds in the \"Spoonful of Sugar\" song) are dated. Seeing Mary fly in on her wires is pretty bad compared to the stuff kids see today with Harry Potter flying around on a broomstick. Ditto the way everyone goes flying in the \"Love to Laugh\" number. For kids today, its just weak.I love the music and the chemistry between Andrews and Van Dyke, but what was so amazing in 1964 is just seen as bad to audiences who are new to this film and don't come in with a reservoir of love for it.Sorry, but in the 21st century Mary Poppins just doesn't fly.",

            "content": "Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like \"Show White,\" \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"101 Dalmatians.\" With \"Mary Poppins,\" however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled \"Mary Poppins\" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, \"Feed The Birds.\" Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make \"Mary Poppins\" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), \"Let's Go Fly A Kite.\" The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.",

I watched it out of curiosity, and was quite pleased by what I had seen. This movie is a marvel, especially for its time, with outstanding performances from Julie Andrews as the lead, and Dick van Dyke as Bert. The music is all very well written and composed, as well as quite catchy. The choreography in the movie must be my favorite technical aspect, as I was blown away by the size and scale of the film.However, I did have some issues with the film. First of all, the two children, Jane and Micheal, aren't very convincing children, but I ignore that because they're child actors. Several of the songs are overly long, and do interfere with the story, and I just keep wondering,\"what does this add to the overall narrative?\".about Mary's character, While I feel Mary herself isn't very developed, the hidden aspect of her personality is quite justified by the resolution of the movie. Dick van Dyke is also occasionally grating with his thick cockney accent, but was never too annoying.The rooftop scene was both amazing in the sense of choreography, and slightly grating as the song went on. The film thankfully never fully annoyed me, but I was bothered by these aspects.This is one of the greatest and most magical of all the movies I've seen by Disney, and I am very glad to have had the opportunity to see it myself.",

I thought that scene looked great. I also thought the \"Fly a Kite\" scene looked great and the ending was wrapped up nicely.All in all, I like how the whole movie was placed together, the editing, directing, cinematography, etc. Weak parts were how the director shot the old woman feeding pigeons part which looked corny.

Her beauty and charisma combined with her acting are one of the biggest advantages of this film. Dick Van Dyke is great choice for the role of Bert and kids are very cute. Directing is great, special effects fantastic for its time and animation perfectly integrated. Music is excellent and almost every song became evergreen hit. But all of that is less important. What makes this movie one of the best of all time is wonderful emotion it brings. It tells one of the most beautiful stories ever told. When it makes you laugh, it's not because something is funny, but because it pours pure joy into your heart. When it makes you cry, it's not because it's sad or pathetic, but because it's sincere and genuine the way only kids are able to be. Movie that everyone should see at least once in a lifetime.

            "content": "Just recently, I watched this film with my younger sister, who is pretty much obsessed with the whole \"High School Musical\" phenomenon. I wanted to show her the musical that defined MY childhood, but wasn't sure how she would react to the dated graphics and themes. I was pleasantly surprised to find that she found the film to be very entertaining, from the goofy songs to the crazy characters to the wacky animation.In all honesty, though, what is not to like about this charming film?! The areas in which the movie excels include:Plot: Simple enough (Nanny swoops down from above to take care of somewhat-neglected children) for children to understand, but with just enough political undertones to keep adults' attention, something that does not occur in HSM (in that series, either you buy into the catchy tunes or you don't...there's no middle ground).Acting: Julie Andrews (as Mary Poppins) and Dick Van Dyke (as chimney-sweep Bert) turn in incredible performances that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and there isn't a member of the supporting cast that doesn't bring something interesting to the table.Music: Of course, a musical film is ultimately judged by the success of its musical numbers, and in that case \"Mary Poppins\" is a rousing success! It would take too long to rate all the musical numbers in this movie, but suffice it to say that they offer something for everyone. I personally love the chimney-sweep's \"Step In Time\" upbeat dance, while my younger sister's favorite was, as she would said, \"the one with the dancing penguins!\".Overall, \"Mary Poppins\" is a movie that can be enjoyed by any and all ages from now until the end of time. Please watch the film to sustain your own craving for nostalgia, then introduce it to your children/relatives to show them that musicals need not be set in high school.",

The music was very good one song in particular is so hard to say its like saying a tongue twister.

We didn't finish it during the first viewing, my teacher put it back on about a week later and we finished the movie. After school, I asked my mother to buy me the movie on videotape. When she went to go buy it, the store was sold out of \"Mary Poppins\" videos. So, she bought me a \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968) tape instead. You all know how that turned out. But, she did buy me a \"Mary Poppins\" tape a few days later. Now, I might like \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" better, but I still think that \"Mary Poppins\" is a fantastic movie!MY OFFICIAL REVIEW FOR \"MARY POPPINS\":\"Mary Poppins\" (1964), out of all the live-action films that were produced by Walt Disney himself, this is, without a doubt, the best one. Also, it's one of my top 10 favorite family films. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, great special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story of this movie is based off a book by P.L. Travers. She also wrote seven other \"Mary Poppins\" books, I have read one of the novels in elementary school, the one that the film is based off of, but not the other seven. The storyline in the movie follows the book very closely, with a couple of differences. In the book, Mary Poppins is a lot more stern and strict. Also, the wind controlled her when she first arrived. Of course, some alterations are necessary to meet movie standards. But, these changes do not hurt anything at all. This is one of the most unique storylines in any family/children's film. It keeps you invested from beginning to end, and you're always excited for what happens next! The acting is superb, from all of the actors and actresses, especially from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke as Bert! Julie Andrews performance is nothing short of phenomenal, she really helped bring this film to life. She is such a joy to watch on-screen in this movie. Her portrayal of Mary Poppins is iconic, and by far her best performance. Her character is loving and caring, yet stern. That's the biggest difference between her portrayal in this movie than in the book. In the movie, she is a lot nicer and charming. However, she is strict whenever it's necessary. I really enjoy the movie version of Mary Poppins much more than the book version. Dick Van Dyke as Bert/Mr. Dawes Senior is just as fantastic, however, there is one flaw that can't be overlooked; his over exaggerated Cockney accent when he plays as Bert. Even as a kid, I thought his accent was a little over the top. It's definitely one of the worst accents I've heard in any movie or TV show. But, that being said, his performance is so charming and fun that you can forgive his terrible English accent attempt. Granted, trying to imitate a foreign accent can be a challenge. Still, his performance as Bert is so great that you can forget about the accent. Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as Jane and Michael are a lot of fun to watch. David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns as George and Winifred Banks are fantastic. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they are great and really bring this movie to life. All of the sets/locations are wonderful, and give the movie an excellent atmosphere. It looks like it takes place in a storybook, which is cool! The special effects are well done, and hold up to this day. There are some that are a bit cheesy, particularly some of the green-screen shots. However, they are still passable though. All of the special effects are great, especially for that time! Finally, the soundtrack composed by the Sherman Brothers is phenomenal. The Sherman Brothers are on my top 10 all-time favorite movie composers list. All of the songs are excellent, and really tie the film together. Out of all the live-action films that Walt Disney himself produced, \"Mary Poppins\" is definitely his crowning achievement. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"Mary Poppins\", go see it today. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! If you have kids, show them this movie. You'll be glad you did, and they'll be happy too. But, this movie can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is \"practically perfect\" in every way!",

By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.  Not that that mattered.  To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must-see movie of that summer--the way \"Star Wars\" would be in the next decade.  I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap-dancing with the penguins and crying during the \"Bird Woman\" song (which was as much social commentary as a sentimental tune about our feathered friends). I became a fan of Dick Van Dyke's show after this--he basically won my heart as Bert--the jack-of-all-trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.  For the rest of that summer, man, I WAS Mary Poppins.  My mom bought me a record of all the songs, I used her old Avon sample case as my carpetbag, and I acted out the movie every day. If VCRs and DVDs had been everyday household items then, I would have asked for \"Mary Poppins\" for Christmas. (It would have been worn out by Easter, most likely!)As happens to children almost overnight, my interests changed over the next year and I sort of got over my fixation with Mary, Bert, et. al.  After all, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke went on to other things after that, so why not me?  And then in the 90s, Disney re-released \"Mary Poppins\" as a video.  I bought it for my daughter (or at least that was the excuse I gave my husband). Though she was too young to understand everything in the movie--just as I was the first time I saw it--she, too, loved \"Mary Poppity\" as she called it.  We must have played it at least 3 times a week during the first summer we had it, while living in temporary housing and waiting for our house to be built.  She, too, loves to act this one out and to sing the songs for hours on end.  The apple does not fall far from the tree, I guess.As for me. . .it's all I remembered it to be, and then some. For starters, the music. . .what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score--they were beautifully put together.  And the little details are delightful, too.  Among them:  Mrs. Banks, who is a feminist (at least when Mr. Banks isn't around) wears bloomers--and later in the movie, we discover Mary Poppins does, too.  (don't blink, or you'll miss seeing them)  The relationship between Mary and Bert. . .as a child I thought they were probably a couple but never had time to see each other because of their work.  Now?  I think they would be a couple if they got a lucky break.  Let's face it--she's a nanny and he's a lower-level tradesman. Even if they did get married,  in 1910, the realities of British society were such that if you weren't part of the gentry, you worked for a living, and changing your \"class\" or status didn't happen.  A shame, because their characters obviously love children very much.  So they do the next best thing--work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle-class homes--mainly by shaking up the parents.  Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one--he was the idea man, and she handled the implementation. And therein is the secret:  this movie was not as much about Mary, Bert, and the kids as it is about Mary, Bert, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks.  It's when Mr. Banks realizes that his children don't need a nanny to be happy--they just need their parents to love them and give them their attention--that he also becomes the man that the Bank needs.  The scene between Bert and Mr. Banks at the house is one of the best in the movie.  As for the ending?  When I was a child, I didn't understand it.  Now, as an adult, I do.  The mission was accomplished, and it was time to move on.  As one of the main characters said, all was as it should be.So is this movie.  Enjoy it with your own daughter. . .",

            "content": "I'm not ashamed to say that MARY POPPINS is truly one of the best-loved films of my childhood. Everything about it was, quite literally of course, magical for me. The idea of a nanny as cool as Mary Poppins (a simply delightful Julie Andrews) coming to live with me, helping me clean up with a snap of the fingers, singing me to sleep with one of the loveliest voices known to the world, bringing me on adventures in sidewalk-painting lands and on rooftops at nightfall--it's small wonder that the songs and the story have stayed with me even over a couple of decades into (supposed!) adulthood. I just rewatched the film for the first time in at least ten (if not more) years, and it's still as fresh and funny as I remember it. My love for it hasn't been diminished by time; rather, my enjoyment of it as a child probably contributes to my renewed interest today. After all, I remember the penguins tap-dancing with Bert (Dick Van Dyke), the horses flying off the merry-go-round, Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) laughing so hard he floats, the chimney sweeps dancing merrily over the rooftops and through the Banks house... it's incredible fun to relive and rewatch these scenes from my childhood.The entire film is fleshed out with songs galore, great ones from the justly ubiquitous 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' (whew!), the cheery 'A Spoonful Of Sugar' (sung as a meaningful reprise by Dick Van Dyke at the end), 'Chim-Chim-Cheree', 'Let's Go Fly A Kite', my personal favourite 'Feed The Birds (a simple, gorgeous, heart-rending song), and many more. You also couldn't get a better lead actress than Julie Andrews, who plays the stern, \"practically perfect\" Mary Poppins wonderfully--it's a shame that the last third of the film, in a hurry as it is to tie up the loose ends, neglects Mary somewhat (possibly my only complaint about the film) and goes on a little too long (the chimney sweep dance is charming for about half the length of time it goes on). But Andrews really is marvellous in the role, particularly in her final scene when she talks to her parrothead umbrella and we realise that, beneath all the sternness, she does love the children after all. But aside from that, her voice is stunning; she is radiant and well-deserving of her Academy Award (even given the MY FAIR LADY mess that cluttered the year's Oscars).MARY POPPINS had a great supporting cast as well. I mean, of course, the children (Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber), Mr Banks (David Tomlinson) and the rest... but most especially Dick Van Dyke as Bert. Deplorable Cockney accent or no (and I wouldn't have known as a child, since I don't live in the UK and I thought it perfectly respectable--apparently I was wrong! [g]), he brings his long-legged, quirky charm to the role. Bert could really be quite an annoying character; Van Dyke makes him endearing. Another supporting character worthy of mention would be the special effects in the film--from the combination of live-action and cartoon, through to the smoke staircase, the magical folding clothes and opening doors, and the floating tea party. The story needed that touch of magic that only Disney could provide, and it was effective enough (and mostly stands up to scrutiny, even almost 40 years later) to help rather than hinder the overall charm of the film.Watching MARY POPPINS now as an adult, I can see the darker undertones to the film's message that I missed as a child, and in a way, I'm very glad I saw this film before I had the time to realise what was being suggested about society and patriarchy. The simple message, the one you should take from the film, is simply to be happy. To not forget that the biggest things in life are often the ones that we take for granted; that tuppence can be the smallest sum and the greatest joy to different people. This film simply appeals to the imagination in a way very few other films do or can... helped along by the great big dollops of charm and exuberance provided by the writing, the cast and the songs. A wonderful film to show your child, and possibly the best one to carry through your life with you.",

            "content": "\"Magical\" is about the only term I can use to describe 'Mary Poppins (1964),' Robert Stevenson's marvellous live-action Disney musical that I have treasured since my youngest years. When two mischievous young children, Jane and Michael (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) request a nanny with a \"cheery disposition, rosy-cheeks and no warts,\" they could never have anticipated the arrival of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), purportedly the loveliest woman in existence, practically perfect in every way. Along with merry working-class man, Bert (Dick Van Dyke), the young children are taken on magical adventures more amazing than anything they could ever have imagined, helped along by some first-class visual effects and an assortment of memorable song-and-dance numbers. 'Mary Poppins' turned out to be one of Walt Disney's all-time most successful motion pictures, winning five Oscars at the 1965 Academy Awards {including Best Actress for Andrews} from an incredible thirteen nominations {which included Best Picture and Best Director).Though Julie Andrews obviously steals the show as the kind and sweet \u0096 but also slightly vain \u0096 Mary Poppins, my most recent viewing of the film has uncovered the incredible acting performance of David Tomlinson, who plays Mr. George W. Banks, the father in the wealthy household. As his surname suggests, Banks is every bit as punctual and meticulous as the bank at which he works, arriving home each night at exactly 6:01 PM and revelling in the precision of his timing (\"The Life I Lead\"). However, George's preoccupation with his career has predictably opened a rift between himself and his family, and, being the proudly independent man that he is, it is ultimately up to the young children to bridge the ever-expanding gap. Though her character doesn't prove quite as significant, Glynis Johns is a lot of fun as Mrs. Winifred Banks, a spoiled mother who chooses to spend all her time fighting feminist causes.The highlights of 'Mary Poppins' are too numerous to mention, but my favourite sequence has always been the chimney-sweeps' antics across the roof-tops of old London (\"Step in Time!\"), as they dance and jump all over the place, nonchalantly skirting the edges of the buildings. That timeless image of the blackened silhouettes skipping feverishly atop the chimney-tops is one that I have never forgotten. Also take into consideration the wonderful extended adventure inside Bert's countryside chalk pavement drawing, probably the most brilliant instance of live-action/animation interaction outside of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).' All actors have a lot of fun with the musical numbers, which were scored by Richard and Robert Sherman. Whether you're seeing the film for the first time, or reliving it for the one hundredth time, 'Mary Poppins' remains a delightful, magical, magnificent cinematic treat that you'll never forget. In fact, now that I think about it, I spent the best part of yesterday quietly whistling 'A Spoonful of Sugar' to myself!",

I have had two cats named \"Tuppence\" (the present one was adopted and was already named \"Chirp,\" therefore he is now called \"Tuppence-Chirp.\" I wore out my VHS copy so now I have the DVD.

            "content": "'A British bank is run with precision!' \"Mary Poppins\" is a lively family musical that fashions an inviting fantasy world out of Edwardian London. It is a rare film that successfully incorporates potshots at fox-hunting, accessible song craft and an exploration of parenting.Before the arrival of Mary 'practically perfect in every way' Poppins, we are introduced to the children's parents - too busy with their various concerns to truly give their children any time. Mrs Banks (Glynis Johns) is a skittish campaigner for women's suffrage; Mr Banks (David Tomlinson) is a patriarch of the old-school, a moralising leftover from the Victorian era. A Galsworthian man of property, business and propriety.Disney's view of London has a strange charm all of its own: a delusional old sea captain and 'crew' presiding over a mock-ship in the sky; sooty chimney-sweeps engaging in elaborate rooftop choreography; an absurdly penny-pinching banking business located in a grandiose building of Neo-Classical proportions, propped up by Athenian columns. A police constable (Arthur Treacher) every bit as reassuring as old George Dixon of Dock Green himself. One gets a sense of the London of E. Nesbit; the progressive middle-classes influenced by Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw and the Webbs, captured in novels like \"The Story of the Treasure Seekers\" (1898). There is social change, yet there are still advertisements for nannies placed in The Times; still straight-faced claims that 'the British pound is the admiration of the world'.The dialogue and song lyrics are crafted with a good deal of wit and lightness of touch: from the famously long nonsense word I needn't reproduce, to odd mentions of 'rum punch', to 'Chim Chim Cheree' to the stately vocabulary afforded Mr Banks in speech and song, it is a film that takes joyous liberty with language. Some of the lyrics match W.S. Gilbert in their satirical capturing of the English gentleman.Julie Andrews? Well, she is perfectly cast as the utterly strait-laced lady of misrule, Mary Poppins. The chaos she creates is controlled, and with a decided point: to educate both children and parents, coating some unpalatable truths in sugar. Bert and Poppins work to bring the family together, helping the children to understand their father, and vice versa. As with so many family films, there is explicit criticism of capitalist greed and an assertion that people will see the error of their ways and behave better: the bankers forgive Mr Banks and he is accepted back into the fold.As David Thomson argues in his seminal Biographical Dictionary of Film, Julie Andrews only really made sense in films of this particular time; her Poppins is redolent of an era marked by its security, despite JFK's assassination and the Cuban Missile Crisis. She captures a pre-Beatles practicality; an Englishness of controlled amusement but little time for 'frivolity'. A cheeriness underpinned by responsibility, only the coyest hints of sexuality permitted (in a brief moment with Van Dyke in the painting sequence). P.L. Travers, the author of the original novels, thought that her Poppins was diluted, made rather too palatable. It is interesting to speculate what a Glenda Jackson or Diana Rigg could have made of the role.Of course, the Van Dyke accent is awful, wandering between stage cockney and his own, and I do confess to some irritation at his incessant, Donald O'Connor-in-your-face performance, but it fits within the context of what is a stylised fantasy London; indeed, an American imagining of it. It will be interesting to compare with the same year's \"My Fair Lady\".David Tomlinson is perhaps the unsung hero of the film, indeed its heart; his Mr Banks is an utterly convincing archetypal traditionalist who gradually opens up, becoming a man who can relish his own absurdity; who learns to live anew. His songs are my favourites of the film - particularly the late, reflective one ('A man has dreams'). The child actors somehow manage the feat of being enthusiastic without being cloying. It is a limitation, however, that Glynis Johns is not given more to do; her character undergoes little development in comparison with her husband.Whilst there are minor reservations and gripes to be found, the life-affirming qualities of this film cannot be denied. It is an achievement - a monument even - that Disney has not been able to surpass; offering something for everyone, child and adult alike. Bankers and fox-hunters not withstanding.",

Nominated for Best Picture and winning Best Actress for Julie Andrews at the 37th Academy Awards, it was the most successful Disney venture up to that time. Released in 1964 in the midst of the final years of large scale musicals, the film also starred Glynis Johns as the Banks mother, David Tomlinson as the father, Dick Van Dyke as Bert the chimney sweep and Matthew Garber and Karen Dotrice as the Banks' children.The most memorable sequence of the film is the animated journey through the English countryside upon carousel-horseback and the song \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" sung by Andrews and Van Dyke. This is a film in which can never be repeated because it was so well made. It had grandeur and beauty, and is timeless, and unforgettable. It is \"Mary Poppins.\"",

Enchanting is too weak a word to describe its impact.Julie Andrews still haunts my dreams, more often as Mary Poppins than as Maria von Trapp. In weeks of seeing the film (In Calcutta, we saw it after THE SOUND OF MUSIC)I knew all the songs by heart, I had been to the cinema 3 times in 6 weeks to see it, had read 4 of the books by the end of the year (1968), and had been heartbroken by Mary Poppins' final departure in MARY POPPINS OPENS THE DOOR.I still grow misty-eyed at the end whenever I watch it. God, if He/She/It exists, be thanked for P.L. Travers and Walt Disney and Julie Andrews. In retrospect, the film is very episodic, the character of Mary Poppins very different from the one Travers created, but for many like me who saw the film before reading the books, Julie Andrews (and what a heavenly voice!) became the archetypal lovable governess.",

The children are played very flat and one dimensional and don't bring the childlike energy and exuberance the roles require.

David Tomblinson is a blast as the father, as are the children. There is solid support also from the likes of Glynnis Johns, Hermione Baddely and Elsa Lanchester.

The songs and choreography are what makes so timeless, as well as the outstanding animated sequences. One of my favourite scenes was the one on the ceiling, with the terrible jokes, but you couldn't help laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. In contrast Mr Banks walking to his financial doom ties with Feed the Birds as the most moving scene of the film. It also teaches some nice family values as well.

Simply, Ms. Andrews, with her angelic face, is the right choice for this role. Dick Van Dyke as Bert is a joyous as a sidewalk artist. Karen Dotrice (Jane Banks) and Matthew Garber (Michael Banks) are two lively and sad children at the same time.

Jane and Michael Banks are the children of the wealthy Mr Banks who, believe it or not, works in a bank. Dick Van Dyke plays Mary's friend Bert, who has a different job everyday, and Mr Dawes Sr, who works at the bank with Mr Banks. Jane and Michael just want their father to pay attention to them. they run away multiple times, driving away many nannies. When Mary Poppins comes to answer their advertisement that Mr Banks ripped up and placed in the fireplace so carefully the night before, Jane and Michael learn what life is really about. That \"just a spoonful of sugar\" does help \"the medicine go down.\" All their escapades before were to get their too busy to pay attention father to pay attention to them. They needed a father, not a banker. When Mary takes the children on their first outing they meet Mary's friend Bert, who's a chalk artist that day and a chimney sweep the next. The children really start enjoying their outings and when they try to discuss them before bed Mary pretends she doesn't know what they're talking about.\nNot just a movie with a great story, Mary Poppins deserves a 15/10 stars.

It was the first movie I ever saw and It has remained my favourite until this year when I saw \"The Wizard of Oz\"(I think you get the idea of my taste in favourite movies!!!). This film, of all the wacky kid's musicals made, is the best rival for \"The Wizard of Oz\" to the throne. Kid's movies don't come much better than this!! It is also one of the most original movies ever made.I think the title \"Mary Poppins\" is the most misleading thing about the movie. Mary herself is not the main character of the film. I honestly think Bert is. Bert is the down-to-earth character who guides the children. Mary Poppins just dropped from the sky and added a little spice. Bert has all the real responsibilities. Of course, the story focuses mainly on the neglected children in an upperclass family.I am amazed at how easy it was for Hollywood to forget this film. If you ask me, this is the best example of how to use a big budget and make a great movie. For a film loaded with special effects, elaborate sets, colourful costumes, amazing stunts and dance sequences - the list goes on - with an imagination to match, I've never seen a group of actors handle it so well!Julie Andrews makes this movie. Her performance is the one every big shot Hollywood actor should be looking at when it comes to acting among special effects! And for a film debut as well!!!!! Dick Van Dyke is perfect and I love Mr. Banks' character because aside from all his boring behavior, he remains interesting in his quirky environment. This movie exists in a world of its own.It's difficult to describe the world created in Mary Poppins as it is unlike any I've ever seen conveyed before. It is perhaps what I would describe as the land of children's dreams as I remember many a childhood dream of this kind. The clever thing about this is that the world actually exists. It is not a dream(like \"The Wizard of Oz\").This is my second favourite film of all time. I think the only reason \"The Wizard of Oz\" is first is because it is not made by Disney. Disney has a formula that \"Mary Poppins\" goes by. \"The Wizard of Oz\" goes by the beat of its own drum. That aside, I recommend this film to absolutely everybody. I love it!Oh, yeah, the soundtrack!! Second best soundtrack in a movie as well!(Guess which is first?)",

Disney has gotten three of their films nominated for Best Picture (this one, Beauty and the Beast, and Up). Sometimes the Oscars can be off-the-wall so it may not be the best evidence to bring about but I do have to say that the fact that \"Mary Poppins\" achieved a whopping THIRTEEN nominations is a testament to its greatness.Julie Andrews is one of my favorite people ever and her voice is, at least, among my top 3 that I have ever heard. Her work in the movie is iconic (though I am still skeptical about an Oscar for it) and certainly a delight. I think more consideration should have been given to the other actors: Dick van Dyke (despite the accent ordeal) was quite fun as Bert and the old bank partner; Dick Tomlinson is also strong as the strict father George; and Glynnis Johns was very good as Winifred the mother.Despite having no connection to Christmas, I watch this (along with \"The Sound of Music\") generally around the holiday season. I don't know why I love the movie as much as I do, but I always say that while it certainly has received praise, it is on some level underrated. Lastly, the stage musical DOES NOT do it justice!!",

Unfortunately, unlike the aforementioned movie, I could not sit through this one. Although it has far better production values and bigger budget than \"Bedknobs,\" I have trouble recommending this one to anyone over age seven (even that might be a bit old, in this day and age). Thus the term \"family classic\" doesn't really apply here. The film is just so sickeningly sweet it's almost nauseating, and viewing it as an adult is akin to eating a very, very, VERY large box of sweets in one sitting. I was unable to sit through more than the first half hour before feeling bored to tears and unable to continue (I'm 40 years old, male). Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood? I don't know.Not to detract from this film -- it's obvious why it's considered a classic. I'm just not sure the average parent will be able to sit through this with their kids. By all means though, do show it to your kids. Just don't be surprised if they find this boring -- if they enjoy \"Mr. Roger's Neighborhood\" then they won't, but otherwise it's questionable.",

So, Mary Poppins flies along to their home with her wonder, magic and being \"practically perfect in every way!\" Michael and Jane spot her, and Mary becomes their new caretaker. She starts off with the children cleaning their room, \".. and SNAP! The job's a game!\" She spots Bert, an old friend who does very good drawings, and they whisk off to a magical world inside one of Bert's drawings. After the rain comes, the children must take medicine. It turns out to be delicious, unlike the Buckley's medicine I see all the time.To skip a bit, Mr. Banks, a cranky businessman who has no time for fun in life, seems to be accustomed to Mary Poppins and starts actually laughing, something he hadn't done in a while.In the end, everyone is happy, and Mary Poppins has to leave, but it's all good when they sing \"Let's Go Fly a Kite\".So, it's a good movie.

Julie Andrews was right on target when she got her foundation recompense and expressed gratitude toward Jack Warner for turning her down in the film form of My Fair Lady.

Dick Van Dyke's performance is a marvel of energy and charm, despite the moments when his Cockney accent sounds less than natural.David Tomlinson's performance as Mr. Banks deserves special notice, I think. Mr. Banks' moments of snobbery, and his later awakening to his family's needs, add humanizing elements to the film that keep it from being too sugary and sentimental.And the score by the Sherman brothers is masterful.  \"Chim Chim Chiree,\" which won an Oscar for best song, is actually one of the lesser (although still good) songs, I think.  I prefer \"Supercali...\" and \"Feed The Birds\" and \"Step In Time.\" But every single song, even \"Sister Suffragette,\" packs a wallop.This was the first movie I fell in love with as a young child, and I remain entranced by moments in the film like the dancing chimney sweeps and the lady feeding the birds.",

To look at little Jane and Michael, in their innocent purity, is to remember the first time you saw the movie. But enough of that. Laced with fun songs, including A Spoonful of Sugar and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, this a pretty cheery movie, although there are some darker scenes, including those at the bank. Dick Van Dyke is amusing, and the laughing scene is still a classic. What stands out the most in this film? I am not sure. The color is magnificent, but there is a dark underlying theme in this movie I cannot put my finger on. Whether or not it's the creepy scenes at the bank, or even the dark mood of the chimney sweep song and their songs (not the chirpy Step in Time, of course), this movie is a dichotomy of emotion. Andrews lights up the screen, Van Dyke sometimes darkens it; Tomlinson is representative of both. Humor is everywhere, in the form of cannon-firing British seamen, clowning housemaids and a cheery Glynis Johns as Mrs. Banks. The songs quite often make the movie enjoyable, more so than the often-dark plot line. But really, if you want better fare, go check out The Sound of Music - it's much more delightful than this film, although probably not so for the kids.",

None of the effects seem cheesy, even now; they're just fun. Equally charming is the music. I love \"Spoonful of Sugar\" which summarizes Mary Poppins' view on life and, of course, \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" could almost be added to Webster's dictionary. However, the song \"Feed the Birds\" is the most moving moment in the entire movie, proving that just a small act of kindness is the greatest gift that can be given.'Mary Poppins' is a film that has survived the test of time. I expect this film to long outlive the first generation it touched and beyond. It's the films that send you away with more than you came in with that really survive. A tune to hum, a spring in your step, or maybe just the urge to do something kind to someone who would never think to ask you for help, feed the birds so to speak.

It's not only my favorite Disney, but my all-time favorite movie.Odds are good you've seen Mary Poppins, it came out in 1964 and is a pop-culture touchstone. If you haven't seen it, go see it.Based upon the series of books by P. L. Travers, but mainly on the first book, Mary Poppins is a film we should be very grateful to have. It took Walt 20 years to obtain the rights to Mrs. Travers' fantastic tale and the bold Australian born author was very strict on what could be included the 1964 classic. While Travers would ultimately hate the flick with all it's Sherman Brothers songs and animated sequences, Mary Poppins would still be a critically acclaimed flick to the public eye and after all these years, it's still one of the greatest fantasy films of the last several decades. I read the books and they are worthy of checking out, and if it weren't for Disney's brothers who read them, he probably wouldn't have thought bringing the character to the big screen.The movie revolves around an unhappy family, who called the Banks and the chaos theory as Mary Poppins, who is the main character, a wonderful nanny is inserted into the Banks family. The children go from \"Be seen and not heard\" \"Be heard and seen\". The movie also mixes humans and animation figures which is quite well done. I think this movie is spectacular and everyone should see this movie at least once...In Edwardian Landon's Cherry Tree, yet another nanny resigns from keeping an eye on Mr. Banks' boisterous children, Jane and Michael. But then, as if by magic, a new governess-the enchanting, Mary Poppins-lands on their doorstep to take control of the situation, as thrilling adventures along with the amazing chimney sweep, Bert, pave the way for a wonderful transformation. Will the charming Miss Poppins turn chaos into order?The 1910 London scenery looks very magical in this film. You can very well imagine like Mary Poppins popping up in a place like that. The film was filled with great musical numbers, all done by the legendary song-writing team The Sherman Brothers like Oscar winning \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\", \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Step in Time\", \"I Love to Laugh\" and \"Feed the Birds\" (Disney's personal favorite as well as my favorite song of the movie). And let's not forget \"Supercalifragiliexpiaidocius\". Man, that's a long word! Brothers Robert B. And Richard M. Sherman were behind the perfect score. There are lots of classic scenes there, like when they jump into the chalk drawing. You can see them racing with carousel horses. And Dick Van Dyke dancing with animated penguins. Entertaining movie can't get more entertaining than this. Even the animation and effects in this movie are superb, from the umbrella head in the shape of a parrot that talks to Mary, to the animatronic birds that Mary sings to and those were early animatronics developed by I'm sure one of the imaginers of Disney. Such artistry could not have been found in any other movie at the time and all of bends together.I have enjoyed this movie since I was little and I remember singing the songs, dancing the scenes and even reenacting many of the scenes with my family and friends. It's a timeless classic and one of Walt Disney's greatest achievements, if not Walt's personal magnum opus, if you don't count Mickey Mouse, Disneyland or his first feature length animated film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). My family also has seen this film for years in fact, ever since it came out, with my father being 8 at the time of its release and his parents who often went to movies took him to go see it and I'm sure years from now the film will still be looked at and be one of Disney's all time masterpieces.A practically perfect 10/10.",

Based on the books by P.L. Travers, this film centers around the Banks family of London 1912, whose most recent Nanny (Elsa Lanchester)has just quit after the children (Matthew Garber, Karen Dotrice)have run away again chasing an out of control kite. George Banks (David Tomlinson)begins to advertise for a new Nanny when the children come to him with their own advertisement, which George dismisses, tears up, and throws in the fireplace. We then see the pieces of the children's advertisement float up the fireplace. Enter Mary Poppins (Andrews), the \"practically perfect\" who arrives to interview for the job with the children's advertisement in her hand, all taped together. What follows are a wonderful series of adventures including a magical housecleaning of the nursery, a tea party on the ceiling, a country holiday in a sidewalk chalk drawing, and a dance session on the rooftops of London with about 100 chimney sweeps. This is movie magic at its zenith, and it is just as entertaining now as it was 42 years ago. It is a definitely a family film, but there are lovely adult touches in the screenplay...I love the way it is implied that Mary and Bert (Dick Van Dyke), the chimney sweep/jack-of-all-trades, have met before this movie takes place but it is never really discussed. I also love the way Mary never admits to having any kind of magic powers and after each adventure tells the children it was all in their imagination. This was the most memorable example of mixing live action with animation during the \"Jolly Holiday\" scene, which is absolutely delightful. The sublime musical score includes \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Chim Chim Cheree\" (which won the Oscar for Best Song), \"Step in Time\", and of course \"Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious.\" Andrews and Van Dyke are given solid support from Tomlinson and Glynis Johns as Mr. and Mrs. Banks, Hermione Baddeley as their maid, Reta Shaw as their cook, Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, and Arthur Treacher as a Constable. If you have never seen this film, or more importantly, if your kids have never seen it, go out and get the DVD today because this film continues to enchant generation after generation because it is the perfect family film.",

Mine are watching now for the first time and the film is 30 odd years old  - and they love it - and so will all kids for years to come.\nFull of harmless cheerful fun it is a pity that so many \"shot 'em up\" type kids films are made now. Using Van Dyke and Andrews to play the English characters has helped to make this film acceptable both sides of the big pond. I doubt if this would have been the case had the cast been drawn from just the UK.\nDick Van Dyke absolutely shines and delivers a pretty well flawless performance, perhaps his best ever. The criticism about his Cockney accent is simply not justified. Those making the criticism are usually not from East London and wouldn't know a Cockney if they tripped over one. Its no better or worse than any other actor trying to take on a strange accent.If you want a beautifully crafted film for your kids then don't hesitate - buy Mary Poppins and you'll have something that will last forever.",

            "content": ":::::some spoilers::::::::I recently saw this film for the first time in years and it struck me as kind of odd but simply because I wasn't watching it as it was intended to be seen. No matter what you believe about Disney and his subplots or pseudoplots all of his films are for children first and foremost, they're just not solely for children. Mary Poppins is probably one of his most simple and joyful creations.The story is so unpretentious we forget what it is at times: Mary Poppins is a nanny on a mission to reunite the Banks family and she succeeds. In the middle she takes them on magical adventures with her assorted cast of friends. This is the kind of film that the term suspend disbelief was created for. Things just happen in this movie and you have to accept them, like a child accepts them: Seeing is believing. Of course, this being a musical the songs are essential and they are fantastic, my favorite changes day by day or viewing by viewing.The special effects, and mixing of live action and animation are years ahead of its time. The acting which some may critique is dead on the money. Dick Van Dyke, in dual roles, plays a caricature of both a chimney sweep and an old bank partner (at first I questioned the casting but now I see it was truly inspired and a surprise). None of the characters are meant to be played subtly and some, like Mr. Banks, require moments that are way over the top. Even Julie Andrews isn't as understated as she usually is (While on the subject I do believe the Academy feared having her win 2 consecutive Oscars even though she deserved it for the Sound of Music much more).Ina film where old men shoot cannons off their rooftops at what they think are Hottentots, how can one question the reality of the situation or whether Stanislavski would've approved of the acting method? You can't it's a film of pure imagination for those who know how to use it. It is whimsical, touching and a pure delight. If you just sit back, relax and let this film take you into its world you'll have a great time.",

            "content": "A fine, fine film. In my opinion, children's movies are some of the best ever made but they are often over-looked because they don't have gritty storylines or passionate (physical) romances, but that's what makes them great. They are a fantasy escape into a world we've never seen but we all wish we had. And that's what Mary Poppins does so brilliantly. I don't think that anyone anywhere can honestly, truthfully say that they didn't yearn for Mary Poppins to fly to their doorstep and teach them magic when they were little.I watched this film religiously as a small child. I LOVED Julie Andrews (and I still do) and used to be fascinated by the fact that Mary and Maria from the Sound of Music (another favourite) were played by the same person. I loved her so much I also used to continually watch her in Victor/Victoria which is quite a rude film involving a lot of gender swapping which, as a five year old, I didn't really understand. Julie is just magical, so graceful and wholesome.My one fault would be the whole bank palava. I know it's basically the whole story, but as a child I didn't understand maths or money and had no wish to, so I just switched off during that whole bit. There's not enough Mary during that middle bit so there was no incentive for me to watch it. I really do love Mary, but if I had to pick a fault with her, it would be that she is \"practically perfect\" and she bloody well knows it. She's just not quite modest enough. Also, I always wanted to know who or what exactly Mary was, where she came from, but I suppose it just increases the air of mystery surrounding that wonderful woman who literally goes where the wind takes her.A great, sing-a-long soundtrack. My personal favourites are the lullabies Mary sings to Jane and Michael and, most of all, Step in Time, the chimney sweeps' rousing song and dance bit on the rooftops of London. Spectacular scenery and great choreography.I was never particularly into Bert, I could never quite get past that distracting accent, but he is good fun. I always wished they'd explain how Bert and Mary know each other but I guess it's better left to the imagination.All in all, a great film not to be missed. I know I'll be bringing my children up on it, it's a brilliant imagination-developer. Good, innocent fun. 10/10",

            "content": "Being a fan of movies like Nanny McPhee, I hoped that this, being one of the ones that inspired them, would give me a good experience, and even more so being considered one of the classic Disney movies. However, even Disney proves that all their old movies weren't treated equally. Let's start with the good first, will you? For starters, the graphics... Oh my god! They are beautiful! The settings, the art style, EVERYTHING! For starters, I love how it mixes 2d animation (or 2d sets) with live actors in some scenes of the movie, apart from that it's very original for its time (and it's still fresh nowadays, man, this movie probably was very expensive...), everything looks so beautiful and has aged very well, well, everything except the special effects put on the actors.... oh man, I wish the whole movie would have been in 2d... But hey , even the parts that are \"real\" look incredible, thanks to a very well achieved setting, then we have the songs, which are very catchy, although this is also a negative point (which I'll talk about later), but most of the first It puts you in context and manages to give you very good moments, and finally Mary Poppins herself, Julie Andrews in the first moments of the film manages to have a very good personality. I think she is by far the best character (or the only good character... ugh). She is funny, but without leaving the serious side of her, although she isnt as interesting as Nanny McPhee. And that's all.... Now unfortunately we have to talk about the bad. I think the main problem with Mary Poppins is its duration, it lasts longer than it should and the movie starts to add a lot of unnecessary padding after halfway through. It's not that the movie doesn't have interesting ideas or anything like that, the problem is that they're all gone by the time it gets halfway through, and the other half isn't interesting at all and they abuse a lot of cheap humor and meaningless situations, like when everyone goes crazy in the bank just for two coins that the kids wanted to use to feed the birds! Or all the excessive and boring songs they sing just to drag out the plot. And my god... some characters are cringe! Starting with Bert, he is just dumb, he looks like a character out of a kid's show like Art Attack. Albert comes out of nowhere laughing and we are never explained what happened to him that is left floating in the air, the same with the bankers who only care about money but they never tell us the real problem they have (I suppose all is a joke), and finally some sailors who from time to time show them and shoot cannons once in a while. But they do not contribute anything! They add absolutely nothing to the plot, either in terms of story or humor, what a waste of movie time! Sometimes I don't even know if Mary Poppins is responsible for some of the things that happen in the story, or if it's just a joke for a laugh. I also think that Mary Poppins itself, although it was executed relatively well, I think that after the first half she feels very wasted. In that sense now that I think about it, it suffers from the same problem as the first Nanny McPhee movie, the nanny is there more as a support, but she doesn't do much. In the end it is the family itself that ends up fixing everything, almost as if the nanny had not done anything, and the redemption of George Banks (the father of the children) is so forced that... ug, I don't know how to say it . This movie has so much old lady humor that it's not funny. Sometimes I even feel like I'm watching a theater play more than a movie. They do not give rest song after song. Anyway...\nMary Poppins is a movie that influenced a lot, and it was very original in various aspects, however, the years took their toll on it, it had a lot of potential, but it ended up being very boring, illogical and excessively long in my opinion. But without this movie there wouldn't be any better ones, so hey, at least it's something.",

Julie Andrews captures the prim and proper nature of the \"Mary Poppins\" we saw in P.L Travers' books although she doesn't look much like her. Dick Van Dyke does a dreadful job at speaking in a cockney accent, sometimes I even press the mute button because his voice offends my ears and. I think his voice should've been dubbed (why didn't they think of that?!) even away from \"Mary Poppins\" he has an annoying voice as if he's kind of muddled or confused with his lines, yes I'm sure the Disney crew could've found a better actor for Bert but I could see him doing his best at it after all he is an American. David Tomlinson, I must say, makes a terrible performance as Mr Banks - I much prefer him as Mr Brown in \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" and not to mention his singing for \"The Life I Lead\" - WELL! That is just too annoying for my ears to bear but that's in his character; pompous and strict but we see him progress as the film rolls on. But a lot of the time he may come across to you as more of an arrogant swine rather than a strict banker who always loses his temper with anybody who doesn't obey his household rules. The cast is kind of insufferable (apart from Julie Andrews) as I'm sure a lot of people will agree, however, there is a high point to it, besides Julie Andrews, and that is the classic actress Jane Darwell who, by then, had aged quite a bit since \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"Caged\". Just looking at her, she looked extremely frail as the Bird Woman with sleepy eyes, trembling mouth-movements and kind of slanted posture but, even so, there she was. In a film for the very last time - and in a beautiful sequence! To have made it to 89 years old in 1967 was AMAZING! This film is partly a tribute to Jane and also a MASSIVE the ultimate exposure of the Mrs Travers' enchanting book - ON-SCREEN! \"Mary Poppins\" goes a little over the top in some scenes but I love it just the way it is. Although I don't think it's Disney at his best (probably \"Snow White\" and \"Fantasia\") I strongly and personally think it's a heartwarming, totally bedazzling movie that all should try out. It's very underrated! I watch it at bedtime every night as a routine to settle me down to go to sleep and I've got lot's of videos of it - as a matter of fact I've got nearly every release. Just to let other fans know, the cover for the 40th Anniversary Edition looks dull and uninteresting and I hate it. Oh well! Quantity not quality, is what my mum sometimes says.",

At that time I enjoyed this movie and even saw it a second time in a theater despite my parents' objections to certain Disney business practices. When I was closer to middle age I saw it again and I was appalled. Contrary to one poster here who insists on making a useless comparison to Andrews' other big musical, Sound of Music, to trash this movie for having songs she likes much less, I find that compared to movie musicals in general especially those aimed at a younger audience, the songs hold up well even not quite in the immortal class of Rodgers and Hammerstein. (Who are better served in other musicals. Sound of Music is too much straight syrup for me, although Rodgers' contribution has no problems. But what do I know? Both stage and screen versions made big buckets of cash, inspiring MAD magazine to satirize it as the Sound of Money with a \"Dough\", Re, Mi song). The look of it creaks now, even if it arguably broke new ground in the integration live and animated action at the time. The thing that got me as a adult was the awful sugar coated apologia for the real dark Dickensian world of England, especially in the light of current developments in America. The happy homeless woman whose life is rich because she feeds the birds. The happy chimney sweeps who no doubt happily hack into their bleak later life of poverty and black lung. To its (small) credit it does not lionize the well heeled characters but makes them ridiculous. But I can no longer enjoy the movie as a whole having walked too many times in the big cities of California in the post-Reagan(as Governor, massively cutting the mental health infrastructure) era of mainstreaming the mentally ill onto the streets. 8 when I didn't know better, 5 now that I do.",

One of the things that really surprised me about this movie- it was filmed entirely indoors in Studio 2 at the Disney Studios in Burbank.

And though I've never cared for The Sound of Music either, I can't fault it for any reason. But Mary Poppins is dull. She never cracks a smile. For someone who comes out of the sky, she is certainly a killjoy as well. I wouldn't want her as my nanny, while she sometimes participates in the fun activities, she acts annoyed with them most of the time. Even as a kid, I thought she was a bit mean and far too firm. Which is what makes the moments when she does do silly things seem out of character.A very unpleasant title character really bogs down any film, no matter how good everything else is, and Mary Poppins is a good example of a bad character.",

I sniffed a bit at the prospect but when I was forced to sit down with him and actually pay attention to it I was completely enraptured from beginning to end. It is a tour de force in every department (Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent and all) - wonderful songs, great acting, slick script, delightful humour.What really makes it so astonishing for me is the performance of Julie Andrews - how can anyone come across so strict yet at the same time be utterly beguiling? She looks truly radiant, her smile would melt the stoniest heart, and her voice when she sings is captivating. No wonder Mr Banks can't resist her when she argues back at him!Another thing about this film: it is pretty subversive. When I watched this film as a child I don't think I could possibly have understood the \"it's a man's world\" message. I don't think I even knew what a suffragette was. I'm still not sure about the role of Mrs Banks - she plays the sufragette but always seems to put that side of her character away in the closet when her husband comes home from work, but I think in fact rather than acquiescing to patriarchy, she is really humouring the little man to make her own life easier, and while he is singing his silly song about how an Englishman's home is his castle, she is saying \"yes, dear\" and keeping it quiet that she knows she is really the one who is in charge around here. In fact, I've noticed that the only sympathetic male character in the film is Bert, and as Mary Poppins says in her song when they are walking through the cartoon countryside together, she likes him because she knows he will never take advantage of any woman.Some of this 'poitical' message may seem a touch dated now, but then again maybe it doesn't - has the world really changed that much? Whatever, it doesn't really matter, because this is a truly splendid film regardless, and surely one of the most deserving films of its oscar there has ever been.",

            "content": "One of the most ebullient and optimistic movies of all time. Set in turn-of-the-(last) century London, against a background of changing social mores and women's rights, Mary Poppins (played by Julie Andrews--who won an Academy award for her performance)blows in on the winds of change, and descends upon the thoroughly respectable but slightly dysfunctional Banks family.As Nanny she tames the young Banks boy and girl, opens their minds to imagination, introduces them to the realities of class and social injustice, all the while waking up Mr. Banks to the very late 20th century needs of his children. From start to finish the tale is told with song and it is by far the best soundtrack of any Disney movie, due not only to Julie Andrews's sweet soulful singing, but the infectious tunes of Richard and Robert Sherman.All performances in this movie, from Dick Van Dyke, the child stars, David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks), Glynis Johns (Mrs. Banks) to so many others, are superb. The movie began a tradition of state-of-the-art special effects from the Disney studio and, though they are somewhat dated by today's standards, they remain ingenious and very original.Directed by British director Robert Stevenson, a Disney studio veteran, and produced by Walt Disney himself, Mary Poppins is the best film to come out of the Disney studios to this day. In its amazing ability to preach a moralistic and conservative message with such an uplifting and entertaining spirit, it achieves all of Walt Disney's vision of a perfectly ordered world. Like Mary herself, it's \"practically perfect in every way.\"",

            "content": "One of my earliest memories of my childhood (and probably of your own) is sitting on the sofa in our living room and watching this movie.  When you're three or four years old, you love it wholeheartedly and are certainly in awe by it, but can never fully appreciate the absolute masterpiece that this film is.  No, people, Disney is not always for small children -- Disney is for EVERYONE, and that's what Walt Disney gives us here: something for everyone.  First, you must look at the script -- a script full of wit and humor and at the same time with heart, humanity, sentimentality, and a lesson that often seems to be forgotten: material things and riches mean so much less than family and children and the little pleasures in life.  Director Robert Stevenson makes this film a feast for the eyes that also speaks to the heart. Then you have the wonderful score by the Sherman brothers, Robert and Richard, chock full of brilliant tunes like \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" and \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" that are light and full of breezy fun, a total antithesis to one of the most poignant, haunting melodies in the whole film, \"Feed the Birds.\"  You also have an amazing cast that features two amazing and adorable children, Karen Dotrice as Jane and Matthew Garber as Michael.  You also have veteran character actors like Ed Wynn (Uncle Albert), Elsa Lanchester (Katie Nanna), Reta Shaw (Mrs. Brill), Hermoine Baddeley (Ellen), and even Jane Darwell (\"The Bird Lady\") lighting up the screen.  The ever-radiant Glynis Johns plays Winifred Banks, the children's mother and a suffragette whose \"cause infuriates Mr. Banks.\"  While she only gets one song, \"Sister Suffragette\" is an unforgettable number and she plays the part with a flair that only Glynis Johns can.  Disney veteran David Tomlinson plays George Banks, Esquire, the children's father and a devout businessman who believes that the most important things in life are being head of a ship-shape household and carving \"his niche in the edifice of time\" at Fidelity Fiduciary Bank.  He gives a superb performance and shows us that it's never too late to learn what is really most important in life.  Dick Van Dyke is outstanding as Burt, the \"jack-of-all-trades\" who not only has his own one-man-band, but is an artist as well as a chimney sweep.  Van Dyke's comedic skills are in top form here -- he plays the part with such enthusiasm and his golden voice and incredible dancing are part of what makes this film such a treat.  Finally, we are graced the presence of Mary Poppins herself, Miss Julie Andrews.  Fresh from the Broadway production of \"Camelot,\" with that first glimpse of her floating down from the sky, you know you're going to fall in love with her.  While portrayed seemingly younger than the Mary Poppins in P.L. Travers' beloved books upon which the film is based, Julie Andrews plays Mary to perfection: very proper, very intelligent, a bit distant as to avoid any sentimental attachments but never too far removed, enchanting, intriguing -- a woman who knows exactly what she's doing and how she can help the Banks family to be just that -- a true family.  Her voice is exquisite throughout the film.  This film isn't just for the little ones, it's a film for anyone -- you're sure to love this film (that I must say is just as good as about any other movie musical aimed more toward the adult set) just as much when you're fifty as you did when you were five.  Take it from someone who's seen this film more times than she can count, this is one phenomenal piece of magic captured on film, and we owe it all to the magic maker himself: Walt Disney.",

            "content": "There were times in all our lives where we needed Mary Poppins. That nanny that could guide us through life, yet still make sure that we did not forget to have fun. One that could help us grow up and learn, no matter our age.Of course in real life, since she does not really exist, we never truly will get those magical experiences. However, it is movies like this that help fill in that void, making us feel that we too have been affected by Mary Poppins.What sticks out most about this film is Julie Andrews portrayal of Mary Poppins, whom, dare I say, is practically perfect in every way. Not only does she perfectly encapsulate the requests of the children, being rosy and delightful throughout, she also fulfills the requests of Mr. Banks, striking a balance for the stern and disciplined nanny that he wanted.Throughout the film there is a mysteriousness about Mary Poppins. She performs these magical feats without too much of an explanation or acknowledgement. There are times in the film where she would completely deny these adventures had even happened. She also possess a sly intelligence, being able to manipulate anyone, but only in her best intentions, and only to help the family. What truly works about this odd portrayal is what it produces from the other actors. Slowly but surely, you truly believe these characters to be swept up from this magic that she conjures, giving each character depth and change as they become affected by it. This all helps to propel the feeling of family. You see how fondly she treats all of them, the warm feeling she entices, and how everything she does is to help lead to this family becoming close. Although she will never admit it, she loved them all more than anything.What can say? The songs are practically perfect in every way too! Each one seems to encapsulate the story's present atmosphere perfectly. This provides an instant and pure emotion with each song. Look at the song \"Spoonful of Sugar\", it is fun and magical mood which made cleaning fun to me as a child. \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", which attempts to describe an indescribable joyful feeling that can only be put into words through music. Then there is \"Chim Chimney\". This strangely enough gives me the feeling of joyful loneliness, like staying up late and reading a book. However, it is my personal favorite (and Walt Disney's too) that perfectly encapsulates the film's more touching moments, \"Feed the Birds\". We see an content old woman sitting on the steps of a tall building, that seems almost to engulf her, as birds fly all around it in the darkness. Throughout it we hear the soft voice of Julie Andrews, as she sings slow lullaby like toon. It all gives off a feeling of togetherness, beauty, and sadness. I feel there is also a message to be taken with this song, that we should stop and appreciate all that we have now, as due to time it may be lost before we know it.There are some aspects to this film that I did not come to realize until recently with age. One thing that stood out to me is how the film bridges its point of view, allowing insight into multiple characters. In the film's first half it focuses on the children, with fun sequences of animation, dancing, and magic. Throughout this time, the film communicates the children's fear of their father, whom they do not understand. He seems to only want to shape them into adults, doing away with necessary childhood happiness. It is then in the film's second half that they focus more on Mr. Banks, whom we realize there is more to than what we and the children perceived. We learn that deep down he needs the exact thing that the kids need. The movie comes to communicate that everyone, no matter what age, need people to look out for them. This keeps the whole film from being just for kids. By providing knowledge that is wise and applicable for older audiences, there is always something different to take with you depending on where you are in your life. Making a movie that truly changes with age.Now, being a highschooler, there are many messages that this film communicates to me. It communicates that you should work hard, but never to forget to enjoy the fun life has to offer. It communicates to respect and even try to understand parents, that who, like everyone, need someone to look after them. Finally it communicates that through everything that goes on, to stop and appreciate all that I have now, for I may someday not have it. If I was to describe the feeling of watching this again, it would be like a warm embrace from a forgotten friend. New, exciting, and wiser than before.",

Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins.Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch.

If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers.Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls.

Van Dyke is a trooper and gave his all in the song and dance numbers but OY!, that wretched accent! As far as the film is concerned, it's okay as light entertainment and not much more. Watching this could not help but make one wistful that Julie Andrews was not cast as Eliza Doolittle in the film version of \"My Fair Lady,\" a role of far more substance than the role in this piece of Disney fluff.",

Forty years on, it stands out as part of the very last generation of screen musicals, in company with \"The Sound of Music\" and \"My Fair Lady\". Such things would (to be fair: should) only be done on Broadway these days. The point of a musical is that the storyline is carried forward by the songs and not by the spoken dialogue. \"Mary Poppins\" works on this level, as you could delete all the dialogue and still follow the plot. I sensed this even at seven, as it seemed more interesting to listen to these trained voices than to hear adult actors delivering lines. (If memory serves, only Admiral Boom and the Constable don't have musical numbers). Ed Wynn and Dick Van Dyke do their best to sound British. They're joined by a cross section of Hollywood's English colony, many of them now gone. Julie Andrews joined the very small club of actors who've won Oscars for their debut films. I cannot vouch for the notorious variations between the film script and Pamela Travers's books, but this one can be summed up in Mary Poppins's own words: \"Practically perfect.\"",

Mary Poppins is an epitome of a character who is firm but kind. Bert is a man full of life who knows that even being a screever can be a fun if u like what u draw and u draw what u like. Is not that true happiness that u find pleasure in ur work! Mr. Bank is like any man from the modern world who thinks that life is only about setting up objectives and meeting the goals and Mrs. Bank is a true English woman, flighty as the English weather. Jane and Michael Bank are what all of us have some where deep inside us, a child who is looking for guidance and who needs to learn how to balance the responsibilities of life with a bit of fun time. And Mary Poppins is the right bridge to connect a generation that has taken the bitter pill called life with the generation that needs to learn the reality and in effect she shows that at each stage of life each one of us needs to grow.I hope 2 have children of my own some day and they shall hear the songs of Mary Poppins from the day they r conceived to know that although the life that I am giving to them is a bitter pill to take but That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, medicine go down in a most delightful way. That they may learn the right attitude towards life from the day 1 of their existence! I will make sure that my children know that they have a Mary Poppins of their own!",

Plus it has immortal lines and songs that everyone knows, tear jerking moments, singing moments and laughing moments. Dick Van Dyke's accent may have been awful, but just bear in mind that he tried and he brought an extra added lift to the film. Think, either him or Richard Burton, and no offence, but I don't think we really need Shakespeare in a Disney film. Plus we had the budding romance between Mary Poppins and Bert, or am I the only one who noticed that?

In short, Mary Poppins is a magical nanny that uses her skills in home- keeping, song, dance, and a little white-magic to help rear some young, rich kids that seek a better relationship with their father. There are some AWESOME sets and sound stages designed for the movie. And some really talented actors, that Walt Disney was all over to get on this production. Dick Van Dyke is fun, but he looked and sounded more like a stoned Australian than a cockney fellow that sweeps chimneys. On a technical aspect, there are some great flying/floating scenes that I'm sure were unmatched for their time. One of my fave tech scenes was the magical staircase that was made out of London smog and soot, so the kids and gang could look out over the city.",

I never get tired of watching this film. The laughter, the humor and the story all together was touching and funny. Julie Andrews was great. My favorite character was Dick Van Dyke who played the Bert, the lovable chimney sweep and then there is Ed Wynn who played the hilarious Uncle Albert who loved to laugh all the time. Another thing I like about this film is that I am so glad that Disney has not made a crappy sequel like they have done with so many other classic Disney films, with Mary Poppins, so far they have let this one stay the way it was originally and for that I am very grateful because every sequel that Disney has made to the original classics are horrible. Never the less, this film is touching, heartwarming and funny. If you have not seen this film I highly recommend that you or you and your children see this film. You will love it.",

It combines top class performances from Julie Andrews whose fantastically memorable performance as Mary Poppins won her a well deserved Oscar, from Dick Van Dyke who despite the slightly dodgy accent, ooozes with charm and energy, from David Tomlinson the comedically controlling and stereotypically strict Father and from the entire supporting cast (especially Admiral Boom and the Banks' housemaids), with revolutionary animation techniques which still, in the computer age, awe-inspire children and adults alike.Mary Poppins is an amazing film on every level, technically it is (for want of a new phrase) an amazing and revolutionary master-piece, it is musically stunning, heartwarming and entertaining. The storyline is fantastically complex and simplistic at the same time, which explains the ageless and timeless appeal this amazing film holds. So does this film not appear in the top 250? And who are the cynical people so void of imagination that could deem this amazing and memorable film to be worth any less than 9 out of ten. Like every film it has its faults, but it was written and executed with unparalelled imagination.

You have to use conversation talk. This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have seen it tons of times, but I don't remember those times because I was little. Which is the age that most people watch it at because it has the most impact then. I'm sure I would look at it now as a teenager in more critical terms, like a reviewer. But i would still love it. That is not saying that this movie is only good for little kids. Any age would love it. The singing is excellent, probably the best singing I've ever heard.       People are critical of Dick Van Dyke's accent in this movie. They say it takes away from the goodness of the omvie. Being an American, I'm sure it is only normal to say that I see no way that this keeps from the fun of this movie. In fact, it sounded so funny and cool when i watched it that I used to want to laugh, and I used to really like Bert for it. It seemed like he was trying to get to the kids watching it and get them to have fun, which i did. Now, for the English, I can't say what they think. After all, I don't have their accent, so I have no reason to be offended by it. I just think it's a fun twist to the movie. I agree that the chimney sweep dance was spectacular. It was great how they made the effect of the closest chimney seeps visible and detailed, and the farther ones kind of added a 3-D effect, with depth to the movements. I always thought it as also cool how they all slide down the chimney into the Bank's living room.     The one thing I don't understand is not about the quality of the movie. No,that is unquestinoably magnificent. My misunderstanding is about how this movie missed the top 250 list. I mean, everyone loved it. Everyone owns it, if they don't they tape it. Everyone loves it. So how could it not make the to 250. You have other far-less revered moies on the list like \"The Shining\" and \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Ok, I admit I know people who said the second was great, and I like the first, but neither are as talked about or as respected and enjoyed as this movie. I don't know, maybe in 20 years these movies will have more respect than \"Mary Poppins,\" but for now much more age ranges and just a higher percentage love \"Mary Poppins.\" People talk about how they've gotten it for their kids, and they've seen it many times. But it isn't on the top 250 list. I don't understand. OH, and for those of you who are saying \"well then why don't you vote, mart guy,\" I just did. I gave it a 10. Maybe that will have some effect. For now, I hope some of those lovers will vote and put this on the list. The bottom line is this movie is great. It has all the elemenst of an excellent movie, and I'm sure glad they did bother to give this four stars. It deserves each of the those stars, and anything less would be unacceptable. See this movie if you haven;t. If you have, continue to enjoy it. I highly recommend it.",

I also recall seeing it several times at that young age but it wasn't until about some 40 odd years later that I had the opportunity to see it again. I'm not sure why, but the scene where Julie sings 'Feed the Birds' brought a lump to my throat. Perhaps it brought back long since forgotten memories but it was somewhat haunting hearing that tune and reflecting back on how I loved it as a child. Being so young, I had no idea of what happened in banks or what the womens vote related to. I do recall the singing, dancing and vivid colours that hypnotised me when I was 5 years old and perhaps assisted me at a tragic period within my family. I'd suggest Mary Poppins is an evergreen. Perhaps I'm biased as kids movies were not (or didn't seem) common when I was younger. An amusing post script was a few years later I was taken to the movies and was told the lady who was Mary Poppins would be appearing. Imagine my disappointment when I sat though the 'Sound of Music' with not one sign of an umbrella flying nanny in sight!",

It hasn't lost any of its magic and now I wonder why so much time passed without me watching it again.

David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns are great as the parents and Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber cute as can be as the children (truly a shame that Matthew Garber's life was so short). And all of the supporting performances were cast with actors who hit just the right note and added to the film. Dick Van Dyke was truly magnificent despite having perhaps the worst English accent of all time. And Julie Andrews deserved every accolade she got and more. Probably the greatest screen debut of all time.

To any adult who pays attention during Mary Poppins (and doesn't treat it as background noise), it becomes apparent that the film is really about Mr. Banks - he is the character with the dramatic arch. Everyone else is simply blissful unaware of the trials of life - but also unaware of how unassumingly Mr. Banks carries their burdens for them. The film spoke to me plainly as a child - its themes were clear and powerful. And it continues to move me today.This film contains many things that I would consider my \"favorite.\" First, it is my favorite musical. It is my favorite Disney film and favorite family-oriented movie. It also contains my favorite song \"Feed the Birds.\"The beauty of Mary Poppins is so pure, you just might miss it. That's why I love it so much, Bert and all.",

Something about nanny's with English accents makes that kinder spirit inside you feel all fuzzy. I love how she is kind but firm. The music in this movie was amazing. Julie Andrews out does herself again. And DICK VAN DYKE. What a heartthrob for all girls. Back then i bet he was the Brad Pitt of Hollywood.

Oh sure, they are nowhere near what special effects that are done in movies today, but considering the time this was done and the available technology of that time - this was amazing. The songs and lyrics - timeless. I surprised myself singing along and recalling the words of many songs after all those years.

I can't help but laugh when I see the scene with Mary singing a duet with what looks like a Robin from the tree outside, it calls to mind the scene in Shrek (1) where the princess sings a duet with a small bird in a tree, and the bird explodes trying to reach the high notes... how times have changed! That just would not do in 1965. Dick van Dyke is brilliant as usual. His singing and dancing is delightful to watch and lifts the film in ways only he could achieve. A good film is soon sorted from the average when children continually play them over and over. If you can sit down and watch it after hearing and seeing it more than 20 times, it passes the test!

There is darkness - moments that are positively unsettling and even a little scary in the books, which are nowhere to be seen in the movie.

I mean, I almost quit my job, if you can believe it, and I had a very good position, too! The film's message of putting the REALLY IMPORTANT things first in one's life hit me like a hammer! I try and have as many \"kite flying\" moments as I can with my children AND with my wife! I don't really believe that Disney was attempting to expose the \"dark side\" of patriarchy, per se, but that adults need to keep strong roots in their childhood, or else they'll become withered and (almost) humorless, like the old bankers in the movie! But even THEY end up flying kites!!I said this film was \"dangerous\" only because it MIGHT make you reconsider your whole life!!SOAPBOX: The sad fact is that today's corporation, \"Disney\", shares virtually nothing with the enterprise that Walt Disney founded and fostered so many years ago (the one that produced \"Mary Poppins\").

            "content": "Mary Poppins is a film I grew up on.  There really isn't a time in my life that I can remember that I hadn't seen this film.  It can't really be defined by one single genre.  It's a musical, it's a fantasy, it's a comedy (probably by the Greek definition because it's not a tragedy),  and it's most definitely a fantasy.  Who wouldn't have wanted to grow up with Mary Poppins?!  Or have a friend like Bert?!  As far as I can think about it, no one!As a kid, I just liked to jump on this trashy brown couch and sing along with the songs as they played.  When I watched it with a bunch of friends about a month or two ago, I noticed things that I would have never been able to notice as a kid on the couch.  The scoring to the movie is nearly unbeatable, particularly during the scenes that the \"Tuppence-a-Bag\" song is playing.  Other great song include \"I Love To Laugh,\" \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" \"Step in Time,\" and the Oscar winning, \"Chim Chim Cheree.\"The movie also has a message behind the father character, David Tomlinson playing Mr. Banks.  His wishes for the children were always calculated and \"just so.\"  It took Bert (a timeless Dick Van Dyke) to let him know that making the children make mature decisions, particularly investing in the bank, will only make the rest of their relationship more difficult. Rather than being father, he should be a dad (slightly as Nirvana put it).I'm p***ed off that this movie isn't as well remembered as it should be. At the Oscars, it received 13 nominations, more than any other movie that year. It was beaten by \"My Fair Lady,\"  which, no offense to \"My Fair Lady\" fans, was not as good or timeless.  \"Lady\" received 12 nominations and won 8 of them, including Best Director and Best Picture.  Of \"Poppins\"' 13 nominations, it won 5.  Plus, when the AFI released their top 100, they neglected \"Mary Poppins,\" but did not neglect \"My Fair Lady.\"  \"Mary Poppins\" was better than more than half of the movies on that list anyway. Please, don't get me too wrong on this one, because I did enjoy \"My Fair Lady.\"  I just don't like the fact that \"Mary Poppins\" didn't do as well.But nevertheless,  Mary Poppins is a 10/10 for many more reasons than this, but here are a few.  If anyone want to talk about Oscar snubs, e-mail me.",

Ms Travers is said to have wanted many changes from Walt, as well she might because whose printed stories could compete with this extravaganza anyway? Julie is making a great film debut. I've tried to find something that could be improved with her performance. But can't. She nailed this one. Other areas of the film are nearly as good. It's hard to imagine any modern day special effects surplanting the ones in the film, however hokey or contrived they may seem. The songs echo through time and still are great. It would be nice to hear more of Chim Chim Cheree in the film however. Dick Van Dyke, the original Disney DVD, is fun to watch, even if a bit over the top at times. Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber give on the money portrayals as do nearly every body else in the cast. Unfortunately I can't recall when I first saw this film anymore, my memory is blurred, however I did see Karen's other wonderful film in 1964 The Three Lives of Thomasina and I recall a fond memory of seeing this film with my grandmother when visiting her. Bring the kids! Fun Fun Fun. Buy this movie and save the rental charges for future screenings.",

            "content": "\"Mary Poppins\" is one of that select group of films that can truly be called 'Classic', a project conceived in love and filled with so much child-like wonder that it will never grow old or 'out-of-date'. Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's remarkable career, both story-wise and technically, the film remains an unsurpassed achievement! Based on P.L. Travers' tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors' works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney's desire to make a definitive, truly 'special' film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed 'pet' project, \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings.With Travers' grudging approval, casting began. While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent. Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from \"The Three Lives of Thomasina\") as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.But it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly 'made' the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, \"My Fair Lady\" (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in \"Camelot\" on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role. \"But I'm pregnant,\" she told him. \"No problem,\" he replied. \"I'll wait!\" And thus a Classic was born!",

            "review_title": "Disney should go back to the books on this one.",
            "content": "Having read the Mary Poppins books before this movie was made, I eagerly awaited its arrival.  It was a great disappointment to find the tone so thoroughly changed.  Had I been older, I would have known that Disney was the wrong studio to undertake the project: they Disneyized it.  It is telling that when P.L. Travers objected to their treatment of her stories, the studio had to appease her with the argument that the film would make a fortune.  Oh, well-- what are movies for?Mary Poppins should have an aura of menace.  Some of the adventures she led the children into were threatening; some of the situations they got themselves into were dangerous.  The contrast of danger and normalcy increased the effect of her magic, and added to the significance of the messages behind the stories:  The everyday scenes of life can have hidden meaning and deep undercurrents (most of the people in the neighborhood were somehow involved with the goings-on), and home is a safer harbor than one might imagine.  In many respects, the Mary Poppins stories are reminiscent of works by Ray Bradbury.Disney did not really \"mature\" to the point of handling stories such as these until \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" (1983)-- a Ray Bradbury story, by the way.  But \"Mary Poppins\" also directed the stories to a younger audience than they were originally written for-- they are juvenile fiction, not children's stories.  At a time when taking the whole family to a movie was more common, this was a valid business approach to the production.  It doesn't do the stories any favors, however.The dynamics of audiences have changed in the last thirty-five years, with more young adolescents attending movies independently of their parents. There is a market for a more accurate version of the Mary Poppins stories. Since Disney is-- sometimes needlessly-- remaking some of their old movies, why don't they remake \"Mary Poppins\", and get it right?  Margaret Hamilton would have made a fine Mary Poppins; Lily Tomlin could do quite well with the character nowadays, perhaps the more surprisingly considering her association with comedy.  And, as amazing as the effects for the first \"Mary Poppins\" were (and still are, in many ways), they could now make the movie with effects that live up to the depth and subtlety they took out of the stories when they made the first one.It would be a shame if P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins stories faded into oblivion and Disney's \"Mary Poppins\" remained the only vestige of the creations-- as often happens with good books.  Read the books and see what you think.",

Surely they could have afforded a decent dialogue coach. I cannot believe that Julie Andrews didn't say anything about it to the makers at the time. This is often cited in England as an example of the worst attempt at an accent on-screen, several magnitudes worse than Marlon Brando in 'Mutiny on the Bounty' or Johnny Depp in 'From Hell' I can only assume that the makers assumed that the target audience, outside of the UK at least, would be incapable of noticing the difference.",
