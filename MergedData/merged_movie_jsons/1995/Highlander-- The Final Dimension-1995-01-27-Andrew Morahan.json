            "content": "In 1995, with the enormous international success of the \"Highlander\" TV series, producers Bill Panzer and Pete Davis once again teamed up to unleash another \"Highlander\" sequel upon us. This time, it's \"Highlander III: The Sorcerer\" or, as it was known in the U.S., \"Highlander: The Final Dimension\". (Don't ask me where the hell that came from) The film finds Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) enjoying a peaceful life with his adopted son, deceived that he has won the Prize. However, the evil sorcerer Kane (Mario Van Peebles) has broken free from the Japanese mountain he was entombed in, and now he wants the Highlander's head.One of the parts of the film I enjoyed the most was Christopher Lambert's portrayal of Connor. For once the character isn't a severely depressed maniac, and in fact, he's better in this film than any other. Mario Van Peebles makes a good, if not unbelievable villain, with Deborah Unger as the sexy Highlander girl.Andy Morahan's direction is good. The script is good and very entertaining, but the film's problem is this: although it has all the right materials to make a good film, they are either wasted, put in the wrong place or dropped quickly. It makes you wonder if the franchise is cursed.The film's score, by J. Peter Robinson, was very nice as well. Loreena McKennit's \"Bonny Portmore\", featured twice in the film, is a beautiful and outstanding song that has now become the theme for the series.All in all, while \"Highlander III\" (Sorcerer/Final Dimension) is an entertaining film, it can't come anywhere near comparing to the original film, although it is a major improvement over \"Highlander II\".",

            "review_title": "Mildly entertaining - An improvement over II",
            "content": "Just to be up-front about this - I enjoy these films. The original - Highlander - was the only one in the series which really stands the test of time (Endgame has now joined it in this), and stands head and shoulders above the others for artistic merit and originality, but still, I liked the others well enough. I also like the much maligned Christopher Lambert. He's an odd actor to be sure - far from the Hollywood norm in appearance, style and accent, but he's nothing if not original and once you understand his understated style, you might just see that the guy has some serious talent. Read on if these statements resonate with you. Otherwise, feel free to move on without reading or rating this review.Lambert is good, Unger is good, Van Peebles is campy as hell, alternating between absurdist humor and menacing poseur-ship.The script is OK, certainly less grandiose and more mindless than II (and closer to the original in feeling, pace and plot), but not particularly original.The production values are a slight step up from II, about as good as Endgame, and almost up to the original's standards.Conor McLeod has reclaimed something of his humanity - imagining himself to be the last immortal on earth, but of course, he is wrong. Sorcerer Kane, who has stolen the magic of one of McLeod's former teachers, is hunting his head. McLeod has adopted a child and is about to fall in love again, the last thing he needs is an attack by an enemy who has no corporeal body.The film is entirely predictable, and is nothing more than a fan film. So what? It's harmless entertainment with some very pretty scenes from Scotland and some other gorgeous landscapes, and, if you don't expect much, you might just have a good time with it.",

            "content": "(A word of warning there may be a few spoilers within so if you haven't seen this or any of the other films or the series I recommend you not read this yet)First of all Highlander III: The sorcerer is the french title used for this film, I just thought I'd clear that up real quick.Those of us that live in America know Highlander III as Highlander: The Final Dimension. Highlander is extremely criticized due to the fact that Highlander II: The Quickening came before it. I look at it this way, Highlander II is like Halloween III it has nothing to do with the rest of the series the only exception is that it does involve Conner Macleod, unlike Halloween III which doesn't involve Michael Myers at all. I did not see the theatrical version of Highlander: The Final Dimension, I just recently came across a copy of the R rated Directors Cut of this film. This cut of this film is excellent and it is a nice sequal to the original Highlander if you forget about Highlander II.I think I can understand why this film was criticized, the theatrical version was probably released half assed with the scenes all cut up. The Directors Cut is pure and complete.I'd like to comment on the love scene in this film between Conner and the female lead, it is almost on a pornographic level and it is no wonder that they wouldn't allow that to get into theatre's. It is greatly welcomed in this release though.Mako does an excellent Job as Macleod's new trainer at the beginning of the film, he knows he is going to die and on at least three occasions gives Conner the opportunity to take his head, he idiotically refuses and his trainers powers fall into the hands of evil an evil that would hunt MaCloud many centuries later. Those that say that this is a remake of the original are greatly mistaken and should rent the directors cut of this film and watch this one again.MaCloud did win the prize in the original film, it just so happens that when the sorcerer is resurrected the game begins again,Macloud is actually defending the prize he already won, he gets an even greater prize when he kills the Sorcerer, he recieves the powers and knowledge of his trainer and his power of illusion, besides the overall prize.Many have asked about Highlander: Endgame, this film only works if you think of it as many years later, this film also is based on the television series too, we have both Conner and Duncan in this one. IF you see the pilot of that show Conner is there, we learned that he trained Duncan after finding him almost dead after a battle. This film pretty much wraps up that series and it tries to finish off the film series as well, it is confusing but you can make sense out of it if you try. The Villian in that film tops them all as he doesn't care about the rules, in fact he breaks every one including the Holy Ground rule.If anyone else can figure out the link between Highlander I, III, the series and Endgame, feel free to write another commentary with updated information and your own thoughts of what if.Highlander: The Final Dimension is under-rated and the Directors Cut of this film should be viewed for best performance.There can be only one, yes in the end there can be only one, we do not know when the end will be, it could be the end of time for all we know, immortals are always being born throughout the centuries and years, we don't know who they are or where they are, at the time end of time one man shall stand alone, at that point there can be only one, but it will be almost an eternity before every immortal is killed in fact the game has the potential to last an eternity.Those were just some words to think about next time you watch any of the Highlander films(except II) and when you watch the show.",

            "content": "From my point of view, this was an attempt to put back puzzle in normal after the terrible \"Highlander 2 - The Quickening\" sequel. Well, they did it, but still, the film is nothing special. What I like about is film... it has a very different way of telling story, different tempo of the proceeding through the film. In a way, it's a kind of lemonade film... a quite relaxing. Everything is relaxing and nothing special, just like some kind of TV film from \"Hallmark\", you know, when come back home, after the work, you eat something, than you sit back, or lie down on your favorite couch and you stumble upon this film, and then you just relax.Simply nothing is touching you so deep about this film, everything is hollow. Everything is like \"oh, OK\", \"oh, they have a sword fight, right\", \"allrighty\", \"nothing here...\" \"that's good...\" in kinda boring way.Actors: Christopher Lambert - wooden, doing nothing but talks like a bored Frenchman. Deborah Kara Unger - about her later. Just keep reading. Mario Van Peebles - his performance was funny, He keep it creepy and ugly, the way his character is supposed to be, well that's his way to perform it, his way to see this character, but it was weird that he keeps remind us on Kurgan, and that pig growls... damn... spit out those slimes from your throat... Jesus! Mako - His \"guest role\" was fine and relaxing as a great Japanese immortal sword master. And to mention Raoul Trujillo (warrior 2) from \"Apocalypto\" and \"True Blood\" season one (the Longshadow vampire dude), it was interesting to see him from his younger days.OK - now for the highlight of review... Probably the best thing in whole film, was no more or no less - the SEX scene! The sex scene between Christopher Lambert and Deborah Kara Unger was more than impressive! Wow, they did it without a double. That was a real talent between the two of them. Good movements and good \"coreography\" during the sexual \"work\", combined with a \"f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, \"allright, let's perform it!\" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame \"Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!\" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.",

An old enemy similar to the Kurgan of the first film, escapes an entombment after 400 years and begins a quest for the head of McLeod. Kane- the Sorceror -makes a great villain and blends into modern America easily with his tattoos and piercings. The film also boasts some Conan elements with Mako again playing a wizard named Nagano and there also some f/x similar to T-2 as the sorceror's power is made apparent. Debra Unger is also a plus as a smokin' leading lady who provides the best and sweatiest sex scene of the \"Highlander\" cycle. There are also some great locales used in the film. From snowy Japan to African deserts to the Scottish Highlands, the film features all three beautifully. McLeod also has an adopted son and is hounded by a new NYC detective who is wise to his immortal habits. But through it all, he keeps his cool demeanor. However, the soundtrack leaves much to be desired. 7/10. Check out the DVD!",

I admit that this is probably my favorite sequel, only because the beginning reminds me of kung fu sequel, with Mako teaching Lambert swordsmanship and kung fu, however that aside the movie is fairly uninspired but not too dull and really it makes logical sense, even in comparison with the original (The only sequel to do so.) The suspended animation thing is a lame way to bring up a new enemy but at least it doesn't explain that they are from a different planet, or completely contradict the original like the fourth. The fight sequences are decent and the production values while somewhat cheap play passably on screen, so overall it's a mediocre sequel. Nothing special but at least semi-watchable.* * out of 4-(Fair)",

            "content": "*SPOILERS* Highlander III: The Sorcerer (1994) is a poor copycat movie of the first one in the franchise. This is a far superior film to Highlander II but it is really a copy of the first one. ... It really feels as if the Highlander story has no more to give us but that would be very wrong. It used to be my second favorite film in the franchise but not anymore!! Christopher Lambert returns as Connor MacLeod as the protagonist who has to face against a new dangerous and powerful enemy; An extremely powerful sorcerer known as Kane (Mario Van Peebles) who threatens to win the fabled \"Prize\" in order to gain world domination by eliminating Macleod.Plot: Deceived that he had won the Prize, Connor MacLeod awakens from a peaceful life when an entombed immortal magician comes seeking the Highlander.This movie has a tons of problems while people are trashing Highlander II: The Quickening idiots! You give this hack job of a movie a better rating than Highlander 2: Renegade Version?! This is a joke. Highlander 3 is at its best when it's ripping off the first film and at its worst when it tries to add in sub-plots that go no-where.Connor MacLeod has suddenly a son? Really? Are you people that stupid! The immortals can't have kids! Why would MacLeod adopt a son is stupid and ridicules! Brenda is suddenly killed in this movie with a weird explanation! Kane The Sorcerer (Mario Van Peebles) want's to win the fabled \"Prize\" in order to gain world domination. Haven't we saw that in the first movie when the Kurgan wanted to win the \"Prize\" by eliminating MacLeod?!Lt. John Stenn (Martin Neufeld) says the dialogues like that he was in the first movie, when in fact the character was never mentioned or seen in the first movie!!!!! The character Lt. John Stenn miraculously disappears from the movie without any explanation!Kane The Sorcerer (Mario Van Peebles) kidnaps MacLeod's fake son ( Gabriel Kakon) and uses him as bait by playing the same trick with a car that The Kurgan played on Brenda by kidnapping her and dragging her in the car and hitting people on the street. I saw that scene in the first movie already gosh! Kane The Sorcerer (Mario Van Peebles) has sex with a prostitute, haven't we already see that in the first movie? The end of a sword fight the battle in the power plant when we see the sword battle between MacLeod and Kane, during the battle you can see a stuntman for Christopher Lambert doing the sword fights which the fight is a fake! Why is doing a stuntman all the work for Christopher Lambert? Couldn't he do it his stunts him self, like he did in the second one?! Why this movie has so many titles? It is stupid! The Sorcerer, The Magician, The Final Dimension and The Final Conflict?! That is beyond stupid! Like producers didn't know what title they should use for this movie! Geesh! What is so epic about this movie than we saw in the first two movies? I think with the power plant this movie tried to rip off Terminator 2 and I Come in Peace (1990)! This movie is rated PG-13 not R, the first two movies a rated R not PG-13 you morons! I am sorry, but this is a terrible awful film! The only thing I liked in this movie is the song Bonny Portmore by Loreena McKennitt. It tried to follow the story the of the first film which it ruined with coping it! I liked that the film was also shot in Castle Tioran, Lochaber, Highland, Scotland, UK that is the only thing I liked. I also like MacLeod making his own sword and the song Bonny Portmore is played by Loreena McKennitt that was epic. There are almost only three things I liked about this movie.I also liked Highlander entering abandoned power plant for the final battle I like that and I like the music score playing during the fight. that is all. The rating is F 1/10 for me I am not reviewing Endgame and The Source they both suck and they are even worst than this one! 1/10 Score: F Studio: Miramax Films Starring: Christopher Lambert, Mario Van Peebles, Deborah Unger, Mako Director: Andrew Morahan Producer: Claude L\u00e9ger Screenplay: Paul Ohl Ren\u00e9 Manzor, Brad Mirman Story by Brad Mirman William N.

            "content": "This is definitely more of a sequel than Highlander 2: The Quickening was. With respect to the first Highlander this film actually follows it pretty well.  It's funny though because it totally disregards the existence of Highlander 2.  In Highlander 2 they show Brenda Wyatt (the main girl in the first Highlander film) dying from the effects of a depleted ozone layer, but in this film they mention that she was killed in a car accident.  Anyhow, if you pretend that Highlander 2 doesn't exist, this actually makes a good deal of sense with regard to the original Highlander.  The only qualm I have with the film is how could Connor MacLeod think he has \"the prize\" when there are still 3 more immortals out there?  That doesn't really seem to make sense, but maybe some die-hard Highlander fan can explain it to me.Anyhow, all in all, I thought this was a really good film.  I loved all the actors, Christopher Lambert does a great job as Connor MacLeod as always and I was really impressed with Mario Van Peebles, he did a fantastic job, and looked really menacing throughout the film.  Deborah Unger was a nice addition, she's definitely a looker, and not a bad actor either.The story was pretty good, but it's nothing terribly complicated.  The special effects are very nicely done.I'm not a die-hard Highlander fan, but I do like the films, and I thought this film was great.  I hope you enjoy the film as well.

Christopher Lambert is back and he still has that glow for this character of Duncan Macleod. Now for the villain, Kane (not to be confused with the WWE superstar) he was a good villain but not as bad ass as Kurgan. Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.",

Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology.Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance.Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly.The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had.The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth.The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song \"Bonny Portmore\" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace.The special effects are okay.The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once againHighlander III: The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.",

Centuries ago one man was chosen to protect all that is good. Throughout time they have hunted each other fulfilling the prophecy, that there can be only one.

One man was choosen to protect all that is good. Now an enemy from the past journeys time to challenge him in the present.Largely panned by the critics, but it has some surprisingly nice scenes, and with overwhelming duels , colorful scenarios and including numerous images in video-clip style . .The picture displays noisy action , derring-do, adventure , spectacular combats, dumb script and breathtaking outdoors which are a treat for the sight . The flick is starred by a known cast , giving functional performances , such as : Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod / Russell Nash , he's a fighter from four centuries ago with an eternal confrontation since Middle Age against his fellow headhunter immortal , Mario Van Peebles as an extremely hammy called Kane , Deborah Kara Unger as research scientist Alex Johnson / Sara, Mako and Raoul Max Trujillo .

This movie, however is different in how not different it is: it's basically a campy remake of Highlander. But now with magic.The plot is Connor has won The Prize, but has done nothing with it. Centuries before, a Japanese mage removed 3 immortals from The Game by cursing them and trapping them in a cave. An excavation releases them, taking away The Prize and resuming The Game.Mario Van Peebles tries to replace Clancy Brown's Kurgan, but his villain just isn't that interesting, except for his periodic sorcery. His character feels like a weak ripoff.There's good stuff for fans in here, the Holy Ground fight for instance. There's an incredible sequence set to Bonny Portmore. The movie tries to recapture the original, but in ridiculous ways and with a classic movie sin: introducing a kid.The name didn't help the movie: it was called both The Sorcerer and The Final Dimension, the latter having nothing to do with the film, and the box wrongly suggests it involves time travel.This movie isn't amazing, and it's nowhere near as good as Highlander, but it washed the taste of Highlander 2 away (as much as it could), and in my opinion is the true sequel to Highlander.",

            "content": "Most of you I'm sure are familiar with the Highlander TV series staring Adrian Paul. Well the movies in my opinion were never as good a the TV show, with the fist movie being the only redeeming one of the bunch. Part 3 is a pretty bad movie and my opinion has not changed since I first saw it ten years ago. Some on this board say its a remake of the first others say it continues from the first. Either way the movie is awful. The movie starts out way back when Connor Macleod (Lambert) leaves Scotland and sets out for his quest, I suppose. Eventually makes his way to Japan, where of course he comes across the master sorcerer Nakano (Mako). There he learns the way of the sword and how to fight. Ever seen Conan? Well so did the people who wrote this. While he becomes a better swordsman, evil is approaching. Kane (Mario Van Peebles), what an original name for evil, and along the way he shows how evil he is by burning down a small village in the dead of winter. Did I mention the movie Conan? Kane makes his way to Nakano's cave and beheads him taking his magic for himself, but becomes trapped in the cave until the movie is made. While Macleod has been trying to forget his past, a female archaeologist Alex Johnson (Unger) has managed to uncover the cave of the Wizard Nakano. As you guessed Kane is released and promptly beheads one of his thugs and sends the other after Macleod. Macleod senses something is up, returns to New York where we have a badly acted cop attempting to get him for previous murders. He mostly fails and Alex tracks him down using a piece of tartan found in the cave that revels who he is. Kane also finds him and of course they duel. Macleod loses and runs back to Scotland for no real reason. There he finds time to make a new sword and have sex with Alex, the hot female lead. You have just witnessed the best part of the movie so don't worry about the end, but I'll tell you anyway. Macleod once again confronts him and defeats him in a very anti climatic ending. There can be only one.Defiantly not the worst movie I have ever seen, but this is certainly worthy of mention. As stated in my title, the only real reason to watch this movie is for the very well done directors cut sex scene. Deborah Unger is no joke! She is not only hot but certainly knows how to handle Lambert. I guess I'm not surprised that it had to be in the directors cut with what they show. By far the only entertaining part of this film. From the fight scenes to the special effects there just isn't much great about this movie. The acting is terrible. I'm not sure who is worse Lambert who can't act at all or Van Peebles who looks like a total moron in the film and acts like a idiot. Is there any point to Kane driving like a maniac with Macleod's kid in the car? What a waste of time and film. Unger at least is hot and who cares if she acts bad. The special effects were OK. For the time I would say they were maybe average. The story was also poor. Mako is wasted as the oriental master and could have been much better. Scene after scene was just boring and a waste. As mentioned the car scene, also many flashbacks, some were OK. Kane going to a hooker and putting a condom in his mouth, pretty stupid. How about Lambert getting shot and jacked in the streets then taken to hospital and thrown in the mental ward. Stupid. Keep an eye out for Kane's sword Dark Magic witch is a finely crafted sword. The on locations of Scotland and other places are good, but I didn't come for geography I want a good movie. Overall a very poor movie that actually spawned more sequels. If you want the best sex scene in a non porn film, this is it, if not watch the superior TV series with Adrian Paul. 3 out of 10...There can be only one!",

I was really looking forward to this, since it was supposed to be a direct sequel to the first film. But  instead, it's just plain disappointing. It doesn't even try to explain the movies' connection to the tv show, and it's basically a remake of the first film. Even the villain is a carbon-copy.Christopher Lambert tries hard, but the plot is just too flimsy for anyone to take this seriously. The mentor characters are also dissapointing. \"Highlander 1 and 2\" had Sean Connery teaching Lambert, and his character was great. \"The Gathering\" had Lambert himself teaching a new guy, Adrian Paul. But the mentor in \"Final Dimension\" is played by Mako. He's a decent actor, but the character doesn't hold a candle to Connery or Lambert, and in a film about mentors and their students, he should have.Beautiful Scottish footage (in the film's best scenes) and well-choreographed sword-fights can't save this from being disappointing. ** out of *****.",

Centuries later Macleod has won the prize but the contest is restarted when Alex Johnson's archaeological dig in Japan releases Kane to battle again.There can be only one, and after this film I was kinda thinking that there should have been only one.  This film sees the series stretched out to nobodies benefit.  The film tries to simply do what the first one did.  So we have the big evil baddie, the death of a master, the flashbacks to other times, the confusion of NYC cops etc.  The flashbacks are pointless and just incredibly random \u0096 they aren't even given the slight attention that the original did.  The whole story in fact, just seems to flow along without much effort.  Threads are simply dropped on the cutting room floor to keep the running time down and none of the characters are really ever developed at all.Lambert is even less charismatic than he usually is and is pretty dull, rarely showing any emotional involvement in this film at all.  Van Peebles is as poor as I'm used to seeing him be.  He plays his character with all the real menace and character of a poor WWF wrestler.  He is simply repeating the character than Clancy Jones played some time ago.  Unger is dropped in as the star-crossed love interest and is only worth a glance during the obligatory (for the DTV market anyway) love scene.The sword fights are OK but my total lack of interest in the plot or characters made them pretty much exercises in futility for the most part.  I don't understand why they bothered to make a third part when it was so very evident all the way that nobody really had the heart for it.  It all smacks of laziness and I wondered why I was putting in the effort to watch it when so little effort or care had been put into making it.",

I have since seen the unedited version and found it to be much better. Despite being hated by Highlander fans and downright loathed by non-Highlander fans, I found the flick to be pretty good for a sequel. The first one, depending on your opinion, is an extremely powerful movie. It changed my views on the way action movies should be. Highlander sets the standard. Highlander III, on the other hand, sets the bar pretty low. It doesn't set out to be as deep or character-driven as the first one. It is for all intents and purposes, about making a buck off a classic. Normally I would condemn it for solely that reason, but I actually liked it enough to consider it a guilty pleasure. Would I openly admit to my friends that I like it? No. I would, however, recommend it for Highlander fans not expecting too much. It's definitely a guy flick, being all about action sequences, T&A, and style over substance. It also offers a gorgeous female lead and fine music. Not a great flick, by any means, though better than the other sequels so that's saying something. 7/10",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect revisiting Highlander 3 after 20 years. When I was about 11 I was somewhat obsessed with the Highlander movies (back when there was only three and a tv series that was even too cheesy for me), but except for the first one which I have rewatched every once in a while I had abandoned all hope for this franchise around the time the forth one came around, so I buried it along with other films from my childhood that aged badly and never looked back.I am glad I ultimately gave highlander 3 another chance though in a random Christopher Lambert marathon.Granted the story doesn't make a lick of sense and is nothing but the flimsiest of excuses to save a valueable property after the disaster that was Highlander 2, but a lot of the core strengths that made the original so compelling are still here.\nFantastic visuals, an odd but unique performance by Christopher Lambert and a surprisingly touching emotional core that keeps it all together. Generally this is a very appealing movie to look at. Whereas the original was inspired by the videoclip aesthetic of the eighties, Highlander 3 takes after the early nineties action and thriller genre. Harsh shadows, highly saturated Oranges and Blues, fluent camera movements and the trademark transitions between past and present from the original. After the dreadful style of the second one that looked like cheap direct to video trash this is a nice return to form.While the romance doesn't work quite as well as it did in the first one, there isn't too much focus on it, and yet it's still used well to drive home just how sad and lonely immortality would be. I always call Highlander the best vampire movie, because it manages to convey that tragedy much better than almost any vampire movie, safe maybe for interview with the vampire.This doesn't feel like the cash grab it could well have been. It smells of fanfilm, albeit a very competent one and had it ended there it would have been a very satisfying conclusion to a flawed series, tying up all the plot points of the story in a nice bow.\nSo far this review sounds rather glowing, so other than the obvious reason that there should have never been any sequels, what drags this movie back down to a 5 out of 10? Well, the former doesn't help admittedly, and the script seems rushed and unoriginal to the point where this feels more like a soft reboot than a sequel.\nAlso, and Highlander fans are going to hate me for this: for a franchise based solely on kickass swordfights the swordfights in all the Highlander movies are actually really bad and awkward. Some of this can actually be attributed to Christopher Lambert's bad eyesight so I will cut him some slack, but even when there's a double involved (sometimes rather obviously as in the finale here) it always looks like two dudes just swatting metal sticks against another, not as it should, like the dangerous blade dance of two masters who have honed their craft for centuries. In Highlander 3 they at least try to edit around these flaws. It works a little bit...The music isn't bad, it has a few good moments but of course it can't compete with the absolute juggernaut that was the Queen score of the first one.Another problem is Mario van Peebles' performance. He looks freaking cool and in a different story his character could have worked but the over the top silliness clashes with the much more interesting character drama. It feels too much like he's trying to mimic Clancy Brown's iconic performance from the first Highlander, but even that one felt more grounded and layered. The unoriginal script is bubbling through the cracks here, as so many villain-defining moments are basically copied from the original.Ultimately this is a deeply flawed movie but still very satisfying if you grew up with the original. It feels like coming home after a long time. There's a lot more mold than you remember, but it's still cozy.",

It was a stand- alone and the audience adored it...myself included.Highlander II was a sequel, and because the first one was a stand alone and the game was over leaving no room for a sequel...they did a retcon, made them all aliens, and took away everything the fans and critics loved about the first one. Just like remakes and reboots tend to do.Highlander II realized the mistake of Highlander II and they did yet another retcon, ignoring the abysmal failure of Highlander II and brought back the things that the fans loved about the original...but, the original was a stand alone, so they retconed the ending again to give us a third movie and it didn't work.It did not work.Again, these are movies about immortals, there are thousands of years in which to make a movie...but instead of doing the obvious thing they did a retcon, of a retcon and it doesn't exactly work.But it didn't fail as much as Highlander II, and they didn't bring Sean back from the dead again, so...we were stuck with the TV show to redeem it all.",

This is the third and probably most watchable entry into the series. Where the first Highlander couldn;t decided whether it wanted to be a beautifully filmed sword and scorcery movie or a trashy action movie and the second was more of a sci-fi movie this one gives us an even mix of unexplained flashbacks and modern time fight scenes. Christepher Lambert returns as the scottish clansman who is still speaking in a french accent and wearing his scottish clansman attire of blue jeans and white sneakers. This time he is up against Kane, a scorcer who provides us with the best Highlander villian yet. The absence of Sean Connery as Rameriaz hurts this movie quite a bit but for fans of the series of someone looking for some corney fantasy movie that doesn't involve the use of many braincells will find this enjoyable mostly due to the great special effects.",

And I must admit that after suffering through the 1991 movie, then I weren't exactly harboring much hopes for this 1994 third movie in the installment.Sure, I had watched \"Highlander III: The Sorcerer\" once before, but I have to be completely honest and say that I had totally forgotten about the movie's plot. So it didn't bode well for the movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it once again.While writers Brad Mirman, William N. Panzer, Paul Ohl, Ren\u00e9 Manzor and Brad Mirman certainly managed to put together a script, plot and storyline that was better than what was seen in the 1991 sequel, then this 1994 movie was by no means a particularly noteworthy moment in cinematic history. Yeah, it was nowhere near the 1986 original \"Highlander\" movie, so you're not in for anything grand here.The movie is starring Christopher Lambert and Mario Van Peebles, and also has Mako on the cast list. An okay enough cast ensemble were in the movie, for sure, but they had precious little to work with in terms of script and characters.I have to admit that \"Highlander III: The Sorcerer\" sort of felt like a movie that came and went without leaving any lasting impression, since the franchise officially died after the abysmal 1991 sequel killed it off. And now that I have seen \"Highlander III: The Sorcerer\" for a second time, I can honestly say that I am not returning to watch it again.My rating of director Andrew Morahan's 1994 movie \"Highlander III: The Sorcerer\" lands on a four out of ten stars.",

            "content": "Sometimes, even the most innocent and naive movie lover can understand that a movie is going to be a huge failure. That must have happened with \"Highlander II\", since it is almost certainly one of the worst sequels ever made. After deciding to make this film, the producers and director Andrew Morahan were aware of this, and they corrected it by deciding to pretend that this film never existed, returning to the original and building on that foundation. The result wasn't a success, but at least it wasn't an insult either.The script for this film shows us what happened after Connor MacLeod left Scotland, still wounded by the death of his first wife. He goes to Japan, where he seeks out a wise sorcerer named Nakano. It turns out that there was another immortal warrior interested in going against Nakano, to kill him and absorb his magic and power: Kane. The fight ends in the sorcerer's death. In the present day, his cave is discovered, along with bones and remains that point to the Scotsman's presence, which intrigues archaeologists and historians, as Connor, now a respectable antiquary, prepares for the ultimate battle with Kane.All right, the script is really a mess and admits very silly possibilities for the eyes of anyone who understands and studies history. However, it is a much more decent script and much more in keeping with the original film, which can be said to be a positive point. Nevertheless, it doesn't bring anything really new or fresh, except for a few scenes that are set in the Baroque period and Revolutionary France. Even the villain is, at heart, a retelling of the villain from the first film.The cast does what they can, but only Christopher Lambert deserves to be given the thumbs up for a satisfying job. There are a lot of clich\u00e9 situations or scenes where we get the feeling that the characters are not acting intelligently. Mako tries to be very genuine and gives his character a certain authenticity, which was positive, but everything else is forgettable. Mario Van Peebles seems to bet everything he can on his voice, the huskiest and most cavernous he can get, and Deborah Unger is just the pretty face of the moment.Technically, the film also sought to recreate the look of the first film. There are some points to highlight, namely the good work of the cinematography and the visual and sound effects, which manage to give the film some of the spectacular effects of the first one, without the freshness and authenticity. I also liked the period scenes in general. While not brilliant, they were a welcome addition that shows us a little bit of the main character's backstory. The soundtrack again bets on heavy rock, but is generally forgettable.",

Even if he was bound by a continuation contract, I think any court would grant him a unilateral termination after reading this scenario. And I wish it was just a screenplay that was bad. Aside from acting, which for the most part is decent, the film is pathetic in almost every aspect, technical and essential. I was most bothered by the tempo that leaves the impression of watching a movie trailer or a music video, as well as music that, while not bad in itself, is totally inadequate.

            "content": "The original Highlander (1986) is a film that truly has earned its cult following. Sadly, the story was made in such a way that trying to continue it in further installments would be downright mind boggling. Highlander II: The Quickening (1991) was reviled by fans due to its departure from the original story. Maybe that blunder would talk sense to the producers right? Wrong. Instead another sequel was made, this time further following original story. Initially...this could be promising, but why bother? Once Connor MacLeod won the prize, that was it. Yet somehow, he ends up not being the only one, completely undermining the story from the original. I think continuing the concept is fine...but the original seems to have made the story too perfect.With a screenplay written by Paul Ohl, his first credit and directed by Andrew Morahan in his first film credit, this sequel is no better than Highlander II: The Quickening (1991). It's nice that everyone tried to approach this entry more faithfully than the last but even then, clearly bad decisions were made. Fans learn that before MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) moved to America but sometime after Ramirez's death, he was in Japan learning skills from another master by the name of Nakano (Makoto Iwamatsu) to fight against the deadly swordsman Kane (Mario Van Peebles), who happens to get frozen in a mountain. Now present day, long after MacLeod has \"won\" the prize, Kane awakes to finish what he started.The writing is what really drags this potentially redeeming sequel through the mud. Ohl, deserves credit for at least trying to come up with a way to continue the original. But again, the original story seemed too perfect to continue to begin with. A vast majority of this feature is retreading familiar ground that happened in the original and even some of the first sequel. With Kane on the loose, MacLeod returns to New York where not only does he get pursued by a new cop Lt. John Stenn (Martin Neufeld) who is looking to jail him under his pseudo name of Russell Nash, MacLeod also crosses paths with another woman named Alex Johnson (Deborah Kara Unger) who's interested MacLeod's backstory. Also not to mention, he has an adopted son now too in the middle east named John (Gabriel Kakon).There are parts of the script that acknowledge the past, like mentions of the first cops who were on MacLeod's tail and MacLeod's first American love interest Brenda Wyatt, but that's it. Everything else is more or less repeated, including the line \"there can only be one\". Got it, thanks. This leads audiences to believe though character development doesn't really exist here if similar ideas are revisited. It really makes no sense. Continuity while ok in some places, is another issue in others. Characters are able to find one another with almost no issue....even if they're countries apart. How? As for action, it's slightly better than before, but not by much. For 1994, the special effects are about the same as the last sequel. It's nice to see a different cast of actors alongside Lambert but that's about it. Acting is just average due to the script.Visually speaking, the camerawork and set design was an improvement. Mainly because the setting took place either in the mountain ranges of different countries or the urbanized streets of the city. The director of photography this time was Steven Chivers, better known for his start with Richard Stanley's Hardware (1990) and Dust Devil (1992). At least the shots filmed look distinguishable from each other, unlike the first sequel. As for music, the score was composed by J. Peter Robinson. Probably better known for his work on Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994), Robinson does produce more recognizable music than the first sequel's musical score. It's still not as memorable as Michael Kamen's rendition but it does have some Celtic flavoring sprinkled throughout.Say what you will about Highlander II: The Quickening (1991) being a bad sequel. However, it's bad for doing something way out of whack. Unlike this sequel which redeems itself with minimal correction in its story, with only average acting, good music and camerawork. Other than that, the action still isn't that impressive, the effects aren't top notch and the story almost being a complete rehash.",

I really do wonder why \"Highlander\" ever bothered to have sequels in the first place, I know producers enjoy money but this story has been over for some time. So Highlander is at it again, fighting evil and killing immortals by cutting of their heads. If you can kill them, why the hell do they call them immortals?

It feels like a movie made by people who have seen other stories and can copy elements of stories, but don't have a clue how to TELL a story themselves. On three separate occasions random phone calls are used to propel the story forward. Characters suddenly inexplicable phone the character on-screen and rapidly provide them with just the right information to propel the story forward. This sort of thing is hilariously bad. But also frustrating because the viewer can plainly see other (subtle) ways the story could/should have been driven in that particular direction. Phone calls aside, the film is full of clunky moments like that. Something randomly happens because, basically, the script needs to get a character from A to B. Some of these instances (like when Connor is declared \"a lunatic\u0085 a lunatic\u0085 a lunatic\") are so abrupt and so badly done they are laugh-out-loud funny.On the topic of things that are badly done in this film: a lot of the dialogue is dubbed. And the dubbing is obvious and badly. The scenes with the New York Cop character could actually be scenes from a full-on foreign language film.The film opens with classic examples of tell-don't-show storytelling. We can forgive the lead character's opening narration to camera as he is basically recapping the events of the first film, but the Nakano character opens the movie by warning MacLeod that someone evil is coming to kill them. And that's it. He tells the hero/us that Kane is evil and then Kane appears. And, thanks to a wildly OTT performance from Mario Van Peebles, Kane spends the entire movie as a one-note villain. Relentlessly evil. And certainly no fun to watch.The pace is good, however. Something is always happening, and the locations/flashbacks keep things fresh for the entire running time. It all feels like a missed opportunity. The same cast and story with a good script would have made for a decent entry in the series. After all, the excellent TV series proved that it is more than possible to tell good/great stories using this formula.4/10",

            "content": "This movie should heed its own slogan: \"There can be only one.\" There SHOULD have been only one \u0096 one *Highlander* film, that is. Each sequel drives another vapid nail into the bottomless coffin that has become the *Highlander* franchise. *Highlander* was a magnificent film and, quite obviously upon viewing, a completed story; there was never any question of a sequel - until the advent of Mongoloid Marketeers, All Budget, No Brains.And a shameful pity that in favoring the original *Highlander* movie, one must add qualification these days - There was nothing like *Highlander* when it first appeared; directed by an Australian former music-video director (Russell Mulcahy), featuring a kinetic soundtrack driven by Queen, a story involving Immortals all hiding in plain view amongst earth's populace, congregating for The Gathering, to battle for The Prize \u0096 the gift of foresight and mortality \u0096 and to be THE ONE; featuring newcomer Christopher Lambert, suitably ingenuous as the Scottish Highlander Connor MacLeod, and Sean Connery aggressively fey as his swashbuckling tutor, Ramirez.*Highlander* was engaging, humorous, poignant, original, well-written and well-filmed. Each successive sequel has been exactly the opposite.Regarding *The Sorcerer* (aka *The Final Dimension*), it is quite pointless reviewing or in any way even describing the plots of movies which do not adhere to their own internal logic. In this case (barring the first exceptional installment), this whole series has been battling against itself, in reneging on its own oft-repeated slogan: \"There can be only one\". Well, obviously NOT...The disjointed characters move through *The Sorcerer*'s listless plot with no regard to continuity or semblance of purpose \u0096 they just end up where they need to be for a scene to play itself out \u0096 all those scenes which were obviously pitching points for the producers to lay on the money-men. Now, how to join those scenes? It mattered not, as long as the money was green and the picture was greenlighted.Also directed by a former music-video director, Andy Morahan, *The Sorcerer* displays none of the art and eye that Mulcahy brought to *Highlander*, though Morahan has no qualms in plagiarizing Mulcahy's film at every turn, inserting \"flashback\" scenes to gird the storyline and attempt poignancy, copying scenes (such as the villain Kane's pale impression of The Kurgan, when he mocks MacLeod's son in the car) and just blatantly *repeating* scenes from *Highlander*.The movie's early sequences display more than enough chinks in its feeble armor, where we catch up with MacLeod sometime after *Highlander*, but before *Highlander II: The Quickening*, which, according to this film, apparently never happened. Then the illusion of plot collapses completely when MacLeod gets shot in a New York alley and in the next scene is being frantically dollied to an Emergency Room. Now: who in New York would look twice at a shot guy in a deserted alley, let alone ring it in? Then it gets even more idiotic. Fast.Upon awakening on the hospital dolly, his wounds healed, MacLeod becomes violent and the obviously unfit-to-practice doctor diagnoses him as \"insane\" in three seconds of fighting interns, drugs him and sends him to the lunatic ward. The only apparent reason for this seems to be to execute one of those screenwriter pitch scenes: Kane's medieval henchman stalking MacLeod through modern hospital corridors (how he located him in this facility - with no time for even an *efficient* hospital's paperwork to be processed - is beyond comprehension) and, though MacLeod is randomly trying to find an exit and the henchman is stalking purposefully, somehow both end up in the same basement laundry room. After all that setup - the shooting, the dollying, the lunatic ward, the stalking \u0096 MacLeod kills the henchman quickly with no fanfare and the movie moves on, into further contrived plot less-ness.The swordplay was choreographed by Young Billy from the sixth grade. A suitable nomenclature would be \"air-guitar sword-fighting,\" i.e. rather than actually trying to slice and dice each other's bodies, the opponents slash at the AIR above each other's heads and parry these strokes as if they were vital. In one sequence, Kane (played by Mario Van Peebles, a talented actor/director, heinously miscast here) slashes at MacLeod, who parries Kane's stroke, only to have his sword shatter under Kane's blow. Kane's follow-through, which should have then neatly severed MacLeod's head, doesn't go anywhere near it \u0096 what then, was Kane slashing at? Sultry Debra Unger plays The Chick and - like Roxanne Hart from *Highlander* \u0096 is aroused uncontrollably by the concept of Immortality, her foreplay also being the sight of MacLeod getting stabbed. Guess immortality is a magnet for sexual loonies\u0085.Stereotypical moron cops, whose gratuitous swearing seemed unfamiliar to their untrained-actor mouths, hound MacLeod, whilst Kane kidnaps MacLeod's child, setting up the conundrum where The Hero can't kill The Villain because he alone knows where The Hero's child is.But MacLeod kills Kane anyway. So much for strategic conundrums.After the explosive climax \u0096 not describing the level of excitement, but rather, that there were many gratuitous explosions set off - when MacLeod is once again levitated with the electric ecstasy of being The Last Immortal Ever \u0096 ahem, again \u0096 his son walks nonchalantly down some stairs and reunites with him as if he's just walked in from the kitchen.To put the weak capper on an altogether limp movie, an impotent rock song sings us out over the end credits.Where's Sean Connery when he's least needed?

Then his peaceful existence is shattered when another old enemy from the past, Kane (Mario Van Peebles), who killed another mentor/friend of Connor's (Mako), reappears and starts raising hell. While trying to thwart him, Connor meets a sexy blonde named Alex Johnson (the very sexy Debra Unger), who essentially looks like a blonde version of a red head he had in France during the revolution. Yet another poorly made sequel to the imperfect but enjoyably nutty 1985 sword & sorcery romp, this one ties with \"Highlander 2\" for worst sequel in the series (Highlander 4, which features Duncan MacLeod, is slightly better if you're a fan of the show). Lambert goes through the motions while Van Peebles goes all out over the top in yet another clone of the Kurgan (even recreating the Kurgan's wild car ride from the first movie) who wouldn't last five minutes in the ring with him. The film's only real highlight is the very powerful sex scene between glum Lambert and prototypical sexy blonde ice queen Debra Unger, who probably ranks as being the best of the Highlander babes. A decent actress just to be fair, Debra is also an impossibly well built woman who looks great with or without her clothes on. The only thing that makes me recommend this for rental is the aforementioned very powerful sex scene that strips Debra of her clothes so that we can marvel at her athletic yet slender 5'7\" body.",

This movie seems basically the exact same in many ways as the first movie, but not nearly as good. It doesn't capture the magic and wonder of the first movie.Connor is not the \"only one\" as he was left to believe he won \"the prize\" in the first movie. A bad guy he encountered 400 years earlier that was buried under a mountain reawakens. Kane. Played by Mario Van Peebles. His character was awful. Ott. They tried to make him like the Kurgan in the first movie. Crazy psychotic fun. But he was not fun. The Kurgan made me laugh. This guy didn't. Why didn't they do something new and different? That would have been interesting. They even had him copy the crazy car-driving scene from the first movie. Yawn. I don't think it was Peebles's fault. He was probably directed this way, and this is how the character was written.The flashbacks weren't enough. Those moments in history are part of what made the first movies so magical. Not enough of his time with Nakano. Not enough so as to understand what happened to Connor after Heather died. How did he come to get there and meet Nakano? He still seems rather naive and raw as an immortal.How did Kane and his other compatriot navigate? Ok, Kane had magic now. But what about the other guy? Dressed like that. Making it all the way to New York. Where did he get a passport? Lol. I mean these two should have been fish out of water. But they woke up and everything was fine in their perception of the world.Brenda is dead, so naturally, they start all over with a new love interest. Alex. Lo and behold, investigating old artifacts and Conner Macleod. Just. Like. Brenda.That cop was kinda awful. Ott New York accent. He looked too young to be speaking like an old man New Yorker.No mention of Connor's daughter, Rachel. He now has a son.The plot of this is basically the same as the first movie. Crazy immortal comes hunting for Connor. That's it. But at least in the first movie, we saw how the character of Connor was fleshed out. We watched his beautiful and sad romance with his bonnie Heather. We watched some really good flashbacks in his history. We learned how the immortal worked and the rules of the game. And it was so well done. Captured magic in a bottle. Here, not at all. It was still somewhat entertaining. There were some beautiful scenery in the modern Scotland scenes.I miss Queen's music. That also made the first movie great. Some people in the reviews liked the music, but to be honest, I barely noticed the music except for Bonny Portmore. Which was played a lot in the tv series. Speaking of which, this movie aired in 1994 and the series started in 1992. Connor appears in the first episode of the series. So there he knows there are other immortals and that no one has won the prize. I wonder what people thought at the time that watched both this movie and the series? Kind of weird I suppose.The movie still looks cheap looking as the first two did. Too bad they couldn't get a bigger budget given the home video success of the first movie. If they had, that may have changed the whole dynamic of this. But then again, the first movie was cheap, and yet somehow was such a gem. Rough around the edges, but magical.In essence, this movie was like a dull imitation of the first movie. Too bad the franchise could never regain its footing after the first movie. What they needed was a great writer to write a compelling sequel. 4/10.",

            "content": "The following review, is by a friend of my, Peter Benigni, which I first asked him if I could use his review, and he said yes. \"Highlander\", released in 1985, has spawned both two popular syndicated television series and an stupid animated series, so it's surprising that the franchise's own worst enemy is the pair of film sequel it has been produced 5 years later: \"Highlander II: The Quickening\", made in 1990, one of the worst movies ever made. After the great failure of this film, the Davis/Panzer teaming decide to make up with making this film. So, we have \"Highlander: The Final Dimension\", made in 1994, starring the original Highlander, Christopher Lambert. It's a great pleasure on the big screen, having Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, the role that he created and later inspired the \"Highlander:The Series\" producers in 1992, though he seemed elevated to competence in the first film through proximity to fellow Immortal Sean Connery (alas, Juan Sunchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez's character remains dead and Connery remains smart enough to avoid non-Bond sequels). Even excusing the implausible French-Scots accent, Lambert's performance as Connor MacLeod (in HL1 and HL3 and the HL:TS 1st episode) was always one of the greatest and hightest points of the \"Immortal Universe\", making him probably THE coolest Immortal in the Highlander Film-Series. And, to be truthfull and onnest, if Connor MacLeod didn't exist, then Duncan and the characters of the televison series would have not been existed. The nastiest of these in this installment is Kane (Mario Van Peebles), a 751 years old Immortal, who was trupped in a cave at Japan for 400 years, while he gained the power of the Sorcerer Nakano, Connor's second teacher. \"The Final Dimension\" is all over the map and timeline: It starts in late 16th-century Japan and includes scenes from revolutionary France, 18th-century Scotland and 20th-century Morocco and New York City. This is movement, but it's hardly action. For that, one turns to the four sword fights that shape the film (immortals shun modern weaponry), with most interests the one in the Budish shrine (a little bit ridiculous, since the Budish Shrine was a Holly Ground, but, as it seems, Kane was VERY bad and unreligious) and the Final Battle in the end (certainly better than the Final Battle in the first one). There are also scenes of sword forgings and sword training (in Japan with the ubiquitous and truly Immortal Japanese actor Mako -one of the classiest and greatest Japanese actors). There's even a set piece with Lambert running through the Scottish Highlands, slashing the air as Loreena McKennitt sings a beautifull ballad that aims to follow in the chart steps of the original's \"Who Wants to Live Forever?\", and comes very close.MacLeod's love interest this time around is archaeologist Alex Johnson (Deborah Unger, also playing his 18th-century paramour, Sarah Berrington), but other than her showing up for unusual scene segues, nothing much happens. As for Van Peebles, he's a big improvement to General Katana's character at HL2, but unfortunately, he's reapiting much of Clancy Brown's the Kurgan character (and lines), making his character a litle boring, but still, he's a good villain.\"The Final Dimension\" marks the feature debut of video veteran Andy Morahan, here following in the footsteps of video director Russell Mulcahy (who did the first and second films). Many people said that he should have stayed in the Music video productions, but I believe he made a good film, with style and inspiration.Given that each movie has had its good and bad points, I'm not sure whether this is worthy of praise or not. I think \"Highlander: The Final Dimension\" is one of the better sequels in the Highlander series, although many people thought that it had been failed as a true Highlander sequel. I don't think so...TRIVIA: Wait until \"Highlander: Endgame\" comes out at late Semptember 2000",

For one, the awfulness that was \"Highlander 2: The Quickening\" was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved \"The Quickening\", it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production.The first reaction as the movie began: at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of \"Quickening\" was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring \"Quickening\", \"Quickening\" had one advantage to \"Sorcerer\": it was real cinema while \"The Sorcerer\" reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a \"McQuade\"-episode.An action-franchise, be it \"Highlander\" or \"James Bond\" lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns: Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the \"Highlander\"-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for \"Highlander\"-fans.\"It's a kind of magic\", was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success: what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in \"Highlander 2\" was the attempt to explain the background and reasons \u2013 something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in \"Highlander 3\" is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the \"Highlander\"-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers \u2013 they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood.One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded \u2013 not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like \"Highlander: The Series\", \"Highlander: Endgame\" or \"Highlander 5: The Source\", which one would inadvertently have to watch.

            "content": "You know a film franchise is running out of ideas when the producers decide to churn out a new film that essentially retells the story of the old one, but badly. I recently rewatched the first Highlander, and saw the two sequels for the first time and came to the conclusion that yes, there should really only have been one.The core concept behind Highlander is a good one: immortal warriors fighting over centuries until only one is left, who will win the Prize, the nature of which varies over the various entries of the franchise, but is usually described as the power of all immortals who ever lived. The only way an Immortal can be killed is by removal of the head, usually via sword.This made for a good film: an epic story spanning hundreds of years, cool swordfights and a good performance from Christopher Lambert made the original Highlander one of the better 1980s films out there. At the end of the film, he had supposedly won the Prize, and that was that.However, because it was so successful, it spawned sequels: the hilariously bad Highlander II, and the one being reviewed, Highlander III: The Sorcerer.The film starts with Connor MacLoed (Christopher Lambert) going to Japan a couple of hundred years ago to learn from the sorcerer Nakano who has the handy ability to make illusions appear from thin air. Nakano is also being hunted by Kane(Mario van Peebles), a villain who is virtually a carbon copy of the Kurgan (is a barbarian, likes to kill women and children, etc) who wants the power of illusion to do bad things. Kane catches up with Nakano, Connor escapes and Kane is buried in Nakano's cave.Skip forward a few hundred years: Connor is living with his adopted son in some Middle Eastern country, until Kane is released from a cave by an archaeologist obsessed with ancient Japan (a variant on the love interest from the first film). Connor becomes aware that Kane is back, and then goes back to New York to kill Kane. Apparently he didn't win the Prize after all, and is in actual fact an Immortal who thinks he is mortal (which he was meant to become at the end of the first film). What follows is pretty much a retelling of the first film. There are two scenes that are really blatant copies of ones from the first film: Kane taunts Connor on holy ground where Immortals cannot fight. The first time he does this they fight and they actually explain what happens when you do fight on holy ground, and the second time is virtually the same as the scene with the Kurgan in the church in the first film.The second time you get a sense of deja vu is when Kane kidnaps Connor's son, and then proceeds to drive around terrifying him by playing chicken with various vehicles. The exact same scene was in the first film, when the Kurgan kidnaps Connor's love interest and speeds through New York. However, any sense of danger in the scene in the third film is removed by the fact that all of the things Kane pretends to collide with are illusions, which cannot actually harm the occupants of the car.Connor and Kane fight, Connor kills Kane, and then wins the Prize again, at least until the next sequel Highlander: Endgame, which at least was trying to do something new. And even the effects of Connor's quickening (the process by which Immortals take the power of those they have killed) were just lifted from the first film and cleaned up a bit. It's just plain lazy film-making.Mario van Peebles makes for a rather camp and unthreatening villain as Kane, who you never believe Connor will have any difficulty in defeating. He does try in some places make his performance different from that of the Kurgan, but the script demands he attempts to mimic the first film's villain.Christopher Lambert just seems rather bored throughout the film, which isn't surprising as he contemplated walking off of Highlander II (which he made through gritted teeth). He probably only agreed to appear in this due to getting a rise and the prospect of some easy money. The other actors are rather forgettable.I sometimes persevere with a bad film if it makes me laugh. Highlander III did manage this, but only in a few bits. Most of the time it just bored me, and the only reason I didn't put it off was so I wouldn't ever want to waste more time watching it at a later date. It isn't really worth bothering with as such - the first film or Highlander: Endgame are better choices. Of course, if you have the boxset, then you already have it, so I'd advise you watch one of the other three films. They are all better than this tired cash-in.",

Instead it's Mako who plays the mentor role in the misty flashbacks that have become a trademark of the series. Where the original highlander was blast of action adventure this is an unwieldy lump of narrative that tries to fit in with the chronology of the series but never achieves it. Mario van Peebles is pretty laughable as the bad guy and no where near to matching the originals Kergan as a nemesis. There's some tacked on nonsense about illusion but basically its a re-hash (again) of the original.Christopher Lambert sleepwalks through his part and Deborah Unger looks nice but exists purely for a token sex scene and to get kidnapped and generally threatened.Don't waste your time on this, Highlander begins and ends with the original.4/10 - 'There can be only one' if only that were true!",

All Highlander stories are best when they interweave stories from the past and the current day. This movie does not do this well. Also, spoiler alert!!! Do not read further if you do not want to read the spoilers.The plot lines set in the present day in this movie are almost the same as the present day section of the first movie. In both movies, The evil immortal hires a prostitute, terrifies somebody by driving wildly, Connor falls in love, Connor warns the woman to stay away, etc Also this movie lacks enough action scenes. Mario Van Peebles does a nice job of the playing the bad guy, but he is not nearly as scary as the Kurgan. Christopher Lambert seems to be doing this for paycheck and looks like he is just going through the motions. The script has many holes in it and does not seem to make much sense even in the Highlander world much less the real world.",

The soundtrack is very nice, there was one song i really liked in the movie, i think it was BONNY PORTMORE. I am not sure but i think that was it. The story of Macleod is pretty sad. I think noone should live forever. I really liked Lambert. I would marry him if i were a woman =) Nice movie. Nice scenes. The villain (mario van peebles) is pretty evil and too FUNNY. I liked the scene where he is in the car with macleods son. It shows that you can do lots of funny things if you have supernatural powers. By the way can you tell me why heros should have sex at least for one time in these kind of movies??? I cant understand this. Why is having sex so important? i think people should grow up and dont give a damn to these kind of useless things. A man is still a man even if he does not sex. This just makes me sick. I think platonic love is more important than everything. Think about it.",

Remember the chinese man that got his head chopped off...and was still doing a maniac laugh? What was that?! And how the movie is set one minute in ancient Tibet, then in modern Japan, then in Scotland, then in 18th century France and finally in the USA? Okay, so the scenery shots of Scotlands mountains were nice and it really did set the scene. But there were alot of \"props\" in the movie that didn't fit in. For example, where on EARTH did the trampoline come from for one of the actors to jump on it and fly to the ceiling or something, where did the fire come from when the man and woman are kissing in the mountians in the middle of nowhere and there were a load of others that I won't mention. It was one of the craziest movie I've ever seen. It was a complete criminal waste of movie money. I've never seen the first 2 Highlanders, and I don't think I want to.",

To tell you the truth, I was actually surprised that not only was it not that bad....it was very enjoyable.Now, i know that if you read half the reviews before mine, you know the plot and that it is almost just like Part 1....well it aint true that EVERY third movie of a series has to be a HUGE story. I liked this because it was realistic in that sense.Good fighting scenes...almost as good as the first one. The girl in this movie is beyond hot...but not the best (Endgame has the title there). Kane was a good villain (although alot like Kurrigan) but still interesting and pretty funny at times. The movie does have its moments (the airport scene was good too)I ending where Connor is at his original sword is well done and the song that followed it was very touching as Connor says \"Its finally over\"...pretty sad.Ive never seen Highlander- Renegade (which is now the real version of Part 2) but here is what i think of the rest.Highlander- Awesome movie. Great Story, emotion, action....everything you want in a movie like this.Highlander 2: Didnt see it.Highlander 3: The Sorcerer- Good movie and sequel (even though it is alot like the first, its still enjoyable)Highlander- Endgame- Its OK but 3 was better. It has its moments though (like the Connor/Duncan fight scene was filled with emotion). The Villain is amazing too. Jacob Kell was the greatest villain of them all in my opinion.\nHighlander 3 wasnt great but its atleast good.",

Longer version: Many thought that Highlander 2 killed the franchise. It is for many an abomination and on worst of all time lists. Strangely they could make another movie but know they had to deliver. For me they made the absolute right decision to ignore that Highlander 2 even existed and play it safe by reusing Highlander 1 story, character (types) and themes. They of cause tried to make it different enough for camouflage reasons but it did not work well.  Another frequent complaint are the special effects. While not garbage they are nothing to write home about and did not age that well too. Also the magic or the uniqueness of the first movie is gone. It is not as impactful, interesting and enjoyable as the first movie. This sound maybe too negative. For itself it is watchable and I like the setting, Kane as villain and the new skills (Cant go into details because of spoilers). An improved version could have been a hit. The acting is O.K. Neither a failure or a masterpiece. The music is still good. Overall a step it the right direction but defiantly not a hit or masterpiece. Maybe it is worse than I think and the comparison to Highlander 2 made it look better than it really is.",
