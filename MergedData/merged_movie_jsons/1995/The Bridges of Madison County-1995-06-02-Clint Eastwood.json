            "content": "I admire the likes of Woody Allen, Chaplin and Clint Eastwood (just to name a few), who possess(ed) the chops to write, direct AND act. They're complete artists, and I wish I could be like that (I'll be already too happy if I can ever achieve my life passion of writing and directing, though, since my acting would be less convincing than Owen Wilson playing Hamlet). Even though Eastwood didn't write this (Richard LaGravenese did it beautifully, based on a novel by Robert James Waller), he does a good job in front of the camera while also directing this human encounter between a photographer (played by himself) and an Italian housewife (Meryl Streep, magnificent) in 1960s Iowa. Their four days together would change their lives forever. The premise doesn't sound too original, but Eastwood wonderfully captures all the raw emotions between these people, who seem throughly genuine, alive, and passionate. Lennie Niehaus' beautiful music score helps enhance the romantic atmosphere, and the slow pace is never a bore since it's necessary to make you live those brief but special moments with them. From westerns to female boxers to jazz musicians to war dramas, Clint Eastwood knows how to tell a good story, and \"The Bridges of Madison County\" ranks among his best. 10/10.",

            "content": "On the page \"The Bridges of Madison County\" often read like a reject from Mills and Boon and yet it was tremendously popular. People who normally wouldn't read this sort of thing were not only reading it but quoting it. You could say that for some people it held the kind of camp appeal that bad books sometimes do for the so-called intelligentsia. Personally, I am inclined to think that its tale of middle-aged romance struck a cord. It may not have been well-written but many people recognized in its two central characters a reflection of themselves. It spoke of a great passion and a great loss; a \"Brief Encounter\" for the nineties. Still, it never quite seemed like a vehicle for Clint Eastwood; (once upon a time you might have envisaged Arthur Hiller doing it), yet here it is, larger than life on the big screen and utterly lovely, utterly heart-breaking.Perhaps Eastwood chose to film it as a vehicle for himself. He wears the mantle of the ageing Lothario perfectly at an age when most romantic leads are played by much younger men, (or are simply non-existent), yet who blanched when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant were wooing Audrey Hepburn well into their old age. Admittedly Eastwood isn't entirely comfortable in this sort of role. He's not a versatile actor. His best performances have been as tortured losers or just old-fashioned tough guys but under his own direction he blossoms here. Of course, the 'romantic' in Eastwood has never been hard to find. You need look only to the scores he has composed. (He has written the main love theme here and his use of classic jazz standards by the likes of Dinah Washington and Johnny Hartman adds considerably to the film's beating heart).What is remarkable is that essentially Eastwood's film is really something of a chamber piece for two players. A few other characters flit into the frame but for most of the time there is no one on screen but Eastwood and co-star Meryl Streep and this is one of Streep's great performances. As Francesca, the woman who finds in Eastwood's photographer Robert the one great passion in her life albeit briefly and at a time when the likelihood of such a thing happening was remote indeed, Streep is extraordinary. Sometimes Streep can overwhelm a project; her versatility doesn't always work in favour of lesser material. But here she seems to have tapped quite effortlessly, not just into the consciousness of her character, but into her very soul as well. And if that sounds cheesy, let me assure you it isn't. Cheesiness isn't in Streep's vocabulary, even if it is in mine! Perhaps Eastwood was able to discern in Robert James Waller's novel the seeds of a great love story or perhaps he just felt he could bring his artistry to bear on some unlikely source material. Whatever, it's paid off. On screen \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is a great love story; there won't be a dry eye in the house.",

            "content": "Meryl Streep is absolutely astonishing. I forgot it was her ten seconds into the film. That opening breakfast scene where all of her story is written in her magnificent face. As an Italian I know there is no acting involved here. She IS Italian. She reminded me of Anna Magnani in \"Bellissima\" there is not a single false note. Clint Eastwood, clearly, dedicates the film to her and the results are pure magic. The film is based on an unreadable book- at least I couldn't get through it, in spite of the brevity of the volume - the film however, is bound to become a classic thanks to the powerful chemistry of the stars. If you love film,like I do, I recommend you to see it once and let yourself be taken away by the truths in Meryl's eyes then go again and take note. Look at every one of her moments, from how she closes the refrigerator door to her laughter. Look at her reaction when she discovers that Clint stopped at Bari, her home town, just because he thought the place was pretty. Look at her hands, her walk and then go back to her eyes. It's a treat of the first order. Clint, in front as well as behind the camera,does a miraculous job. I passionately recommend it, no matter how young you are.",

Meryl Streep in \"The Bridges Of Madison County\" is such a miracle to me. I never thought for a moment that she, no matter how wonderful an actress she is, could fool me. Meryl Streep could never be Italian. Well, there I was, thinking and pre-judging like people I detest. I was so wrong. Not just because she fooled me, although there is no fooling involved here. She won me over. I forgot she was Meryl Streep, the actress, and I lived Francesca's story to the fullest because, I suppose, that's the mystery of great acting, I was confronted by her sheer undiluted truth. The truth in her eyes in every one of her gestures. The truth on her brow. Her thinking, transparent. Clint Eastwood does the right thing putting the entire film at her service and placing himself as the foil to liberate that powerful latent side of Francesca. I though it was ironic and I'm not sure if was meant to be that a wonderful woman like Francesca will sacrifice, what could arguably be call the love of her life, for those children. The grown children's mediocrity was kind of shocking to me. Will the revelation of their mother's secret, reveal a latent, greater side to their natures. I hope so. Francesca deserved extraordinary children. Try no to miss this little miracle.",

            "content": "The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic masterpiece, but it's so incredibly heart wrenching, most people only want to see it once. I have a DVD copy in my collection, but the cellophane is still on it. It's a wonderful movie in every facet, and some-including yours truly-name it as legendary Meryl Streep's finest performance. Clint Eastwood wears two hats, and his thoughtful and sensitive directing makes it seem like you're watching someone's life unfold, rather than going to the movies.Richard LaGravenese's screenplay brings an entirely new meaning to the story, and if you run out and buy a copy of the original novel after watching the movie, you'll be severely disappointed. The book contains a love story between an unsatisfied housewife and a visiting photographer. The movie proves their sacrifice had meaning. The film starts out informing the audience that Meryl Streep has died and she wishes her ashes to be scattered over the bridges of Madison County, rather than to be laid to rest next to her husband. Her adult children, Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, are understandably confused, but when they come across a set of journals written by their mother, they learn of a brief love affair she had when they were children. Annie and Victor are struggling in their own lives, and learning more about their mother helps them navigate and learn. If you can believe it, the book doesn't include any of that! The housewife doesn't die, her children don't grow up, and she isn't able to continue to mother them beyond the grave. Where's the poignancy? Where are the final tears they could have wrung out of their readers? To me, the parallel storyline with the adult children is what makes this movie a tear-jerking classic.\nThere are so many beautiful scenes that have staying in my memory, as I'm sure they've stayed in yours, even though it's been over ten years since I've watched it. I remember how many Kleenexes I went through during each part of the movie, which is probably why I haven't broken open that cellophane. My heart breaks when Meryl presses a shaky hand to the car door, and although I'm not a mother myself, I appreciate her wonderful expression as she closes her heart before greeting her children.Getting past the tears, there's so much wonderful acting in this movie that makes you wonder how Meryl ever lost the Academy Award, and why Clint wasn't even nominated, since it's his finest hour as well. Perfectly cast as a drifter with dreams that have passed him by, he could have easily come across as either a sleazy Harold Hill-type who wants a fling with a grateful housewife, or an unrealistic romantic. He's neither, and because the love they share is mutual, the story works.If you've never seen it, you've got to pick the right moment to watch The Bridges of Madison County for the first time. Don't watch it after a breakup, and don't watch it when you're feeling blue. You'll need all your strength to get through it. But you'll be rewarded. You'll get to see two career-best performances in an indelible love story, and you'll find yourself wondering if Meryl Streep is secretly Italian and has hidden her accent in all her other movies.",

Meryl Streep plays an Italian living in rural America and she is out of this world. Her opening scenes at the breakfast table are staggeringly beautiful, it could have been a silent movie, we would've understood and live Francesca's story just by looking into Meryl's beautiful face. Every laugh, every move, every nuance is so Italian and so real that I went to look up her background to see if there was some Italian blood in her. Apparently not, but she reminded me of Anna Magnani and of my mother - she's Italian too, so I should know. Clint Eastwood's performance is tender, powerful and generous. I started going to the movies in the 70's and part of the fascination was to go and see movies with adults doing adult things, behaving and reacting to life the way adults do. \"Five Easy Pieces\" \"Coming Home\" \"Sophie's Choice\" and then the old great old ones from \"Sullivan's Travels\" to \"All About Eve\" As a side note I should inform the decision makers that on my second visit to the theater I took five kids with me, two 17 year old boys and three girls, 18, 16 and 16. They went back to see it a few days later with some of their contemporaries. The comment of one of the boys was: \"It made me think of things I don't usually think about\". He invited his mom to the movies to see \"Bridges of Madison County\" According to his mother, that was the first time ever, but, as it happens, not the last.",

            "content": "The image of Clint Eastwood, firmly ingrained in the minds of the movie-going public is that of a man of few words and lots of actions to back up what little words he does employ. So to see this multi-talented and complex man directing himself and starring in an old fashioned romantic story is a pleasant surprise. Made even more pleasant in how well it was done.The children of Meryl Streep are gathered for her funeral and are astonished at a request left by her not to be buried next to her husband and their father. Instead she wants to be cremated and her ashes thrown off a wooden bridge in the area and in the creek it runs over. Later on her grown children Annie Corley and Victor Slezak find a letter among their mother's effects and it's a lengthy one and she explains her reasons for this.One day back in the early sixties when the kids and husband Jim Haynie left for the state fair, National Geographic Photographer Clint Eastwood stops by and asks Streep for directions. He's in the area to photograph the picturesque Bridges Of Madison County. Meryl is attracted by the stranger and it takes awhile, but before long she realizes she's found the true love of her life.The issue of Meryl being Italian is there, but not overstated in the screenplay. She like thousands of others was a war bride brought over from Europe by GIs. There was a no fraternization policy that was enforced somewhat, but true love or true hormones obey no government edicts. A lot of these marriages worked. In fact Meryl's to Jim Haynie worked because no one found out about her indiscretion to Eastwood until after both of them died. She says herself that the transition from Italy to Iowa was a traumatic one, but she wanted to make it because she'd be going to America and a better life.Meryl Streep received one of her sixteen Academy Award nominations for this role, the only recognition the Academy gave to The Bridges Of Madison County. Sad too because Clint Eastwood who is a man always challenging himself showed that their could be a tender a romantic side to Dirty Harry Callahan. In fact while watching The Bridges Of Madison County I guarantee you won't once think of any of Clint's action heroes.Director Eastwood also exquisitely photographed the Iowa countryside on location in Winterset Iowa which already had its place in Hollywood lore as the birthplace of John Wayne. The Bridges Of Madison County is one of those tender romantic stories showing the fires of romance can still burn in people other than the young. But the film is for romantics of all ages.",

            "content": "When Francesca Johnson passes away, her grown children are puzzled to learn that she wishes to be cremated and her ashes scattered from a local bridge rather than being buried next to her husband. Their puzzlement turns to surprise and shock when they read their mother's secret journals and read about an affair she had had many years ago with a photographer who came to the area for a few days.I had seen this film many years ago in the cinema when it came out and had only average memories of it. With it coming onto TV recently, I wasn't sure if I'd bother because I had the idea in my head that this was a rubbish weepy but decided to go for it anyway. I am glad that I do not just make assumptions about films based on genre because my memory had tricked me in regards this film and in fact it was surprisingly good. I'm not generally a weepy fan but this is not what you think a weepy will be. Reading the plot summary and watching the film itself, it is clear how easily this could have fallen into sweeping sentiment and unbearable mush and it is to Eastwood's credit that it never does. Even as the plot sees the lovers falling into idealised romance, the film never does and it is the cool, calm direction that keeps it from being this way. Some will see this as 'excusing' the affair but I don't think it does - affairs happen because the grass is greener and that is just what this film does; it seems romantic and idyllic but that's because it is meant to be. I'm the last person to try and defend having affairs but I don't think that this film did this but I can understand why people would dislike it for doing this.Without the mush, what is left is a film that is refreshingly free of sentiment and is able to deliver a grown up romance that is genuinely touching. This is seen in the honest chemistry between Francesca and Robert; sometimes things like this happen - two people just click, nothing has to be massively wrong in the relationship for it to happen. The film avoids easy shots (like making the husband be a real idiot) and just tries to show us why these two fell for one another so quickly. It isn't perfect of course and it is still a weepy of sorts - some of the dialogue is a bit self-consciously 'deep' for my liking but generally it was an adult telling of an adult romance - no corny ending, no sweeping score or clich\u00e9d effort to pump the audience for sentiment, instead I found it genuine and, as cold hearted a b*stard as I am, I was moved by the film.I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and this film was a real pleasant surprise as it showed how able he is as a director and performer. I have already praised his work as director but he also turns in an unshowy and natural performance in the lead. Streep has never totally won me over and I often felt that doing an accent is not the same as giving a performance. Here her accent put me off at first but generally she is good and shows suitable restraint in depicting her character. She suffers a bit from having to deliver a narration that occasionally contains sentimental dialogue but she does well despite this. The support cast is OK but really contributions from Corley and Slezak are no more than distractions from the main show which is a collection of natural scenes between the two leads and no one else.Overall, I consider this film a reason to not just watch any specific genre of movie and reject films simply because 'those aren't my type of things'. I was pleasantly surprised by a film that is romantic without being sentimental or mushy; idealistic without being unrealistic; moving without being sickly. True it may not be everyone's idea of a great film (nothing goes bang and there are no car chases) but I liked it a lot more than I had expected and if you want to see an adult love story then you could do a lot worse than this.",

The following year, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Dustin Hoffman's wife, Joanna, in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\". She earned the Best Actress Award for \"Sophie's Choice\" (1982), and was nominated for another Oscar for her outstanding performance as real-life Karen Silkwood... In all, she has received 13 Academy Award nominations, the most recent for her supporting role opposite Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper in the fascinating film 'Adaptation.'In 'The Bridges of Madison County,' Streep stars as Francesca, a conventional wife of an Iowa farmer... Francesca cares for her family with all her heart, as she has done for years... She describes herself as \"happily married,\" but nevertheless falls easily into a chaste but tender affair with a charismatic wandering photographer on assignment for National Geographic magazine in the fall of 1965... Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) stops at Francesca's farm to ask for directions... While close-ups provide Streep's intimate thoughts, some women lost patience with her indecision and reticence...Francesca, although nervous by the attention of the courteous visitor, but guilty about being unfaithful to her passionless Iowa husband, finds out a mystical attraction for the top photographer who has come to Madison County to take pictures of the local covered bridges... Francesca was at home, alone, her husband and two children having gone for four days to the Illinois state fair...Francesca and Robert talk about their lives and their old dreams, and as their relationship grows, they both find themselves drawn to each other, falling deeply and immediately in love... Their true love strikes at the heart of everyone... 'In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once.'The suffocating rain sequence has to go down as one of the most poignant in cinematic history, beautifully complemented by a soundtrack resonating with a melancholic piece of blues and piano... Every performance in the movie is backed up by a truthful, believable script full of real, everyday people... The poignancy of each moment is underscored by an unforgettable choice of romantic melodies... The motion picture, nominated for the C\u00e9sar Awards in France, is another example of Eastwood's exceptional style as both a filmmaker and as an actor...As a filmmaker, Eastwood proves his comprehension of the secret of romance novels, showing sensuously, and sensitively the way people feel and think when they are really in love... As an actor, he is very convincing as the loner with much to share... Although his travels have taken him far across the 'other side of the world,' he still looks cleverly back on his life...His film gives us the passion between two lovers, but also life's compromises and regrets... It is a realistic portrait of a man and a woman who love the memories they share... It is a sensitive exploration of feelings which grows into something neither one can get free... It is an invitation to consider what might have been missed or lost in our life... Meryl Streep is heartbreaking as a lonely woman surrounded by family... We truly feel her pain and desperation... She fights with all the love, hope, frustration and responsibility... She is someone whose dreams of coming to America have not been fulfilled by the tedious reality of her life in Winterset, Iowa... Her busy life is filled with details but has nothing that truly excites her anymore... She is forever altered by a chance encounter.. Her emotional range is enormous and her laughter is as charged with energy as her tears... But you never doubt the truth of what she's feeling... As the pair reveal their own lives through each other, a connection is made, and in just four fateful days, they find one another and commit themselves to each other for a lifetime even though they remain apart...We all dream of the chance meeting, that particular time when we really feel we are enjoying life... But love never obey our expectations... Robert and Francesca, couldn't stay together physically, but their love was so strong that lasted forever as Francesca grew old on the farm and Robert traveled the world... Women love romanticism and never seem to get enough... And true love is possible, even in the scope of a life of compromise, and in the middle of nowhere, on the far side of any age...",

            "content": "Closeup on a mailbox: Mr. and Mrs. Richard Johnson. Behind it, a dusty road leading through green fields, a minivan coming towards the camera and a pan over towards an isolated farmhouse. It's the present, and Michael and Carolyn have come to settle some issues regarding their mother's estate. It seems that their mother wanted her ashes scattered from a nearby covered bridge, which startles her two grown kids, particularly the seemingly very conservative and religious Michael. Turns out that Francesca had her reasons, as they find out when they open her cedar chest and turn to the diaries contained within...Late summer 1965, and Francesca, an Iowa housewife in her mid-40s is seeing her husband and kids off to the Illinois State Fair. They'll be gone for 5 days and she'll have little to do but be bored in a different way than she usually is, until the arrival the next morning of a lost National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Kincaid is on assignment to photograph the covered bridges that the county is famed for, and Francesca tries to tell him the way to the Roseman bridge but quickly decides to show him the way personally instead. As they drive towards the bridge and make small talk, they seem uneasy at first - but when Robert mentions Francesca's accent, and she finds that he has visited the town where she grew up in Italy, something starts to click. He reaches for a cigarette from the glove compartment and brushes her leg...later he picks flowers for her....they have the same favorite radio station, playing blues and jazz. Francesca starts to see something special, exotic....Robert sees someone warm and real, centered but more than the simple housewife that she's let herself become.So begins four days of falling in love, four days of uncertainty, secretive glances, shyness turning to boldness, feelings long-buried in both reawakened and examined by two people smart enough to know right away how problematic an affair can be, yet willing to cast aside the doubts and damn the consequences. For now. The brilliance of The Bridges of Madison County isn't in any kind of originality, and it isn't in the bits of Waller's strained prose that occasionally leech through LaGravenese's generally excellent screenplay; it isn't in Streep's accent, which I know some have problems with but which I barely even notice at this point; and it isn't in the framing story, which again has grown on me over time but is certainly not all that interesting itself. What makes the film magical is the chemistry, the feeling of absolute rightness between the two leads, and the slow building towards an inevitable yet still heartbreaking decision.Clint Eastwood certainly must have seemed an odd choice to take on this film, which he co-produced and co-wrote the elegiac \"Doe Eyes\" theme for in addition to directing and starring - even to me, a big fan already at the time, it seemed odd. Robert Redford seemed to be everybody's idea of Kincaid, and Steven Spielberg got mentioned often as a possible director, but I doubt many people will have problems after they see the film. Eastwood's Robert is a sensitive guy, but he's not schmaltzy, a poetic man but not pretentious about it, and a man clearly as unsure about the concept of love and the kind of risk he puts himself into as the married Francesca. He's a traveler and a loner, but deep down there's something missing, something we can feel almost from the beginning, something seen in the long gaze out the window near the end, and as he stands in the rain, waiting and hoping, at the film's emotional climax. And Eastwood the director keeps things from getting out of hand sentimentally until the last half hour, when both he and the audience know it's time for the tears to flow.But as good as Clint is - and this is surely one of his two or three best performances - Meryl Streep is just a marvel here. Overlook the accent - whether you like it or not, it really isn't terribly important here - and you see a less mannered, more natural performance than she's given anywhere else. She mentions a couple of times in the making-of piece that accompanies the film on DVD that she was uncertain at first of Eastwood's quick shooting style, but it does wonders for her, giving a spontaneity that she really needed for the role. So much of the film relies on us believing that these are two hesitant, uncertain people with a yearning that at first has no direction - it can't seem studied, and it doesn't. And for a film that is set mostly in a kitchen and around barn-like red covered bridges, there's an excitement and intensity that can't be matched in most romances shot under the Eiffel Tower or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. The technical aspects - Jack N. Green's lovely September-October photography and the wonderful Eastwood-chosen musical mixture of Johnny Hartman and Dinah Washington, among others - are just about perfect as well.What the film ultimately builds to - and much of it is on Streep's shoulders - is a powerful examination of regret and loss and a determination that there are no perfect choices in life, only choices that involve different kinds of sacrifices. The film doesn't comment on the rightness or wrongness of her adultery, but Francesca lets her kids know that whatever she's done, she's not going to beat herself up over it - and neither should they. At the end, we know that whatever choice she made would have been difficult, would have involved hurting herself and others; there's no easy answer, only a bit of hope for the next generation, as they at least have come to accept and understand, and Francesca's ashes scatter on the wind....",

So a film of the book 'The Bridges of Madison County' did not fill me with joy and pleasureable anticpation.Yet Clint Eastwood has waved a magic wand, and worked wonders on the lack lustre source material, by pairing it down to produce a beautiful, warm film with only one real flaw (more on that later)The film's overwhelming main strength is the casting of Meryl Streep. As Francesca she dissolves into the role - at times her gestures and dialogue seem so natural and unforced it is as if Eastwood had installed a fly-on-the-wall camera into the house of a real Iowan housewife. She lifts the film - which does centre on themes which could appear trite in the wrong hands - to the level of profound piece of art. Her selflessness and devotion to her family, and tortured sense of divided loyalites are presented so powerfully, and so plausibly, that the final scene in the car at the end (those who've seen it will recall immediately what I mean) pulls at your emotions so hard you'd swear it was you who was making the decision. I defy anyone with a pulse not to shed copious amounts of tears at this point --- you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved on some level by this great, great performance.Clint Eastwood provides good, solid support in the sense that he doesn't overact, and allows Meryl to become the heart of the film. This is a wise decision - part of the terrible weakness of the book was its dependence upon the inane thoughts and ramblings of Robert Kincaid. The film is beautifully directed, beautifully photograhed and beautifully scored - the radio tunes and the non-diegetic Bridges Love theme really enhance the romantic, lush tone and mood of the film.My only problem is with the misguided decision to cast Francesca's older children and flash back periodically to them reading through their Mother's journals. The acting in these parts is mediocre at best, and they detract from the elegance and poignant mastery of Meryl Streep's central performance. The ashes scene at the end is - I feel - necessary for closure, but the rest of the scenes featuring the chldren should have been scrapped. The Francesca and Robert sections stand alone and require no interruption - these other segments cheapen the mastery of Meryl.Above all, this is a film which (on paper) can be dismissed as pure soap opera. But it transcends these potentially trite themes to make a universal story of love, selflessness, devotion and choice, that speaks eloquently to the viewer, no matter what your age or experience. It's a truly heartbreaking tale of transitory experience and the power of memory. It will make you think about your own life, and about your closest family members and relationships.And its finest quality has to be the magic of Meryl Streep who proves, yet again, why she is uniquely the best actress we have ever had. As Clint Eastwood said about casting this role: 'I only made one phonecall'. He knew as you will too - no other actress could have brought so much depth, warmth, beauty, charisma and humanity to this character. As a humble film lover, it's all I can do to applaud her from the depths of my heart. Bravo, Queen Meryl!",

This is a quiet movie about someone who has given up her life for her family. She has left her European home to be with her husband. He is a good man but really pretty dull. Her kids are spoiled and inconsiderate. When Kincaid shows up, he offers her four days to ponder the rest of her life. Some criticize the morality of it. The movie is so well paced and so gentle, that the relationships between the characters come softly in the night. The subtly facial expressions and nuances show us what real pros can do. It's so nice to see Eastwood grow better all the time, not just Rawhide or Dirty Harry (not that there is anything wrong), but a fine, confident performance of a lonely man who finds his four days as well. The worlds of the two characters are so different yet they become kindred spirits and lovers. I appreciated that at no time was there a possibility that they would be caught red-handed.

There is however the moral dilemma of a wife cheating on her husband and potentially throwing away an entire life that came before. The smartly written screenplay by Richard LaGravenese is skillfully handled by director Eastwood, juggling duties on both sides of the camera in a way that challenges his tough guy persona in the type of films he's more generally recognized for. The story arc is bookended by the adult children of Francesca Johnson (Streep) questioning her last will and testament and ultimately, the secret she bore for the remainder of her life following a four day affair with photographer Richard Kincaid (Eastwood), while on assignment in Madison County, Iowa. There pervades in the story the inevitable conflict that must be faced when Francesca's family eventually returns from their state fair sojourn, giving rise to a fateful decision that will reverberate for the remainder of their days. The tear inducing scene of Kincaid standing in the rain as Francesca tries to suppress her sorrow is one of the most heartfelt sequences one might encounter in film, carrying with it a finality that threatens to sentence it's participants to lives of melancholy. Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is a high water mark in the careers of both of it's principals, and a movie not to be missed.",

            "content": "While I don't condone infidelity, affairs can make for great cinema. However, not in this movie despite featuring two stars, Meryl Steep and Clint Eastwood, whose talents are wasted here. Streep's at times compelling performance is expended on a film which manipulates viewer emotions so they don't see this affair for what it is. It shouldn't be considered a great love story just because it's the wife who is cheating on the husband, not the reverse. It is not poignant, sensitive, and romantic (as often described) but instead involves boredom, lust, and naive schoolgirl thinking far more than genuine love. Yes, it does have wonderful cinematography but viewers shouldn't confuse the beauty of the Iowa scenery as indicating that this illicit relationship was in any way beautiful. When you get past the acting and the scenery...Here we have a housewife, Francesca, longing to travel and bored with her faithful, hard working, and decent but dull farmer husband and unexciting country life. While her husband is off at the State Fair with their teenage children, she has an affair with a stranger who chances her way, a ruggedly handsome, world traveling photographer named Robert. She foolishly concludes, after a few conversations and sexual encounters (some of which occur in the marital bed she shares with her husband, not exactly endearing), that her new man, a charismatic wanderer, is her true love. Of course her husband 'doesn't understand her' but her lover, who has known her for a few days, is her soul mate who understands her completely. (Would viewers be as sympathetic to a man whose wife didn't understand him, who had an affair because he suddenly found his soul mate and contemplated leaving his family so he could go off with his lover to follow his dreams???) From the onset Francesca is miserable living in a house in the middle of nowhere but she has only herself to blame. Wasn't she aware when she married him that her husband was a farmer, that they would be living in the country?? There would have been hobbies and interests she could have pursued, even living in the country, where she might have found some degree of fulfillment and which wouldn't have upset her husband, especially given that her children were getting older all the time so likely to permit her more freedom. Francesca should have discussed her needs, wants, and dreams WITH HER HUSBAND! Admittedly he wasn't exactly sensitive but neither did he appear to be a monster who would have cared nothing about his wife's unhappiness, had she made him aware of the full extent of it. She never really made much effort to open her heart up to him. While she did remain with her family, playing the self sacrificing martyr and suffering for years in silence are not admirable, IMO. She stoically 'did her duty' but never attempted to make anything better of her marriage.Who is to say that if she had gone off with Robert, he wouldn't have dumped her when she started to bore him? Having one failed marriage behind him and a history of reluctance to commit, he didn't come across to me as a very promising life partner. If Robert had really loved Francesca, he would have thought of her best interests instead of selfishly encouraging her to abandon her children. The dancing scene where they end up in bed comes across as a clich\u00e9 seduction, nothing original or memorable. The truck scene in the rain is supposedly so moving but how can anyone sympathize with a woman even considering leaving her teenage children for her lover of four days? Unwisely, Francesca chooses to write a tell-all journal about the affair to be read by her adult children after her death, requesting that her ashes be scattered off a particular covered bridge to join her lover's ashes. I found this neither romantic nor touching but selfish and pointless, serving only to upset and potentially hurt her adult children. If she and Robert genuinely had this great love, surely it wouldn't have required some grand romantic mingling of their ashes off that bridge to prove it. Of course these children, a rather uninspiring pair who contributed nothing positive to this movie, quickly become understanding and are not (as would be more believable) devastated about their mother's infidelity and especially learning that their father wasn't her true love. In fact, we're to believe this revelation actually helped them sort out their own romantic messes. The modern Hollywood message, I guess.Had she not chosen to risk hurting her children with her after-death revelations, I might have felt some sympathy for Francesca wasting so much of her life based on four days of the romantic, exciting, passionate early phase of a new relationship, foolishly pining for a man who likely would have brought her unhappiness even if she had been free.Those who want a truly moving film about an affair should watch the 1945 Brief Encounter. It has class. Much the same idea -- bored middle-aged housewife has short term liaison with exciting new man but unlike this film, the wife realizes what she does have in her husband and, contrary to the clich\u00e9 about not being understood, relates her tale as though addressing her husband, the only person in the world who would understand. It perfectly contrasts committed married love versus the excitement of a new romance. And its heroine, a very sympathetic character, would NEVER have deliberately hurt her adult children for such a pointless whim as the ashes. Alas, Bridges is no Brief Encounter.",

Streep of course SHINES in her lead role as the unhappy, unsatisfied, unappreciated wife who meets Clint Eastwood while her husband is away and falls deeply in love. The performances given by Eastwood and Streep are two of the best acting performances I've ever seen in film. The accent, the frustration, the love, and the raw emotion is all captured unbelievably well by Meryl Streep. And Clint Eastwood tackles the drifter in love role well, it doesn't even seem like he's trying, it just feels so natural and real that it's hard to believe he's an actor playing a part. The chemistry is undeniably electric! Very natural romantic chemistry combined with their acting is really what makes this movie work so well. The writing is so well done too, it reaches out and grabs you, it really makes you feel like you're in the story. There are some movies that you feel they're excluding the audience, but this one really makes you feel so hard for these characters, it will matter to you what happens to them. I really liked the way they did two separate stories two, one in current day and the other in the past. Sort of reminded me of the notebook in a way. I love this film for the simple reason that it makes you feel things that just warms you up, you will feel good watching this.

This is probably down to the competent directing from Eastwood, and the exceptional acting ability of Streep, which she executes without much effort - at least it appears that way! Streep's character, Francesca, who is somewhat of a dreamer, was in search of an illusionary life, which was unobtainable, mainly because it only existed inside her head of fantasies. Indeed, the fantasy of the romance is only her interpretation of it via her journals. In reality, her romantic interlude would have turned sour because it would not live up to her expectations in everyday life, just as her idea of the American way of life didn't, being married to an ordinary farming lad.As an Italian homemaker, Francesca is stereotyped from the start as the opera loving romantic, cooking breakfast for a largely unappreciative family in a mundane world, which she once viewed through rose tinted spectacles, whilst daydreaming back home in Italy.The film's message is that romance can be deceptive, in that it misleads women into mundane lives that bear no reality to what they have been taught about it. But, women who crave romance, should demand it, and not be afraid to ask for it, or to admit to liking it for that matter. This is what Francesca should have done with her husband.",

            "content": "SpoilersThe challenge in making The Bridges of Madison County is to convince the audience that spending four days together out of their entire lives, a man and a woman can be so deeply in love that they, separately, wanted their cremated ashes to be spread over the bridge where they first met.Over the 135 minutes of this movie (which by the way never felt too long to this viewer) director Client Eastwood goes about this formidable task. (I have not read the book so these comments are confined solely to the movie). It's a normal, contended if not outrageously happy family, with nearly-grown-up kids, and a cordial if a little stagnant marriage, when Francesca (Meryl Streep) faces the prospect of spending four days by herself in the farm house when the family goes to a country fair. In comes globe-trotting loner National Geographic photographer Robert (Clint Eastwood), a little lost in search of a covered bridge he is hoping to shoot. In a way, there is a little similarity to Before Sunrise, in that two complete strangers in a chance meeting suddenly click, realizing how much they enjoy each other's company and conversation, and carry on to develop a deep relationship within a very limited time. Obviously, there is a big difference, that would put TBOMC more in the category of Interlude (1968) (which, by the way, I consider to be the best in the 'brief encounter' genre). But somehow, I tend to associate it more with Before Sunrise.Upon showing Robert the bridge, Francesca is actually a little bit annoyed that right away, this man become so absorbed with it that he seems to have forgotten about her. Streep portrayed that feeling beautifully, particularly in the tone of her voice, when she says something to the effect of 'I can wait, I have time', more to herself than to Robert. But then, annoyance becomes attraction, as we recall the general belief (albeit somewhat male-centered) that to a woman, a man is most attractive when he is fully absorbed in his work. The relationship develops in a wonderfully relaxed pace, with dropping her off home, 'care to come in for a coffee?', 'would you like to stay for dinner?'\u0085\u0085..all nice and friendly until Robert asks one question too many, although quite innocently, 'ever thought of leaving your husband?' Even with profuse apologies, the parting was a little shadowed.Calming down, Francesca reflects that she might have reacted too strongly, drives to the bridge in darkness and leaves a note to invite Robert back to dinner the following day. After seeing the note, Robert calls to accept the invitation, but asks Francesca to join him at the bridge at twilight as he wants to do some work there first. They then separately carry on with the day, Francesca going to buy a new dress for the occasion while Robert goes about with his business. But then, at lunch, he witnesses how a woman known to be having an affair is received in the restaurant (this is one of those small communities where everybody knows what everybody else is doing). Concerned that being seen with him might compromise Francesca, he calls her to give her the opportunity to back out. She seems unperturbed, they meet at the bridge, nothing untoward happens. As Robert continues to handle their relationship in a most considerate and gentlemanly manner, Francesca's attraction to him deepens. We see how she is erotically aroused as she baths in the tub where Robert has just showered, and finally puts on her alluring new dress and comes down to the kitchen, looking like an entirely different person from the earthy country housewife she has been. The spark that sets the whole thing on fire is a call from a neighbour, simply to ask how she has been managing with the family away. As the phone is on the wall right behind where Robert is sitting, Francesca's hand comes gently down to rest on Robert's shoulder as she speaks, and he responds by putting his hand over hers. The rest is history, so to speak. They spend their third day together, a day very much reminiscent of 'interlude'. Cold reality hits on the morning of the fourth and last day and Francesca is that close to running away with Robert. We have seen how Francesca is attracted to Robert, first by his dedication and talents, then by his gentlemanly consideration and kindness. What is less convincing is the feelings on Robert's part. Indeed, Francesca has asked the same question, that since Roberts has readily admitted that he has close women friends in various cities, what makes Francesca in Madison County any different? To be fair, Eastwood's acting has contributed much towards making Robert's feelings towards Francesca convincing. Ultimately, it's up to the audience whether they want to be convinced or not.TBOMC had one Oscar nomination, Streep's (which was one of her 13 Oscar acting nominations, 10 lead and 3 supporting, in her career so far).

One Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood).As much as I don't like this movie, I must at least admire what Eastwood has managed to achieve with it as its director, given the source material, which is basically just housewife literature, in the most derogatory meaning of the term. But with Eastwood at its helm, it transforms into something almost bearable. It is unhurried, yet never slow. The characters feel like actual three-dimensional people, and not just props meant to fuel our fantasies. The sets are nice, the dialogues feel natural and if only the story had even the slightest bit of substance, this could have been something. Plus both Eastwood and Streep are phenomenal actors.Alas, the story is garbage. I can see Eastwood trying to tell something about the loneliness of house wives, or the loneliness of a traveler. You can see his attempt to build passion where in the book there's only lust. But, the fact remains, that this is simply a movie about an affair. The movie tries to hang bells and other assorted decorations to hide the fact, but it fails. And it's dull to boot.

Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.",

The whole movie is completely enjoyable. What I mean by this, is that the creators took the time to introduce the characters to us without hurry, which helps us to become more involved with them later.IMDb suggests to its reviewers to compare titles with similar ones. In this aspect I want to say that I think (as many persons do) that this is one of the best romantic dramas of all time. I want to say too that it is both my favorite Meryl Streep and my favorite Clint Eastwood movie so far. IMDb also suggest reviewers to recommend similar titles to their readers; in that sense my second favorite Meryl Streep movie is \"Kramer vs Kramer\" and my second favorite Clint Eastwood movie is \"Gran Torino\" and I am not sure if the third one is \"Million Dollar Baby\" or \"The Unforgiven\". Sorry, I still have no idea about which is my third favorite Meryl Streep movie, too many movies too different from each other to choose from.OK, about THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. Maybe its beauty comes from making an extraordinary love story happen to \"almost\" ordinary people. He is a photographer for National Geographic and she is and Italian immigrant born in Bari that lives in the county of Madison, in Iowa, USA. She is home alone while her family is away and he happens to arrive to her town to take pictures of the great bridges and landscapes. The story is actually told by the sons of Francesca (the Meryl Streep's character) when they find a letter let for them by her telling them their story. Its a narrative arc that makes you wonder how much people maybe YOU have met in life without really knowing them and their motivations for living. At the moment of making this review, The bridges of Madison County is not included in the IMDb top 100 greatest movies of all time but I really believe it deserves a place there.Thanks for reading.IMDb Review by David del Real.

My favorite part of the movie was when Robert was leaving and the two cars were staying at the lamps one behind the other...it was a very touching scene,I think.

            "content": "Romance is probably the most difficult genre to a director or screenwriter could write in any segment of the art. Being a genre all exhausted and always repeated clich\u00e9s, the film always runs the risk of hearing comments like: \"It's just more of the same\", or \"Only women even like it.\" It is precisely this restriction which ultimately hurts most because men even being in the 21st century, even if you like it, will hardly admit that thrilled to see a romance. Yet there are novels that stand out from the others and always end up bringing news or a different approach that has already been shown, and great merit is the script.Based on the book by Robert James Waller, the screenplay by Richard LaGravenese, the same who wrote The Little Princess (1995), brings a mature love and sensitive as rarely seen in cinemas. After the death of Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) - an Italian Bari that many years ago fell in love and married Richard and settled on a farm in Iowa in the United States - their children discover, via a diary that mother had a quick and intense extramarital affair with a National Geographic photographer. In the summer of 1965, while her husband and children are traveling, Francesca gets an unexpected visit from photojournalist Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). It asks for information about the covered bridges of Madison, which should shoot for the magazine where she works. She tries to explain the way he does not understand, and she offers to go along, but gets involved with Kincaid. The novel is as intense as fast: only lasts four days, when the children and her husband returned from the trip. When the children discover the secret love's late mother, come to notice that ever noticed the sad life that her mother wore, and question their own weddings.LaGravenese writes using the flashback, and what could break the pace of the narrative, in this case only helps to create a second sub-plot centered on today and after reading the diary, begins to suffer influences occurred in 1965. The romance of the mother ends up having an important connection with the relationship of the children of Francesca. The writer has not hit at rush events, giving an exact idea of how those four days of 65 were filled and how their relationship was built. In a secluded location, realized in the simplest gestures, bumps and accidental touches, the desire for one another growing increasingly. Of course, at first sight we condemn adultery, but gradually the viewer will understand that was not something previously thought, or easy to do. We will see that a much larger force involves the characters. As the characters say at one point, is something that comes only once in life. Many people spend their lives trying to feel something of that magnitude and fail. Robert says: \"That sure only happens once in a lifetime.\"Clint Eastwood, also marked for his roles in Westerns as an actor, gives his first sign of sensitivity as a director, knowing show reactions from children to go reading the journal left by his mother. The child has a reproachful look, as the daughter prefers to read everything before anything. It is precisely this that brings the audience the story. Even reprehensible act of betrayal, we abhor the beginning, we are curious to find out what happened in those four days when lovers live intensely the full arc of a relationship: empathy, attraction, desire, passion, anxiety, suspiciousness, dream and reality.Eastwood also right in ambiance. Exploring the beauty of the local landscape with its plans to air out the farms and plantations of the region photographed by Jack N. Green, the director delivers a charming and poetic film telling the story of the love between Francesca and Robert in a bucolic location, isolated, giving the idea that the two were there, no one around, just loving. All this reinforces when Robert says at the end of the film: \"When I think of why photographers the only reason that comes to mind is that I spent my life trying to get here. Seems to me that all I did today was to get you \". The bridges of Madison also represent a symbol of that love, considering that is the main reason for Robert to get to that remote location, and can also be seen as the possibility of Francesca follow another path in life to find true love. Just as the bridges, the cross represents the sacrifice of Francesca Francesca made by the end of the projection.The art direction and costumes also show the house well simple within the United States and help the viewer to understand the time the movie takes place and the motivations and fears of Francesca, at a time to leave her husband and children was against everything that society imposes.Eastwood enhances their sensitivity in some special scenes. The moment you answer the phone while Francesca arranges his collar of her lover, leaving him surprised with the act. Another moment is when Francesca and Robert dancing passionately to the radio. Or showing anxiety and insecurity to buy her a new dress, which she later reveal in a letter that she never had loaned to his daughter because he considered him her \"dress\". There is also the moment when Francesca says Robert positioning your camera gear as she observes the span of the bridge. But one can not but mention this movie without remembering the late splendid. Robert leaves his car in the rain and looks Francesca last standing in the rain, and she even wanting to accompany him, implies that should stand beside her husband and children. He then outlines a smile and back to your car.All this staged with gestures. Following, Francesca and her husband stop the car behind the car of the photographer. The signal opens and the car does not come out the front. Francesca's husband begins to get impatient while the photographer hangs a gift that won the housewife in the rearview mirror. Francesca, with her hand on the door, resists hard not to leave the car.Another decisive factor and exciting, especially in the last twenty minutes of the film, the soundtrack is Lennie Niehaus, who had worked with Eastwood in Unforgiven (1992). The theme song \"The Bridges Of Madison County\" is one of the most exciting, sensitive and romantic that cinema has ever produced and certainly will bring tears to most viewers in several moments of the film. However, Niehaus avoids becoming repetitive track, using the songs that play on the radio to pack the novel. The tone of the track only accentuates the melancholy precisely contained in the script.Clint Eastwood also plays Robert, effectively the feeling grows that the photographer (\"... I do not know if I can squeeze a lifetime between now and Friday\") when Francesca says he tries to learn more about the life of the photographer). Not surprisingly, as an actor, in general, Eastwood is a great director, but here he gets a good and believable interpretation. Meryl Streep, who creates a tragic character, demonstrating competence Francesca's struggle to resist that passion. The actress creates an Italian accent in his proper English, without exaggeration. It is interesting to see at the beginning when she is with Richard and the children at the table, when we noticed her distress, conformism and apathy compared to your daily routine without the same passion from the beginning of the marriage and the children have grown more than give due Maternal. With the arrival of Robert, she will gradually dropping, and will creating a unique intimacy with him. Streep spends wisely insecurity, anxiety, passion rising, certain feelings and internal social conflict and to pursue a new life. His performance consists of details of gestures, accent and actress is one that can pass all the angst, passion and suffering by the look, as in the scene in which resists opening the car door, and then tells her husband that needs a moment, as she cried in the car. His Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe is no less than deserved.The Bridges of Madison County is a touching, mature and inspiring movie. Makes us believe that we are destined to someone else, or that we spend a lifetime looking for you. Ideal to accompany his girlfriend (o). Makes us believe in true love, the overwhelming passion and that love is often, as in life, full of sacrifices. Great classic contemporary romance.",

It consists of two people meeting, getting acquainted, discovering something profound and then forced to make decisions that'll determine the rest of their lives, as well as the consequences for those linked to them.Some questions addressed include: What if you're married and you meet someone you genuinely romantically love? What if you're single and you meet a married person you profoundly love? How far do you (or can you) wisely take the relationship? What about others who would be negatively affected by pursuing the relationship?These are all honest questions that most people have to consider at one time or another in their lives. The movie's not corrupt for asking them or featuring a certain questionable act any more than the story of David & Bathsheba makes the Bible corrupt (or, arguably worse, the story of Judah & Tamar).One character is too loose with morals, which he justifies by criticizing all the \"borders\" in life. But there are boundaries everywhere: National, state, county, city, school, government, business, social and... marital. The bottom line is: You're either married or you're not. If you're married that means you have a committed lifelong covenant with your spouse. That's what taking vows is all about. The movie tries to have its cake and eat it too by supporting such loyalty while flirting with the temptation to discard it in the name of true love. regardless, the picture smacks of real life, real people, real (hard) decisions and is very well done, which is to be expected with Eastwood at the helm.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Winterset & Adel, Iowa.GRADE: A-",

            "content": "Based on the book of the same name, this romantic drama begins at the present time, when the son and daughter of Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), come home to Madison County, Iowa, to bury their mother. They learn that in 1965 their mother had a four day love affair, with National Geographic Photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood). They find their mother's three volume journal that she wrote shortly after the affair. The journal explains the affair, the reason for her actions, and the way she still felt for them and their father. The journal begins at the point when the father and the children go away on an excursion and, during that time she meets Kincaid. It also talks about the 25 years since then, and if the two ever kept in touch.The film is very melodic in its approach towards the two main characters and the act of committing adultery. You find yourself thinking about the delicate nature of love and betrayal. Is it wrong or is it right? You are as confused as the two lovers are and that is what Eastwood wanted to do. Eastwood's directing is very good. Streep's portrayal is fantastic. Eastwood did it again. As he did in Unforgiven (1990). His directing was very good, but his acting is a little distant from the audience and I saw a few editing mistakes.My final word on this film however is, it is very good. It is something that most people of the nineties should see. It approaches a problem that is widespread today and takes that problem into a confused dream-scape world and tries to correct the mistakes that many human beings have made. The film is love all the way, without glorifying the act of adultery. The message is clear and I only hope that some people do not see this as an excuse to cheat on a loved one.9.2 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB",

Now I have finally caught up, and will easy rank it as one of the best movies Clint has starred in. Nevermind the plot. This is a movie which will devide viewers both when you watch it, and based on your age. It's all about opportunities and dreams, the consequence of following a dream. It's about prejustice, specially in a small, gossippy town. There's a housewife who gets treated like shit by everyone after an affair. What we, the audience, don't get to know, is WHY did she have it. Could it had been an abusive husband? Maybe? Is it right or wrong? Bridges is a beautiful, little love story spawn over only 4 days. The forbidden love between Fransesca (Meryl Streep) and Frank (Clint Eastwood), which isnt planned, it just happens organic. It never bails out for an easy solution, \"it's adultery, and adultery is wrong\". Fransesca is happy enough in her marriage, and have 2 kids who soon is old enough to move out. So what to do? There's no right answer, and the movie embraces it. A very impressive, adult movie from Eastwood, who clearly has left the big action now to Arnold, Stallone & co. Both actors are terrific, have perfect chemistry. My only complaint is Meryl Streep's \"Italian\" accent, which sounds oddly enough stronger the older she gets in the movie.",

What follows is a jump back to the 1960s, when an Iowa farm wife (Meryl Streep) meets and falls in love with a roving photographer for \"National Geographic\", Robert (Clint Eastwood). There you see how the pair meet and their very, very brief affair that lasted only a few short days.As for Francesca's grown children, at first they are horrified but over time they seem to think it was cool that their mother had this hidden life. The above quote is spoken by the daughter in \"The Bridges of Madison County\". It's referring to her mother's affair with a relative stranger. Perhaps I am overly moralistic and judgmental, but to me this DOES make her mother a bad person...though it would not seem to be so by Hollywood standards. And, to me, this is the fundamental problem with the film. While it's artfully acted, gorgeously made and directed...ultimately it's a film that romanticizes adultery. If the lady's husband had been physically abusive or evil, perhaps you could understand her actions...but his biggest crime is he was dull...and the wife never seemed to tell him she wasn't satisfied. You'd think she'd owe it to the guy or perhaps ask for a divorce. To me, that makes this a film that is tough to enjoy...as I felt bad for the husband...as I would if my wife went off and had an affair with someone else. And, I would sure hope my wife would feel the same way about this film and its message about a 'nice' affair.",

They know it's a romantic drama and don't even need to see it, they are already convinced that they won't like it. And yet, if only they took the time to give it a try, they might be surprised by it. I know I was, so why shouldn't others have the same feelings about it.The movie tells the story of the National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) and the housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) whose paths cross in the sixties. While her husband and children are away at the Iowa state fair in the summer of 1965, Kincaid asks Francesca for directions to the Rosamunde Bridge. He tells her that he's in the region to photograph the bridges for his famous employer. She agrees to show him to the bridges and that's how their four day romance starts. After these four days, Kincaid leaves and Francesca is left behind with her mixed feelings of grieve for a lost love and happiness for her family that has returned. Not able to tell anybody what has happened to her, she has written it all down in a diary that now, after her death has been found by her children. In that diary she asks them not to bury her next to her deceased husband, but to scatter her cremated remains off Rosamunde Bridge, just like happened with Kincaid, after he died...With this movie Clint Eastwood proves to be a good director who is able to do a lot more than to act in Westerns. In fact, this should have been his second masterpiece (Unforgiven was his first one, no doubt about that), but in my opinion he made one small, but fatal mistake. The fact that he keeps returning to Francesca's adult children reading the diary, takes away a lot of the magic. If they had only been in the movie in the beginning and at the end, it would have been a lot better, because they aren't the real stars of this movie. The only real stars are Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, who both did an excellent job in this movie. Their acting feels so natural that it almost is like they aren't acting at all. The chemistry between the two is unbelievable and pure. I've rarely seen such beautiful moments of passion in a Hollywood production and I certainly didn't expect to get it from Clint Eastwood.Overall this movie is a pleasant surprise. Normally I'm not a great fan of romantic drama's but I will never reject a movie, just because it belongs to a certain genre either. It felt real without being all too sentimental, it was moving without being corny. This is really a very nice movie that everybody should give a try. I'm sure many will say it isn't good, just because there aren't any car chases or big explosions in it, but for all those who are looking for an adult love story, this is definitely worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10.",

He writes about the casting of Francesca and says very succinctly \"I made only one call.\" My only reason for giving a 9 is that I never wanted the movie to end which it unfortunately does after 135 minutes.It's no wonder that Streep has been time and again acclaimed as the greatest ever ,this despite the presence of Robert De Niro,Jack Nicholson ,Jodie Foster Katherine Hepburn and many others.",

MadMatt7 was particularly eloquent.In the first place, apparently, this bore fest was meant to be a romance. One that brought tears to some women's eyes. It isn't. I have no doubt that it made some women cry. It made THIS woman cry. Only in my case it was due to mortification. Thank God, I'm old, but not senile. I can still tell the difference between a real love story and what this silliness is: a geriatric sexual romp disguised as mushy, mawkish \"sex-is-ageless\" romance, designed to please horny old goats and fat, bored, middle-aged housewives who fantasize that indulging in tedium-inspired extra-marital infidelity means they still \"got it.\"Good. Got that bit of reality check off my chest.BTW, please don't judge all middle-aged women by the above-mentioned.In the second place, I hate Meryl Streep. Well I do. Yes, I know this will make fans of Our Lady of the Accents get the vapors. Just break out the smelling salts and be quiet. I hate Meryl Streep and there's an end to it. She's a mediocre actress, glorified because she can imitate foreign accents. Any stand up comedian worth his salt can do that - but none of them ever got an Oscar for their trouble - In this snoozer Meryl goes about flapping her arms like a wet hen, presumably \"playing the Italian.\" Wow. Such a thespian. Stick to accents, you silly cow.Good. Another bit of reality check off my chest.And now the painful part. Clint, what the Hades were you thinking? Must you really test your fans' loyalty to such a sad point? This silliness is an insult to the memory of Dirty Harry, the Preacher, Frank Korrigan, and Luther Whitney, to name a few. Shame on you, man. Shame on you.And that's the long and short of it. If you're a horny old goat, or a bored, fantasizing,\nmiddle-aged housewife, this ... thing ... is you cup of Ensure. If you are a normal, mature - mentally as well as chronologically - well adjusted human being, skip this dreg and do something else. Preferably something to which you don't have to sacrifice valuable brain cells.",

Clint can be a romantic lead and compete with the best in that area.I love this film for it's rural settings,Eastwood's direction,and his marvelous acting performance along with Meryl Streep's.Adultery is indeed a touchy subject with me.Being raised with certain values,I can't help but detest the mere subject,but in the case of this particular film it is so well done you almost have to overlook it just this once.This movie is a well done potential classic.One of Clint's best from the standpoints of both acting and directing.",

            "content": "It would be easy to go into The Bridges of Madison County with trepidation. It looks like one of those real hardcore chick-flick romances, where a bunch of middle-aged-to-elderly housewives and lonely women go in and imagine themselves in the part of Francesca being possibly taken away by Robert Kincaid to far away places. And no wonder since it was first a book that was a major hit - and also, from all accounts I've heard, a trashy piece of mainstream for-women work. But the factor of Clint Eastwood is a curious one, especially since he's rarely had movies that were about just two people in love (the closest one can find are in the 70s with Play Misty for Me, which is more of a thriller, and the obscure Breezy). It turns out he was an excellent choice to direct the picture, as well as appear as co-lead, because he never second-guesses or pushes the material where it would feel false.In fact, this is one of the more realistic \"weepie\" love story films I have come across, at least from recent memory. It starts with the dialog and the characters, and whatever writer Richard LaGravanese was able to take away from the book he made it work for Eastwood's aesthetic, which is that of two people who meet, have actual conversations without pablum or hokey bits, and even when the occasional self-indulgent narration bits from Francesca come up they're not un-welcome. When we see this man Robert come into Francesca's life it's very natural, or appears to be as much as it could be for these two people. Then as things deepen, albeit quickly, this becomes part of the romantic feel that is captured with subtlety and delicacy. So, when the real dramatic quandaries come around- of whether or not this woman will leave her husband, who is a good man without anything on him to make him villainous, and her kids- it too is dealt with rationally, with a sense of tragedy but humanity.Bridges of Madison County is nothing if not a very human tale of love and loss. It's a \"chick-flick\" with all of its clich\u00e9s pared down, stripped away of all their chicken fat and shown with the bones that make them work for just any viewer looking for a good story, love or otherwise. And Eastwood is also very good at including the plot device of the two 40-something kids reading through the late Francesca's journals- their own experiences as people are brought in to the narrative wonderfully. All in all, the story reveals the filmmaker to have such a great sense of what makes a good romance film- a hopeless romance, perhaps, in a similar mold of the films of Wong Kar Wai- while also being able to have us connect with these people. The wife commits infidelity, but it's hard to really side either way. They're too real and too conflicted to stick on any one side (some may disagree, which maybe will reveal more about themselves than the actual film, which is interesting), which is rare.And what about the stars? This and Heat are, clearly, the films that in 1995 had iconic stars of their generation on screen facing off. Whereas Pacino and DeNiro had one scene, Clint and Streep have the bulk of the picture to hang on to. It goes without saying Streep lays bare her characters flaws and conflicts and joy so well, a given perhaps, but the real revelation is Eastwood. Who knew such a man who usually eats grit for breakfast and in later years has a gravel-chiseled profile has such a tender soul to lay bare? There are some who will avoid the picture just for this reason, which perhaps is fair; no one wants to see their tough-guy icon showing how \"soft\" and vulnerable they can be on camera. But for those willing to take a look, it's one of his bravest and maybe even just best performances (as with a recent Sean Penn in Milk, you'll rarely see Eastwood just smile this much, which is great).",

            "content": "My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think.One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women.Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished.As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love.Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband.We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.",

Here we have a middle-aged bored housewife who's going through a midlife crisis and longs for some excitement. So what else is new? I'm middle-aged and I'd like some excitement, too, please. Enter our rugged traveling photographer, Clint Eastwood, and, a few screws later, our housefrau has now found the love of her eternal life????? Of course she's horny for him: he's exciting, adventurous, a deep-thinker, poetic - but very selfish and crappy family material. Meanwhile, her devoted husband of umpteen years, who is not abusive in any way and has stood by her through thick and thin takes the back seat because he's...well, boring. As a married man of 10 years with 2 children, I guess this gives me free license to dump my wife and kids if I suddenly wake up one morning and find them tedious in comparison to some hot new chick that really turns me on. It also makes me feel really good to know that, right now, my wife is probably fantasizing about dumping me for some rugged, exciting, outdoorsy type.This is basically another Jack and Rose Titanic situation, where the audience is deliberately kept from the reality of what would happen if these two shmucks really did get together. Namely, Clint would dump Meryl when he got tired of having sex with her or Meryl would dump Clint when she finally figured out what a twit he was. Well, it's nice to know that they will be stuck with each other for eternity - under a bridge of Madison County.",

Some of my fondest memories from class were not only his lessons, but also being able to enjoy classes where he shared his photography and music.When I graduated from college, I was given a questionnaire to fill out.

What initially put me off was discovering that Meryl Streep was meant to be Italian. I have great admiration for Streep as an actress but for the first part of the movie I kept trying to work out which country her accent was meant to be from. I decided eventually on Russian. Blow me down if it doesn't turn out that she's meant to be Italian. My parents are Italian and I've heard a lot of English spoken with Italian accents in my life but none of them sounded like Meryl Streep. To compound things even further she later tells Clint Eastwood that she's from a \"small town\" in Italy that he would never have heard of. She eventually tells him that this small town is called Bari and learns to her great surprise that he has not only heard of it but has visited it and was so entranced by what he saw that he broke his train journey and stopped there for a few days. Now I know that Americans are notoriously ignorant about other countries but Bari happens to be a large urban centre and while it has some sites worth visiting it is hardly the picturesque small town that seems to be suggested in the movie. From that point on the movie began to lose me more and more. I found it generally dull and thought it was exploiting its viewers emotions. A pity really because I thought that some of the portrayals of a marriage that were shown had great insight. I left before it finished. My wife stayed.",

I finally watched this movie in my early teens and I couldn't believe that this was one of my mother's favorites. The husband takes the kids with him for 4 days to do something that benefits the family and some random stranger with a camera entices Meryl streep's character somehow. I get that the woman felt empty and what not but damn.... I understand that people fall out of love but that doesn't make it okay to cheat. From what I could see the husband was a good guy and look I get it was the 60s and divorce was pretty taboo especially in the more rural areas of America at this time but having an affair was just as bad. She had other options... Sorry. When the husband was on his deathbed he looked at Meryl Streep and said basically I'm sorry I couldn't give you the life that you wanted. The guy really did love her but poor Meryl Streep had the soldier through a relationship where she didn't even love the guy... Boohoo poor Meryl Streep. I would like to also point out that if Clint Eastwood played the father that stayed home and then cheated on his wife with some photographer lady he would be chastised for it (by the audience) but for some reason it's okay when it's Meryl Streep and or female that's doing the cheating... even though I didn't like the movie for these reasons that's probably why a lot of other people actually like it. I just don't like double standards and I don't like the message that this sends out about relationships in general.

You can feel the sexual tension between the actors and that is when the movie is at its best - the little moments when dialogue is at a minimum but there is a lot going on. It was also nice to see a couple of approximately the same age, and also nice that Meryl's husband wasn't made out to be this total jerk, thereby giving a segment of the audience the reason to understand why she is having an affair.

            "review_title": "An Affair to Remember.",
            "content": "\"The Bridges of Madison County\" is a leisurely-paced, finely-tuned  romantic drama beautifully orchestrated by director/actor Clint Eastwood, with a transcending performance by Meryl Streep.Based on Robert James Waller's surprisingly successful novella, this project has Clint Eastwood straying from his formulaic action material and winding up with one of the most lyrical, passionate dramas to come out recently. Who knew Eastwood could aim so perfectly for the heart without the help of a gun and holster.In adapting this rather prosaic piece of prose for the screen, Eastwood shrewdly (and graciously) shifts the point of view from Robert Kincaid to Francesca Johnson.  With Meryl Streep as its primary focus, how could anything go wrong?  Streep is simply luminous here as the  foreign-born Iowa farmwife and mother consigned to a life of drudgery.  Her family away for the week, she happens upon a handsome, worldly photographer briefly in town scouting out locations for his next National Geographic spread.  What results is a beautifully mature story of spiritual and unconditional love. Eastwood himself displays a rare, vulnerable side as the taciturn Kincaid who has grown accustomed to a solitary, self-serving existence.  The chemistry between Eastwood and Streep is surprisingly potent and ultimately moving, a real tribute to their disparate talents.    With subtle nuance, we slowly become familiar with these two unlikely strangers in the night.  A harmless lunch...a cozier dinner...revealing conversation...a slight brush of the shoulder...the casual adjustment of a shirt collar...a spontaneous mating dance.  Once their true feelings finally come to the surface, we feel for them and understand and rationalize their attraction.  This is absolutely crucial in maintaining the beauty of the romance for it must reroute the obvious appearance of a housewife conducting an adulterous affair with some fly-by-night Romeo.  Significantly, Francesca's husband is not portrayed here as an abusive lout deserving of such betrayal.  He is simply a remote, unresponsive farmer who has settled routinely into mid-life -- still devoted to his family.The perfervid affair, of course, is beset with feelings of guilt, anguish and fear, but never regret.  Ever mindful of small-town gossip (one cruel restaurant scene has a known \u0091scarlet' woman openly ostracized by its patrons and employees), the couple find out-of-the-way places to go to enjoy their brief time together, while faced with the dilemma of their futures. The climactic scene in the truck with the tormented Francesca gripping the door handle, torn between staying in the truck with her unsuspecting husband or fleeing to Eastwood in the automobile stopped just ahead of them is one of the most searing, agonizing screen moments ever experienced by this viewer.A minor drawback to the film is the \"present day\" subplot device, which reappears sporadically and bookends the affair seen in flashback.  These scenes involve Francesca's two surviving children coming to terms with the discovery of their mother's past affair via letters, diaries and mementos purposely left to be read upon her death.  These segments are integral, to be sure, but awkwardly presented and annoyingly intrusive.Known for his deep love of jazz, Eastwood incorporates a wonderfully lush, often bluesy score, littered with familiar classics, notably by the late, great Dinah Washington, whose exquisite version of \"I'll Close My Eyes\" is a must for every music library, and Johnny Hartman, whose \"For All We Know\" highlights the lovers' initial encounter.  \"The Bridges of Madison County,\" despite its deliberately languid pace, is an enduring wallow for incurable romantics everywhere.  Simply, it is an affair to remember.",

            "review_title": "As Effective As It Is Simple",
            "content": "One of the joys of Clint Eastwood's oeuvre is that, besides his tough-guy cop or western roles, he has also been involved (acting, directing, or both) in a plethora of \"simple\" films. Not simple in the sense of \"bad\" or \"dumb\", mind you, but simple in that they don't really on a ton of other components besides a good story, solid characters, and terrific acting. Those three things are exactly what are featured in \"The Bridges of Madison County\".For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Francesca (Meryl Streep), an Iowa housewife--originally from Italy--who had/has big dreams in life but has \"settled\" for a husband and two children. On one rare occasion where she is left alone for a few days, photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) stumbles upon her farmstead looking for directions. What follows is a whirlwind romance in which both parties learn each other's deepest desires and must make tough decisions before \"the family\" returns home.Because \"Bridges\" is such a dialogue-heavy film, the characters have to be absolutely spot-on in terms of writing, and that's exactly what happens here. Truly the best scenes of the entire experience are Francesca & Robert just sitting at the dinner table talking to each other. Universal (and timeless) themes such as loneliness, entrapment, wanderlust, and passion are discussed, and thus there is something for nearly every viewer to identify with.Incredible acting is a \"must\" too, of course, to carry all that dialogue, and does it really get much better than Eastwood & Streep? While seemingly an odd fit for each other at first, they are both so good at their craft that it becomes easy to understand what is drawing these two characters together and the tornado of emotions the relationship produces.I also liked how the story is framed in a flashback reference, where Francesca's children are all discovering this for the first time themselves by reading their mother's old diaries. This framing mechanism lends even more importance to the \"chance encounter\" (especially at the beginning of the film), as viewers already know this will become a momentous period in Francesca's life.It would be easy for modern film-goers to discard or dismiss \"Bridges of Madison County\" as \"too slow\". To be honest, despite being a huge fan of Eastwood's work, it even took me a long time (and a specific recommendation) to get to this one. However, that was an enormous injustice to the story, acting, and direction present here. If you want to see how Eastwood honed his emotional-movie craft to later make masterpieces such as \"Million Dollar Baby\", \"Gran Torino\", or \"Changeling\", one could make a case that all starts with \"Bridges of Madison County\".",

            "content": "A most surprising approach of mid-life love for a mother and wife, though seen by a male director apparently well supported or supplemented by some women in the team. What happens if for four days you are alone, but not abandoned, and meet a man that reveals to you that there can be some new love in your life even though this life of yours is satisfied, happy, well-balanced and characterized by no particular need nor want, nor even, as for that, wish, except maybe the desire to listen to and enjoy some classical music, some opera singing \u0096 and it could be anything at all \u0096 which is not appreciated by the other members of the family ? That is rather light as for discontentment or dissatisfaction. A short-lived love affair develops during and over these four days and you are confronted to the need to make a decision. The situation has already been considered by many and in many films. You break off and away and let yourself go with that love affair. Then later on you regret what you have lost in the process. Or you resist and do not yield and you regret all your life what you have not done. In both case you enjoy what you have taken or kept and you are divided between the two sides of your decision : does what I have taken or kept balance what I have rejected, refused or let go ? The film is thus not particularly innovative by its theme. Yet it has a special perfume, fragrance. What is it ? Certainly not the reaction of the children when they learn about it after your death. Their reactions are predictable and even superficial. The special value of this film is in fact in the two actors and the way they embody, with their body acting, the meeting of two potentials, the passion and the end of it, the loss of it and yet the survival of it. Apart from this marvelously well rendered flesh of the film the subject is banal. Meryl Streep particularly transcends her part and takes us into the deepest layers of her mind the way they ripple on her surface, on the surface of her body and behavior. We feel her disarray at first, her fascination then and her conservative sacrifice last in the most humane and subtle way. We are suffering and rejoicing with her and each side of her situation or decision has its lot of suffering and its lot of rejoicing. That's why this film should be kept in mind and remembered.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

            "content": "Bridges of Madison County is probably the worst so-called romance movie I have ever seen. If you disagree answer these questions: Why would Francesca believe he loves her? Because of a few \"lines\" professing his, what? Great opportunity? His good times with her? What he said was \"This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime.\" What was \"certain\" about it? Was it more \"certain\" than the wife he divorced without regret? Romance note, before you trash your life, such as it is, and run off with someone who has managed to abandon one marriage, and looks down on commitment in general, AT LEAST know that he loves you! And if he really does, he will NOT ask you to abandon your children!Another question; What exactly did he see in her? What was so special and different to leave him without sense enough to come in from the rain? Are these two \"soul-mates,\" or is she just a woman who needs to feel loved and frustrated enough with her life to have sex with a total stranger. Was the sex sooooo life altering that he was willing to finally settle down? Passion and love, let's not confuse the two, one can last four days, perhaps a week, maybe a year... the other a lifetime. Sure, drop everything and go... he's got nothing to lose, while she'll lose what little she has. That is NOT romance, it's sad. It's insulting. The more you think about it, the more his \"certainty\" plays like a pickup line.And when did these DEEP LASTING emotions develop, from the 3 or 4 conversations they had? While driving along in the truck? Or was it when they were soiling the sheets in the bed where she was to sleep with her husband? Which brings me to the issue of infidelity, and the dim view of marriage in general? He doesn't seem to value it, she \"suffers\" through it. In this lopsided \"romantic\" story there's scarcely a happy couple to be found, let alone happily married one. As a GUY who LOVES romance, please, PLEASE do not accept this counterfeit tripe of an offering as real romance. Hollywood has gotten so lazy as to toss us a scrap and expect us to gobble it up as fillet! A man who asks a woman to leave her husband, and her kids who are \"almost grown\" is thinking of himself. A REAL man, and REAL love would offer to do whatever you wanted to make YOU happy. He would say I cannot bear to lose you BEFORE you had to have a conniption-fit in the kitchen. HE would be devastated on that last day BEFORE you served breakfast, before you did anything, and would take you by the hand and ask you to sit down, and with a lump in his throat the size of Iowa look you in the eyes and ask, \"What are WE going to do?\" THAT is romance. It's not a 4-day teenage fling with older actors. It's no-matter-what, 'till the end, 'till death do us part!HUSBANDS listen up! Your wives are quietly telling you something. Get busy and do your duty as a husband. Sure she's adjusted her life for you, sometimes sacrificially, but you are bound to do all within your power to see that she is happy and fulfilled! She should feel LOVED!",

Here she has a cute Italian one and she cocks her head to one side a lot,smiles shyly,keeps raising her hands to her face and employs bits of \"business\" that clearly indicate \"acting\".Mr C.Eastwood on the other hand belongs to the \"less is more\" school and apart from the occasional wrinkling of the brow to indicate moments of high emotion is happy to rely on our perception of his screen persona in much the same way as that other great American movie invention Mr J.Wayne. Miss Streep is very beautiful(even more so near the end when she has aged realistically)but I found her transition from Italian=American earth-mother/cook/homemaker to flirty middle aged woman willing to risk everything for love decidedly unlikely. Equally Mr Eastwood's spartan independence is rather too quickly cast aside as he reverts to lovelorn adolesence in very short order. \"The bridges of Madison County\" was a very popular story and obviously somebody was going to make a movie of it.Because that task fell to Mr Eastwood what we have is about as good a movie as could have been made out of it.The faults lie in the original material. It is a film about love rather than sexual attraction,and in that sense is \"adult\".Women will find it confirms their belief that most men lack the capacity to understand what love is,men will worry that they are unable to satisfy all the criteria required by their partners. There are some lovely songs by the relatively little - known Johnny Hartman on the soundtrack that hopefully will make you go and search him out as I'm sure was Mr Eastwood's intention.

Unless confronted by the wives or killed by the husbands he even manages to publish few nude photos in the National Geographic. The movie is not \"On Golden Pond\" and these two are not Hepburn and Tracey either.

Francesca and Robert's passion, rapture, and deep understanding are a different form of love, but will it last? As Francesca said, once it lasted, it would have vanished. Whatever choice she had made, it would not be wrong, but 'we are the choices we've made'. It was all up to her, and she made a decision. However, I, like Francesca, want to know and picture with all my heart what could have been with two very much different people who had had totally different life goals, comfort and adventure. Their love being so magnificent and magical, were they willing to give up the past and and who they are for each other?For whole two hours, I feel for Francesca's love and agony to give up what's so beautiful. Streep makes it so easy and natural to put myself in her shoe and even be her, sitting right in front of the screen. Just beautiful and heartbreaking. Especially, a scene where Richard's car turns and is placed behind Robert's and the whole sequence of Streep's face, silence, Robert hanging Francesca's pendant, his waiting, and her holding the door are genius.

This has to be one of the most romantic and sad films made for decades, at least since the 1940's and 1950's. Not only is it highly romantic, but the underlying eroticism will have you in a state long before the middle of the film.To start with, when the film begins, all its protagonists are already dead..... Eastwood, Streep and Streep's husband. This is already tear-provoking in itself. The film is therefore presented as a series of flashbacks in conjunction with Streep's childrens' reading of her diaries.The whole thing is very thoughtfully done, picture quality is excellent, the sets and lighting are magnificent. Streep's innocence ( \"What is this passion that's invading me ???\" )is extremely beautiful and natural. Eastwood plays it sober but with just the amount of passion to keep the spectator's heart pounding sufficiently quickly !!Even if you are against infidelity, it's difficult NOT to want these two to make out so to speak, as you can feel the passion \"boiling up below the skin's surface\" ( excuse the culinary imagery please !! )The tears really start to gush during the scene in the rain when Streep and her husband are behind Eastwood in his truck at the traffic lights -the waiting seems endless and the spectator can feel the frustration Streep is undergoing through this scene. We see Eastwood's truck turn off to the left and .......... oh ! its difficult to describe it !The final scene where the ashes are tossed into the river is of course heart-tearing and we see how Streep's children reflect on their own personal lives in the light of what they read in her diaries.It's very difficult to put into words the emotion felt on watching this film, so I'll stop here but would recommend this as one of the most romantic films of the last century which will be a source of inspiration to future generations.",

A friendship grows up between them, which turns to love, and they have a brief affair while Francesca's husband Richard and her teenage children are away for a few days at the State Fair. Robert wants Francesca to leave her husband for him, but she refuses. Although she has fallen deeply in love with Robert, she is unwilling to hurt her husband and children and is afraid that her love for Robert will fade should she take the irrevocable step of ending her marriage for him.This could easily be the plot of some cheap, sentimental movie, but \"The Bridges of Madison County\" avoids falling into the traps of cheapness and sentimentality. Part of the reason is that it starred two of Hollywood's most talented actors, Meryl Streep as Francesca and Clint Eastwood as Robert. Eastwood was perhaps an unexpected choice, given that he was in his mid-sixties at the time and that in the past he had been most often associated with violent action films, particularly Westerns and police thrillers. In recent years, however, he has been keen to extend his range as an actor, and his role here is an example. Those who felt that he could not play a romantic hero in a film more concerned with emotions than with action were to be proved wrong. Not only is he surprisingly handsome and virile for a man of his years (how many sixty-five year-old actors would dare do a scene bare-chested as Eastwood does here?) but he brings far more tenderness and sensitivity to the role than one would expect from the man who created Dirty Harry and the High Plains Drifter.Although her previous attempt to play the heroine of a doomed romance, in \"Falling in Love\" about a decade earlier, was not a great success, Streep is superb as Francesca (but then, she normally is superb). Playing an Italian gives her the chance to add another to her collection of accents, but there is always more to Streep than her talent for mimicry. What convinces us that she is foreign born is not only her accent but also her mannerisms and her slight hesitancy when speaking, as though she is groping, albeit only momentarily, for words in a language not her own.Eastwood also directed the film, and the style of direction is an unusual one for a modern movie. In the thirties and forties many films were made in the \"filmed theatre\" style (usually forced on the directors of the day by technical limitations). Films of this type were made in a studio, generally with an indoor setting. There was more dialogue than action, and the film's literary qualities were more important than its visual ones. This style of film-making fell out of favour as the technological abilities of the cinema advanced- even when a modern film is actually based on a stage play an attempt is normally made to \"open it up\"- but Eastwood seems to be reverting to it here. Although there are a few outdoor scenes, including shots of one of the covered bridges which takes on an important significance, much of the action takes place in Francesca's home, particularly her kitchen, where she and Robert hold long conversations. They do not actually move into the bedroom until more than halfway through.This style of film-making has the advantage of enabling us to build up a picture of Francesca's marriage without this having to be shown in detail. In the great nineteenth-century novels of female adultery, such as \"Anna Karenina\", \"Madame Bovary\" or Fontane's \"Effi Briest\" it became something of a convention to depict the husband in an unflattering light, thus providing an explanation for his wife's infidelity. That convention in not followed in this film. We see little of Richard, but from what we hear of him he is neither a booby like Charles Bovary nor a cold bully like Karenin. Francesca describes him as very clean, hard-working, gentle and a good father. Yet from her conversations with Robert, we can understand why she is dissatisfied in her marriage. She married Richard shortly after the war, when he was a soldier stationed in Italy. (The film is set in the mid-sixties). It becomes clear that the young Francesca saw marriage as a means to escape from her own war-ravaged country. She seems to have fallen in love with the idea of America as a land of opportunity rather than Richard as a person, and life as Mid-West farmer's wife has not fulfilled her expectations, leaving her nostalgic for her homeland. The life of the cosmopolitan, widely-travelled Robert seems more glamorous than the one she is leading.The one thing I did not like about the film was the \"framework story\", set in the nineties, in which Francesca's children, now adults, discover the truth about their mother's affair from documents she leaves behind after her death. I felt that the story of Francesca and Robert was strong enough to stand on its own without this unnecessary addition, especially as the nineties subplot had a rather moralising tone at odds with that of the main story. The film as a whole, however, is very good, touching and well-made, with great insight into what Glen Campbell called \"the dreams of the everyday housewife\". 8/10",

            "review_title": "A Sweet and Poignant Love Story",
            "content": "An Iowa farmer's lonely Italian wife, left at home for four days while he and the children are off at the Illinois State Fair, has a torrid romance with an adventurous, globe-trotting photographer. Although he reawakens her physically and emotionally, she doesn't really believe it's true love until it is too late. What she does believe is that she has a duty to family (\"the little details of her life\") that eclipses her right to real happiness.One year, we went through Winterset, where the story is set, and found it to be a rather strange place. The rolling Iowa countryside, with its lush vegetation, vast, often stormy skies, and enchanting, white gravel roads, has a special charm, to be sure. But much of the state is nearly flat and it is often bleak and depressing, the unpleasant odor emanating from penned hogs and feedlots often hanging heavily in the air. And Iowans struck us as a very provincial lot -- suspicious, very nosy, and at times downright weird. In fact, some of them looked overly inbred, even potentially dangerous. The movie, to its credit, captured the essence of all that quite well. Francesca deserved more than to spend the rest of her life in such a place, and she owed it to Robert, the photographer, if to no one else. Tossing their ashes off the same bridge was a symbolic gesture, at best, and I'm afraid it was a poor substitute for the few short years they might have enjoyed together instead of just four short days in each other's arms. Even after her husband died, Francesca made only a token effort to contact Robert. While I understood her decision to stay with her family, fearing that her love for him could not last if she ran away with him and that she'd blame him for a growing sense of guilt, once her kids were gone and both she and her husband were getting older, I think she should have found him again, if only to reunite temporarily, rather than going to their respective graves never having known what might have happened. Clint Eastwood, the director, was trying to make a realistic ending, but I felt a little let down by it.That said, the love story was sweet and poignant, certain of the love scenes rather erotic, and other sequences quite moving. I particularly liked the couple's interaction on the second day, after Francesca left the note for Robert and they were hesitantly circling one another, both desperately wanting to make love. Then, the scene in the kitchen, where Francesca blew up and called Robert a shallow phony, I thought was very effective. Finally, we had the climax, where Robert stood in the rain, looking pathetic but sincere, then at the stoplight, he held up traffic for another moment, hoping Francesca would change her mind. She almost did, too, but simply couldn't tear herself away from her husband in time. To his alarm and concern, she broke down in tears as Robert turned left and rolled out of her life, forever. That was some good cinema. At the conclusion of the film, we see an encompassing view of the tidy, productive little farm where Francesca spent her life, giving everything else up to remain there. Did she make the right decision? The scenes where her grown children read her notebooks after her death, trying to understand her final wishes, could have been somewhat better but did not, to an excessive degree, detract from this otherwise excellent effort. In particular, Meryl Streep as Francesca was especially good.",

            "content": "The movie is so brilliantly made to deliver the message of what you want versus what you should do. I guess this role wasn't difficult to Streep in its essence as she played it already with Robert Deniro in Falling in Love but there was a challenge in this role and it is unfair not to be able to see it as a viewer! The challenge was for Meryle who is in her 40s to act as the teenage who fell in love and found the passion that she had never felt before in such an age and still be lovable to the conservative viewer. I, for one, loved her so much and wasn't intimidated by anything in the way she acted. I was totally compassionate with the character and I have to say that many of the comments didn't quite understand the character. It all lies in the scene where she says to Eastwood that she hoped she didn't bore him with her stupid chatting and he replies back that he could never think of her that way and that she was a smart woman. It's at the moment that she falls in love with him because she had lost her wit in the simple life of the simple man she got married. Just amazing! The story talks about the kind of love that you find once in your life with only one person who can get out the real you and make you feel your importance which life tends to bury down with its different loads.The movie had so many deep and beautiful scenes, particularly the scene where Francesca is in the car with her husband and Eastwood is in his right behind them hanging the necklace on the mirror as a sign for her to leave the car and runaway with him just like teenagers in love would do. Waw, this movie never stops to amaze me with all the details in it. Both characters never knew what love is and they found it together but not at the right time.There is also the scene where her husband is dying and he asks her if he ever did her wrong and she smiles knowing that she had taken the right choice by staying with her family. That's when duty calls and love no matter how big it is fails to surpass doing what's right.And believe me there is so much more to the movie and no matter how much has been said in the reviews, there is still more.",

The pacing is much too careful and lethargic, however Clint's chemistry with a curiously cast yet exceptional Meryl Streep is captured well. Her performance alone makes the picture worth-seeing; soft, yet earthy and gutsy--and with a convincing Italian accent--Streep manages a full-blooded character, someone with whom audiences can instantly identify.

If we forget that this is just another story, with different characters, different situations, a different time and made in 1995 instead of 1940, we could even say that it's a modern Casablanca. The main elements are there: An impossible love, lovers took apart by almost irresistible forces, and several common scenes: The rain scene, the appearance of Eastwood in the rain (similar to the appearance of Ingrid Bergman at Rick's cafe in the night)... In Casablanca they always would have Paris, in The Bridges of Madison County they always would have Iowa...Thus, in my opinion, this film borrows several elements from Casablanca, but not to copy them, but to incorporate them into a different story.This film is beautiful. Eastwood and Streep are near perfect, to the point that we forget their physical appearances to reach their feelings. We are able to see the inner beauty they have found in each other and get captivated by the atmosphere. There is a fantastic use of light which fits perfectly with every situation, and the music is quite good.When the film finishes, you find yourself in deep melancholy.

Cremation is an every-day affair, now. And, this story reversed the passion in the family: remember how large farm-families used to be? Farmers were hardly ever too tired to make babies. That \"Mom\" was the horny one should shock no one, if \"Dad\" weren't romantic enough to quench \"Mom's\" roving eye. Most moms are clever enough to realize four days aren't going to erase many years of sacrifice and love.....she made \"the right\" decision, because she knew she was where she belonged.I shed tears even for happy and beautiful movies - \"Bridges\" didn't open the spigot for me.

I agree that the performances were impeccable and the limited sets made the viewer focus on the relationship that was central to the plot. It's a very intense portrayal of a very real emotional dilemma, and I empathised with Francesca's difficult choice. I do think she chose wisely but in a way it was a no-win situation for her. Time does heal and make that pain bearable, and maybe it did for her.It was obvious to me that she chose to become closer to Robert - she invited him into her life, and then she realised the impact of what she had done. It is a cautionary tale in some ways as well - I'm sure a lot of people in that situation would have denied themselves that opportunity. Meryl Streep's performance conveyed every aspect of what her character felt, without words in many cases. Clint Eastwood was also excellent but i couldn't help wishing he had been a bit younger. I don't know how old the characters were in the book.This is one of the few movies that tears my heart out each time I see it as do the English Patient, Schindler's List, and some others. The realism of the emotions is so dramatic that it's impossible to avoid being drawn in. I agree with comments that the cutting away to the \"present\" with her children reading the diary was unnecessary, but this didn't ruin it for me.",

            "content": "I put off watching THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY because I expected it to be a lot of sentimental nonsense about two aging fools who fall in love at first sight before the soap suds become thicker and thicker.Well, I was wrong. I have to confess that I was afraid I'd have to put up with another Meryl Streep accent that would leave half of her words unintelligible, but again I was wrong. Streep gets across the Italian ancestry without too heavy an accent and gives a remarkably fine performance, doing so much with her eyes and expressive face that she doesn't even need dialogue. She shows us the pain just below the surface--and the boredom and loneliness of the housewife who yearns for something missing in her marriage relationship.And Clint Eastwood scores too, this time without guns or tough guy lines that we're used to hearing from him. He does an honest, realistic and natural job of acting that makes him seem what he is supposed to be--a traveling photographer with the National Geographic intent on filming some of those lovely New England bridges.The story moves just a little too slowly for comfort at times and this is the only major flaw because it's told in such an honest fashion from beginning to end. Streep's children are extremely well played and their viewpoint is understandable when they discover the diaries she has kept of her four day love affair.Touching and straightforward in its simplicity, there is much to admire about the film. Streep and Eastwood are at their level best. The color photography is a treat and so is the unobtrusive background score.Again, the only real flaw is the length. It's the kind of relationship tale that could have been told just as effectively without scenes that are held too long.",

            "content": "An erotic adventure set in rural Iowa in 1965 and later. Seriously bored, unhappily married but quite lusty war bride turned farm wife, Francesca, finds herself alone on her dreary Iowa farm for four days when hubby and the two teenage kids take off with prize steer to the Illinois county fair. She is stuck tending the corn and canning vittles and sometimes flashing the scare crow when it gets windy. She married a soldier turned civilian farmer hoping for a ticket to America and a life of adventure only to get what she considers drudgery in small town USA. Things change when Robert, an aging free range and randy Nat Geo photog bops into morally conservative and gossipy Madison County to take a few snappies of the local covered bridges. In the few scenes that show it, the residents of this town are mostly portrayed as overweight, homely or rude. Robert runs into Francesca when scoping out the bridges and sensing she is willing, presses hard toward the goal from the get go. He regales her with stories of his world travels while probing her about her happiness. This is also shown in several scenes of Robert admiring her back-end on the porch, long looks into her eyes and brushing against her several times. Robert also makes it clear on their first evening together that he has little use for morality or places any value on the traditional family. He is more of an amoral citizen of the world. In a bizarre analogy, he compares his morality to that of wild animals in Africa. Francesca finally bites and the two eventually hook up for four days getting their groove on in the bed, bathtub and beyond. Robert splits town a few days after her hubby and kids return from the fair. Even though he offered to take Francesca with him on his next adventure, she nearly left but instead decided due to a sense of duty to stay at Green Acres than go frolicking with the photog in some jungle.Fast forward a decade and a half later and Francesca's hubby has gone toes up leaving her alone on the farm to wonder about what may have been had she booked out of Iowa with Robert. Fast forward a second time to 1982 and Francesca finds out that Robert is now taking his dirt nap when the UPS man delivers a cardboard box to her home. Turns out that Robert left her his estate consisting of a couple beat up camera, his bracelet and her necklace she gave him in 1965 and a book detailing their four day fling. Old Francesca just got screwed again since that is it, no money, stocks, real estate or precious metals. Just a box of junk barely worthy of ebay. Turns out old Robert had no earning potential. Fast forward one final time to the 1990s and now Francesca is in the bone orchard and her two kids, both bitter losers themselves, discover her infidelity when they find Mom's tawdry journals detailing the love fest and Robert's box of junk. They fight over the situation with the daughter defending her mom's sexual adventures while the son believes old Robert was just getting his Tinder on. Then they both later conclude that Mom was right since she was so unhappy. The final scene is quite interesting with the daughter, wearing the dress Francesca bought for her first night a passion with Robert, stretched out on her Mom's bed in the farmhouse (the same bed ....), calling her husband to ask for a divorce. The apple does not fall far from the tree in Madison County.Moral of this story: Its not the farmer's daughter, but the farmer's wife is where its at.",

That is its very definition.Case in point: Meryl Streep. It is hard to deny that she is more Goddess than actor to most people, much like Jack Nicholson, she's become an icon unto herself. This regardless of whether you like her or not.Which makes it so much more impressive when Streep pulls off a magic trick of major magnitude: making the audience forget it's actually her. She does so quickly and seemingly effortlessly, which is crucial to the suspension of disbelief required to become involved in this sappy love story. It's no minor feat, considering she's Meryl-f*cking-Streep! (attach as many exclamation points as you like, depending on how gay you are).So, what about the movie itself? Clearly a superior work to the underlying novel, thanks to skillful direction and overall good performances. Definitely moving in a bitter-sweet way. In my opinion, it's just a little too soppy for me to think it's truly great. But despite its being such a blatant tearjerker, it's nevertheless appealing and gripping. Something to cleanse your sinuses and refresh your soul.Kudos especially to Eastwood, who has repeatedly proved himself a far superior director than actor (and that's saying some). But overall, this is Meryl Streep's victory over her own cult status. Halle Berry was right: she must be the best actress of all time.",

An unmarried man on a photographic assignment stops at an Iowa farmhouse to ask directions from a middle-aged woman whose family is away for a few days ... conveniently. Thereupon begins a character study of these two people, played by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, and told in flashbacks from the POV of the woman's two grown children, after she has died.Streep's character leads a life of stability and bland security. For her, the stranger represents a more adventurous life, one of excitement and new experiences, and an escape from the mundane details of an ordinary, but stable, life. But whenever a person selects one path, he or she necessarily forgoes alternate paths. It's everyone's dilemma. As usual, Meryl Streep gives a wonderfully convincing performance. Also, I must credit makeup artist Roy Helland, who did a great job, especially at the film's end when Streep's character is made to look much older. And the film has a finale that is realistic, rather than cinematically predictable.This is the kind of story that needs to be told slowly. And it is. But it is way too slow. Several times, as when, for example, Eastwood and Streep are \"slow\" dancing around the breakfast table, the plot almost grinds to a halt. With a runtime of well over two hours, some of the more lethargic moments could have been edited out. I also did not like the casting of the two adult children whom I found irritating. And, with all those wrinkles, that frizzy gray hair, and that receding hairline, Eastwood was about twenty years too old for the role he plays, in my opinion.\"The Bridges Of Madison County\" has its good moments, especially when it is making some social commentary on nosy, small town America. I'm glad I watched the film ... once. But the plot is too slow. The casting is not very good. And as a man, I found the story to be too sappy and sentimental for my taste.",

            "content": "If you want to see an actress make something out of nothing, then see Meryl Streep in this lumbering romance novel of a movie. Based on the ridiculous Robert James Waller bestseller (a book I truly loathed), the 1995 film retains a lot of the novel's unbearable treacle and heaving sentimentality. At the same time, screenwriter Richard LaGravenese's adaptation improves the story immeasurably by shifting more of the focus to Francesca Johnson, an Italian post-WWII bride who has become over the years, a lonely, middle-aged Iowa farmwife circa 1965. Her husband and two children leave for four days to the Illinois State Fair, and by chance, renowned photographer Robert Kincaid accidentally drops by the Johnson farm for directions to the famous Roseman Bridge, one of several covered bridges around Winterset, Iowa. Francesca is fascinated, then smitten, and the two embark on a brief but life-altering love affair.It's fortunate that Clint Eastwood chose to direct this film, as it takes his professional certainty and laconic storytelling style to make this vehicle work. Without sacrificing much of his natural machismo, he's also quite effectively enigmatic as Kincaid, though I think he's at least a decade too old for the part. Whether wringing her hands in anticipation or quietly crying in her mud room, Streep, affecting one of her world-class accents, is at the top of her game yet again. The film's best moments are hers in the rain-soaked scene of inevitability toward the end, when the drama is guided mainly by her mastery of the character's alternating waves of regret and longing. What doesn't work at all is the use of a framing device in having the now-grown Johnson children read their mother's love letters about her romance with Kincaid. It doesn't help that Annie Corley and Victor Slezak play these parts as if they are cast in a sitcom. On the plus side, Jack N. Green's cinematography lovingly captures Iowa's bucolic landscapes. But there is no getting around the slowness of the action, which feels interminable at 135 minutes. The DVD came out just two years after in 1997 and consequently has none of the extras we have come to expect from more recent releases.",

In the first place, I much admire Meryl Streep (as Francesca Johnson) who, once again, shows her mastery of acting, period. Her ability to say much more than enough without using words is simply astounding. In contrast, although Eastwood does a credible job, his efforts fall short; adequate, but only near the closing scenes, does he show the real agony his character, Robert Kincaid, must feel while standing in the rain.Sure, this is a tearjerker for many. However, if you can control your emotions for a little while, you'll more easily see that this is a story that confronts the nature of human love as never before, I think. The central question is undeniable: does true love between two people ever truly exist? It's what the two lovers do eventually, however, that puts this story onto a higher philosophical plane \u0096 and thus provides hope for Francesca's children when they learn of her affair after her death (that's no spoiler \u0096 the whole story begins with the reading of her will).The supporting cast typifies the people of the area: rough, inbred, literally down-to-earth, rural people who form the backbone of America \u0096 thus making Kincaid's presence all the more attractive to Johnson, as she digs the dirt and shoots the s*** with the local women. Streep just falls into the role, even down to the blunt and dirty finger tips...I don't know of any other outright romance that Eastwood has made or in which he has appeared. So, for those reasons alone, it was worth seeing from my perspective \u0096 apart from the stunning performance by Streep, arguably one of the few women who could have taken on this part.Recommended for all.",

She shows us the pain just below the surface--and the boredom and loneliness of the housewife who yearns for something missing in her marriage relationship. And Clint Eastwood scores too, this time without guns or tough guy lines that we're used to hearing from him. He does an honest, realistic and natural job of acting that makes him seem what he is supposed to be--a traveling photographer with the National Geographic intent on filming some of those lovely New England bridges. The story moves just a little too slowly for comfort at times and this is the only major flaw because it's told in such an honest fashion from beginning to end. Streep's children are extremely well played and their viewpoint is understandable when they discover the diaries she has kept of her four day love affair.....Touching and straightforward in its simplicity, there is much to admire about the film. Streep and Eastwood are at their level best. The color photography is a treat and so is the unobtrusive background score.",

That little tidbit might scare away some male viewers, but let me assure it's not a sappy love story. Even my husband thought this was a \"really good movie.\"We are absorbed by these two characters and feel their chemistry almost immediately. By the time we remember that there's a family out there to consider, it's too late. We're dug in deep and feel the pain of having to choose between what's always been and what could be.

It is strange but a true fact that Dirty Harry could give such a balanced and heart touching finish to the novel written by Robert James Waller.

Both of us enjoyed the film greatly and thought that all the elements that make an enjoyable and memorable film came together. I love reading Viewer Comments, depending on the film, before writing my own and please forgive me here; some of them are downright bizarre. Movies are fantasy, even if they want to be factual so treat them as fantasy. I do not think that you should bring out your Bible and begin to thump it because you are there to protect the morals of your kids or as Christians love doing, protecting us, the Great Unwashed Masses, from ourselves. We will succeed in arriving somewhere without the help of the silly churches dotting the land like pimples on the earth's behind. This was a fantasy examination of what is and what might have been. Eastwood and Streep play their roles seamlessly; Eastwood's direction married to Steep's always sensitive acting is superb. I loved Streep's virtually flawless facial expressions mirroring her interior emotions throughout the film. I was not bothered by her accent or how other commentators saw it, her lack of an accent. The film's ending was hard; Francesca had decisions to make, she made them and must spend her remaining years recounting those decisions, as do all of us whether in career, or love or virtually anything in life. It is the old story of the Fork in the Road and the path taken. Yes, that reality is there but the details of this movie are still fantasy and should be seen exactly as that and nothing else.",

            "content": "It sure is ironic when Clint Eastwood starts talking about being over in Africa taking pictures with an attentive audience, country housewife Meryl Streep, who could only dream of being in Africa as opposed to her boring, pedestrian life, especially after she tells him that she chose not to go to medical school because of her children. It's too bad they didn't cast Robert Redford. Yes indeed, the Indiana countryside here is beautiful yet far too quiet in spite of the noise of the night crickets, and those bridges stunning. I remember seeing covered bridges as a child, and just the novelty of that was quite intriguing to a little kid. For the Italian born Francesca (Meryl Streep), it's obvious that she's used to much more excitement, and when a magazine photographer, Clint Eastwood shows up, it's a distraction from the dullness of her day after her husband and children have gone to the State Fair.I would have preferred this had they not consummated an affair but just thought about it and realized it would be best not to sleep together. That would make a more interesting moral tale, and certainly something that her grown children could try to understand a little better years later while going through her things after her death. The conversations that Streep and Eastwood have certainly leads to an obvious attraction, and it's understandable that she's drawn into his exciting world even if he thinks that it's dull. When she tries to describe her life to him, it's obvious that she resents her quiet life but is aware that it is of her own doing. She doesn't hate her husband and gently praises him, and certainly she loves her children only as a mother can. But love doesn't mean like, and there certainly is a thin line between love and hate and like and dislike. She loves them because she has to. Not because she wants to.The character of Francesca is not a selfish woman, and what happens here doesn't make her a bad person, but perhaps it should have been a secret that she takes with her, just as Gloria Stuart said in \"Titanic\", \"A woman's heart is filled with many secrets\". The two of them do have good chemistry together, legends on screen that work well in spite of the age difference. It's hard not to moralize over the situation, but it's not like she shows him the bridge and then quickly rolls around with him in the weeds. It takes time, a lot of ethical contemplation, and then finally, the decision. This is a beautiful film to watch but it's nothing more than what it comes off as, a romantic novel that's a good read once but certainly not a literary classic.The movie has terrific photography, a sweet musical score and a somewhat believable situation only marred by the directions in which the story starts, shocking the children with the news that their mother was indeed a woman with desires and lusts and needs they didn't realized and probably took for granted simply because she was their mom. And \"moms\" like this aren't really \"women\", just some commodity that you turn to when you need a soundboard or lunch money. I would have preferred this been about an attractive unavailable woman meeting an attractive single man, dealing with the struggles of their emotions and ultimately deciding that their eternal friendship is much more powerful than a weekend romp.",

Basically the mother of brother and sister Carolyn (Annie Corley) and Michael Johnson (Victor Slezak) has died, and in her will she gives instructions of a new death plan, being cremated and her ashes scattered off a bridge in Madison County, like the man she mentions, Robert Kincaid (Eastwood). In her box of possessions, she has written the story of her and Robert, and this is where the film goes to flashback. Italian mother and wife Francesca Johnson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) is alone for four days while her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) are away at the Iowa state fair. She sees a car pulling up to her house, it is Robert asking for directions to a bridge that he needs to photograph, and she decides to take him there. He takes the pictures and takes her back to the house, and she invites him in for a drink, and then a little later when he planned to leave for dinner. You can tell Francesca is really attracted to Robert, but we're not sure about him. Day 2, he comes back and they spend some more time together at the bridge again. It is later in the evening where they become a lot closer, and eventually kiss and end up in bed together. The next day there is a little squabble about the affair situation, and after day four he decides it is right that he should leave, and Richard and the kids (till now) never found out. Years later, Richard is on his death bed, and Francesca every year always visits spots Robert used to go on her birthday. Of course she discovers he has died when his attorney sends her many of his things. Carolyn and Michael of course understand how passionately their mother felt for Robert in those four days, and how the memory of him helped her survive till death, so they honour her wishes. A very touching story that you can feel more than one way about, i.e. is the affair wrong or right, and who should Francesca be with? It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Streep was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Passions.

            "review_title": "A Bit Flat Due to Flaws",
            "content": "I finally saw this film after vaguely hearing about it for years. It was a little different than I expected within the 'Iowa housewife gets swept off her feet by a mysterious traveler' concept.There seems to be an ideological split in the reviews of this film beyond the normal love/hate thing. It basically boils down to people who find the concept beautiful and romantic(as intended) and those who think all infidelity is repugnant and this film is a creepy justification for it. I'm not into those camps--I don't really like infidelity and yet the film has beautiful concepts and moments and maybe that can overcome the moral failings of infidelity at times. My bigger question is how does the film handle the concepts, material and characters?The concept of the film is interesting. I was surprised how short the span (4 days) covered is and how intense things got in that time. That is hard to portray. Streep is so lauded that I guess I expected more from her. She emotes well in the waterworks scenes but... Little things bothered me. One is her accent (which seemed off) and the exotica of how she is Italian, living in what seems a numbing and strange land to her. I think it would have been more interesting if she was a 100% Iowan corn fed housewife who Eastwood's character still felt was exotic and sublime. Her Italian aspect makes the exotica and romance seem too easy, too expected, too asked for in the middle of Iowa. Her portrayal is also slightly dense and even charmless, at times. It doesn't gel with the wise, worldly sounding old woman in the journals pleading people to follow true love, even if in the afterlife. This has a way of not only being a bit dull (who wants to watch a film about a charmless women receiving undue attention?) but also making us wonder why Eastwood is so interested in her. It's not that we think about all his travels and think 'why HER?' like she does in the breakfast scene. It's that even if he hardly ever met women, only from a small regional area, it would still seem strange he was so taken by this somewhat dense and boring woman, a woman reticent to follow her passion (even when given the opportunity of a lifetime). Eastwood simply does his Eastwood thing, but it falls right into charming, authentic, independent minded photographer, and it is no wonder why SHE is interested him. The last problem with Streep's character is her history. We don't know anything about it. We just see she's in this marriage and family, and maybe not thrilled about it. The sacrifice she makes, the boredom she feels under the surface, the lack of true love that gets brought out by Eastwood's character are a bit hard to have empathy for. We are left to assume she chose these circumstances under willing conditions. So on some level the almost victimhood we are expected to buy into in order to cheer on the infidelity and true love in the film is difficult to buy into. Her problems are her own fault and at the core, she's simply unwilling to rock the boat and do anything to make herself more happy and this cuts back on some of the heartbreak and empathy we feel at the end of the movie. I felt it more for Eastwood's character (though it is confusing why he took so strongly to her, he plays it well, and it is clear he's heartbroken). But I think it needed to be a total two way street for the film to work right.The bookend aspect of the kids learning about all this through things left after Francesca's (Streep) death is a cute idea to add some depth to the message of the movie. The lack of full development in the romance kind of demands a secondary element to enrich. But the acting is second rate and compared to Eastwood and Streep (even if it isn't their best work) it feels like parts of a Hallmark Channel movie pasted onto a real movie.The whole Bridges/charming Iowa countryside thing is a hook, a fun setting framing device. But I did hope they would do more with it. The history and draw of the bridges isn't brought into the meaning of the film at all. The cinematography is not very interesting or expansive, and the actual film minutes dedicated to the surroundings are limited. In fact, the film feels claustrophobic, with much of it taking place in the farmhouse kitchen/dining room. We get only the most limited and clich\u00e9 feel for small town Iowa life in the 1960's an how to a certain type of soul it would suck at the oxygen.Overall, this is a more flawed and run of the mill romance than I was hoping for.",

But that unnecessary atrocious Italian accent, why? It was thick in parts and then almost disappeared and during the narration towards the end it was just a bit weird. I don't recall her explaining how she came to be married to an Iowa farmer so a bit unbelievable. But she did a good job with what she had.I didn't get sparks from the short lived love affair. In every scene he just gave that bewildered look he does before shooting someone. Sorry Clint, you don't do romantic movies that convincingly.It was interesting seeing a lot of reviewers giving low marks because the movie involved infidelity and yet most of the movie showed Meryl Streep's character struggling with it and the grown children trying to come to terms with it. So they (the reviewers) totally missed the point. I enjoyed the second half more than the first. The emotion was more raw and it just laid out the affair for others to think what they will.It's a 6 for Meryl whom did well with a script that felt disconnected and the music and songs of the era dragged me along even if the story didn't.",

Concluding you've found it after a 4-day encounter is probably not the wisest decision you will ever make. It's an exciting escape, but of questionable value upon which to build a relationship. In only 4 days, they've already have two arguments. Francesca's family lets the door slam, which bothers her, but she takes no issue with Richard sitting at the dinner table and flicking his cigarette ashes on the floor. How long would that tolerance last? She plays Italian opera on the radio (does such a station really exist in rural Iowa?), which her children rudely change without even asking. Yet, she doesn't seem to care that the radio plays light jazz (not Italian opera) when Richard is there. Richard \"helps\" her in the kitchen for probably a grand total of 2 minutes while she does all the prep, cooking, and clean-up. True \"love\" is blind, I guess. A sentimental tale, but not realistic. And definitely not a moral lesson.",

Returning to the farmhouse Francesca who is on a roll asks him to dinner,she seems to get her lines from a supply of fortune cookies with gems such as \"We are the choices we have made\" and to break the tension,\"would you like some iced tea\" not exactly Noel Coward but hey this is Iowa. Francesca speaks with an accent that could only have originated in  a Mexican section of Boston. The rest of the Movie or as Roger would say the \"Film\" is a little hazy as naps kept interrupting my following of the story and vice versa. In the end \"The Bridges of Madison County\" leaves many questions,did Francesca pass on the secrets of life to her children? Did Robert go on to explore the mysteries of life such as the Subways of Paris or the poems of Bob Dylan? Did Francesca's husband ever plow the north forty?

Also, Meryl Streep's power-house performance helps elevate the film.'The Bridges Of Madison County' tells the story of Francesca Johnson, played by Streep, a lonely, insightful Italian housewife in Iowa. While her husband and children are away at the Illinois State Fair, she meets and falls in love with a photographer, Robert Kincaid, played by Eastwood, who has come to Madison County, Iowa to shoot a photographic essay for National Geographic on the covered bridges in the area.The film begins well, and the 1st interaction between the hero and heroine is charming. However, the writing falters in the middle, and even the pace dips. But, a emotional & challenging finale makes up for it. Richard LaGravenese's Adapted Screenplay offers some really nice dialogue, while Eastwood proves his mettle as a filmmaker yet again.

            "review_title": "When good adultery doesn't necessarily depend on bad marriage...",
            "content": "When an Italian girl falls in love with an American GI, she doesn't exactly picture the America of her dreams as a farm in Iowa. Yet Francesca has been a dedicated wife and mother for twenty years, as commitment meant something to those who bore the baby boom generation. But it didn't make their generation, nor any generation since the dawn of humanity, immune to a heated and passionate romance... especially when the mysterious stranger who knocks at your door is Clint Eastwood?Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese credited the actor-director for giving him the right advice when it came to adapt Robert James Waller's best-seller \"The Bridges of Madison County\". When a book is that popular, no need for extra plot elements that might alienate your potential audience without drawing a new one. Eastwood's point was that the story of a four-day romance between a housewife from Iowa and a free-spirited photographer was speaking for itself already, all a script had to do was keeping the material mature, and well... romantic.And Eastwood applied his own advice behind the camera. Not that he ever indulged to fancy directing or editing but he didn't let any artistic license deviate the story from the original romance. Indeed, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is about two adults, not bad persons, surrendering to the impulsiveness of a moment, not out of foolishness but precisely because only people their age are aware that destiny can sneak at anytime, and that unpredictable episodes are to be seized, no matter how brief the encounter. Doesn't that ring a bell? Eastwood intended to make an old-fashioned romance, it turned out to be the spiritual successor of David Lean's 1945 classic, the film LaGravenese saw after being advised to tone down his enthusiasm. And \"Brief Encounter\" was great because it ended with the right bittersweet tone. The husband understood that his wife was 'away' for awhile and wherever she went, he was glad she was back to him. It was the film's emotional peak, showing that marriage isn't an existential dead-end. Adultery can say a lot about marriage and responsibility, and sacrificing one's passion might be the price to pay for a memory you'll treasure for the rest of your life. And like the train station in \"Encounter\", bridges play the role of the connecting place. Robert Kincaid came to Iowa to shoot one of these picturesque bridges that could belong to a Southern postcard or a Mark Twain illustration. The city dweller and globe trotter loves the breath of Iowa and the charm of the landscape but Francesca didn't really pay attention until she walked across the bridge, which felt like a first time, as if there was indeed something new in the air. And Streep, like Eastwood, can say so much without speaking, the way she moves, walks and peeps into Robert say enough. And the way the romance slowly takes form is like a sparkle stirring up until it becomes a bonfire of emotions, and the performances of the two actors are integral to the romance's believability. Clint Eastwood plays it in a understated tone that hardly hides his vulnerability during some pivotal moments. When Francesca asks him for a tea, then a dinner, there's something in his \"yes\" that says \"I'm glad you asked\". And then you have Meryl Streep, in her first Oscar-nominated performance after five years (the longest she ever waited). She doesn't play the frustrated housewife, she's not even shy or ugly by movie standards. In the opening dinner scene, you can read in her saddened expression how estranged she had become to her own family, but she later warns her husband not to smoke and gently pats his cheek, she's a touchstone in her family. And it was the right touch not to depict the husband (Jim Haynie) as an abusive or bad man, you can make 'good adultery' without relying on a 'bad marriage.' That's a truth of life.Another truth, albeit less existential is that there's also a lot of smoking and drinking in the film, I guess a man always takes it as a good sign where a woman loosens up with him... but this isn't about sex, it's about creating the kind of atmosphere where Francesca and Robert can relax and be themselves. At one moment, Robert tells a funny story and it's less the story that matters but her body language, the spontaneous yet sensual way she lifts her legs, her childish excitement that makes her irresistible to the point of sexiness. She gets even more beautiful as days and nights go by, reaching their pinnacle in the last night before the departure, unlike \"Brief Encounter\", they have their moment and it's shown with enough lighting to make it erotic. Then comes the bitter 'morning after', a powerful argument and a choice to be made. For all the talk about love and life, the film manages to say more in quieter moments such as Eastwood staring at Francesca under the rain. Earlier, he was that dashing man with long white hair and a vigorous torso shining under the sun, then he looked almost bald with the eyes of a kicked puppy. And you have the climactic shot of Francesca's hand on the car's handle... will she decide to join his car or stay with his husband? The book was a wide success because of its polarizing dilemma. It's not about satisfying one audience in particular but making everyone understand either choice. As it's said in the film, \"we're all the choices we've made\" and there will always come a moment for regrets, apologies and forgiveness, even the husband has such a moment. And although their 180\u00b0 turn isn't as smooth and believable as the main story, Francesca's children embrace their lives with the spirit of that four-day but life-changing romance, one that says a lot about life, choices and commitment. After all, what good romance doesn't?",

It is a romantic movie that restricts the technical film-making to the minimum preserving the intimacy of the scenes.

Consequently the outstanding scene, shot in a car waiting at a red light, needs no talking, pure moving pictures. Almost with every scene the film makes you believe that what you see will happen now, cannot be missed and will be gone forever with the next frame. The drama is presented as one big flashback from the children's perspective. One may argue that this destroys the viewer's perspective and excitement now and then.

            "content": "This movie is good enough that even with multiple viewings, knowing what's going to happen, I'm choked up at the off-mentioned scene in the rain near the end.As noted elsewhere, the framing device of the adult children finding and reading Francesca's memoir doesn't work; their scenes are pedestrian at best. Even with this significant flaw, I consider BoMC a great movie. Think of coming across a Vermeer with a U-frame-it. The more you look at the actual painting, the less the frame matters. BoMC is almost that good.Robert and Francesca chance to meet in front of her farmhouse, as Robert has gotten lost looking for Roseman Bridge. Both are long settled into lives that make this meeting stupendously unlikely; he's a globe-trotting photographer and she's been in this house tending her family for nearly 20 years, although she hails from Baro, Italy, making her being there that way at all unlikely to begin with. She's been listening to opera beating dust out of a rug while husband and kids are off showing a prize steer at the Illinois state fair, where they'll be for four days.The two of them are in for a life changing relationship, although it seems at first like nothing more than a small detour for him and a break in the routine for her. They gradually awaken in each other dormant longings for a different kind of life than what they have. At the end of the four days, they are torn, and the movie works because we're torn with them.They have quite a lot to say to each other, but there's more than enough room for the dialog within the farmhouse kitchen, the exteriors around the bridge and the honky tonk joint they venture to on Wednesday, within the score and the Johnny Hartman love songs. (Who knew that old style radio with tubes in it could sound so good?!) Susan Sarandon (in Dead Man Walking) is the answer to who got the Oscar Streep should have won for her performance here, but she needed Eastwood to play against for that performance to have had the resonance it has. When Robert says he's not really an artist, I feel like he's speaking for Eastwood, telling us what he really would like to be but doubts he has the stuff for, although there's artistry there that Francesca connects with. In any event, without Eastwood's physicality, Francesca/Streep's transformation wouldn't make sense. Eastwood's acting is sometimes harshly judged, but I see him here fully inhabiting the character of Robert, perhaps because it's similar to his own.Forty years ago or more everything was \"poignant,\" to the point where the word was a clich\u00e9, but the word fits BoMC and the relationship between Robert and Francesca like none that I've ever seen in any other movie. The screenplay, the actors, the cinematography, and the score all work together.Many reviewers have objected to the movie's portrayal of infidelity, some so upset that it seems they've overlooked that this is a work of fiction. I could better understand the objections if Robert and Francesca's affair had a happy ending or was seen to have no consequences. Neither of these is the case here; both Robert and Francesca, having tasted the forbidden fruit, will never recover their previously settled lives, will forever experience a sense of loss. Meanwhile, Francesca's family will never know that anything happened, except that Richard expresses regret on his deathbed that he couldn't fulfill Francesca's dream, a scene that didn't ring true for me.Look at it this way: the book upon which this movie is based was wildly popular in spite of its prose being almost universally reviled by everyone with any pretension at all of literary taste. Were these many readers attracted by the opportunity to be offended by a tawdry affair? Isn't it more likely that there's much appeal from a story of unexamined lives, unrealized potential, the road not taken, of an exploration of what love is really about, even when the story is poorly written?In the end, I think the portrayal of what imperfect people might do seemed real enough to be upsetting to viewers who would prefer to see good people doing good things and being rewarded and bad people doing bad things and being punished. There are movies for these people, and to be sure, Bridges of Madison County isn't one of them, which makes it more interesting for the rest of us.",

Francesca is a housewife going about with her usual household duties and Robert is a photographer for the national geographic magazine. But the union of these two characters gives birth to something extraordinary. We pretty much see the movie through Francesca's diaries which are being read by her children. Reading it makes them realize that there was also a time when they themselves dreamed of more things. 'The Bridges of Madison County', is about unfulfilled dreams and that even though one doesn't always fulfil his or her dreams, it is better to have dreamed even if for a little while, than to not dream at all. On the technical side, Eastwood has kept everything delightfully simplistic. He uses a lot of symbolism with rain, bridges, heat. The soothing soundtrack, especially the piano pieces, and smooth cinematography are splendid. Meryl Streep is very sexy in her convincing portrayal of Francesca. I found her accent a little faulty as it sounds closer to Eastern European rather than Italian. Clint Eastwood is great as the loner photographer who finally wants to hold on to something he can't have. To sum it up, this lyrical movie is like a song, a song about dreams, about love and about living your life the way you want to, even if for a small period.",

It was all very obvious, not at all subtle and consequently embarrassing. Also, it was somewhat unrealistic, i.e., when, after they lovers have separated, Eastwood standing drenched in the pouring down rain just staring/glaring at Francesca in the truck. Francesca's \"nervous breakdown\" of despair in the truck. There she is choking back tears, collapsing into the corner of the seat, hands fluttering all around, while her husband rolls his eyes and keeps driving. Probably attributing it to \"womens' issues\". I mean, afterall, they were just discussing meatloaf. This thing with the hands was really distracting, it was like she had two pigeons tied to them, they fluttered around throughout the movie, but not in an \"italian\" way. More like a \"unwell Southern Belle\" or 1950s East Village beatnik chick.In general, I found Francesca rather unsypmathetic. She turns on the opera on the radio for dinner, her daughter comes in, turns it to rock n' roll. Francesca, the great martyr, sighs and rolls her eyes. There were some nice scenes, but the dialogue was SOOOOO heavy-handed and maudlin. Probably would have made a great stage play...lots of self-revelation.I enjoy Meryl Streep in most things, especially Sophie's Choice and Ironweed. And she wasn't exactly bad in this, but not particularly memorable, either. Eastwood's character, however, was just a rehash of Finch-Hatton/Redford in Out of Africa. He was ghastly. The most emoting he should ever do should be similar to that done in In the Line of Fire. That's about the extent of his range. Anything more just makes me squirm.Check out Brief Encounter.",

            "content": "The gift of a good story-teller is to tell the history behind the story without mentioning it. And that makes this essentially shallow story worth every minute.\nIngredients? Streep's complete surrender to the character's essential motivation to live, in all it's complexity. And Eastwoods complete surrender as a director, to sensitivity, unspoken truth's of characters, music etc.\nAnd last but not least that which is mentioned best in a German saying: 'the master shows himself in limitation'.\nNowhere the drama derails...For me personally i have to hold back my enotions everytime an American filmmaker shows in music and light what is so un-american: sentiment for the past and what is gone, and will never return. Eastwood is a master in doing that.\nThis sentiment expresses itself in the passing lives of unknown immigrants that build America as a nation. They live simple lives, like this Italian woman, giving her live to raise America's strength for the next generation. No statues, no recognition.\nIn this movie her simple live is pulled out in the light, sentimental, un-spectacular dramatic, told a thousand times,But it is True and Human.And 'truthfulness' is what makes this movie worth watching.",

            "review_title": "Eastwood makes a David Lean film",
            "content": "Based on the popular novel by Robert James Waller and with a script by Richard LaGravenese (supposedly shepherded along by Steven Spielberg when he was considering directing the project), Clint Eastwood's The Bridges of Madison County is a departure from the kinds of movies he'd been making for a while, but also seems like a counter to his earlier Breezy. This is the kind of film that David Lean was making with The Passionate Friends and Brief Encounter and would have fit more comfortably in his body of work than Eastwood's, telling a tale of temporary passion that gives away to more permanent states despite the pain of letting go. That Eastwood handles the story with such delicate tact and gentleness is a testament to his continually growing abilities as a filmmaker.After the death of Francesca (Meryl Streep) in the 1990s, her two children Carolyn (Annie Corley) and Michael (Victor Slezak) convene at the little Iowa farmhouse she had called home since coming to America from Italy decades before to deal with her affairs. In her safety deposit box, they find the opening to a narrative of four days in the mid-60s when Francesca had an affair with a National Geographic photographer named Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) at the same time that the children and their father, Richard (Jim Haynie), left home for the Iowa State Fair. One of my favorite things about this film is the framing device itself. It could have just disappeared for the bulk of the film, used merely as bookends to Francesca's story, but it gives the children the opportunity to see and learn from their mother's humanity one final time, giving them their own arcs that coincide with Francesca's.Francesca in the 1960s was a content housewife and former teacher who is seeing the end of her time as an active mother with both of her children no more than a couple of years from moving out to start their own lives. Richard is a good man, and she has nothing to complain about beyond the dreams of her youth that never came true. On her first day of relative freedom with the family gone, into her driveway arrives Kincaid looking for directions to one of the covered bridges in the county. Since the roads are hard to navigate without intimate knowledge of who owns which house, Francesca decides to just tag along and show him. That leads to Francesca offering to cook him dinner, and the two steadily see something in the other that is out of reach but right there at the same time.Francesca started her life in a small, eastern Italian town and jumped at the chance of marrying an American GI to see the world and make it to America, an exotic place, and what she got was the quiet life on a farm in the American heartland. Kincaid is a wandering spirit with no roots anywhere and sees himself as a citizen of the world. In him, she sees the kind of exciting life that she had promised herself. In her, he sees a kind of permanent companion who could share his wayward life. Steadily, over the next few days, they grow increasingly intimate until they feel like they are two sides of the same person.However, the contrast to Breezy is important, I think. Breezy was pure fantasy fulfillment, and The Bridges of Madison County edges into it for a time with Francesca feeling like she can have everything she wants if she simply leaves behind her simple, little life. However, real life has trade-offs, and despite the joys she feels in Kincaid's arms, she knows that her leaving would hurt a lot of people, most of all her good husband Richard. This really ends up feeling like Laura sitting with her husband after having just said goodbye to Alec in Brief Encounter. Francesca makes the selfless decision to stay for her family. There are a few other things swimming around this decision, mostly the feeling that the specialness of the four days will dissipate as soon as they go off together forever, a feeling that is selfish in its own right. She wants to preserve the feeling of love she harbors for Kincaid in amber forever.What gives all of this an extra dimension is the children. Michael can barely stand to listen to the tale of his mother's torrid love affair, but what he's actually going through is learning that his mother was human. Carolyn being a woman going through her own marital troubles has a base understanding of Francesca's mindset that Michael doesn't share, and she learns something different. She learns that life in a small town can be fulfilling, that dedication has its own rewards, and that maybe she can try to find common ground with her husband after all. It's a very good way to use the wraparound story to reinforce all of the thematic ideas in the core story while advancing it into the next generation.Acting is what really makes the movie beyond its script, and there's so much to appreciate. The center of the film is Meryl Streep as Francesca, pulling off an accent, of course, but she really does embody the character of a housewife with lost dreams given her chance to maybe live them again. Her final moments in the truck as she watches Kincaid drive away are wonderful. Eastwood is also good, though I think he understood his own limits. There's a bit of trivia that Eastwood turned away from the camera when it came to his crying moment, and I have a suspicion that he knew that he wouldn't be able to sell it all that well. He left it to the audience to interpret, and it was the right choice. The two adult children are very good as well, creating their own emotional arcs that really resonate.This is really a wonderful film. A quality script filmed well by Eastwood while he manages his actors to strong performances is a very good combination to build a movie on. Eastwood was on a bit of a tear in the early to mid-1990s, and this just continues it.",

            "review_title": "Magnificent romance from a distinguished director!",
            "content": "Few stars have had such a huge resurgence in Hollywood both on a popular and critical scale than Clint Eastwood, from Heartbreak Ridge in 1986 to the present. In his little masterpieces, he puts together beautiful photography, sentimental music (his other passion), and enthralling characters. He has covered a range of genres in his career, from action, westerns, suspense, and even musical biographies. The realm of romance is a new venture for Clint, and he follows through with it brilliantly. The Bridges of Madison County is Eastwood's foray into a different part of America's heartland, geographically and spiritually. Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) is a photographer for National Geographic who goes out on assignment to shoot the covered bridges of Iowa's Madison County. Through asking directions, he meets up with Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep, in another fine performance), a farm housewife. What separates this story from all other romances is that they are concerned their running away together will tarnish what strong feelings they already have for each other. Sometimes, the will of the spirit is greater than all else. Clint sculpts some amazingly lush and picturesque scenes, using landscape and atmosphere to his advantage. He is accompanied by a gorgeous score, composed by himself with Lennie Niehaus, simple but fitting to the background. I've often had a struggle trying to prove that Eastwood is more than just a \"make my day\" stereotype, but a real actor with real characters and real style. With Streep, I've had much less of a problem backing up the same argument. She is much more than just an actress sporting another accent each time she steps in front of a camera. I rank these two among the best in the business, having a genuine love for what they provide to an audience. This radiates with every scene they create, expertly and feelingly. It's very simple and very difficult to explain how romances are able to work for an audience without implying that it is delivering corn or crap. All I can establish is that if you can feel the chemistry working between the couple on the screen, it gets you every time. \"Bridges\" works for me big time, not just because I idolize these two stars, but because I got an intense calling back to the golden age of cinema, where you could cut the intensity of the actors with a knife. Eastwood and Streep show that they have learned from the days of classical cinema, revealing to us that the old ways still work and still pack a wallop. The Bridges of Madison County is a masterpiece, carefully crafted, lovingly performed and shot, and touchingly expressed. This is one of the best films of 1995. Rating: Four stars.",

It has everything: an engaging story, romance, passion, moral issues, believable characters, a good picture of the time period, excellent actors, beautiful scenery, etc.. Still, I do not fall head over heals over it in the way I did when I watched it at the pictures when it was new - 19 years ago. The movie has not changed, of course, but I have. I am older, more mature, and have more life experience - including a marriage, two children and a divorce.I can now see the story from the other side. Suppose, that I went away with the children for a few days, in an errand that was fun and good for the whole family. During this brief time, my husband should enter into a relation with a woman whom he considered much more exciting than me. More beautiful, with a more interesting background and profession, and a more exciting life-style... And the reason that I would be less exciting, would be that I - who maybe also had other dreams as a young girl - have given all I have for the good of our family...That would not feel very nice. Also, it would not feel very nice, if he died first, to find out that he has treasured a lot of mementos from this short affair. Without realizing, that the romance would soon have passed and the woman taken on ordinary proportions, if they had lived together in an everyday reality for some time.Basically, I think it is morally wrong to make a movie like this. It gives people the wrong ideas, inspires them to seek illicit love affairs and dampens their conscience, and can even cause family tragedies. Still, it is very good as escapism, if you keep in mind that that is what it is, and that it cannot happen in reality.",

Not only do I find her acting slightly bovine, but her insistence on involving herself - often rather erroneously and embarrassingly - in politics and legal matters makes it very difficult to distance that behaviour from her performances; a cautionary tale for actors: stick to acting!I didn't find Streeps performance in this adaptation to be particularly special, but through careful mental judo, managed to fall back on the Francesca created in my mind from the book.The movie remains close enough to the book to be engaging and is a sometimes welcome departure from reading a book I now know so well, I can recite every line from memory.",

The resultant love affair not only changes their lives forever, but also the lives of her children thirty years later.Eastwood's film is skilfully crafted, though it does have its faults, tending to be over long and self indulgent. Too many of the quiet scenes are drawn out, lessening the emotional impact of Richard LaGravanese's screenplay. Still, everything else is very professional.Editing may be under done, but all other technical credits are superb, especially the cinematography, which captures picturesque Iowa with aplomb. Jack Niehaus provides a melodic score. All this is strongly supported by two expert showings from Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. The former does very well as the citizen of the world who may have finally found someone to love for life. Streep is at her best as the ex-patriot Italian whose routine life is turned on its head by this perfectly charming stranger.\"The Bridges of Madison County\" is a movie for devotees of true romantic love stories, and for that audience this is a real treat.Tuesday, February 27, 1996 - Lorne Theatre",

The film is an exploration of how bonding between human beings does not always follow societal rules and norms, of the perennial dilemma of the head and the heart, nature and culture. With great sensitivity, The Bridges of Madison County lays out the relationship in its most honest form and raises the question as to whether there can be a correlation between the conventional, accepted norms and morality at all times. The acting is top-notch, with Meryl Streep essaying a character in agony as only she can. Clint Eastwood as an actor in this film is perhaps not as good as Clint Eastwood the director, but he still leaves behind a few priceless moments.In conclusion, it is a must-watch if you have a thing for romantic dramas.",

It's really just a two-character drama, with fine performances by the unlikely pairing of Streep and Eastwood. He's the person she'd like to be - a free spirit with nothing to tie him down - but ultimately her love and respect for her family and her sense of obligation to them win out. It's a movie about the heroism and work-ethic of motherhood and how much women sacrifice to care for their families, and it makes its point with great subtlety and insight. A very well-crafted film, with a powerful score by Lennie Niehaus and brilliant editing by Joel Cox. The key to developing character and drama with this type of story is to carefully control the editing to give the performances centre-stage, and this is a textbook example of such judicious pacing.

When you consider that the focus is on only two characters for the large proportion of the film, it is incredible that this does not become monotonous or repetitive in any way.What really got me was the intensity of the relationship that the two actors managed to portray, it is very emotional and very real. I was very impressed by Clint Eastwood. Would never have imagined him pulling off a role such as this, but he was fantastic. I personally love the scene where they are in the kitchen dancing. There are hardly any words exchanged throughout this entire scene, but that did not seem to matter, it was just such a beautiful part of the film. The whole thing is a very much a reflection of the normal way in which a relationship develops. No grand gestures, no over the top displays of affection as is common place when relationships are being developed in films.

This is his emotional and sensitive movie which forces us to think about whether we are enjoying our lives being where we are, or we still regret the decision we made in our lives. I was completely spellbound as the end credits rolled and really enjoyed every minute of this movie till its last scene. The story is about four days in the life of a happily married lady, which she lived with a complete stranger. She cherishes and remembers those four days till her last breath and leaves her diaries with all her confessions for her two grown up children to read. Meryl Streep is superb and lovable as the lady and Clint Eastwood himself plays the role of the photographer who accidentally comes in her life. The movie has some emotionally written scenes which have a spiritual value. The dialogues make you look inside your own life and question your own existence and its worth. The unsaid conversations between Meryl and her husband, who know everything are filmed in the most impressive way. The best part is that as the children read their mother's diaries, at first the boy feels disgusting reading it, but then understands the feelings of her mother who was also a loving women from inside. And its even more beautiful that at the end they both don't feel any guilt for their mother but feel proud at her innocence and truthfulness. Mahesh Manjrekar made \"Astitva\" in Hindi, inspired from this movie, but changed the sensitive topic into a tense drama which becomes cunning and sarcastic in the end. He kept the character of the lady alive to face all the hardships after her confession. Whereas the original movie is lovable till the last scene,the Hindi version has only one saving grace \"Tabu\" who has acted brilliantly. For many reasons, still \"Meryl Streep\" is more believable in her impactful act. She is just adorable in the scenes which show her inner conflicts. Along with \"Clint Eastwood\" they both look like real life lovers and talk through their eyes.This is a poetic expression on screen straight from heart, not to be missed, even if you have seen \"Astitva\" or not.",

During the conversation at the kitchen table in the farmhouse the two begin to become more involved with each other by exchanging background information. The result is a very deep emotional bond between two people who would never have met under ordinary circumstances. So they took advantage of the time they had together knowing within themselves that an opportunity such as this may never happen again.In a gentle presentation the audience is guided through the entire story from a chance meeting to a final resting place for two people who never stopped loving each other. The letter addressed to the children fully explains that this is not a sordid love affair or any act of betrayal. It is a story about a mother who still remained faithful to her immediate family but fell very much in love with a man who had a different lifestyle to offer her.",

            "review_title": "This kind of certainty",
            "content": "This movie was phenomenal. Perhaps it hit me harder because it has many parallels to my current love life. It's a typical love affair story but it brings so much more to the audience than an action many consider immoral. Powered by Meryl Streep's exceptional performance, Francesca comes to life from the cozy but passionless cornfields of Iowa. As an Italian war bride, her life has been entirely set around family and devotion to her household until she meets a traveling photographer, Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood), who boasts charisma matching that of Streep's. They fall in love and have a 4-day affair that inevitably has to end after Francesca's family comes back from a trip.While their affair follows the very fundamental story arc taught in Film 101, it was so expertly executed by the two now-veteran actors. Their chemistry was so evident that their goodbyes brought tears to my dry eyes. The buildup starting from exploring Francesca's motivation and romantic tensions with subtlety was also excellent, completely captivating the audience with their affair. There were very little explicit scenes but still remained much erotic. I also have to say the music was definitely my taste (slow jazz) and I thoroughly enjoyed the main theme as well.If there was a heap of affair-driven romance movies, this movie would have to stand on top. The beauty of this affair makes me wonder if affairs such as this one are so terrible (I have no excuses for long-term affairs). Without sounding pro-affair, Francesca would have been unable to stay devoted to her family and probably run away from the Iowa farm if this new drive in life did not occur. Robert would have continued his life as a no-name photographer without publishing any of his work. As a bonus, her story made her children rethink about their current marriages. I would say their affair was a net positive even though Francesca was not faithful.Does true love need to have an end result like living happily together until death do them apart? Was this love not meaningful as it was just a momentary product of boredom, passion and dumb luck? Though I don't know the answers to those questions, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" shows that in a world full of uncertainty, this kind of certainty is rare. That our passing moments can have a lasting impact on one's life and could be their reason to continue on with the rest of their time on this planet.",

            "content": "Ever since I was in the fourth grade and saw Dirty Harry on tv, Clint Eastwood has been one of my heroes. I have cheering for him ever since. Someone said that he dominates every scene he is in like a lion in a roomful of kittens! I have to admit that I was reluctant to watch this film at first. Its hard for me to picture Clint in a role where he doesn't punch out or shoot at least one person. And in a romantic role as well! I thought to myself no way! The Bridges Of Madison County had been a beloved best seller although I have never read it, but I am going to go looking for it tomorrow because Eastwood and Streep make magic on the screen in this sad but beautiful film. They have both never been better, she as a happily married but bored farm wife and he as a kind gentle National Geographic photographer with whom she has a four day fling with. People don't realize that Eastwood directs most of his own films, in fact he won Best Director Oscar for Unforgiven. I feel this is his best work. I have never seen a more beautiful film to look at when they show the lovely country scenery (you have to excuse me I grew up in West Virginia). This is a film that doesn't have action so the dialogue and interaction between Robert Kincaid and Francesca has to hold your attention and boy does it ever. Eastwood never liked to use much dialogue early in his career. In the \"No name\" Italian Westerns he tore out pages of the script and told them to give him minimal lines. He is wonderful in a role that really requires him to \"act\" in this one. They are very tasteful and discreet and showing the growing bond between Robert and Francesca (a less talented director would have had them both naked and in bed). Whats so sad in the end is that they realize what can never be and that they weren't meant to be together. It reminds me of that poem \"for all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these, what might have been\". It is interesting that they began the film years later after the main characters had died and it is her children finding out about it. I just hoped that Robert and Francesca were both together forever drinking iced tea and \"splitting the atom\" in Heaven. Bravo Mister Eastwood and Ms. Streep.",

            "review_title": "Decent film worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep, albeit one's willing to endure the contrived writing, middling supporting performances & weak framing device",
            "content": "\"Robert, I want you to come\" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years.This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody.A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big' \u2013 it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich\u00e9d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber \u2013 the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes \"This must be Robert Kincaid\" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye.Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.",

Eastwoods attempts to capture their process of understanding their mother and relating it to their present situations is ruined due to some poor performances by Annie Corley and Victor Slezak.  However, this is no reason to omit the movie from your consideration.The Bridges of Madsion County takes you into the hearts of these two individuals who share a precious moment in time that stays with them forever.

There was an insert  in National Geographic saying that they never had a photographer by that name and they never published an article about the bridges of Madison County.  But  when one watches the movie it seems to be based in a true story. Meryl Streep (One True Thing) won the SAG Award Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.  Kincaid and Francesca Johnson,  Meryl Streep,  meet while her husband and children are at the Illinois state fair. Francesca is  honest, sincere, homemaker. They are just two people that meet at a wrong time in their lives.\tThey fall in love in four days, a love that lasts forever. She cannot follow him because of her family and the whole story is sad. There are scenes where it is difficult not to cry. The scene where Kincaid comes back and it is really rainy. They see each other, she begins to cry and her husband is so oblivious that it takes forever for him to notice that she is crying. She grabs the door handle of the car, but she cannot go. It is an asphyxiating scene.  Another touching scene:  she has grey  hair and her husband  is old and sick and he tells her \"I  knew you had dreams but I could not make them come true.\" \t \tThe story telling is terrific as well as the photography.  I love how the story is told by her kids, and how they go through their mother's  things and how that affected their lives. She tells them that \"As one gets older ones fear subsidizes.\"  True! There are movies about the same topic but the audience is made to pass judgment, but in this one it is tough to judge. The characters are so lovable and sincere.  \t \tThe ambiguity of  the situation leave the audience torn between love, right and wrong and makes the audiences reflect in their own lives.

A story of a woman (Francesca) never had a reason to question her life. A loving husband, two grown kids and a life she grew accustomed too. When her husband and kids leave for the state fair on Illinois it gives her time to deep clean and catch up on chores. When a stranger pulls into their driveway asking for directions to (Roseman Bridge) it spark the beginning of her questioning her own life.Seeing Clint Eastwood in a movie as a love interest is a special treat, for a actor most famous for playing cop's, westerns and raunchy comedies. Yet Clint has done it all (acted in every genre there is for a movie, written screenplays, directed, produced, released about a dozen records (mainly country music) am I forgetting anything. His acting by his own direction is top notch. Meryl Streep on the other hand is acting or Hollywood royalty at it's finest. Together they light the screen up and takes us the viewer on an emotional ride we'll never forget. For the few days they spend together are magical and both Clint and Meryl doesn't fail to deliver the goods.The main base is; her two children arrive at her house after she passed for the reading of the will. It the items they start with are a letter and key to her hope chest. Inside they find four journals that the summer of 65 and her affair she kept secret. It also contained her final wish to have her cremated and her ashes spread by the bridge where the man she loved was spread.I assure you that this movie though a bit slow to give the viewer the feel of being there. Every time I watch my eyes are glued to the TV and swept into the story itself. Their performances alone are powerful and the scenes are breathtaking, the score only adds to this spectacular movie. I also love it as though it is a fictional story based around two characters the movie itself comes off as a real past event.",

I found their romance by no means unbelievable.Let's give screenwriter Richard LaGravanese some credit-although he bit it a bit with his directorial debut \u0091Living Out Loud', he's right on target here.

The books felt like it was a betrayal at the end, and I did not appreciate the choice that she made to stay in the marriage instead of go -so I had no desire to see the movie. Then years later I saw a stage musical adaptation and that was OK. I didn't particularly feel drawn into the characters, but I appreciated the performances if you know what I mean, so I finally decided to give this movie a chance after all it had Meryl Streep in it. How can I pass that up? ? And I was really surprised at the tenderness and believability Clint Eastwood showed in his chemistry with Meryl Streep -especially when he said to her \"why should I want what I can't have\" that's probably paraphrased, but that was a very moving moment I was impressed with the believability of it, and when all is said and done the way, the screenplay worked having the children find this all out after the fact after her death, etc. Was touching and was easier to accept the decision she made, knowing how difficult it was -/having that scene where she wanted to run out of the car for example, little nuances like that made it seem more of a understandable ending than I felt the book communicates , so I actually preferred this movie to the book and I had empathy for the characters. Movie was well acted well directed, beautifully filmed- and the ending did bring a tear to my eye so it got eight stars from me .",

They drive out of town on further day trips to jazz joints etc .When Francesca's 4 days of being alone are almost up ( before her family returned ) she , without provocation , lashes out at Robert ( who was consistently genial & gentlemanly - for a man who's sleeping with another's wife ) , angry that she had reduced herself to just another one of Kincaids romantic trysts from around the globe .\nHer anger didn't stem from any post-coital , adulterous regret or guilt about back-stabbing her poor husband ; but from her insecurity about being a plain , uninteresting farm wife who lived in the middle of nowhere and her longing to be special to someone exotic like Robert Kincaid .\nAfter her unkind ( & uncalled for ) attack , Robert Kincaid , always the gentleman , doesn't respond in kind , but shockingly rises to the occassion , assures her that his association with her is special to him and puts his money where his mouth is by asking her to leave with him , risking his own heart , instead of taking a more convenient ' wham, bam, thank you Ma'am ' exit .\nMollified , Francesca packs up to elope with Robert, feeling validated & special . On their final dinner in the house, after getting whatever she wanted from Robert , Francesca hypocritically decides that now, her husband , Richard doesn't deserve to be treated so badly by her & neither do her children .\nRobert Kincaid , who could've left unequivocally after a passionate 4 day tryst , enjoyed by both sides , now has risked his heart after the admission of love & the offer to elope , forced out of him by Francesca's abusive tongue-lashing from before .\nHe leaves the house broken-hearted, telling her that she may change her mind after her family arrives & that he will still be in town for a few more days - where she may see him & decide to leave with him after all .\nIn the end we see Francesca out shopping with Richard ( who is clueless about his two-faced wife ) when she runs into Robert who's very painfully & heartbreakingly , standing in the rain without compromising her publicly , waiting to see if she'll leave with him .In the end , Francesca was neither true to Richard nor to Robert - she just used both men . She cheated on her husband and broke Kincaid's heart .Richard Johnson dies years later , never finding out the truth about how his wife abused his faith & Robert Kincaid dies being true to his illicit & misplaced ' love ' , thus never giving himself the chance to find real , clean love in a legitimate relationship with an honourable lady .Apparently this wasn't enough for Francesca who , after her death leaves journals for her middle aged children to catch up with their mother's thrilling indiscretion . Francesca claims she's being honest with them but like an exhibitionist , includes unnecessary erotic details .\nThe only good outcome from the illicit passion was that after reading the journals & reflecting on the contents , Francesca's two children take a second look at their own lives & troubled marriages , with the son deciding to repair his relationship with his long suffering wife & the daughter deciding not to be a doormat to a philandering , weak husband.",

Four days, you decide that a guy ambling through town is the love of your life? Hollywood is pathetic. I kept trying to care about these people and about the clich\u00e9'd housewife who agonizes over whether to leave her husband and her children and run off with a guy she just met. We love and romanticize what we don't have and take for granted what we do. --Especially since we only see their best side in the beginning, while trying to compare that with the reality in which we live. Hollywood loves and elevates the superficial and denigrates truth and reality. It's possible that the only way lovers like these could remain in love with such a fantasy is precisely because they never dealt with real life together. It might not have been so romantic. Maybe they would even have discovered that they weren't as compatible as they thought. Still, the mysterious man of the world \"that got away\" is what makes women cry. I'll tell you what I find romantic. The couple who has been through hell and back together and still get butterflies at the sight of one another.On top of all of that.......Streep is overrated in this.

When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, \"The Bridges of Madison County \" and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. \" I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one.\" she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me \"True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone.\" Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.",

I Should think that that would be no surprise to anyone who loved the book, since the film does no real justice to the heart of the novel! What do I mean? Well, that is both somewhat complicated and simple. But in short the screenplay writers and indeed the director have taken a novel which was about a man who was a poet, a visionary and a shaman, (Who was almost completely out of, and beyond time,) and basically turned him into a two bit prick with pants! And if that wasn't bad enough they have also turned the lead female character into a midlife dissatisfied housewife who needs some action, when in the original she was a real, European woman, found as if by surprise in the UnDead Midwestern state of OHiO-IoWa, simply in awe of a man who faced the world completely on his own terms, and who was quite unwilling to try to \"civilize\" him! I knew, when I saw an interview with Meryl, about the upcoming film, that this adaptation was going to be a total hack job! In the interview she stated that she was given assurances, from Mr. Eastwood, that \"all that wordy, poetic stuff\" that was in the novel, would NOT be on display in the film.That was also when I knew that the woman I fell madly in love with, who made such an amazing character as Sarah Woodrough, in the incredible film \"The French Lieutenant's Woman,\" was not the same as the characters she has played {big surprise.}I would then conclude that Ms. Streep is far more likely to be like the character she plays in films like \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" than any character she played, when she was a younger actress!",

The construction of this intimacy is, as expected, totally classical. Creating increasingly closed shots when contact between protagonists occurs, thus portraying their closeness.\nBut beyond the usual mastery to direct and tell a story that Eastwood pours on the film, what is truly remarkable ends up being the relationship between the viewer and the story. A relationship as intimate as the one between the two protagonists.\nIn a very personal way I must say that the great achievement of this film seems to me to be the way in which it reminds us of what cinema is.. An art like no other, capable of transmitting feelings and generating a personal relationship with each viewer of in a different way, through genuinely beautiful human images and stories. It would be nice if there were more films capable of achieving this today, but it is not.

            "content": "I thought the book was much better....For instance, upon showing Robert the bridge, Francesca is actually a little bit annoyed that right away, this man become so absorbed with it that he seems to have forgotten about her.Streep portrayed that feeling beautifully, particularly in the tone of her voice, when she says something to the effect of 'I can wait, I have time', more to herself than to Robert. But then, annoyance becomes attraction, as we recall the general belief (albeit somewhat male-centered) that to a woman, a man is most attractive when he is fully absorbed in his work. The relationship develops in a wonderfully relaxed pace, with dropping her off home, 'care to come in for a coffee?', 'would you like to stay for dinner?'..all nice and friendly until Robert asks one question too many, although quite innocently, 'ever thought of leaving your husband?' Even with profuse apologies, the parting was a little shadowed.Calming down, Francesca reflects that she might have reacted too strongly, drives to the bridge in darkness and leaves a note to invite Robert back to dinner the following day. After seeing the note, Robert calls to accept the invitation, but asks Francesca to join him at the bridge at twilight as he wants to do some work there first. They then separately carry on with the day, Francesca going to buy a new dress for the occasion while Robert goes about with his business. But then, at lunch, he witnesses how a woman known to be having an affair is received in the restaurant (this is one of those small communities where everybody knows what everybody else is doing). Concerned that being seen with him might compromise Francesca, he calls her to give her the opportunity to back out. She seems unperturbed, they meet at the bridge, nothing untoward happens.",

            "content": "So what? Those are the words I wanted to say after I watched this movie. The number of women who sacrificed their own interests for their families all over the world ever since is countless. What is so special about this plot? Francesca is no exception having a dilemma to choose between dream and duty. Thousands of women strangled the throat of their own dreams and desires under the pressure of society just as Francesca did. The movie is overall slow and sad type. The only thing I intend to emphasize on is Meryl Streep. I really wonder why people respect this \"award-winning\" actress so much! She is simply pathetic and a clown. She has terrible problem with her hands, especially in this one, she constantly touches her own cheeks, throats, arms, parts of her dresses, this and that, other things, failing to decide what to do with these hands, where to put. She speaks in the most inaudible way as if having an uttering problem, drugged or drunk or sleepy, as if the words are rolling out of her mouth! In all the movies she plays all these same \"too-good-too-simple\" type female leads. She has got one and only one idea of acting in the world, just leaning her head on one side and a simple smile and a line-delivery that sounds like stoned. I am really curious how can she even survive in the film industry. If one looks at the movie databases, one would find that Ms Streep either practically begged for some roles on her hands and knees at times, or some other times said she would rip some other actress's throat out for getting the desired role! What is the matter with this woman? I am really curious. Film industry does not have to be so stupid in the first place. Clint Eastwood is quite lovely in this movie, and believable as an irresistible magnet to lonely housewives. I have a feeling that he should have thought about doing such roles more than those western movies or one of those stereotype sullen face cops with creased foreheads who never smiles. I do not know if it has ever occurred to him.",

I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit.To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.",

Eastwood's attention to detail and his unnerving eye for a good script help to ensure that this is much more than a vehicle for entertainment, and help to confirm both his extraordinary range and his place in American cinema.The nature of human desire necessitates the film's moral ambivalence, but it is most of all an affirmation, in an increasingly material age, of the deeper values and feelings that make us properly human.",

And she, tragically, realises exactly the same of him...Robert J Waller's novel is adapted awkwardly here thanks to the imposition of a weak and unconvincing framing narrative involving the children of Francesca discovering her secret love days after her death.  Their needs and loves are irrelevent to us, the viewer (and are treated lamely by Eastwood the director), because we want to follow the story of pure love between Kincaid and Francesca: A love that exists tangibly for four days but is metaphysically timeless.  This part of the movie offers a romantic drama of considerable grace and power in which Eastwood gives a performance of great strength opposite a Streep of staggering excellence.  The closing scenes in which they see one another for the final time - and then she receives his most treasured belongings after his death - are so painfully moving that they will sear into the memory of anyone who has ever really loved and lost; long after the rest of the film has become a blur.",

And this amazingly sensitive and warm piece of work is the best of his four-star flicks...His wife has described Clint's character in this, Robert Kincaid, to be the most like the actor in personality out of all his characters... If this is true, then he really deserved to get to where he is. What a gentle, kind man... Clint takes a break from the tough guy cowboy/cop, and takes on a warm-hearted and charismatic photogorapher who doesn't have a threatening bone in his body... He does the part almost flawlessly, showing some real emotion, this a truly three-dimensional performance from Clint.......But it must be said that he pales in comparison to his partner Meryll Streep. I had only seen her in one film before this - Angels in America - and back then, I was just outright impressed. But after this...WOW... What a perfectly emotional and teary performance... We really feel for her on every level... A role worthy of its Oscar, Meryll's 11th nomination I believe... WOW, again...There is no action in this flick... Yes, it will bore your average Scarface/Bad Boys action seeking teen... But if you're patient and can get past a rather slow opening, you will LOVE this... I think this is the kinda film that housewives watch and cry together on their girls' nights... It is just that touching... Exciting? Not really, it's completely laid back and easy-going..

            "content": "I like these type of films which follow the relationship between two people all the way through without focusing too much on other characters. 'The bridges of Madison County' does just that. About 15 minutes into the film Clint and Meryl meet for the first time and the majority of the film is about the blossoming relationship between them from that first moment. The performances were so great from both of them and Meryl Streep captured the Italian accent so well. The surroundings were very beautiful too, i don't know if this was really filmed in  Iowa or not but the beautiful surroundings fitted the film perfectly. It's a very slow moving film but that works very well for this genre. I found it to be one of those types of films were you can't miss a single word, i needed total and complete silence and i couldn't take my eyes away for a single moment. Also this would have to be the most moving and romantic tearjerker i have ever seen. Unmissable entertainment.",

Although the situation was not exactly the same, I once had to let go of someone that meant everything to me, for reasons much like the same in the movie, this person had to leave my life. I had this person only a short amount of time, and when it came to an end my world of course had to move on, but the time we had left an impact on my heart, although years later those imprints are still there. Right after this happened, my friends bought me the book on tape, knowing at the time they could never convince me to read the book. I appreciatively took the tapes and a few days later slide the first into the tape player. I was immediately amidst the beautiful relationship that happened between these unique beautiful people. I couldn't stop listening, and stayed up an entire night, letting the novel flow through my ears. I laughed and I of course cried. I have read the book numerous times now, it sets above me on the shelf and I still read it from time to time. Seeing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised, Hollywood had not destroyed the novel, like many books are destroyed. Although the movie had been changed a bit, it was still moving and conveyed the sentiment and the beautiful relationship that Fran. and Robert. I cried tears at the theater like I had never cried before for any other movie. I can't count the number of times I have seen the movie to date, I don't watch it daily, or monthly, but from time to time, I need to feel what I feel when I watch it. I can never believe how I get sucked into the movie time and time again, and without a beat I cry and truly wish she'd open the truck door and run to Robert. Yet, I completely understand, sometimes...sometimes...true love has to wait, b/c life often steps in the way.I realize that many find this movie about an affair that should have never happened, about an unfaithful wife. However, in life, sometimes things happen, which, as hard as it truly is to understand you just cannot control. I believe it was probably one of the few times in Fran. life that she was true to herself. Many may find that selfish. But as the movie says, \"love like this comes but once in a lifetime.\" Many and most people people will never find the true love that was conveyed in this film, and often enough, when you find it, it's truly not yours to keep, but it is nice to have, at least for awhile, I for one can attest to that. The movie is beautiful and I feel that Meryl and Clint were perfect and convincing for the roles they played.",

            "content": "I suppose I have seen every Eastwood film ever made. Some are a great deal better than others but surely this has to be his very best both in the role of actor and director. The character of Robert Kinkaide is so fitting for the mature Eastwood. Gone is the macho, tough icon of earlier movies and in this we see a developed whole actor at total ease with himself both in front and behind the camera. I can watch this film again and again because it is so lovely. It's a gentle film that takes the audience along with it so convincingly. There is not one moment of over acting. The narrative is believable and the ending is exactly correct. Eastwood has created a wonderful atmosphere of high summer in Iowa, you can feel that intense heat that surrounds them. The film is flawless, a rare thing.  Meryl Streep, an actress whom I don't always enjoy, surpasses herself as the perfect partner for Eastwood in this movie. This is possibly the best love story that I have ever seen. There is no gushing,Hollywood sentimentality and of course no violence,course language or gratuitous sex perhaps thats why it works so well. I urge all lovers of the art of film making who have not seen this movie to watch it objectively and admire the craft of a truly great director /actor. I cannot believe anyone could criticize this film, When one thinks of  some of the garbage that wins Oscars, it shows just how silly the Academy Awards can be. A film for men and women alike because I feel we can all, to some extent, identify with the two characters. Simply a masterpiece.",

For those who have read the book, the film follows the Waller's romantic endeavor about an unattached National Geographic photographer and a naturalized Italian/American housewife in the mid-west. Perhaps contractual or legal aspects of bringing this novella to the screen resulted in an Eastwood/Streep tandem. Streep is a great American actress with tons of credentials. Eastwood has proven his worth in both acting and directing. Without naming anyone, I feel that several other male/female tandems could have made this movie \"Great\". As it stands I credit it with a respectable \"6\". Streep's italian accent was off the mark and once more she looks as much Italian as Katie Hepburn.

Francesca finds new strength through a romantic, sensual, albeit a very short affair with a worldly and sensitive photographer. I don't approve of adultery yet I cannot fully condemn it here. The film manages to depict their affair as a naturally evolving, mature relationship, as if a ten-year-long relationship were condensed into four days. It is mainly due to Meryl Streep's vivid acting that the affair appears neither trivial nor lewd. Her performance radiates all the love, longing, and passion of Francesca. Clint Eastwood was very believable and had the right chemistry with Streep, but I found his directing sometimes a bit too slow, though overall he created a nice atmosphere for Francesca's story. The only major complaint I have are the two actors who played the grown-up son and daughter. They were always overacting and were rather an annoyance to watch.",

But Eastwood's choice of himself as Kincaid and Streep as Francesca were almost as bad as the polyglot of actors who portrayed her children (except that they were inexperienced actors apart from being miscast). If you really liked the book/story, picture this for the movie: Sam Elliot as Kincaid and Katie Capshaw as Francesca. If you can't picture it, check out the earlier TV film, a modern romantic western, \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1987, I think), in which Elliot and Capshaw paired in lead roles. Pure love chemistry. Add a little subtlety (and teach Elliot to handle a Nikon camera properly, which Eastwood neglected to learn), and we'd have had a great, instead of a good, flick.",

Everyone who has experienced falling in love in a truly ecstatic way will be touched. Streep is fantastic an actress, as she knows to convey emotions sometimes without having to say a word!The absolute climax of the movie is the heartbreaking scene where Francesca (Streep) sees Robert (Eastwood) for the last time. Robert sits in his truck, waiting for Francesca (sitting next to her husband in the truck behind him) to come to him and leave together. She wants to, but cannot. She firmly holds the door handle, pushing it to almost unlock while her doubts are tearing her apart. Robert lingers at the now already green light to buy her time. Her husband starts blowing the car horn (\"what's this guy waiting for?\"), not having the faintest idea what's going on... Your heart can only cry \"Go to him, go!\", but it won't happen.

With just the right amount of passion, frustration and limited hopelessness, she brings out in her character what it was Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) found so irresistible. Eastwood, on the other hand, portrays the kind of world-traveling photojournalist I wish I could have been.  Here-in lies my personal affection for the movie ~ the combination of a painful love destined to haunt these two characters for the rest of their lives, and the excitement of Robert Kincaid's profession.I recommend \"The Bridges of Madison County\" to anyone willing to suspend reality for a couple of hours and get lost in a fanciful celluloid encounter, not intended to strain the brain but to entertain.",

Then I told my good friend to read it though she had just started to learn English. She begged me to read the paragraphs for her though other people had warned her against reading this novel,which might mislead a woman(they said). I did and I tried to explain it to her. We found we both had tearful eyes when reading Francesca's \"fare-well\" letter to her son and daughter. We were especially touched by her last sentence in the letter: Go well,my children.I saw the film myself and then tried to search for the novel in the Chinese version. I have failed to do so but have not lost hope.Now, I must tell whoever happens to read this comment of mine something for them to make their own judgments. I met two American engineers from Iowa last month and we talked about the novel and the film.

Two things that made this movie interesting to me were the sharp plot and the cinema picture of 'the good America', early 60-ies farmland Iowa. Looks like the way you imagine it yourself, reading fi Steinbeck books reflecting it's culture. For updated feminism (that's early 60-ies ; the population drafted for Nam a few years later) the movie shows a nice contrast in it's public appearance and expression (look), meanwhile some still actual similarities too (relational emotional conflict and decision) ; it's a 1995 movie. The movie is well filmed and certainly not sentimental fi looking through the eyes of a Madison county judge. You notice the community in it's reactions, before the emancipatory development /not stimulated to 'try or do' that/ ; it's very consequential on your everyday legal American reality (she's like Redfield if you skip the emotion) / mad is son feel red/ same town etc ; she finds another answer (see movie plot). The conflict (right choice or not) is presented (intuition and directive talent probably) quite in line with Freud's writing on the female Electra-complex ( it's a more frequent conflict in female deciding minds). Nowadays communities and it's 'procedures' are more tolerant liberal dealing with these themes thanks to progress (question yourself if this is true or merely contract appearances of contract reality) etc. This and even more makes the movie good and interesting ; it easily takes you along in it's 'American Shakespearian' drama development. I would therefore recommend this movie for a priority position in the Amazon IMDb 250 ; watch it if you want to see a mature relational movie, listening to the right voice telling the story./Meryl streep/(by the way, I'd rather nominate her an Oscar for this role since she does very well in Bridges of Madison) Frederick Barendse 13-5-14",

But said man's words, style, and genuineness begin to falter rather too quickly for comfort. Maybe it begins with that shower--our thin lover we find is also a very masculine, muscular heroic type male. And then his words become rather trite and at times out of character--in fact his character and his claim to being a special male show through. To cap it off this interlude of friendship, which at times is so compelling as friendship, and would make one of the most revolutionary of Hollywood movies if it stuck with this theme, simply reverts back to the sexual encounter formula. So what we are left with is her drama: should i leave with this new lover before hubby comes back from the fair, or stay put in a good, if somewhat limited, marriage--to a very reliable, and trustworthy male.After she makes her choice, there is a long, drawn out ending, which is so utterly commonplace that even the most involved viewer must wonder just what went wrong with this movie that it has to end with these sorry platitudes. My answer would be the shower scene--which is very much like a long haired man (our male here is described as a \"hippy\" by the towns folks) feeling the need to balance that off (or off the map) with a superman type torso. This is not a new man story, but rather a confirmation of the forever man who has sex with a woman and then goes off on his horse.",

I really enjoyed this picture, it takes my heart and hug my soul. A very big congratulations for Master Eastwood, for me one, of the best 20 directors on history, and also, a very good actor. And, Meryl Streep, my favorite actress, is absolutely awesome in her role. This is a REAL romantic movie, very different to others romantic movies like Casablanca (A great movie, a perfect ten thanks to it perfect screenplay, direction, acing, etc... but I don't like the plot, I think it's tawdry, unreal) :)",

I realize people may quickly become infatuated with each other, but for the nomad photographer to invite this married Iowa farmwife to spend the rest of their lives - based on a couple of days - together was intellectually insulting. 3.

I can understand why some people would say so - in one sense I suppose not a great deal does happen but I like it in terms of the depiction of companionship, the way the two main characters naturally grow closer during the few days they have together. There are some nice pieces of dialogue and I did feel quite emotionally connected to Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streeps character). I thought it had a somewhat similar feel and pace to it as the recent film version of Our Souls At Night, which stars Robert Redford.\n\nThis film certainly won't appeal to all but I liked it as a bit of an easy and comforting watch and it'd take a strong person not to feel at least a little emotional at times, so I'd say its an effective film.

            "content": "My 2022 quest to see all films starring Meryl Streep continues.\n\nThe Bridges of Madison County is a lovely romantic drama that gently unveils the four-day relationship between a lonely Iowa housewife and a world traveling photographer that occurred in 1965.\n\nThe film opens in \"the present\" as siblings Michael and Carolyn Johnson arrive at their childhood farmhouse to settle the estate of their mother, Francesca (Streep).  They are puzzled when it is revealed that their mother has requested to be cremated and that her ashes be scattered at the nearby Roseman Bridge, rather than being buried next to her husband.  As the two begin going through their mother's belongings, they discover that she once had a very brief yet intensely meaningful affair with professional photographer Robert Kinkaid (Clint Eastwood).   As they begin reading the journals in which Francesca detailed her time with Kinkaid, the two children come to understand their mother in a more mature way as they also question the trajectories of their own lives and marriages.\n\nFrancesca is an Italian war-bride whose marriage was, at least partially, a means to relocate to the United States.  As the story unfolds it becomes obvious that small farm life in Iowa was not what her dream had been, but it was now her reality.  When her husband and two children head off to the State Fair, Francesca elects to stay home in order to have four days to herself.  Fate intervenes when photographer Kinkaid arrives in her driveway to ask her for directions.   He's visiting Madison County to photograph its covered bridges for National Geographic magazine.  Francesca offers to ride with him to help him find Roseman Bridge and the two strike up a conversation that leads to dinner as the two discover their mutual admiration for each other.  Neither has any intention of advancing things beyond friendship and discussion.\n\nStreep gives a reserved and authentic performance accompanied with her Italian-Americanized accent.  This role garnered Streep with one of the twenty-one acting Oscar nominations she has received.  She unveils the mundane despair that Francesca endures with a magnificent deftness.  Francesca's history is fully established through Streep's facial expressions and physicality.   Eastwood, who is the film's director, is sublime as the earnest and passionate Kinkaid, a character keen from his observations of life and the bigger world.  It's a wonderful departure from the gruff and angry characters he typically plays.  \n\nMy one complaint with the film is that the actors playing Francesca's adult children in the \"current day\" scenes are quite dreadful.  In fact, the first 15 minutes of the film set in current day is like watching a poorly directed and poorly acted junior high school production.  The staging is bizarre, and the dialogue is utterly contrived.  Then switch to the past and Streep and Eastwood somehow convert that junior high feel into a Broadway production.  The transitions are jarring because of the drastic contrast in acting skills between the two time-periods.  Thankfully, Streep and Eastman prevail\u2026 as does the film.  It's a touching tale, and one well worth experiencing.",

The crisp and the uneasiness is bred, without any flirty talks and the way it surfs around the edgy with a shady note, is stupendously breathtaking. The attraction depicted in here plays a vital role and the makers being aware of the strength of the cast, milks it out from them that lures the viewers in, in its innocent bubble. The background score is mesmerizing, the cinematography is pure magic with fine editing and well detailed camera work. \n\nContrary to premise where it suggests it has a limited span to be spent upon, the feature is maturely calm and soothing where eschewing their characters appropriately, the actors cast in their spells in a subtle tone. The narration is adaptive, elaborative and exquisite with gripping screenplay and pragmatic conversations. \n\nSculpted to communicate for subsequent generation, the tale speaks volume metaphorically in those calm silent pitches that is harrowing and heartwarming at the same time. Streep is a revelation in her convoluted and unsure portrayal that is probably one of her best and underrated performance and on the other hand Eastwood is poised and reserved, supporting her thoroughly in each aspect.\n\nLaGravanese's exquisite adaptation gets better execution than anticipated from Eastwood's deck and is probably his finest act.

Nonetheless, Meryl Streep impresses as always by losing herself in her role, and Clint Eastwood is able to hold his own opposite her.  The tragedy of unrealized dreams is also easily relatable.  The film is a good choice if you're in the mood for a dramatic love story (and perhaps a good cry).",

Meryl Streep also gives a good performance, in fact this is one of the very few starring roles of the actress that I've seen.

            "content": "What makes \"The Bridges of Madison County\" so romantic is its pulsating desire, slow like honey and sultry summertime heat.  Famously, the film is considered to be better than its source material - whereas Robert James Waller's novel of the same name is said to contain passages schmaltzier than your favorite Hallmark channel TV-movie, Clint Eastwood's 1995 adaptation converts syrup into lush longing.  It is about two people who find a love rare and certain but choose not to go through with a relationship due to responsibility and circumstance; we feel their burning for one another ripple throughout our bodies, affecting us at every turn.  Most romantic melodramas choose to go the happy ending/tragedy route; \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is such a successful foray into a genre because it places painful reality into a sublime mixture of cinematic tenderness.  \n\tMost are still familiar with the story twenty years after its introduction: it frames the four-day love affair between Italian housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep, who completely disappears into the role) and National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), who accidentally fall into each other's lives after Robert innocently stops at Francesca's house for directions to the nearby Bridges of Madison County.  What begins as an exchange of manners turns into something more after she decides to follow him along on his photography excursion instead of politely moving on.\n\tFour days is a short time for anyone to fall head over heels in love, but Francesca and Robert have an uncommon connection - it only takes a few late night talks for them to discover that they were made for each other.  But, alas, she is happily married, with two teenage kids; her husband, a working man, is kind to her, fond of her company.  Her children need her more than ever.  But for Francesca, who moved from Italy to Iowa because of the union, there is something left to be desired - and Robert fulfills everything her spouse cannot.  He is considerate of her emotions, aware of her hidden talents.  He sees her as a remarkable woman rather than a dutiful housewife.  The climactic sight of her clutching her husband's truck door, contemplating whether to jump out and run after Robert, is devastating - to stay is painful, but to leave would be a tidal wave of brutal catharsis.  \n\tThe entire romance is told through flashback - as \"The Bridges of Madison County\" opens, the children of the now deceased Francesca are brought to her Iowan home to look over her will, discovering the affair after finding a trio of journals that chronicles those meaningful four days.  This narrative device would be manipulative anywhere else, but in Eastwood's no-nonsense hands, it makes the story all the more poignant.  Now adults with marital troubles of their own, Francesca's children are old enough to understand just how sacred romance is - and how much of a generous tragedy it was for their mother to give up the passion of a lifetime for them.\n\tWith Eastwood at the helm, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" teeters on the sappy, but, for the most part, remains a plausible tale of love for the ages.  His use of a minimal soundtrack evokes the atmospheric, dripping nature of the erotic tension that vibrates between Robert and Francesca; his pauses to study the silent emotions of the leading characters gives us a chance to become them, to potentially see life through their eyes.  Richard LaGravenese's script is considerate, thoughtful; he gives the central figures room to breathe, to consider every possible outcome.  Waller's maudlin prose (not read by me) is completely washed away.  LaGravenese's linguistic maneuvers are incredibly deliberate.\n\tBut while \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is a distinguished romance film, there is something too faraway, too dreamy for it to be anything besides a weepy tale of splendor in the grass.  It feels so personal that it doesn't have much meaning for anyone other than Robert, Francesca, or Francesca's children.  It doesn't seem real, rather sweepingly cinematic.  It's a tragic fantasy.  But it is prosperous when it comes to presenting us with genuine emotion, and Streep's performance is uniformly excellent.  Perhaps I didn't attach to it as much as I would like to because I'm not the intended audience - but that hardly matters.  Here is a romance so refreshingly honest one hardly has time to consider its bathos.",

The chemistry between the lead cast is the primary reason why there is such pulsating energy emitting from this electrifying tale. The crisp and the uneasiness is bred, without any flirty talks and the way it surfs around the edgy with a shady note, is stupendously breathtaking. The attraction depicted in here plays a vital role and the makers being aware of the strength of the cast, milks it out from them that lures the viewers in, in its innocent bubble. The background score is mesmerizing, the cinematography is pure magic with fine editing and well detailed camera work. Contrary to premise where it suggests it has a limited span to be spent upon, the feature is maturely calm and soothing where eschewing their characters appropriately, the actors cast in their spells in a subtle tone. The narration is adaptive, elaborative and exquisite with gripping screenplay and pragmatic conversations. Sculpted to communicate for subsequent generation, the tale speaks volume metaphorically in those calm silent pitches that is harrowing and heartwarming at the same time. Streep is a revelation in her convoluted and unsure portrayal that is probably one of her best and underrated performance and on the other hand Eastwood is poised and reserved, supporting her thoroughly in each aspect.LaGravanese's exquisite adaptation gets better execution than anticipated from Eastwood's deck and is probably his finest act. The poem that flows fluently across the entire feature, a stunningly beautiful tale and stellar performances at the heart of it are the high points of the feature. The Bridges Of Madison County is a rare art where its poignancy is naturally cathartic for its innocence foliated through chivalrous allegory.",

Though it is possible that Eastwood did not take inspiration from Lean's film, the two are incredibly similar thematically and plot-wise. Portraying two people meeting for a fleeting few days in 1965, this film is a transcendent look at love and denial that is positively heart wrenching. Set in both 1965 and the present day, the film looks at the affair between Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) and Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) as it occurs and as it is viewed by Francesca's two children as they learn about it after their mother's death. Both a passionate and mournful look at love, the film is a brilliantly constructed look at relationships.In 1965, Francesca is an unhappy housewife. With her husband and children out of town for a few days, she plans on just getting some time away from them and breathing. However, photographer Robert Kincaid comes to town to take pictures of the bridges of her Iowa hometown for a National Geographic spread. Quickly falling for him, their relationship is brief, just four days, but very much akin to the one in Brief Encounter. Robert is not married to a woman, but is married to his work. Taking him all over the world, he is devoted to the world to the detriment of his relationships with women. Francesca, meanwhile, ditched her dreams long ago to have children. The part of her that would jump and leave at the drop of a hat is long gone, for fear of instilling a bad message to her children. Thus, both know their relationship is doomed. It will end because there are forces beyond their control that pull them away from one another. Yet, as much as it hurts them both, neither wish to forget what they felt over the course of those four days as they, by their own admission, cram a lifetime of passion into just four days.With the relationship defined in small moments - Robert picking her flowers, dancing in the kitchen, taking photos at the bridge, laying in the bathtub, and simply talking at the table - the romance is incredibly authentic. Yet, no moment really rips your heart out akin to the last chance they have to be together in spirit. With her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) home now, Francesca goes into town with him where she sees Robert. Staring at one another in the rain, the film refuses to go for the overly dramatic and unrealistic conclusion. They look at one another, Francesca leans over in the front seat to get a better look at him in the pouring rain, but they go their separate ways. Leaving town, Richard winds up behind Robert. In his truck, Robert can be seen hanging the crucifix Francesca gave him on his rearview mirror and waiting at a green light. He gives her one last chance to come with him. She clutches the door handle and waits. Her worries about Robert no longer wanting her are long gone. The connection is mutual. The experience unique. They are brief soulmates, but Francesca must choose: her family or Robert. In this tense and dramatic scene, the drama feels real. It is not manufactured and you can feel her dilemma. Regardless of what she chooses, she will never feel complete as her heart is guaranteed to be pulled in two separate directions. As is the case throughout, Streep beautifully portrays this complex character and the dilemmas before her. She acts out at Robert for making her feel this way, is set to leave, and is set to stay. She cannot make up her mind, but settles on hurting the least amount of people. Were it not for Streep's powerful performance, the film would still be good but not great. This is the perfect marriage between actor and material as she brings power and grace to the picture, as well as the dilemmas put before her character.One of the film's greatest assets, however, is the portrayal of Francesca's husband. Often times in these films about affairs, the spouse is shown to be boring or abusive or any number of things. Robert, however, is not treated in such a way. He is a great husband and father. On his death bed, he expresses his regret that he never gave Francesca her dreams. His role in the film is moving and powerfully written. A large part of why Francesca stays is to not hurt Richard and it is easy to see why. He is a beautiful soul who never hurt anybody. Why would he deserve to be hurt in such a way by his wife, who he never wronged. Thus, by not portraying him negatively, The Bridges of Madison County brilliantly shows the pull her marriage has on her heart. Had he been portrayed negatively, it would be a mystery as to why she would stay when she was so unhappy. But, due to his characterization, it becomes clear that she stayed because she loved him. She could not hurt somebody she loved for the simple reason that he was not her soulmate. It is a truly selfless act and yet another example of her giving up her dreams for her family.",
