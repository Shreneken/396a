            "content": "This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew \"Ace\". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this \"Goodfells Part 2\". Is it \"Goodfellas Part 2\", in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. \"Casino\" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says \"It's more like Disney Land now\". Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. \"You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!\" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my \"Rober DeNiro: A history of his films\" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has \"hired\" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace \"I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!\", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. \"Casino\" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to \"Goodfellas\", let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I'd like to see it in the top 100, but we'll see. 10/10",

            "content": "I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching \"Casino\" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you'd expect with a Joe Pesci character, he's a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn't mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you'll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than \"Goodfellas\"...also with the same stars and same director. This is because \"Goodfellas\" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas \"Casino\" seemed to have more story and wasn't always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a 'nice' picture. It's filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn't really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice.",

            "content": "I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4",

            "content": "A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the \"blue collar\" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.",

            "review_title": "Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion",
            "content": "Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an \"I'm a schmo\" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's \"Go Your Own Way\" and The Animals' \"The House of the Rising Sun\" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie \"Heat\". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow.",

            "review_title": "Typically fantastic Scorcese film",
            "content": "I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the \"great film\" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.\nScorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of \"Satisfaction\" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, \"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies\" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly",

It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.",

Rothstein is not a mob member, but a \"moneymaker\" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the \"wiseguy\" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the \"old school\" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",

Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen.",

Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in \"Goodfellas,\" but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their \"Goodfellas\" roles. Stone is alluring.",

            "content": "The opening 30 minutes or so of \"Casino\" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist\u2014nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero\u2014providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film \"The Departed\" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece \"GoodFellas,\" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of\u2014I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress\u2014but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in \"Casino.\" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie\u2014the middle in particularly\u2014really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that \"Casino\" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from \"GoodFellas,\" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of \"Casino\" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing.",

            "review_title": "Very good but not without flaws",
            "content": "Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.But I don't think that Casino is at all a \"perfect\" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.Casino is based on the story of Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein \"secretly\" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded \"mix tape\" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.",

            "content": "During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's \"Casino\" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in \"Casino\", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film. When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own. As Nicky himself puts it: \"The dollar\u0085Always the dollar\". But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: \"It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved\". We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.If you approach \"Casino\" as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in \"Goodfellas\".Ultimately, you may choose to take \"Casino\" as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with \"Goodfellas\" and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe. Here, as in \"Goodfelas\" (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie. It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development. The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours.",

            "content": "...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not.",

            "content": "I still remember watching Casino as a 12 year old on New Year's Day back in 1997 and being captivated from start to finish. I was lucky to be watching Casino at that age considering that the film is rated R 18+ in Australia for Medium Level Violence and Medium Level Coarse Language. Thankfully my Dad was lenient as long as we were sensible as myself, my Dad and my brother sat together and watched the movie. Casino was and still is a brilliant movie. Martin Scorsese directed another top notch film. The all star cast was perfect. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese mark another collaboration after their success with the classics Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), The King of Comedy (1983), and Cape Fear (1991). Also joining in the collaboration is Joe Pesci of whom the three actors united for Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990) and The Irishman (2019).Set in Las Vegas during the 1970's, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in another brilliant role) is in charge of the mafia connected Tangiers Casino to oversee its day to day operations. Sam is successful in turning the casino into a legitimate profitable venture as well as skimming some of the profits to the mafia. His legitimate lifestyle is put in jeopardy after he marries former hustler and prostitute Ginger (Sharon Stone in an Academy Award nominated performance) who turns out to be unstable and dishonest as she leads a self destructive lifestyle with alcohol and drugs as Sam continues to shower her with diamonds, fur coats, money and other expensive gifts along with access to a safety disposit box. Another huge threat in Sam's life is Chicago mafia enforcer and childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in another terrific performance) whose volatile behaviour earns him a ban from every casino in Las Vegas as he forms a crew and commits various crimes including robbery and burglary as well as beating, threatening and killing people. Nicky's actions bring a lot of unwanted attention to Sam due to their lifelong friendship. Ginger continues to see her ex boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods) who is a pimp and con artist yet is nothing more than a loser who is always asking Ginger for money. Though Sam organises to have Lester beaten up as a warning to stay away from his wife, Lester still pops up and continues to act as a leach. Marrying Ginger and bringing Nicky to Las Vegas would turn out to be Sam's downfall.The all star cast also includes Kevin Pollak, L. Q. Jones, Dick Smithers and the late actors Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, and Alan King.Director Martin Scorsese as always does an amazing job as he brought to life a classic movie based on Nicholas Pileggi's nonfiction novel Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.Casino is an extremely violent movie with several scenes that are quite unsettling and not for the faint hearted. The \"f\" is used 422 times throughout the whole movie.I loved Casino when I first saw it and to this day, it deserves a spot as one of my top 10 movies of all time. It is 178 minutes long, but is a movie that I still cherish.A well deserved 10/10.",

It's the best performance Sharon Stone ever put in; after the ridiculous \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Sliver\", they could have written her off if not for this. Her character's arc is tremendous.More than anything, \"Casino\" is a showcase of what Pauline Kael called \"film sense\", that implacable quality that all great directors have. Like Spielberg and Kubrick, Scorsese has a gift for knowing exactly what shot should follow which, is an absolute master of camera movements, angles, framing such that the movie streaks across the screen like fast-moving water over rocks, never once stalling or slowing down.It's brilliant, but it's not up with the director's greatest work like \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\", or \"Hugo\", which is a truly underrated masterpiece.

This criminal enterprising dream can't last forever, and when things start to come crashing down, they do so viciously (don't ever tell Scorsese he's timid on his violence). It's mostly when the '70s give way to the '80s and Sharon Stone's drama takes center stage that things become sour. \"Boogie Nights\" sprang to mind around this time, although that was a much more satisfying story.6/10",

            "content": "A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a \"scumbag\" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!",

            "content": "Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way.",

            "content": "Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before.  De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in \"The Godfather II\", and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in \"Goodfellas\".  This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.There were some interesting points.  Sharon Stone was excellent, but once again, she seems to remind me of Talia Shire's Connie in \"The Godfather\". The same could be said of James Woods, who plays a Fredo-like scumbag (maybe Fredo wasn't that bad, but still....).  To top it all off, we've got De Niro AND Pesci doing Ray Liotta's over-voice shtick from \"Goodfellas\".All in all, I would recommend this movie, but I'd also recommend you see the other movies I've mentioned here first.  The acting here is good, the plot isn't lacking, the only negative side is that it does get a little violent. All the same, if you're familiar with Scorcese's work, at times you feel like this movie is basically Henry Hill narrating the Corleone family history.  It's hard to see this group be so good without quite reaching the greatness they've achieved in the past.",

A bunch of mediocre and incompetent Italian gangsters send their cleverest Jew to take over the gambling business in Las Vegas. He does a great job and makes them rich. But these moronic and aging Italian gangsters send one of their own (a violent and psychotic Italian enforcer) to watch over the Jew. The Jew is doing a good job but he gets carried away and marries a beautiful but materialistic and drug addicted woman under the false notion that he can change her ways. He also pisses off another ethnic group when he refuses to take back an incompetent employee. Meanwhile, the psychotic Italian systematically undoes all of the Jew's hard work. Things get messed up. So like I said earlier, I thought the film was an allegory for the way the world is run. There are some really incompetent and mediocre people at the top. The really clever guys are in middle management but even they get carried away. Ethnic groups are perpetually involved in power struggles. And in the end, the large corporations and the squares replace these guys. The film is almost like an ode to the old ways (however mad and violent they might have been) before the corporations took over everything. The film predicts Wolf of Wall Street in the way Scorsese's films would be made and edited. There are two narrators who talk us through the sensory assault filled with interesting camera angles, fast cuts, violence, beautiful women and the opulence of Las Vegas. Three hours simply ran by. De Niro and Pesci are ably supported by Don Rickles, Sharon Stone and James Woods. Best Regards, Pimpin. (10/10)",

The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too.",

The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film.

Robert De Niro is predictably good in the lead, but Joe Pesci, as De Niro's surly back-up, does nothing new and Sharon Stone, as De Niro's wife, is just the 'token woman', trying to build a character without much genuine material to work with (she's satisfactory). Director Martin Scorsese seems more interested in his characters' actions than their motivations, causing some confusion in the story and leaving many questions unanswered by the end. The film is fast-paced and entertaining, but it doesn't leave a heady imprint behind, and some of the violence verges on self-parody. **1/2 from ****",

            "content": "\"Casino\" (1995), a visceral examination of the Mafia's influence on the casinos of Las Vegas in the 1970s, is also the so-called \"companion piece\" to Martin Scorsese's \"GoodFellas\" (1990). Both films star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and were written by Nicholas Pileggi.Some even go so far as to claim \"Casino\" is a semi-remake of \"GoodFellas.\" And many critics found flaws regardless of its connections to the earlier mob film. \"Go in interested and you may find your interest tested way past the limit,\" wrote Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle. \"'Casino' is not about people, just Vegas. It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one.\" Viewing the movie a decade after its release, it holds up well. The film's real strength lies in its narrative and unflinching examination of its characters. Sam Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro) isn't a nice guy, and never really gains our sympathy. Nicky (Pesci) occasionally exhibits acceptable behavior, but if the film has a villain, it's him. And Ginger (Sharon Stone in the best role of her career) is selfish, spoiled and depressing.Critics didn't get it. \"'Casino' runs a little under three hours, but (you) will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor Thelma Schoonmaker,\" wrote Internet critic Steve Rhodes. Rhodes, along with countless other reviewers, complained about the level of violence \u0096 suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate.Whether you will like \"Casino\" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films \u0096 and, of course, heavy violence. Ironically, despite its flaws, \"Casino\" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films \u0096 \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull\" did not feature likable people, either. Whereas we followed Henry Hill's journey from youth in \"GoodFellas\" and felt empathetic towards him, \"Casino\" drops us square in the middle of Sam's story and there's no connection \u0096 this will either alienate or enthrall you, depending entirely on your taste in cinema. I personally love studies of characters \u0096 especially ones that examine the evil inherent in man, and Scorsese is brilliant at revealing these things.His movie exhibits recognizable elements \u0096 a whiz-bang style with quick-cuts, rapid zooms, a diverse pop-and-classical music soundtrack (with no less than four or five Rolling Stones songs), and of course, his famous tracking shots (here, he stages an impressive three-minute examination of a casino without breaking until we exit the front door). But \"Casino\" doesn't confine itself to the restraints of Scorsese's styling. Here he goes hog wild with the visuals (more so than usual anyway), soaking up the vivid colors of Las Vegas, absorbing the dizzying array of flashing bulbs and tacky bright clothing.Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time collaborator, experiments with digital editing for the first time here \u0096 and employs some new techniques that are subtle but make a subliminal impact. The title sequence, designed by Elaine and Saul Bass, is simultaneously dazzling and haunting.The performances are almost flawless. De Niro is Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a legendary gambler who is chosen out of the blue to maintain a new casino for the Las Vegas Mafia. Sam explains the economics of the system \u0096 the mob take their cut of the profits, the rest goes where it should, and everyone remains happy \u0096 so long as nothing goes wrong.When Ace's old friend Nicky shows up in Vegas he begins to orchestrate a ring of violent robberies \u0096 becoming the new leader of a vicious gangster force that threatens to destroy Ace's chances at cutting it straight. Since Nicky is a made man, and Ace is Jewish, he can't stop him \u0096 but fears their new lifestyle will only lead to misery.In the meantime Ace falls for the beautiful call girl Ginger (Stone), who doesn't love Sam, but marries him for his wealth. Her heart really belongs to her ex-boyfriend/pimp (played by James Woods), and at first Ace believes he can tame her into submission; but her free spirit ruins their lives and destroys Ace's confidence.The movie does have its blunders, and is not on the same level as \"GoodFellas,\" but would at least make the list a few titles beneath it. Some scenes seem unnecessary, and Nicky's violent attack with a pen does seem a bit reminiscent of an almost identical sequence in \"GoodFellas\" when Pesci attacks someone at a bar. And as enthralling and entertaining as \"Casino\" is, it never really matches the overall energetic exuberance of \"GoodFellas\" \u0096 they are, despite their close ties, very different films in a cinematic sense.Still, this is a great film, well made and daring. You'll probably either love it or hate it, but there's no denying its powerful impact on the viewer.",

Now that was a great gangster film. Graphically violent, self absorbed, bitingly funny, brooding and epically proportioned, it was a knockout. Not so \"Casino\".This is a real exercise in excess, and one that completely backfires on Scorcese and his team. The film is terribly overlong at three hours, and many will struggle to pay attention the entire time, especially given the narrative which has leads De Niro, Pesci and others talking us through the whole show, another big miscalculation.The movie is far too violent, being often hard to stomach rather than effectively portraying the characters and their personalities and motivations. It's just one long, drawn out gangster show set in Las Vegas that is spotted with bursts of gruesome violence. In short, Scorcese and co-writer Pileggi have used exactly the same formula that they employed in adapting the latter's first book \"Wise Guys\" (\"Goodfellas\") to the screen, which made that film a sensation, and this one a mindless bore.Performances are strong, especially Sharon Stone as the hopeless drug fiend Ginger whose love of money proves her undoing. She is well deserving of the Oscar nomination that has come her way. De Niro and Joe Pesci, though impressive, are really only reprising their original \"Goodfellas\" turns. De Niro's Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is very similar to his Sam Rothstein, the Jewish gambling icon who ran \"The Tangiers\" for the mob. And Pesci's Nicky Santoro, the ultra-violent, crazy mob guy assigned to look after Rothstein, is a dead ringer for Tommy De Vito, his violent, paranoid persona from \"Goodfellas\". Other support players make the most of their limited roles.Definitely under edited, tale could have been told in less than two hours, but Scorcese had to over indulge didn't he. Robert Richardson's camera work is impressive, though even he seems to be trying too hard. Perhaps that's just the whole feel of the movie. An over-rated, over the top, over inflated waste. Art and sets are incredibly lavish, while the costumes are wild but spot on. PS I bet Pileggi's book is great reading.Sunday, March 24, 1996 - Knox District Centre",

I'm gambling Casino will be my mobster movie for all my days.It's a safe bet. Revisiting Casino, for the first time in probably a decade, is like visiting an old friend. And for three hours, it's a ride I can't wait to take again. For, I've done it many times before.I'm not one to like very long movies, or movies that move slowly \u2013 and before I go further, this is NOT one that ever moves a bit slowly. But, ever since it came out on video (originally on VHS, back then) I couldn't help myself. I literally watched this three-hour movie over and over. And over. To the point sometimes, when it went to credits, I would insert tape one (yeah, again, VHS, humph!) and start from the beginning.I loved\u0085and STILL DO\u0085this movie so much, in so many ways, it was easy for me to continuously watch it. With this third purchase \u2013 VHS, DVD and now, BluRay, I can't wait to plug it to experience it another time.This movie is so near perfect on so many levels and depths, it's hard to sum it all up in one review. The movie's onion layers keep surprising me with each viewing. And it's bonus of two movies in one is fantastic.Movie One, or the first half, is made up of all-but fantastic, interesting and driven narration of how casinos work, the rise of the two best friends/street guys and the mobsters in 1970's Las Vegas. From all my research and first-hand experience, this mentality of the 1970's is fairly close to what it is today. In fact, it's almost dead-on. Naturally, some things do NOT happen today \u2013 the place is now like Disneyland: any bad press is VERY bad for the place. So, good luck in smashing a cheater's hands and not having a hundred reporters/bloggers tearing apart your casino the same hour.Movie Two involves every bit of the mistakes these guys made in order to eventually rid Las Vegas of the mob. (There's a lot more to it than from this movie, but for this story, it's centered on these wise guys.) Originally, when I watched this countless times, I narrowed it down to one main slip-up: the firing of a connected relative. But, examining it this time, there were so many nudges to their house of cards, it's hard to add them all up. Each and every bump to the base playing cards had an involvement to everyone's downfall.To top it all off, it's enormously interesting, fun, exciting and suspenseful to see how this well-laid based on true events played out. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the acting.I never once saw Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods (amongst others) on the screen. Ever. These people were truly Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Ginger McKenna and Lester Diamond, respectively. How each of these excellent performances did NOT win Oscars is beyond me. Actually, while we're at it, how the movie didn't get nominated for, and win, for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, etc...baffles me.I digress. These performances were mesmerizing. Each in their own way. All the way down to James Woods, whom I felt did the best of his career and Sharon Stone showing incredible depth.Beyond the incredible feats by the actors was the brilliant direction, cinematography, story, score, soundtrack and pacing. Never did this movie feel slow, nor did I ever \"check the time counter\" because it's nearly three hours. The movie just kept going and on the right course. The plot unfolds as it needs to and the recounting of events and voice-overs were just as interesting as what was on screen.This movie was so powerful, as were the performances, that I almost rooted for De Niro's Ace. His gal, Ginger (Stone,) not so much. On a side note, she was fairly despicable and we wouldn't have hated her so much, if not for Stone's great take on her. (Or, again, the weasel, Woods as Lester.)Normally, I would absolutely and readily admit that I love this movie ten times more than the already very good Goodfellas or Godfather series because I am a gambler and have always (since early teens) been infatuated with Las Vegas and its history. It would be obvious that I'm naturally biased because of the reasons just mentioned. But, I am being honest: past my obsession with both gambling and Vegas, I loved this movie on all levels. Yes, it does help that this gives me a much more in-depth view of a certain segment of Vegas' past, I still love the journey Director Martin Scorsese gives me each\u0085and...every time.",

Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone.  The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . an easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us.  And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration.  This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything.  As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here.Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence  (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more.  But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell.  What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob  (Robert DeNiro)  who wants to be a big player.  His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be  \"legit\"  in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.In the meantime, he's got to deal with an old associate, the violent Joe Pesci, and a whory wife  (Sharon Stone)  who's addicted to drugs and, most laughably, a mullet-haired James Woods.  I can buy the whole wife thing, maybe . . . men WILL do stupid things when it comes to blondes.  But I absolutely cannot take Joe Pesci seriously as a fearsome, bloodthirsty mobster who blows into Vegas looking for his own action.  De Niro and Pesci should've portrayed each other's roles.  But what do I know.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS*** Almost three hours long with some 150 character references or credits in it the film \"Casino\" has to do with the rise and fall of big time Las Veges operator and Tangiers Casino manager Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, Robert De Niro, who's fate remains uncertain until the movie is just about over.We see Sam in 1983 getting in his car and then blown to pieces as a bomb exploded as soon as he turned on the key to start the engine going. As Sam is put, by the explosion, in some kind of state of suspended animation, floating aimlessly in outer space, he tells us in flashback what lead to him getting into the situation that we find him now in. It all had to do with Sam's boyhood friend Mafia made-man Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, who was brought to Vegas by the mob to be put in charge of the casino's security. It was Nicky who's strong armed actions like beating and clubbing the customers fond cheating, as well as showing disrespect, on the floor of the casino that brought the heat, cops, as well as local politicians down on Ace Rothstein. This made things hot for Ace who with his criminal record now being scrutinized,instead of being looked the other way, to see if he can qualify to have a license to run the casino.Things get even worse for Ace when Nicky after being banned by the State Casino Commission from ever stepping into a Las Vegas casino or gambling establishment still pesters him about getting his job back! That would cost Ace his job as casino manager for just associating with the blood thirsty little psycho. Things really come to a head when Nicky starts to warm up to Ace's old lady ex Las Vegas showgirl and part time hooker Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone. Ginger is also still involved with her pimp ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond, James Woods, who's been leaching off her 2 million dollars in cash & jewelry that Ace gave her as a wedding present. This lead Lester to get worked over in a restaurant parking lot by Ace's goons with a terrified Ginger forced to watch.As Ginger got more and more into snorting coke she became easy pickings for Nicky who got her to become his squeeze or woman in him supplying her, through his mob connections, with the white stuff. Soon Ginger got so hooked on both drugs and Nicky that she started to abuse her and Ace's 9 year old daughter Amy, Erika Von Tagen, by tying her up in bed as the two were out at night painting the town red behind Ace's back. It's when the word came back to Nicky's boss back east that he's fooling around with Ace's wife it was decided that he, despite being a made man in the Mafia, was more trouble them he was worth. A hit was set up for both Nicky and his equally psychotic kid brother deli owner Dominick, Philip Surian,who likes to spit in his costumers food especially cops whom he was forced to pay off. In a secret meeting site held in a deserted Indiana corn field both Nicky & Dominick were met by mobster and good friend Frank Marino,Frank Vincent, and his boys to talk over business. What was later to happen to the two sadistic creeps is far too brutal and shocking to be put down on paper!***SPOILERS*** When the film \"Casino\" is just about over we finally get to see what exactly happened to the what looked like at first the late and dismembered Samuel \"Ace\" Rothstein who's doing all the narrations in the movie. But by then with all the action and sub-plots in the film Ace's fate wasn't anything to write home, or in a movie review, about anyway! By then he was yesterdays news in him only being worth while to wrap fish or line your kiddie box with.",

This is a fascinating and powerfully dramatic film with great performances by Robert De Niro and the unforgettably talented Joe Pesci who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in \"Goodfellas\". No one can play a more dramatic role and act as dramatic as Pesci.He can blurt the F-word several times non-stop and go absolutely berserk on screen, which really captivated me in \"Goodfellas\" and now has done it again in \"Casino\".I'm kinda upset with the movies rating on Yahoo by the film critics.Why and how did this movie get a B- by the critics.Okay, I'm with Roger Ebert on this one and I'm gonna say that it's an absolutely great film.Everyone else can go chop their schlong off and die somewhere.Not as good as \"Goodfellas\", but like \"Goodfellas\", it's a four-star masterpiece by the legendary Martin Scorsese and I wonder if he'll ever make another mob movie.If he does, I'm there.",

            "content": "Scorsese follows up GoodFellas with a sort of variation on the theme, creating a similar structure but with different characterization and mood. Both GoodFellas and Casino tell a true story of mob activity in two parts, the rise to power and the inevitable downfall, featuring interwoven voice-over narration, pop music, and, well, Joe Pesci as short fuse to a bomb gone out of anybody's control. They contain different enough elements however that comparing them too closely can misconstrue the point of both; nevertheless, the similarities are there.Casino immediately appeals with its Saul Bass opening titles, and then quickly keeps up the momentum with sharp cinematography glorying in the light and spectacle of the Las Vegas Strip. The Strip is a popular place for filmmakers to play with the light and imagery, and Scorsese is all over it with some amazingly striking and glorious compositions. On a purely visual level, this movie is more than worth the time to check out, and on that note may be better watched silently.Because, the thing is, it's also very noisy. With almost never-ending voice over, constant music, and Sharon Stones superb but still harrowing performance of an overwrought junky falling into sheer hysterics, the very few and all too short moments of silence in this movie stand out for their sheer contrast, and end up being the high notes. It's a shame, too, because technically this is DeNiro's finest performance along the \"detached, cool, but cares\" mode, and he plays a genuinely likable character who wants to play it as straight as possible and knows how to make everyone happy--provided they actually listen to him, which of course they don't, and provided that nothing goes wrong, which of course they do.There's so much to like individually about the film that it is hard to criticize it as a whole. Each individual scene works on its own level, most of them involving DeNiro and Stone as they work through their relationship (one of the most heartwarming moments when he proposes to her, and one of the most heartbreaking moments when he discovers their daughter tied up), the storytelling is sharp, and the visuals straight up eyecandy, but Scorsese still overdoes it in all marks, creating an overwhelming and mostly overstimulating project out of the whole. Form following function? Technically the Strip is one of the world's most famous realms of fully immersive virtual reality, along with New York Times Square, the Mall of the Emiratis in Dubai, and too many places in Tokyo to name. However, that not being a thematic point of Scorsese's movie at all, it doesn't really help the fact that he could have used a little reserve letting the individual pieces work on their own without distracting them from one another by layering them over each other.--PolarisDiB",

Pesci makes a good role, and Woods too. The main objection against all these mafia dramas (Coppola, Leone \u0085) is their premise\u0097they tend to be character\u0097driven, which is wrong. They pretend that the mobs portrayed are interesting as people\u0097i.e., as drama characters. They're not. That is why Pesci and Woods are good, while De Niro flops once again\u0097the first two have well\u0097written roles. The directors behave as if the hoodlums they are filming are Kane or the Ambersons, and not some scumbags.It has zero human content. For a thriller, a genuine one, it is lousy and pretentious and almost flaccid. Who invented Scorsese, anyway? CASINO is meant to be satirical and sometimes funny; but Scorsese is one of the least witty persons in the whole Hollywood. The characters are such that you can not relate to; and not a single stream of sympathy is allowed. It is addressed and meant for the most dubious audience. It's MTV style is banal and vulgar. I mean Scorsese would have been supposed to narrate intelligently about brutes; but the story itself is rubbish.CASINO is a MTV\u0097style brutal extravaganza, mindless and remarkably empty, devoid of any emotion and idea, and of overwhelming, overbearing bad taste; Scorsese boasts in cinematographic tricks that at least at the age he was when he made CASINO should have seemed less appealing to him. Pesci's performance is the only good thing in it (Woods, as I said, is very good too, yet his scenes are too few). Like other Scorsese flicks, CASINO takes pride in a sort of mean, cold, empty, academic formalism ,very conventional and dull. That's why Scorsese (even less than Coppola or Palma) says nothing to many cinema buffs.",

            "content": "\"Casino\" is by no means a bad movie but it rather is a flawed one, which is mainly due to the story and its characters. The first two-thirds of the movie is certainly great but after that the movie takes some negative turns and it loses some of its credibility and I lost some of my interested.No question in my mind that Martin Scorsese is a great director but he however does push it at times with this movie. People compare this movie to \"Goodfellas\" for a good reason. Just like \"The King of Comedy\" and \"Bringing Out the Dead\" were similar in many ways to \"Taxi Driver\", \"Casino\" is on many ways similar to \"Goodfellas\". It's a tough gangster epic with lots of graphic violence, lot's of cursing and backstabbing characters. The main storyline is especially parallel to \"Goodfellas\". Yes, you can truly describe this movie as \"Goodfellas\" set in a Las Vegas casino in the '80's. Unfortunately the casino world is not as interesting to follow as the gangster world as portrayed in \"Goodfellas\", at least that's my opinion of it. The movie is too often about 'nothing' really. Style over substance you may say.But also when you judge the movie on its own good you have to come to the conclusion that there are flaws in it. Sharon Stone is great in this movie but her character is distracting from the movie at times, especially towards the ending when almost the entire movie evolves around her character. It gets tiresome at times after a while and the movie loses some of its credibility because of that. There also are way too many characters introduced in the movie, which makes it hard to follow at times. I also never really got in to the character, not even the main characters. I couldn't really care for any of them and it was hard to understand and follow them at time. The movie is also too violent and graphic, even for my taste. It's a bit too much and some scene's are unbearable. Scorsese really pushed it there and should had hold back a little.There's nothing wrong with the style of the movie. It's fast paced and wonderfully looking, also mainly thanks to the director of photography Robert Richardson but also of course to Martin Scorsese's stylish and unique way of directing and storytelling. Yes, there are some memorable sequences present in this movie, which certainly helps to make this movie a better one than most of the others in the same genre.Also of course the presence of some well known good actors make this movie a good one to watch. Robert De Niro is never disappointing in the main lead and Joe Pesci yet again plays a typically hot tempered Joe Pesci role in which he always is just great to watch. The movie unfortunately under-uses James Woods. They could had done some more and better things with that wonderful actor.Great to watch for the fans of the gangster genre. Overall a good, yet flawed gangster-epic that is certainly worth watching but not worthy of the high rating.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "This movie could have been a very interesting drama about Las Vegas gangsters, but Martin Scorsese ruins it with the film-making technique he used in \"Goodfellas\": expository narration. It was annoying in \"Goodfellas,\" but is very heavily used here. Instead of letting the action guide the plot, he has characters give background narration for every single point of action in the damned film. You're TOLD rather than SHOWN what happened. If I wanted to be told something, I'd read a book. Movies a re more interesting when character dialogue and action move the plot. Narration slows the movie down to a grinding halt.Oh, and there's \"Casino's\" claim to fame: the most uses of the \"F\" word in an English-language non-documentary film. Every other word is \"F\" this and \"F\" that. I know gangsters are tough, macho men who love to speak dirty, but this is way too much. Again, this is where action may have helped to convey the characterization of tough gangsters, rather than the \"F\" word every second. This film needed better dialogue. \"The Godfather\" has excellent dialogue, and though there are dirty words, it's balanced out by intelligent writing. \"Casino\" doesn't have going for it in terms of good writing, unless it's to show that the Vegas mob was run by a bunch of unintelligent morons who can't form a complete sentence without the \"F\" word.The acting is extreme and over-the-top. Sharon Stone is less than spectacular as a drug-addled, high-strung moll. She's either laughing or screaming, and nothing more. She chews the scenery like a starving pit bull. De Niro does little but blend into the background. Joe Pesci seems like his SNL caricature, screaming and squeezing heads into vices.Granted, I'm interested in the history of the Las Vegas mob, and this movie is based on a nonfiction book; but the writing was bad, and the narration device distracted from my enjoyment of the action. I didn't like \"Goodfellas,\" but it was leaps and bounds superior to this dreck. I do not recommend this, except maybe for a rental.

However here the story is so thin that it is really stretched to breaking point.  The first half is mainly just action, heavily stylised scenes with De Niro's voice over giving it a vague direction.  The plot kicks in in the second half with Rothstein's empire crumbling in parallel with his relationship with Ginger.  The action is pretty good, but the lack of narrative is a big problem.In Goodfellas, Scorsese's tricks seemed to be the icing on a very, very good cake.  Here they seem to be a end onto themselves.  Similarly Pesci's performance is very much a turned up version of his Tommy.  Scorsese's tricks, tracking shots and soundtrack all seem to be wasted here - as if he was looking for an excuse to do his visual stuff without needing a strong story.Overall this is an unfortunate version of Goodfellas.

He's to gambling what Scorsese is to directing... a natural... and the casino itself becomes an absorbing character: we feel pulse of the machines, and the men behind the scenes, keeping the moneymaking beast alive while protecting it from cheaters, con artists, and crooked politicians.Enter Joe Pesci as Nicky, Rothstein's childhood friend: the muscle who is familiar and cocky, dangerous and ultimately undependable. And there's the flavor of the month, Sharon Stone, as Sam's trophy girlfriend turned wife, Ginger, who becomes the apple of his eye - and soon, for a man who seemed so infallible, nothing matters but trusting a woman who repeatedly warned him not to.The movie hits a wall with this escalating-downhill relationship between Sam and Ginger, but it was faltering beforehand - De Niro, Pesci, and some of the other shady characters, although colorful and formidable, aren't interesting enough to really care about - unlike GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL or TAXI DRIVER, they all seem more written than real.The duel-narration here... while beautiful in GOODFELLAS between Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco... works here and it doesn't: De Niro's by-the-numbers account is fine in the beginning, giving us a firsthand account of how things run, but it becomes a rambling safety net for the lack of a streamlined plot: especially when his business luck turns sour.Meanwhile Joe Pesci's counterpoint is completely unnecessary, sounding like a mafia goon's version of Bugs Bunny, filling us with details better left for the audience to figure on their own (and given his character's fate... is the narration recorded in Satan's private broadcasting station?)...Then the last half runs itself completely ragged: juggling the dull doomed love story straight out of a nighttime soap, and Ace and Nicky's edgy friendship that meanders to a predictably violent conclusion (and they never seemed that tight to begin with for an unraveling to really matter).If Scorsese and scriptwriter Nicholas Pillegi stuck closer to the Casino, perhaps CASINO, and its characters, might have had more purpose. What we're left with is too much style without substance.(And has there ever been a character more deserving a bloody death than James Wood's pimp/hustler who not only repeatedly steals Stone from DeNiro, but kidnaps, and continually threatens, his daughter? While we witness the immense, overboard bloodshed of everyone else, James comes out with a few bruises. What the hell were they thinking?!)",

The mob portion is kept very brief near the front end, with DeNiro then heading West to man a mob-run casino. There's your basic dealings with skimming, teamsters, the feds, cheats, and whatnot. Pesci is then thrown into the mix as an enforcer to keep everybody who threatens DeNiro, in line. For good measure Stone arrives as an all-flash bimbette who placates well-to-do men with her wiles.My main problem with the film lied mostly in the Scorsese going shockingly against type. First, we have one of the most passive DeNiro performances of his Marty career, as a (Jewish??) guy I kept screaming at to take some freaking action. He allows those who pose a threat to his world to just walk all over him at an alarmingly high rate. Namely, Stone, whom he inexplicably has some undying love for, despite her personality not going beyond a hot blonde of opportunity. That he could be so incessantly forgiving, made me nuts. I kept praying for the explosive Bobby D. we all know and love to show up, but he never arrived.Then you have Pesci, basically aping his own \"Goodfellas\" character, as a leprechaun-esque tough guy whose main fear-striking device is drop F-bombs at top volume. Or kicking the sheeyit out of guys as long as he (Pesci) has others there to watch his back. At least his character takes an unexpected turn that we're told is a huge no-no in the mob culture.People have always been vastly divided on Stone; some hated her, some were surprised and vaunted high praise. I was pretty much on the fence with her, as her two-note (sexy or drunk) offering had your standard indifference to it.James Woods is wasted (and realizing who his co-stars were, seemed to go into Pesci mode for the one scene he was allotted), Rickles and Smothers are thrown in for some Vegas flair, with your usual assembly line of reliable Scorsese Italianos rounding out the supporting roles.Then there's Scorsese himself as they guy at the helm. I've never really been a fan of forced or tortuous violence in a film (the Freddys and Jasons were always quick about it), but where was it here??? Where's the Marty Scorsese of old who covered his filmstock in off-putting gore? The fact that he (finally) shoehorns in some toward the last reel was a real let-down.The film hardly drags, and the narration was an acceptable technique, but in the end I couldn't have cared less whatever happened to any of these people. Unlike \"Goodfellas,\" where, though the main characters were \"villians,\" I felt so awash in their journey by film's end, that you feel you've really been taken to another place by the actors. Casino, not in the slightest.At the very least Joe Bob Briggs had more than one scene. Because the drive-in will never dah!",

The usual suspects are here and this pulsating, rhythmic, rocking Movie is nothing if not indulging. In fact, this great looking Movie goes so overboard in the third act with its Marital dysfunction, that it almost collapses like one of those Casino demolitions.With its non-stop narration and relentless Music Soundtrack things move fast and frantic and sometimes looks so disorienting and bizarre that one might feel that the mind-altered mind of Hunter Thompson is behind the Camera. In the aforementioned conclusion things become more verbally kinetic than visual and it seems like the High is about to wear off. It does.So not without some shortcomings, this can be quite a ride if you are ready for it.

            "content": "During the first part, as we learn the ins and outs of a 1970s and '80s Las Vegas casino\u0085 taking us so close to the mechanics of the operation we feel part of the roulette table or the dice rolling across... is intentionally created in the same fashion director Martin Scorsese showed us the mob's operation in GOODFELLAS.But then something happens, or stops happening, or both.The main character, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, played by Robert DeNiro, is a man of mind, not action. He's to gambling what Scorsese is to directing\u0085 a natural\u0085 and the casino itself becomes an absorbing character: we feel pulse of the tables and machines, and the men behind the scenes, keeping the moneymaking beast alive while protecting her from cheaters, con artists, and crooked politicians.Enter Joe Pesci as Nicky, Rothstein's childhood friend: the muscle who's cocky, dangerous, and ultimately undependable. And the flavor of the month, Sharon Stone, as Sam's trophy girlfriend turned wife, Ginger, who becomes the wormed apple of his eye \u2013 and soon, for a man who seemed infallible, nothing matters but trusting a woman who repeatedly warned him not to. The movie hits a wall with the escalating relationship between Sam and Ginger, but it was faltering beforehand \u2013 DeNiro, Pesci, and some of the other shady characters, although colorful and formidable, aren't very interesting nor are they people to care about \u2013 unlike GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, or TAXI DRIVER, they all seem more written than real.And the duel-narration, beautifully wielded in GOODFELLAS between Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, works and it doesn't: DeNiro's metronomic account of the proceedings is fine in the beginning, giving us a firsthand account of how the casino runs from the inside, it becomes a rambling safety net for the lack of a streamlined plot: especially when his business luck turns sour. While Joe Pesci's counterpoint is completely unnecessary, sounding like a goon version of Bugs Bunny, filling us with details better left for the audience to figure on their own.And the last half runs itself completely ragged: juggling a doomed love story straight out of a nighttime soap with Ace and Nicky's doomed friendship that meanders to a predictably violent conclusion (and they never seemed that tight to begin with for an unraveling to really matter).If Scorsese and scriptwriter Nicholas Pillegi stuck closer to the Casino, perhaps the film, and characters, might have had more purpose. What we're left with is too much style without substance. So to pay homage to vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen's comment to Dan Quayle's comparison of Jack Kennedy: \"I saw Goodfellas. I know Goodfellas. You, Casino, are NO Goodfellas.\" And (spoiler alert) has there ever been a character more deserving a bloody death than James Wood's pimp/hustler who not only repeatedly steals Stone from DeNiro, but kidnaps, and continually threatens, his daughter? While we witness the immense, overboard bloodshed of everyone else, James comes out with a few bruises. What the hell were they thinking?!For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",

The reason for the high rating is that it's Scorsese, and that it's mafia. Those two combined often equals overrating. It's not bad, that's not what I'm saying, but it's not a perfect movie. I want to be more entertained, and more sucked in by a movie like this, Casino didn't quite do it.

This movie, as few others, will assault your senses and make you numb by the time it's over.Constant bickering, yelling, and Sharon Stone's out-of-control character the last hour will have you uttering a few expletives yourself after this Martin Scorcese sleaze-fest mercifully ends.As bad a character as Stone plays, the all-time champion profaner is - no surprise - the one played by Joe Pecsi, who must use the f-word every other sentence. Robert De Niro comes across as a choir boy compared to these other two jokers.The sad thing is, this could have been a decent movie, if Scorcese wasn't just so preoccupied with being so verbally degenerate (see \"Goodfellas,\" \"Raging Bull,\" etc). If the film had been cut down 45 minutes from 3 hours (too much of it dwells on the marital problems involving Stone) and cut back on the profanity, you might have had an interesting crime story with some very colorful cinematography and good narration. However, Scorcese can't seem to make a crime film without all the excess.\"Brutal\" might be a good word to describe this movie. It's too much for anyone above trailer trash morals to endure.",

            "review_title": "Scorcese repeats many ideas of GOODFELLAS... CASINO is a far cry!",
            "content": "The only thing that kept me watching this movie was to learn what happened to the character played by de Niro, apparently blown up by a car bomb at the beginning.As in GOOODFELLAS, there is voice-over narration, this time by de Niro and Pesci (Ray Liotta was the narrator in the former film), but it is nowhere near as effective, and often provides unnecessary, even distracting asides, that only further lengthen a film that could easily have done with 30 minutes less. Curiously enough, GOODFELLAS also had de Niro and Pesci in the cast, led by a highly inspired Liotta, but the only performance in CASINO worthy of any mention is that of Sharon Stone, who portrays a truly repellent character (the incident where she binds up her daughter and confines her to a cupboard is a bolt from the blue and struck me as unconvincing, perhaps because nothing in her actions toward her child suggest anything so excessive). She is very convincing, however, in her descent into drugs and her relationship with her pimp, the \"real\" love in her life, as opposed to the source of wealth that de Niro represents to her.Pesci reprises his exceedingly violent character of GOODFELLAS and kills people as routinely as one would flies. This time, however, he is less credible because he is reportedly clever enough to take over the running of murky business from other ruthless criminals, but then commits excesses so stupid as to make suspension of disbelief impossible. His affair with Stone is also difficult to swallow. I could accept a blow job or one-off sex because she is too drugged up to reason it out, but surely he knows that de Niro will not tolerate it, and he is just too flippant about it. Ultimately, his character is just not rounded enough to stand, and so wayward as to become confusing, annoying, and ultimately lose the viewer's interest.The character played by de Niro is a very odd customer indeed, and the actor's talent is sadly wasted in a part much too ambiguous for me to enjoy. He wants to go clean but stupidly allows ultra-violent chum, Pesci, to join his casino and childishly believes Pesci's promises of good behavior and compliance with the \"legit\" nature of the casino operation. Even harder to swallow is that he should entrust the key to his fortune to Stone, even after he finds her cuddling her up to her pimp again. De Niro seems rather unsure about the role, too. I spent the whole movie waiting for the character to do something but ultimately he accepts everything like the Good Samaritan: he takes in dangerman Pesci, marries pimp Woods-infatuated Stone, has a distant relationship with his daughter that unexpectedly turns into something closer, loses half of his fortune without a whimper when he has seemed money-driven from the start, and is just too polite and quiet to convince me that I haven't wasted close on three hours watching purposeless characters going nowhere.Photography is competent, somewhat reminiscent of GOODFELLAS but less inspired. Direction is very disappointing, especially in light of the standards set by Scorcese in TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS.",

So, clearly, I held off seeing Casino for many years. The other day it was at Half Price for a dollar so I picked it up. I always enjoy stories about Vegas; it's fun to peek behind the scenes of the casinos. This was one of the last good roles DeNiro had, before he descended into the Valhalla of romantic comedies with the likes of Ben Stiller. The good is simply the story itself, which is essentially true. (It is certainly NOT true that the mob was not skimming in Vegas until the 1970's). DeNiro was good, especially when he tried to deal with an old friend who he realized and always knew was an out of control idiot. DeN was clearly ready to jettison Pesci if that was what it took to keep the casino running, but was afraid he could not do so because Pesci was a made man and DeNiro, a Jew, was not and never could be. The scenes \"back East\" with the big boys were always well done; good supporting jobs by all involved. Don Rickles was good. The bad, aside from Pesci and Stone, were: the soundtrack; I felt it got in the way because it was continuous, too loud, and often at odds with the tone of what was showing on the screen. The lighting; in many scenes Scorsese put a hot spotlight on a character or a desktop. I just can't figure out what he was trying to do. The running narration was not needed after the first few scenes. All in all, I'd recommend it. Get a bottle of pure strength ammonia to sniff whenever Stone appears on the screen and you will be OK.",

And yes, in case you have heard... this is quite similar to Goodfellas. There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese and/or anyone else who helped make this. And that's that. 8/10",

For me this is the tale of gambling and crime, coming together as sides of the same coin, and then progressively turning on each other.Ace is the ultimate gambler, because he his devoid of vice in a certain sense. He is not an addict or a con man, he represents a clean way to gamble. His method is not luck; it's math. It is not instinct; it is research and science. Of course, as the movie goes on you start to see the problem it brings which is the need for control. Repeatedly, Ace has a need for control. At first it is in gambling and that is how the becomes successful, but then you see the impulse towards his wife, towards Nicky and towards the government. Ace's story is the rise and fall of a man asking for complete control. For unlimited obedience.Nicky on the other hand is embodied passion. As cold and calculating is Ace, Nicky is instinctive and volatile. He is a gangster archetype of sorts. And, as he starts as Ace's sidekick you see that he progressively becomes bigger and bigger. Increasing in violence but also diversifying in crimes.The film tells the story of how these two guys turn against each other and metaphorically how these two concepts clash. The culmination of which, is the desert meeting.These elements would be enough to make a great film and a compelling drama. But then, there is Sharon Stone's Ginger who is a tragic femme fatale. A woman that starts smart and beautiful, with a negligible drug addiction and insatiable love of money. At the non-metaphor level, Ginger is the woman whose beauty will destroy these guys' paradise.Ginger's, and by extension the city's, undoing will be when she will give in to Ace. Believing that she can outsmart him and con-him like so many guys before him, e.g. Like all the casinos before Tangiers. The benefit for her is instant. She gets security and comfort, but also she is Sam Rothstein's wife, she gets a reputation. But, the price to pay is independence. She will then turn to Nicky. She will try to get the mob against the casino. And she'll loose everything.The final message is the following: The mob got pushed out, but the spirit of Las Vegas has died in the process.It is my personal interpretation of the film, but I think it is valid because the characterisation is very well done. The movie builds its characters as archetypes and then it pits them against each other, which allows the story to have mythological quality.Besides that, this is Scorsese at the peak of its art, which gives a film that is not only interesting and cool to look at but also with a lot of energy and dynamism that nobody else has.",

            "review_title": "Scorsese on autopilot",
            "content": "Half history lesson and half drama, Casino feels like a film built from way too much material to pare down in the time Scorsese and Pileggi had to write the script. Recalling a lot from Goodfellas in terms of actors, characters, and overall structure of a story in the world of the mob, Casino is Scorsese using all of his tricks on familiar ground which feels like it should be fodder for me. I do find the movie an entertaining three hours, but there ends up feeling like there's little point in the end. The rise and fall of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein and the rise and fall of mob controlled Las Vegas end up feeling disconnected to me, like they happened coincidentally rather than one feeding the other. There's just too much of Ace's problems that feel concentrated on his own personal life without touching larger Las Vegas issues.Ace is a gambler \"back home\" (apparently Chicago could never be mentioned directly for legal reasons) who always brings in money for the mob bosses and gets called up to run the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. He walks in, turns things around and increases profits for the mob almost instantly, running a tighter ship on cheats and operations. He also marries a female hustler, Ginger, when his childhood friend from back home, Nicky, a violent psychopath of a made man in the mob, comes to Las Vegas to offer muscle support to Ace and also set up his own street operation on the side.All of this takes about an hour to set up in a series of voiceover heavy vignettes that never really amount to individual scenes. Told by Ace and Nicky in alternating narration, almost like the words were taken from oral history accounts of the time and place, the movie flashes back and forth in time, around Las Vegas, back home and to Kansas City in a flurry of activity that ends up feeling dizzying. This is where, I think, the movie works least well. It's not that the storytelling here is inefficient, which it is, it's that it prevents any sort of emotional grounding with any character. Granted that they're kind of all terrible people, but Ace is made to be the straight shooter in a group of rule-breaking criminals. He understands the rules of gambling and casinos, and he wants to operate within those bounds to create the money for his bosses back home. He could have been someone to latch onto emotionally.He probably shouldn't have been best friends with a violent psychopath or married an unstable junkie with a very strong attachment to a pimp, though.As I mentioned, it takes about an hour for the movie to calm down and actually deliver scenes instead of snippets and vignettes. Once there, the movie gains a footing that it never loses, firmly and energetically telling its core story, but I think it also begins to disconnect Ace's personal story from Las Vegas as a whole making the connection incidental rather than having the two stories really inform each other. Nicky ends up getting kicked out of every casino in town and pissing off the cops so much that he has to operate outside of the city proper. Ace fires a connected good ole boy, insults him to his brother-in-law, and brings the wrath of the state down upon him when they refuse to issue him the gambling license he had filed for. Ginger can't let go of her pimp boyfriend, Lester, and keeps taking money from Ace to give to him. Ace just wants to run his casino, but the chaos that rises up around him ends up consuming everything.Joe Pesci essentially plays Nicky like he played Tommy in Goodfellas, but with less warmth. Tommy was a violent psychopath, but he could have some fun with friends that didn't involve murder and mayhem. Nicky seems to only get pleasure from violence. Pesci plays this well. De Niro plays Ace as a completely collected professional, the kind of person you would expect that the mob might hand over a casino to in order to guarantee profits. His attention to detail, most amusingly demonstrated when he demands equal numbers of blueberries in all muffins from his chef, is exacting and precise. Sharon Stone, though, is where I'm not sure of in terms of quality of performance. She's good through most of the film, playing an insecure woman with a well-worm fa\u00e7ade of confidence, but by the end Ginger is a shrieking insane person for most of the film. I think the performance exists on a line between appropriate for the character and over the top, and I get the feeling that it leans towards over the top.As everything ends up falling apart, with Ace starting a talk show to maintain his voice in the public square in his fight with the gaming commission over his long applied for gambling license, Nicky going so far out of control that the mob back home has to exert some control, and Ginger nearly stealing her and Ace's daughter to Europe with Lester, the movie never really feels like it comes to anything in my mind. Goodfellas had a clear eye towards what it was trying to say about the appeal of the mob life, but in Casino, the mix of history and histrionics don't mesh as well to me. It feels like Ace is supposed to have learned a lesson as he sits in his home in San Diego, but he's pretty much the same guy he was at the beginning of the story. Is this a bemoaning for the lost era of Las Vegas, now taken over by corporations instead of wise guys? Ace does say that in the final voiceover, but the mob era was so violent and chaotic and led to Ace's professional downfall that it feels like a weird thing to miss. Sure, Ace misses the control he had, but he was a cog in a larger, more violent machine, and he doesn't seem to even see that.In the end, I find Casino to be a shallow adventure in another time and place. The intricate look at life in Las Vegas in the 70s through the eyes of some of the fictionalized most powerful people in the city is interesting, violent, and consistently entertaining, but that first hour feels amorphous and unstructured while the ending leaves me with little to chew on thematically. It's a fun movie, but little else.",

            "content": "The main role in Scorsese's film \"Casino\" from 1995 is played (what a surprise) by Robert De Niro. Ace is a gambler with a murky past, who, with the help of mafia connections, becomes the commander-in-chief of a successful casino in Vegas. Except for regular payments to the bosses who brought him there, he tries to live and work as legally as possible.On the other hand, his childhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) follows him to Vegas and takes over the underground, unscrupulously removing everyone in his path, which jeopardizes Ace's reputation, as well as the business itself.This gradually leads to a split and even rivalry between the two friends, and things get even worse when Ace marries a well-known local 'gold digger', played by Sharon Stone.De Niro's character is capable, ambitious, calculated, maybe a bit cold, but within the framework of the mafia film, Ace is something closest to a good guy. Pesci's character and performance are the same as in many other films where he plays a mobster. Maybe similar roles don't make a great actor, but this type definitely suits him and he is among the best movie mobsters. Sharon has a doctorate in femme fatale, but the way Ginger is in the second half of the film makes her one of the most strikingly disgusting female characters I can remember. Towards the end, every scene with her made me sick.The technical aspects of the film are at a high level and the general atmosphere bears a strong stamp of Scorsese's style, but the overall impression it left on me is quite weak. I experienced it as just another in a sea of similar mafia stories, which I was not bored with, but which I could also stop at any moment and never wonder where it led.However, the dose of the author's subjective taste is something from which even the most objective and competent analyzes and reviews cannot completely distance themselves, let alone the amateur reviews of the ordinary viewer. As even the legendary \"The Godfather\" did not amaze me and, although it is very good, I do not rank it even close to the best films of all time, I must take into account that probably this whole film genre is 'not my cup of tea' and that it is questionable how much my subjective impressions weigh.7/10.",

            "content": "Martin Scorcese is a film legend. No matter what anyone might say about any of his films, his reputation is unimpeachable. Even his misfires have terrific scenes. \"Casino\" isn't a misfire - far from it - but only manages to be a good film weighed down by the ponderous style and overly didactic expressionism that is Scorcese at his worst.\"Goodfellas\" was a Scorcese classic. This isn't \"Goodfellas,\" but it sure feels like a mediocre extension of it. For what it is, \"Casino\" is enjoyable. Unfortunately, one of the hurdles that lesser Scorcese films face is that they bring to mind his better work. This is especially a problem when one of his films uses similar themes and even actors from his classics. Here, we have Joe Pesci from \"Goodfellas\" doing his angry mobster shtick again, and Deniro also reprising his standard wise-guy turn. Further, we have crude hoodlums increasingly turning on each other, having mundane personal problems that cross over into their \"work,\" and exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior after starting out seemingly in complete control. Sound familiar? Well, it probably does if you've seen \"Goodfellas\" or many other, better Scorcese films.Robert Deniro, who at times is brilliant and at times seems to be suppressing a smirk in his \"love\" scenes, overall is fine as a middle-level mob boss who mistakenly begins to believe he is the top dog. So, we have the age-old theme of the inevitable mistake of taking your actual bosses for granted. Throw in Joe Pesci as his old friend who reaches the same conclusion about himself, and watch events unfold. Anyone who's seen mob films stretching at least back to \"The Godfather Part II\" on down the line has to see this train racing down the tracks. No real surprises, standard decline-and-fall stuff relieved by the usual Scorcese flourishes which, alas, went over much better elsewhere.Sharon Stone is the empty center of this film, despite the fact that it supposedly is about Deniro's character. As the antagonist out to smash Deniro's controlled world, she is set up as the biggest thing in Vegas. She has to be for her character to work. Unfortunately, but none of that comes across, at least it didn't to me. Not enough time was spent on her character to show why at first she was so popular (which is odd, considering how long this film goes on), so her inevitable decline doesn't strike the emotional chord it should. Reviewers like to say she deserved the Academy Award, but I don't see it. She does get numerous histrionic moments, but then leaves huge gaps in her devolution. Her character lacks continuity. Stone gives two performances, one as a reluctant bride (why?), and then one as an increasingly unhappy wife (again, why?). Admittedly, she does a good job of acting, but it all seems forced and like, well, acting. Her character didn't grab me.The single most annoying aspect of this film is a self-indulgent Scorcese trademark that reached its nadir here and in \"Gangs of New York.\" You may find it charming, or helpful, or entertaining, but to me it is downright distracting and needless. That is a banal historical (this is \"semi-fictional\" in the worst way) explanation and constant narration by the Deniro and Pesci characters which continues right to the end. A little of that works, but it gets way out of hand. The characters repetitiously \"explain\" things that don't need to be explained. For example, the narrator will say, \"And then she hit bottom and blew her money on drugs and pimps,\" and we see Stone stumbling down a hallway, doing her mighty best to show herself \"hitting bottom.\" \"And when they found her body....\" and she immediately falls down in the hallway, right on cue. Nice acting, Sharon! The technique is patronizing. It is as if Scorcese is directing the film toward people who are complete blank slates, and know nothing about people, or history, or motivations. But, in reality, the audience is not stupid. It can be trusted to draw the appropriate conclusions, given a story rather than a monologue with accompanying moving pictures. I think Scorcese forgets himself sometimes. I think most viewers would find thinking things through themselves more enjoyable.In other words, skip the quasi-documentary stuff, and this would be a far superior film.Despite my major quibbles, I enjoyed the film because it does transport you to another time and place, Vegas in the early '70s, before, as Deniro the narrator so unnecessarily (but characteristically) explains, \"It became Disneyland.\" The fashions (Deniro sporting a gold lam\u00e9 suit is a riot) alone are worth the time. Just try not to compare this film to true classics.",

            "content": "Anyone seen Goodfellas? You know ... gangsters, violence, long story, Joe Pesci being a complete and utter maniac? Well, save your bucks. In a nutshell, CASINO is a total replica of a very good film. I'm not saying it's not good. It's just a replica.Sam Rothstein (De Niro) is the man; a gambling genius who (his Jewishness holding him back) becomes THE man in Las Vegas. The problem is that he isn't a made guy cosa-nostra-wise. Doh!! If only he had an Italian background, so many lives could have been spared. As it happens, the Vegas mob bosses insist on Mr. Pesci being there to 'take care' of business. In other words, sadistically maim any idiot who messes with our Sam's good business. Watch out particularly for the 'hammer from nowhere' and Joe's novel use of a Black and Decker workmate which will, guaranteed, bring water to the eyes.Much is made of Sharon Stone's tour de force in this movie as Ginger, Sam's moll. It's definitely a cut above her previous acting credits (who remembers Sliver? answers on a postcard) but at the end of the day, it comes down to her being given a decent script for once, and the chance to ham it up for all she's worth. If screaming and ranting on coke guarantees you plaudits, fair play. Worth a nomination? OK. The Oscar itself? Please.Scorsese is the best director around for this kind of film. You will come out of the cinema saying \"Wow\", \"Yipes\", \"Cool\" etc. Even after a good three hours. No arguments - it is hard hitting and scary. BUT Martin - it's been done before. By you. And with Goodfellas, it was so much more original and, basically, better. De Niro, Pesci and Liotta were seminal. Replace Liotta with Stone, and it's only semi-seminal.Casino will appeal to those who love a good shoot-up, blood and guts and plenty of actors yelling at each other. You will get value for your video rental, if that's what you're after.Let's face it - three hours! But if you want better value, hire out Goodfellas again.",

            "content": "I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen. Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it. From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the surveillance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in. Robert De Niro is \"Ace\" Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.) And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind? The cast is really top notch. De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill. But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it. Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie. And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS. In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD. But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.Gary F.

To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.",

Plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from.  The Rothstein/Ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship, other than \"he's controlling\" and \"she's nuts.\"  Plus Joe Pesci is simply reprising his role from Goodfellas.

            "content": "Casino was the last great film made by Martin Scorsese, who is certainly one of America's finest filmmakers. Despite the three hour running time, Scorsese tells us a powerful story filled with memorable characters. Although he seems to have moved on to big-budget extravaganzas like The Avator, and Gangs of New York, it's films like Casino and Goodfellas that properly showcase his incredible talent.The plot centers around Robert DeNiro's character named Ace Rothstein who has been sent by the mafia back east to manage the Tangiers Casino in Vegas. Ace knows everything there is to know about gaming, and he makes the place rather profitable. A good chunk of change is sent back to the mafia bosses each month. Things seem to be going fine until two things happen. First, Ace falls in love with a shady woman (Sharon Stone) who hangs around the casino and extorts money from unsuspecting high rollers. She has a sleazy pimp-like character (James Woods) brooding over her who complicates things further. In addition to all that, the mafia bosses send some muscle (Joe Pesci) into town to presumably watch Ace's back. But this ends up backfiring as Pesci tears the town apart and draws every cop in the city's attention to the Tangiers. Things continually spiral downward for Ace and the gang until the typically violent climax wipes most people out. There are plenty of other details that you will have to experience for yourself.The film introduces characters we care about, and the actors portraying them are exceptional. Stone, Pesci, and DeNiro are all terrific, and James Woods once again reminds us what a scene-stealer he can be. The film is very violent, but also funny at times. It uses many of the same production techniques that made Goodfellas such a wonderful experience. You also get a nice insider's view of how Vegas operated back before it became such a commercial city. The Vegas that Scorsese shows us is for adults, not families.At three hours, the film is indeed too long. There is a little too much time spent on detailing what a bitch Sharon Stone's character is. After she started fooling around with Pesci, we got the point. Still, we are treated to too many arguments between her and DeNiro. I cannot help but think that if Casino had the two hour and twenty minute running time of Goodfellas, it wouldn't have lost a thing. You won't daydream all that much, but you will find yourself wondering when the next scene with Pesci is coming.Casino was made on roughly a $50 million dollar budget. That's chicken feed compared to some of Scorsese's recent ventures. Though it didn't make that money back in theaters, it has since become profitable through the means of home-ownership. Most of the people I know seem to have the DVD in their collections, anyway.It's time to put DiCapprio on the shelf, and start making some more like Casino, Mr. Scorsese! The Hound thinks Casino is worth 9 of 10 stars.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese does deliver a vivid, pulsating look at what goes on behind the scenes in the temples of gambling out west, but fails at the human drama. Robert De Niro stars as Sam Rothstein, a Midwestern bookie with mob connections who is sent to Vegas in the '70s to run the Tangiers Casino. Sam is a hard worker and keeps his bosses in Kansas City happy with regular deliveries of cash-filled suitcases. Things start to go awry when his childhood buddy Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes to town. Nicky is a psychotic gangster/lowlife whose strong-arm enforcement techniques eventually do him in. Sam has also fallen for blonde bombshell Ginger (Sharon Stone), a gold-digging hustler. For some unknown reason, Ginger can't seem to give up her former pimp, the slimeball Lester Diamond (James Woods). Maybe she's just attracted to his name. The jewelry collecting Ginger would certainly find \"Mrs. Diamond\" more her style than \"Mrs. Rothstein.\" We unfortunately remain passive observers of the downward spiral that consumes these characters. As the third hour dragged on, I just got more and more impatient for the whole thing to be over. I want to be leaving Las Vegas. De Niro does De Niro as usual, but the character's emotional revelations are small potatoes. Pesci does a veritable reprise of his GOODFELLAS part. Funny at first, with his \"F\"ing vocabulary, Nicky soon starts to grate on the nerves. Quick, bring out the baseball bats. Sharon Stone does a respectable job as Ginger, but a Golden Globe win over Susan Sarandon (not to mention the ignored Kathy Bates) is a bit tough to swallow. The non-stop soundtrack of 70's hits is distracting at times, but the costumes and set designs are just right. Frankie Avalon, Jayne Meadows, Steve Allen and Jerry Vale play themselves. Guess Wayne Newton was out of town.",

            "content": "Scorsese is my favorite director working today. From his first great film Mean Streets to Wolf of Wall Street, he's given the world some amazing movies. Some are better than others of course, but I would be hard pressed to say that's he's ever made a bad film. Casino, when first released, was unfavorably compared to Scorsese's Goodfellas, and it's easy to see why. Based on another Nicholas Pileggi crime novel, the returning cast members Robert DeNiro, Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci, a long running time and \"rise and fall of a gangster\" plot. But while Goodfellas is my number one Scorsese film (Followed closely by Raging Bull), Casino has slowly become one of my favorites. The violence is still sometimes hard to watch, two scenes come to mind that in my opinion, rival anything in Goodfellas in terms of visceral, shocking brutality. The infamous torture scene is still shocking, comparable to the ear amputation in Reservoir Dogs. Scorsese's eye for detail and use of narration serves him well, and the acting is across the board excellent. Sharon Stone deservedly won an Oscar for her role as hustler Ginger McKenna. And Joe Pesci is on fine form as hot tempered, coked-up muscle Nicky Santoro. The eclectic soundtrack is great, filled with 70s classics like Jeff Beck's \"I Ain't Superstitious\" and Boogaloo Down Broadway. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing, capturing the gaudy style of the era perfectly. And longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits the film beautifully and doesn't shy away from the sometimes brutal violence. There are a few flaws. You could trim about 10 minutes of Nicky Santoro and his gang (We get the point, they're bad guys). And Robert DeNiro looks about as Jewish as Vladimir Putin. But these are minor complaints. A great film that i'll watch over and over for years to come. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Casino(1995) is a fascinating and terrific behind the scenes look at the mob undergoings in Las Vegas during the 1970's and early 80's.  It deals with things that were hinted at in The Godfather(1972).  Casino(1995) received mixed reviews during its release which was due to ignorance from most film critics.  This film is one of the reasons why Martin Scorsese is the best film-maker of his generation.The opening credits are beautifully done using colors to a greater effect. Casino(1995) is a film that was most deserving of a Best Picture award in 1995.  It should be considered as one of the top films of the 1990's. This is an another example of Martin Scorsese being done in by the Academy Award voters as he should have at least five Best Director[Mean Streets(1973, Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)], and six Best Picture awards[Mean Streets(1973), Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)].\nThe infamous \"Batting Practice\" scene near the end of the film is one of the five most brutal and vicious sequences in a Scorsese Flick.  The first part of the film are a summary of events and the narrative does not begin until twenty minutes into the story.  Its filled with multiple voice overs from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent.  It was written by the same man who wrote Goodfellas(1990).Casino(1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as Goodfellas(1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods.  This film deals with the themes of excess, greed, power, and self-destruction.  Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out unexpectively. Robert De Niro as Sam is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.There are a few scenes that were really masterful.  One, the scene where Sam explains the different roles of the people working at the casino.  Two, the murders during the climax of the movie. Three, introductions of the main and minor characters in the story.One asset of this movie is Scorsese's Utilization of music used to fit many scenes and situations.  It deals with the end of an era when the mob controlled Las Vegas.  The camera is always on the move as well as being fluid and steady.  The difference between this film and Scorsese's early works is this film doesn't have the gritty of of his 1970s films.Casino(1995) is one of Martin Scorsese's three or four best films of the 1990's and that includes Goodfellas(1990), The Age of Innocence(1993), and Kundun(1998).  Casino was the eighth coraboration between Scorsese & De Niro.  Many scenes(gory ones) were cut from this feature in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.  Casino follows in the tradition of gangster epics ala, The Godfather(1972), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Scarface(1983), Once Upon A Time in America(1984), and Goodfellas(1990).One of the film's best lines is \"Before she could start counting her money, the bosses back home decided to settle the case out of court, so they sent me\".  Everyone contributes to the excellent acting in Casino.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her life.  In my opinion, Sam Rothstein represents Martin Scorsese and the mob bosses symbolizes the Hollywood execs.Casino is more a big budget lavish Independant film then it is a mainstream feature.  Robert De Niro as Sam plays him with unusual restraint espically for Robert De Niro.  Joe Pesci plays a more psychotic version of Tommy De Vito of Goodfellas(1990).  After getting brutally beaten by a Pesci character in Raging Bull(1980), and Goodfellas(1990), Frank Vincent finally gets a chance to return the favor.Scorsese directs with the craft of an experienced pro.  Sam Rothstein is based on career of professional bookie Frank\"lefty\" Rosenthal.  This would be the final appearence of the mother of Martin Scorsese in one of his movies.  Casino(1995) as many years pass is a movie that will be acknowledged as one of the director's all time greats.",

I understand he's supposed to be a great director and that the acting is supposed to be great (I just don't see it - and I tried *very* hard to see good things in this film. I paid to rent it, I wanted to like it. How can someone ruin a movie about my favorite themes - Vegas and the mob? I mean, I'll watch practically anything about this topic.This movie's pacing is arbitrary and amateurish. Scorsese knows he has to provide some gruesome violence at some point - we were checking the time of this flick at 1 hour, wondering when it would *ever* be over. I figured then that the violence would be immediate, gratuitous and upcoming - merely because it had to be there, to keep anyone watching. So there it was. A TV-style shoot-out, followed by torture scene (don't worry, I'm not spoiling much) that's filmed with overly artsy and arbitrary camera angles. I've never seen a film that relied so heavily on narration. What was Scorsese thinking? That he'd get remembered for having the most over-narrated film in world history? There are TWO overly wordy narrators, but you can't make up for the lack of cinematic action and believability on the screen - unless you are watching this during a cocktail party or something. Or you really like movies that don't require a strong plot, and blast you occasionally with set decor or violence.The sets are great - that's what kept me going through the movie, but set design and production design do not a great film make. He should have DeNiro be naked to provide interest, though. DeNiro does his obligatory pug-dog face, with the wrinkled forehead way too much, and that bobbing and swaying thing where he crosses his arms and looks intense way too much.The side characters are overwrought and stupidly dressed (that huge bolo turquoise guy is an example). Once again, Scorsese is like a cartoonist that hates cartoons. He can't even put meaningful props around the set, they appear to be symbolic (but apparently are not) and he shows us all kinds of things that never come into play (that's just bad directing - very B movie, actually). I guess I can see how a movie like this one (cartoony) can be popular, though - I just can't handle the shifts in tone and pacing throughout the flick. There are too many scenes where the frame is tilted, comic book style, that have NO comic book content - and where in addition the acting and dialog are overshadowed by set decor or costume - and the dialog/events do not move the movie forward. Why do that? And why then force so much narration (in a boring tone, mostly from DeNiro) onto the audience? I love B movies, and was prepared to view this entry as Scorsese's attempt to make one, to forgive him all the other directorial excesses he's been guilty of. If he had done that - at all, I would have liked it. Or if we'd seen naked Sharon Stone (that's how bad this was - I was praying for Sharon to lose her panties in that one scene, or at least give DeNiro a blow job, but no - nothing).The Italian mobsters and their food look fake and last minutey - as though someone composed those scenes on a Sunday morning, with a hangover, using the most obvious and basic film student style composition techniques and set pieces. Even the decor failed at many points - and it didn't have to.Oh, and by the way, Martin, if you're reading (which I doubt - if I had made this film, I'd never read anything critical about it, I'd never want to remember I'd made it) - merely sticking old slot machines in little trios on the floor here and there to denote \"basement\" doesn't work. Neither does using geometric window patterns or Renaissance colors to provide visual distraction to make plot elements loom large when in fact, it's just standard stuff. Watch a Tarantino movie, will ya?",

The thing that I remember most vividly from seeing it that last time is being thoroughly upset by the scene in the cornfield at the end of the film. Most of the rest of the movie was overshadowed by the memory of that one scene, so I wanted to watch it again because I love Scorsese's films so much that not knowing about Casino was just acceptable. So I watched it again and I loved it again and my respect and amazement at the quality of the movie and the acting and the story and everything else was renewed, and nothing was that bad during the whole movie, so when the cornfield scene was coming up I thought, come on, there's only maybe 8 minutes left in the movie, how bad could this scene really be? Still, my heart was pounding in my chest. It was bad, man. It was real bad.Now, when I say it was bad, I should clarify that it wasn't bad film-making, it was brilliant film-making. But it was too brilliant. It was so brilliant that it affects me as though I was watching what took place in that scene before me eyes in real life. Scorsese gets a lot of bad press about his films being too violent (from my mom, anyway), and Casino is no exception. In fact, it's probably the flagship of violent Scorsese films. I've been an avid horror fan for more than a decade now, so violence doesn't really bother me, but Scorsese's violence has a grittiness and realism that sets it apart from most other types of film violence. It is graphic and sudden and has a gravity and an on-screen affect that makes it look like a documentary depiction of it. Spielberg achieved this same effect in some of the murders in the not so well received Munich in 2004. Now, as I watch the end of Casino, I wonder what it's like watching the dailies with Scorsese, as he sees for the first time what they've captured on film. Do he and the other cinematographers that work with him jump up and clap each other on the back and pump their fists and yell, \"YES!! We got it, that's the PERFECT shot!!\" Or does Scorsese turn his head from the screen in disgust and whisper, \"That's the one. Print it.\" I'm guessing (hoping) it's some combination of the two.(spoilers) Odd, by the way, that the cringe induced by the final scene should be caused by seeing what happens to Nicky (Joe Pesci), who is by far the film's most violent and out of control character. The brutality of his character is as thorough as can be, but Joe Pesci is just so COOL. He plays almost the same character as he was in Goodfellas (an infinitely more watchable and, in my opinion, even better film overall), and he just does it so well. Makes me wonder what he's really like in real life. He can't really be like that, but he can't be that different, you know what I mean? Sadly, no matter how good this movie is, I just can't watch that cornfield scene. I learned this afternoon that I don't ever want to see it again, just like I don't ever want to see that cop get his ear cut off in Reservoir Dogs. I think those are the only two scenes in any film I've ever seen that I really don't ever want to see again. Brilliant film-making though. I haven't said anything about the myriad of brilliant performances yet, so I'll just say that Sharon Stone plays your typical hysterical woman, always shrieking for her money, her drugs, and her jewelry, her jewelry, her jewelry, for crying out loud, and DeNiro is brilliant as well (and as always). But Pesci steals the show in every scene though, including that last one. Now I need to go watch Home Alone to get that image of him out of my head...",

Part of my fascination with Casino is that large parts of it are based on historical facts. The movie's character's names are barely changed from their real life counterparts. Ginger McKenna (played by Sharon Stone) was Geri McGee in life. Ace Rothstein's real name was Frank Rosenthal. Rothstein (played by Robert DeNiro) really did survive a car bombing and lived to be 79. The real life character played by Joe Pesci was tortured and murdered along with his brother in a cornfield in Indiana. The Ginger character did die of a drug overdose. All these details are seamlessly woven into the movie's storyline. It's a fascinating tale.Robert DeNiro is magnificent as Ace Rothstein. Sharon Stone was nominated for best actress and deserved it. This movie showed that when given a chance, Stone could rise above her sex pot image. She really was a talented actress. Joe Pesci was great as psychotic hit man , Nicky Santoro. The movie's 3 hour runtime passes quickly and will keep you riveted to the screen.",

Joe Pesci is the villian we all love to hate, and DeNiro delivers yet another fantastic performance.

Toss in some scenery chewing from Don Rickles, James Woods, and that hilarious Italian grandmother (Scorsese's real life mother) in the butcher shop, and you can't lose.

Particularly, the scene where the con artist gets his hand smashed is really neatly done.It's actually simple trick using camera angle and mock props, but the movie used it in a sudden way that is guaranteed to pull your eyes to the screen.

You need someone who is good at organisation and leadership, a CEO. Any rich man would know that. If he didn't know that, he wouldn't be rich. So the premise, introduced in the first minute, makes no sense. Joe Pesci's yapping voice - as a narrator?! Some silly staged stabbing in a bar over a pen. The other man's hostility didn't even make sense. Just a lazy set up to show how vicious the Joe Pesci character was. And Robert De Niro falls for the annoying girl that's stealing chips from men and throwing everyone's chips around, when with the status of a casino boss, he could choose any of 1000 non-annoying, non-criminal women?

It's a bad film that no supposedly 'great' director would do. It's a film moved by nothing. Seriously, there is no point to make that film. It looks like a worsened version of Goodfellas, that frankly also wasn't that great. There is the crazy Joe Pesci yelling and killing people and the quiet and conscious but also despicable Robert DeNiro. In fact, it can be considered a reprise of their roles. But unlike Goodfellas, that has an intelligent narration an is so over the top that you even laugh at some scenes, Casino has no redeem value or whats or ever. Is a mess. It's so predictable and so repetitive. Why should I spent three hours of my time to see things that were not only made before a lot of times, but made way better before, after all? It is not worthy watching at all. Not mentioning the fact that the film is ugly as hell, it has no art value and it looks like those low budget films made in the 70s. Total fiasco. The music was great, oh yeah, some great stuff on it. But it was all over the place. I merely believe how bad the music was on this film. But if the music was that bad it was because of the editing. One of the worst that I've ever seen in a 'big' film. Seriously, who are the editors of this film? What a lazy work. What they are thinking? I mean, what they are thinking? And the art direction was so tasteless, it looks like *rap. Sorry for the swearing, but it is literally what I meant to say. I know that the intention of the sparkling colors in the ambient was to make the bandits looks even more extravagant and repugnant than they already were, but it couldn't have been done in a better way? Well, I totally think so. I'm not even bothered by the horrible and senseless script, since that there is things much worse than that in the film. Anyway, it succeeds in passing the intended message, that is to show how dirty and how works the casino's world, but the rest, is a mess. The only good thing about it was Sharon Stone, that was by far the best actress in the film. 4.5/10",

The first time through, it is a challenge to keep up with all the \"moving parts\" going on in this true story. Scorcese masterfully edits his scenes quickly and stylishly, sometimes making it hard to get the key details to understand the set up going on in Vegas. But on the second viewing, you know what to look and listen for, especially in the first half hour to an hour.Although the movie does lag at times with the James Woods character (Stone's ex boyfriend), the first hour of the movie is stupendously good. Of course, a movie this good will deliver iconic scenes, scenes that you will always remember and most people will have favorites, much like Goodfellas. Among several others, my favorite scenes include the intro of Sharon Stone's character and then the montage where DeNiro's voiceover is explaining how she works her illegal operation for the casino, the surprise twist at the end relating to the beginning, and I think the ending is my favorite when the voiceover explains how Vegas has changed so much from the old days. There are many other good or great scenes, but these were the best for me.The second time I watched it, I couldn't get out of it even though I didn't intend to watch the whole thing. I just couldn't stop watching it every time it came back from a commercial, and that just shows how good it is. There is a valid legit argument whether this is better than Goodfellas, but I'd give a slight edge to Goodfellas while still not being sure about it.The first time I saw it, I liked it, but I wasn't totally sure how much.

            "content": "Every scene, a thrill. Every shot, a beauty. Every line, a breath-taker. Scorsese's films are masterpieces and Casino is too. I've called Casino a masterpiece since I was seven hard to believe because I saw about half of it when I was younger and loved the look and feel of it all. Now seeing the whole thing again seven years later I love it and call it my favorite Scorsese film. A lot of people choose Goodfellas over this, but Im the opposite, I think Goodfellas was a great mobster movie and a real life look at the 50s Mafia, but I just love Casino for everything it is.The three main actors De Niro, Pesci, and Stone have all outdone themselves here. This is the best work for all three of them individually. They play their roles with power and serve a unique purpose. Without De Niro, the narrations wouldn't have the same effect and be less powerful. Without Pesci, there would be no Italian to swear as good as him. He swears with meaning and makes you fear him when he steps on screen. His cutthroat, no BS attitude is what stands out on screen. Just like the quote said by Robert Di Nero.Having heard that I repeated it to myself numerous times to get the full effect. It was one of the most powerful quotes in movie history to me. Last, but far from least, is Sharron Stone's portrayal of Ginger McKenna Rothstein. She takes the role in full effect by strutting her gorgeous self in front of the camera with every shot of her being a slick one. Her attitude the whole movie really sticks with you and the fights her and De Niro have are very shocking, yet powerful at the same time. Its a feeling, I've only got from this film.The plot is true and is about Sam \"Aces\" Rothstein (De Niro) working as a bookie at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He takes his job beyond seriously and is usually caught in the minx of everything. His goal is to double Casino profits which is then skimmed by the Mafia which is then reported to the tax agencies. Whatever he bets on, he wins, thats that. He has never made a bet he wasn't sure he was going to win. Hes a smart guy and has never done a bet wrong. He is constantly bothered and put at risk when his buddy Nicky Santoro (Pesci, character based on the real life Anthony Spilotro) is sent to Vegas to assist Same, but winds up antagonizing all the casino members and his brash language and overall personality gets his name in a Black Book which lead to him banned from every casino in Vegas.Sam falls for the hooker and hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone) who he winds up having a child with and marrying. He gives Ginger his trust and puts her jewelry, and $2,000,000 cash money in a bank in which she can only access. Sam regrets it deeply when Ginger is still sneaking around with her ex con boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Their marriage soon crumbles, leading her to a strict and pervasive drug addiction with only Nicky to to.I don't want to go in full detail because the movie does have various surprises including the end, which I saw when I was seven and has traumatized me since. Seeing it again didn't have the same effect, but still scared me for life. This time, I cant say it's just a movie. This honestly happened. The events in this movie really happened and thanks to Scorsese is taken in a serious approach with characters that are in depth and to the point. Nobody but Scorsese could have done this movie. It is a true beauty and shouldn't be taken for granted.I play poker with my friend Mike using fake chips and having no real money involved. It something we do to pass the time. After seeing this movie it almost makes me not want to touch a card or chip again. Sure just playing slots, poker, Blackjack, Roulette, or any poker game wont put you in the position of Nicky, but it makes you think how much hot water these guys really sunk in. This is a job that depends on life or death and is not something I'd ever think to do. Money is one thing, risk is another.The movie is often shown on networks like Bravo and much of it has to be cut out because the f word is said exactly 422 times in three hours. Also because of the drugs and violence about thirty minutes is trimmed out too. My opinion is if this isn't shown in the raw, it shouldn't be shown at all. Profanity is common in this movie, but it shows you how strict Italians got. Various racial terms toward Muslims and Jewish people were brought up. Without the feeling or tense and frustration inside these people the movie is bland. It needs to have profanity to be true to the story of mobsters and gamblers. As well as the violence. Its jam packed with violence, but it needs to be there to show the full aspect. Without it, its tame and false.Casino is a genuine film that maybe overshadowed by Goodfellas and Raging Bull, but to me it's a one of a kind, gambling masterpiece with a four star cast, a four star plot, and a four star feeling after watching it. It has the rare effect of after watching it you feel like you lived it. A true masterpiece in the film industry and Scorsese's best film.Starring: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharron Stone, James Woods,, Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, and Alan King.

Stone wins the movie, proving she is far more than raw beauty and charisma in a powerhouse performance. Wonderful 9/10.",

            "content": "Casino (1995) **** (out of 4) Martin Scorsese's epic look at Mafia crime in Las Vegas has Robert DeNiro playing 'Ace' Rothstein, a man placed in the sin city to run things but his love for a former prostitute (Sharon Stone) and the Mafia henchman (Joe Pesci) brought out to keep things running smoothly might have the entire operation fall apart.Technically speaking this here is without question one of the greatest looking movies that you're ever going to see. How Scorsese told the story of the Mafia's involvement in Las Vegas makes for one of the most visually striking movies that you're ever going to see. I say that because the editing, the music selections and the cinematography really comes to life like very few films and it makes it possible for the director to tell this rather violent story unlike anything else he's ever done.I will say that I don't think this is his greatest movie as I think there are several others that are better but that just speaks to how wonderful Scorsese was that he could make so many terrific movies. As I said, the visual style here is rather amazing and there's a lot of narration used, which had to be done because so much is covered here that without the narration you'd be looking at a six or seven hour movie. The narration is something that at one time bothered me but today it's just an added greatness because of how it basically reads you a story and keeps you up to date on everything that was going on.The performances are another major plus as the director gets some of his strongest performers here. The laid back DeNiro that we get to see here is something the actor really nails. I loved the way DeNiro's rage is all the more powerful when it happens because he just slowly builds this anger towards the wife. Pesci is as powerful as ever. Some of complained that this is basically the same role he played in GOODFELLAS but who cares? Stone also delivers the strongest performance of her career as the deadbeat junkie who by the end of the film you will hate with a passion. We also get great support from Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and Alan King.Clocking in just a couple minutes short of three hours, the film manages to pack quite a punch. As story-telling goes the director does a marvelous job at taking a look at Vegas from countless view points. He perfectly covers the main characters but we also get to see it from crooked politicians, the \"guys back home\" and of course even the FBI. CASINO has all sorts of great scenes and it's just amazing watching how Scorsese puts everything together and turns it into something magical.",

            "content": "The last collaboration between director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro as of today, Casino is a tale of money, power, greed, deception & murder that takes its inspiration from real-life events to paint an interesting portrait of both the glamorous & grisly sides of Las Vegas and is expertly steered by stellar performances from its terrific cast.The story of Casino follows a gambling handicapper who is sent to Las Vegas by the Mafia to oversee their casino operations. When his supervision doubles their profits, they send a mob enforcer who's also his childhood friend to look after him. The plot covers their friendship which turns sour over the years as they compete over a gambling empire.Directed by Martin Scorsese (best known for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull & Goodfellas), the story opens with a bang and comes full circle over the course of its runtime but there is no proper narrative structure to it. We watch people going about their daily business and few people dying, and that's what goes on for 3 hours. But the interest isn't all lost, thanks to Scorsese's fine direction.However, the repetitive nature of it does diminish the earlier excitement and after a while, the only thing that keeps it going and makes sure that the film steers past the finish line are its trio of excellent performances. The 1970s casino ambience comes alive in vivid detail but the story is at its most gripping when depicting the other side of Las Vegas that's violent, merciless & uncompromising.Coming to the performances, the film reunites Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci yet again and while the two play their respective roles with comfort & confidence as expected, it's Sharon Stone who steals the show with her at times broken, other times volcanic rendition of the avaricious character. We may not like the characters this film has in store but there's no denying the performances from the cast is absolutely top-notch.On an overall scale, Casino is another fascinating crime epic from Martin Scorsese that recreates the 1970s casino scene in splendid detail and presents its cast at the top of their game but just like most of his other works with De Niro, it's a picture that I admire more than I love. A three-sided character study that takes its trio to the top, only to throw them off the summit, Casino isn't going to be a smooth ride if you can't handle lengthy narratives or don't have the stomach for strong, intense violence.",

            "content": "Teaming Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in a gangster flick is pretty much a no-brainer, but I couldn't help thinking, especially in the latter hour of the movie, that the picture tried to be just a bit too ambitious for it's own good. At three hours, the picture loses some of it's edge, even with Pesci's manic and over the top characterization of Nicky Santoro, a mob hit man sent to Vegas to keep an eye on Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro) as the boss of the new Tangiers Hotel. The scene with Tony Dogs (Carl Ciarfalio) with his head in a vise will make you glad you live in a different universe from these guys.The surprise role in this picture had to be that of Ginger McKenna, portrayed by Sharon Stone. If you never thought she had much range as an actress she'll probably change your mind here, especially by the time she's had it with Ace and goes into that trashing, hysterical fit before she gets thrown out of the house. I thought it was a nifty touch when the film makers threw in that Rolling Stones cover of 'Heart of Stone' in an early scene between Ace and Ginger. That was perfect.Overall, not a bad gangster flick, but if ever remade, I'd recommend eliminating most or all of the narration by the principals, and let the action speak for itself. That, and a critical eye for all that's unnecessary to pare the story down to it's essentials. Keep De Niro, Pesci and Stone though, they know how to turn up the heat when you need it most.",

It is the laziest trick to tell a story.If it was needed to tell the complete story in 3 hours, then this story should've been a \"two parts\" or a trilogy, without any voice-over whatsoever. I can understand this in fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings, but in a gritty and realistic story? Lame.Also the miscast of De Niro. His character was annoyingly passive and nerdy. He just doesn't give that vibe. Not even close. Awful casting choice.\nAlso, no matter how awful your characters are, you should find a way to make them entertaining to see. Joe Pesci did that. But De Niro and Stone failed.\nI was bored and annoyed by the voice over, and with time, I was bored and annoyed at the characters. I honestly couldn't care less about anything.Good \"based on a real story\" movies tend to make you want to find out exactly what happened after watching them.

Even when characters of secondary importance to the story got wacked we saw it all.And the language is very abusive. I don't think Joe Pesci's character spoke a sentence in the whole movie without saying the f-word. Does it have to be that way.Not for me. I can tolerate violence and abusive language, but only if it is used to describe the environment or is important to the story.

Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein has been personally appointed by the mob to head a casino which he proves himself, but at the same time a relentless obsessive whose meticulousness reaches so far as to the number of blueberries in muffins that the casino sells. His childhood friend Nicky Santoro has moved to Las Vegas with his crew to start up a business. In the midst of it all, Sam meets Ginger, a woman he eventually marries, but in a downward spiral of power and greed, they all find themselves in the middle of it all.Review: Absolutely one of the best films of 1995, \"Casino\" is a truly good film with top notch performances from DeNiro and Pesci as usual, but the real surprise is Sharon Stone, completely eschewing her sex symbol from \"Basic Instinct\" to playing a woman who lives in her dark side. The cinematography of the film matches the tone and look of the story with it's best performances from the entire cast. Unfortunately, Don Rickles and James Woods are wasted in fairly small roles but still provide depth to the film nonetheless. Leonard Maltin didn't know what he was talking about when he reviewed this film, because it's an engrossing story that needed to be told in a three hour length. It's not something you'd pay to see in a theater, but it is something you should see on VHS or DVD. Grade: A-",

It has a great beginning, an interesting ending, but much of the middle is worthless. Out of 3 hours of movie, maybe 1 is watchable.It can be compared to a practical joke that involves a piece of paper that says, \"How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over.\" And on the other side it says \"How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over.\" In terms of entertainment and development, it would as effective to make a 20 minute movie, and repeat that exact same 20 minute movie over and over again until near the end of the movie.

            "content": "\"Casino\" is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and color as Disney World.  Robert De Niro stars as a casino owner who is on the ground-level of the city's change.  He is a high-class crook who's able to turn profits with the help of the mafia and crooked gaming practices (a norm for all casinos).  Joe Pesci is on hand as the mob assassin with the short fuse who is De Niro's right-hand man. However, no one stays on top forever and De Niro's demise is partly due to his ex-prostitute wife (Sharon Stone, in her Oscar-nominated role).  Bad decision-making, shady dealings, and questionable alliances will also be key factors in his ultimate downfall.  Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi-layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes.  \"Casino\" is a crime epic, in close contrast with \"The Godfather\" series of films.  Scorsese accomplishes what he did with \"Raging Bull\" and \"GoodFellas\".  Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with Scorsese's direction and the unrelenting screenplay.  Sharon Stone does the best work of her career.  She does not necessarily shine brighter than De Niro and Pesci, but she holds her own and never lets either of them steal her thunder and lightning.  Another great thing about \"Casino\" is the supporting cast.  Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs (!?) all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits, but is just as potent as his other five-star films.  5 stars out of 5.",

From the images of slow rolling dice to the scintillating voice-overs of movie-legends Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, each second of \"Casino\" shines brilliantly. It is a glorious film.\"Casino\" doesn't get the credit it deserves, unfortunately. It somehow takes a back-seat to gangster films such as \"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas\", two highly inferior films. In nearly every regard, from camera-work to writing to acting, \"Casino\" trumps all other gangster films. If you haven't seen it yet, I envy you (as I would LOVE to see it again for the first time). Repeated viewings get better and better, but I was star-struck while watching \"Casino\" originally...and I'm sure you will feel the same. \"Casino\" is an amazing achievement. Many kudos Mr. Scorsese.It would be a mistake not to mention the tremendous cast...and they all bring their best work to the table. Sharon Stone, in particular, was tremendously impressive. Put it this way: When I originally seen \"Casino\" for the first time, Stone was one of my least-favorite actresses. After the movie, she was my favorite. She didn't just play \"Ginger\", she owned her! If I was asked my opinion on the \"Best Supporting Actress of all-time\", my vote would be Stone in \"Casino\". One of the best performances of all-time. Not to be overlooked is some of the all-time film greats in Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and James Woods. I am having difficult coming up with adjectives worthy enough to describe their performances. It's just an outstanding movie, played by outstanding actors, with outstanding direction.\"Casino\" is like a theme park for movie-going adults. It has it all...Violence (including one absolutely BRUTAL scene to watch), gangsters, drugs, sex and plenty of profanity. But it's also about loyalty, friendships and relationships...in a gangster sort of way. Ever wondered what daily life would be for a mob-dealing gangster? Or a hit-man? Or a married whore? Or a pimp and golf hustler? \"Casino\" covers it all! Just sit back with your favorite drink or cigar...and ENJOY!!! :) Thanks for reading...now go see Casino!JD",

I am not that huge of fan of Sharon Stone but besides that I really can't fathom why she was nominated for an Oscar for this.

I also didn't care for the amount of cussing in this movie. It had 422 uses of the Fword. Which is a record. Almost every single line in this movie used the Fword.

We get it, Marty: you REALLY like The Stones.Take your pick, and I will show you several films for which Scorsese received well more credit than he deserves: the muddy, ponderous \"Mean Streets,\" the mediocre \"Taxi Driver,\" the execrable \"New York, New York\" and \"The Color of Money,\" and the predictable duo of \"Cape Fear\" and \"The Departed,\" the latter of which was utterly ruined by Mark Wahlberg's shrill, one-note performance. Additionally, Scorsese's overblown video to Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" was complete jive and gave the regrettable Wesley Snipes a stairway to stardom.Ultimately, \"Casino\" is poor relation to the superior \"Goodfellas,\" which, along with \"The King of Comedy,\" is Scorsese's only film worthy of the heaps of praise showered upon his overall body of work.

Now, some may not care for it simply because it's just not their cup of tea, but nonetheless it's still a great film. The writing is really perfect for the kind of film it is. A record of the most F bombs ever spoken in a film was set by Casino, before Wolf of Wall Street came along that is. I would probably say the 400+ F bombs used was overkill if it would have been a different kind of film, but it fit perfectly for this kind. The writing definitely fits the characters. The characters are wonderfully deep too, we learn so much about them and we get to see them played by such great actors. Pesci, De Niro, and Stone all turn in marvelous performances, especially Stone (this was her Academy Award nomination). The story is very interesting and you won't be bothered by the somewhat long runtime because of the good pacing and the level of interest. There is just so much happening with these interesting, very damaged characters that you won't wanna turn away, I sure didn't.

After all, the constituent elements are there and one can almost foretell a delectable piece on the dark underbelly of Vegas told through a true master's aesthetics. If the same breakneck verve that abounded in 'Goodfellas' was applied to the already radiant Las Vegas, is it not logical to think that something truly stunning should ensue?The opening title sequence is enough to make your mouth water as the significance and seriousness of the tale is immediately conveyed through the gracefully falling body of De Niro and a backdrop of Bach's fine choral piece. However, somewhere along the line the screws went undone and someone must have forgotten to carry the 2. Casino left me feeling like the proverbial s***. Though the violence cannot be deemed gratuitous, something about the film is so dark and depressing, the final product is little short of off-putting. The obvious fault is the length, but there is a myriad of other problems that force Casino to trudge along while Goodfellas flew by.\nAll in all, definately not a waste of time, but have something cheerful lined up later.",

Martin Scorsese's stylish tale of power, greed, and deception is based on real-life organized crime associate, Lefty Rosenthal. The screenplay is penned by Scorsese and his collaborator from 'Goodfellas', Nicholas Pileggi. The movie is three hours long, and it might feel like it drags on places, but the writing is perfect. And what fantastic performances by the actors. The main cast (Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Don Rickles, and Sharon Stone in one of her best roles) is supported by magnificent mob movie heavyweights like Vinny Vella and Frank Vincent. Nearly half of the movie is told through narrations that are quite descriptive, so it almost feels like you are watching (listening) visual audiobook. But the narrations are spot on and contains some of the best lines from the movie. Especially the ones from Joe Pesci whose narration is so smooth and calm compared to his hot-tempered character Nicky Santoro.A pure, classic mob movie in the best Martin Scorsese style.",

            "content": "Gargantuan epic(some critics and Scorsese fans considered it his \"failed epic\")about mob-run Las Vegas focusing on casino \"boss\" De Niro, his flashy junkie wife Sharon Stone, and volatile \"muscle\", Joe Pesci, how they had it all and squandered it due to their own faults and frailties. De Niro, without a legal license to run a casino, was able to run operations of a specific casino successfully with help from city commissioners, and, most importantly, major Midwest mobsters who skimmed from the \"counting room\" in order to allow him his opportunity to earn lots of money and live a life of luxury. Pesci was the mob's go-to-guy when they needed people whacked or kept in line, anyone who threatened to take from the mobsters what they considered theirs. Pesci is feared, but unstable and ill-tempered, and soon his presence in Las Vegas wasn't wanted, his criminal activities catching the attention of the police and FBI out to put him behind bars. Sharon Stone is alluring and attractive to De Niro, but she's involved with a lowlife pimp(played by James Woods)and unable to let him go. Stone has the looks and personality that benefits De Niro, helping him bring in the right kind of people to profit from in his casino. But her drug habits and alcoholism(not to mention, her inability to relinquish her love for Woods who is manipulating her to give him money behind De Niro's back)slowly over time ruin the marriage and this deterioration places her in the arms of Pesci! Scorsese's film is, as you'd expect, very detailed and the screenplay quite elaborate in the inner-working of the criminal enterprise ran by the mob who used wiseguys as their eyes and ears in Las Vegas. We see how De Niro and Pesci's personalities bring about their downfall, and Stone's addictions lead to a tragic conclusion. With all the money, clothes, and jewelry, Stone couldn't find happiness, agonizing in a joyless marriage to a man she never loved to start with. De Niro, as much as he was skilled at making money for his mobsters, couldn't help himself when it came to Stone and running such an efficient casino that he couldn't appease the city commissioner to allow his dumb-as-dirt brother-in-law(Joe Bob Briggs, inspired casting)a small position. Pesci's explosive, corrosive temperament, and unwillingness to play by the rules when it come to behaving in casinos, meant that he was doomed to eventually be discarded by his superiors. As was the case in GOODFELLAS, CASINO has startling scenes of brutal violence as the FBI get the pinch on a stupid mobster goon who gave up the names and subject matter of his people with the old-time gangsters setting in motion the executions of anyone who might rat them out. Watching the glamorous Stone unravel by film's end is disheartening and rather pitiable, going from elegant and stunning to washed-out and browbeaten, the drugs and booze turning her into a hobbling, malevolent, blabbering misfit. We see Pesci stab a man with a pen for cursing De Niro, shoot a woman while eating her supper, and bash poor Don Rickles across the face and skull with a telephone..it's not surprising what his character's outcome is. De Niro, though, because he's such a money-making machine, might escape a grim fate, although Scorsese opens the film with him in a car that blows up. Scorsese leans heavily on voice over narration from both De Niro and Pesci who explain the ways things were run in Las Vegas before the corporations took over. Clocking in at 3 hours, CASINO is certainly long-winded, and I'm not sure these are the kind of characters one wants to spend this amount of time with, but I found the story Scorsese brings to light compelling enough to withstand the entire journey.",

            "content": "A Martin Scorsese's film, casting with his longtime partner Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, like another \"Goodfellas\". This time the story is about Casino, but mobster is still an indispensable part of it.The film began with a car bomb and then flashed back to how Sam carved out his way in the casino business, how he desperately kept the balance between business and his mobster background. At the same time, this film emphasized his unsuccessful relationship with his wife, Ginger. Which is quite unusual in a Scorsese film because most of his films female characters are just ornaments. But this time, Ginger (played by Sharon Stone) is indisputably the leading actress in Casino.Violence is another important ingredient of this film, torture, beating, bombing and killing, all to bring forth the cruelty of the living world. If you're a typical Scorsese's fan, you will love it.The accurate and realistic depiction of Casino business is also remarkable. The colorful world filled with gambling, cheating and hustling. But all gamblers are losers, the only winner is the casino itself. Business is business, making profit is the ultimate goal. When Sam had made great fortune by running the casino, he wanted to be a normal businessman and didn't want to be involved into mobsters anymore. But it was difficult to quit because he had already made the countless ties with them. When it concerns with benefits, it's not a thing one man can decide anymore.Talking abut the actors, I have to admit that Sharon Stone is wonderful in this film, her only Oscar-nominated role by far. But there is something I must complain about, that is the role of Ginger, which is so stupidly written, she was just a mindless Blondie who only wanted to marry a rich man to enjoy a luxury life. We don't blame her for that, nevertheless how could she be so in love with James Wood's role is beyond redemption and totally unconvincing! Maybe the answer is either me or Martin Scorsese does not understand women at all. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci's acting are some kind of continuing of their roles in \"Goodfellas\", good but far from excellent.This film is not Scorsese's best work and Sharon Stone shines in her bitter and badly-written role.",

            "content": "I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's one of those rare films where you can watch it a dozen times, and it's just as thrilling as it was the first time around. Considering it preceded Martin's successful GoodFellas: a film regarded as a classic gangster film (and rightfully so), the format has a bit of the same style going, with a narrative to guide us through the story, and featuring powerhouse duo of Pesci & DiNero, but with this film, so as a result it gets overshadowed, but to me, it qualifies as a film on its own, MY favorite film mind you.There's a certain feel that this movie carries and it's nothing short of perfect. 3 hours in length and not a single minute wasted, it's a masterpiece. Compared to GoodFellas, it's just felt more solid, more nuanced, detailed, technical shots better executed, sound, light, every actor giving 100 % to make you feel immersed in the story. The violence is there too, and naturally it's a ruthless world, but instead the violence has more of a conscience. GoodFellas was hit after hit, sometimes leaving you feeling like you're watching a slasher, so it becomes ineffective. Throughout Casino, the violence is less common, but VERY real, sometimes comically shocking like Friedkin's Killer Joe, to bleak like what you see in American History X. Sharon Stone who plays Ginger plays the alpha HBIC perfectly, and as we learn later on, downplays what chaos she is capable of.DeNior, who plays Ace, is strictly business but he has a heart of gold. He's the narrator and the mediator, and more the more screen time he gets, the more you really like the guy. Comedia Kingpin Don Rickles is even in this movie! Just perfect! Capolavoro!",

            "content": "Perhaps proving the theory of cinema bringing to life the dark desires audience members dare not act out, the American film industry and audiences alike have always demonstrated a perverse fascination with the crime epic - films detailing the illustrious life of those prospering off a life of breaching conventional codes of ethics. Such is a theme that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese has returned to time and time again: demonstrating the pros and cons of a life lived on the other side of the law. And while Scorsese's mob classic Goodfellas charted the rise of a lowly hood through the ranks of the mob, Casino details the contrary: a life of luxury at the top of the mob, the consumption of man's soul by greed, betrayal and maddening violence, and the inevitable plummet which ensues. Although comparisons to Goodfellas may prove inevitable, (given the similar subject matter, stylistic narrative and cinematic techniques, use of brutal violence and even the re-use of actors De Niro and Pesci) to fail to recognize the staggering accomplishment that is Casino, similarities or not, would be unforgivable. Ultimately the two are entirely different animals, as Casino, despite its glitzy exterior, demonstrates a distinctly darker storyline throughout, as its meticulously constructed, precariously balanced criminal organization begins to be torn apart from the foundations, with cataclysmic outcomes. The script, written by Nicholas Pileggi (working from his own source novel) and Scorsese himself is a fiercely memorable piece of work, punctuated with harshly realistic characters and scenarios, and a slew of maliciously well crafted lines. Although De Niro and Pesci's dual voiceovers can be slightly distracting, leading one to believe that the film might have benefited from the elimination of the Pesci voice-over all together, they do provide intriguing contrasting sides of the same story, and one can hardly fault the writers for experimenting. The legendary Scorsese is operating at the top of his game here, bringing all of his trademark meticulous professionalism to play with devastatingly effective results. By moving his film along at a steady, blistering pace, yet still taking his time, allowing his characters to slowly unfold throughout and giving the audience plenty of time to drink in the seductive yet tainted luxury of the lifestyles of high profile casino officials, Scorsese uses his film's hefty duration to his advantage, immersing the audience within his story in a truly peerless fashion. With typically superb neo-noir style cinematography (with many lengthy sweeping shots, capturing the breadth of the casino in all of its hedonistic glory) and editing, and enormously well complimented by one of his patented soundtrack amalgamations, Scorsese's work similarly excels on a technical front, making for a supremely impressive piece of film-making. As per usual, Scorsese extracts riveting intensity and realism from his cast, with captivating results. Robert De Niro inhabits the role of casino owner Sam 'Ace' Rothstein with a masterful conviction and charisma, dispelling all fears of him coasting by on such an admittably familiar role. Joe Pesci runs the risk of being forever typecast in a role only a shade away from his performance in Goodfellas, but fiercely proves his peerless status in inhabiting psychopathic loose-cannon mobsters. Sharon Stone delivers a surprisingly powerful performance as Rothstein's endlessly greedy drug-addict trophy wife, entirely believable as her character arcs from smoothly manipulative to dizzyingly cocaine-addled and truly pathetic. Don Rickles is a charming presence as Rothstein's right hand man in the casino, and Frank Vincent gives a strong performance as a suspicious fellow member of the mob. James Woods proves grotesquely memorable as Stone's past pimp boyfriend, and Woods shines in his few scenes, chewing the scenery with disconcerting aplomb. Kevin Pollack also impresses as a smooth talking \"front man\" for the more sinister undertones of the casino.Brutally intense and endlessly fascinating, Scorsese's crime epic delivers a sufficiently flooring clout to easily merit distinction from Goodfellas' shadow. A masterclass of brilliant writing, blistering acting and disturbingly realistic thematic content, Casino proves another towering accomplishment from the incomparable Scorsese, one worth seeing by any in search of searingly powerful and impeccably crafted film-making. -10/10",

            "content": "As an exhilarating immersion in the titular business, the first act is probably the greatest from any Scorsese's film. Marty plunges us into Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein's universe through a hypnotic flamboyance, working like a reminiscence of another Gangster classic, \"Scarface\"; and Robert De Niro is as charismatic and respectable as ever. I wanted to be this \"Ace\", this manager whose infallible competence in gambling, betting and defining odds made it sound like an exact science. The opening is about a competence, and boy, how refreshing it was to see in a Marty's film, a man who loves his profession, and who's not a gangster. This part is the reason why I like and respect \"Casino\" as a cinematic achievement. And Marty's direction deserved an Oscar nod, if only for this moment where Ace tries to find out how some customers cheat.This part absorbs me so much I always wish it would never end. But you can't expect from a Scorsese film to avoid the cherished theme of guilt, and no guilt without a mistake. So, we wait for it to come, remembering the very first lines wondering how this could have gone wrong? \"Ace\" was the Tangiers' undisputed boss, protected by the mob 'back home', who controlled the casino through the notoriously corrupted (at least in mafia films) teamsters' union. Plus, \"Ace\" had a feared bodyguard, the psychopathic Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci in a performance that would have been more impacting if it hadn't been preceded by Tommy De Vito. In fact, the whole movie has a deja-vu feeling due to its plot's similarity with \"Goodfellas\" but this wasn't a problem for me.The problem was the hypocrisy of the whole \"how things could have gone wrong\". You expect the movie to introduce it smoothly while in fact, as soon as it starts going wrong, the whole narrative, is structured by a series of mistakes. Nicky was at least honest and explicit about his intentions in Las Vegas. He wanted to squeeze the town until the last drop. He wanted the big thing, and no one to step him over, he didn't care about warnings, about his bosses' instructions, he was in a gangster's oasis in the middle of nowhere, and Ace trying to reason him was as laughable as his attempt to conquer Ginger's heart. Nicky's 'pen in the neck' was a premonition of him being the pain in the ass. But still, he was the guy whose friendship prevented Sam to act against him, like Charlie and Johnny Boy in \"Mean Streets\". One weakness, I could have handled; but another was one too much, and I'm talking of Ginger, Sharon Stone in her Oscar nominated role.In fact, even Ginger's entrance bothered me, because Marty and Bobby portrayed Sam as a meticulous man who means business and tolerates absolutely no imperfection. So, I didn't buy that he would let a woman throw the chips in the air like this, even for a 'love at first sight' moment, I thought the movie immediately lost its gripping realism, and it's one of the few weaknesses I noticed, after the dummy in the car's explosion and before Anna Scott's strangely blood-less murder. I couldn't believe the guy who told the croupier to perfectly align the chips, or the cook to keep the same quantity of blueberries in the muffins would let this happen. Well, let's concede that it was love, and Bobby played perfectly the part of a man who wants a desirable blonde so much (indeed, she was beautiful) that he didn't care about being loved. And we understand this would be his downfall. But it just started the very day of their marriage, when she was calling her ex-pimp, James Woods as a believable scumbag named Lester. Couldn't \"Ace\" get the point? That's \"Casino\"'s problem: problems come too early, we know it will be an infernal spiral until a bloody climax would purge out the bad blood, it's just a matter of time before it'll explode, before Sam beats the hell out of Ginger, before Nicky gets his comeuppance etc. Basically, \"Casino\" is about people wondering how they screwed up, while they had it coming from the start. It's about a situation with people being their own liabilities and the icing on the cake was the disturbing sex moment between Nicky and Ginger. I wouldn't care if \"Casino\" was at least a half-hour shorter, but it spans too much time on the 'problems' sequence, it gets redundant and annoying, too much shouting, arguing and of course narrating. Hell, at one point even Nicky's sidekick, Frank Vincent as the namesake Marino, started doing voice-over. The movie reached an extraordinary level of noisiness where even the soundtrack got in my nerves, the part with Ginger and Lester and the \"Can't Live if Living is Without You\" song was annoyance at its peak before Marty finally redeemed the film.At the end, \"Casino\" finally reconciles with the idea that we're watching a Gangster film, and that all this mess must come to an end now, and all the protagonists of this tragicomedy must meet their maker, in the most gruesome way if possible. And I can't go on without mentioning that particularly gruesome and disturbing scene, where Nicky witnesses the death of his brother Dominick before receiving the same batting treatment from Marino and the gang. \"Billy Batts' revenge\" broke both Nicky's bones and my heart, and his crying followed by a bloody face half-breathing before covered by sand, will haunt me forever.\"Casino\" starts and ends with intensity, but in-between \u0085 well, it's like starting a Texas Holdem game, with a pair in your hands, expecting to win with two pairs, or a three of a kind, but at the end, you just win because all the players folded. Shorter would have been better with less style and more substance.And that's that.",

The effortless way Scorcese pulls this off (he uses a 1930s-style font for captions, and at times the strip appears as if drawn in pastels) is perhaps his last great cinematic achievement. But it's not quite a great film, too long for its length, too similar to his earlier 'Goodfellas', and, for all its horrific violence, just a little too smooth. The audience of 'Raging Bull' was allowed to feel what it was like to be Jake La Motta, at least as Scorcese imagined it. The audience of 'Casino' is merely told, the double-headed voice-over steering us through a story we are shown, but never allowed wholly inside of. Still, the abruptly unsentimental ending reminds us of the ruthless that all great directors must possess; and sadly, it's not a edge Scorcese seems to possess any more.",

            "content": "Another beautifully depicted story by Scorsese narrating the ascension and descent of Ace Rothstein (Robert de Niro) as a brilliant bookie that is selected to run the Tangiers casinos. De Niro, as usual, offers an invigorating exhibition of a stern, unrelenting, but also charismatic character that is facing overwhelming obstacles that could easily succumb any other man. You can't help but admire his resiliency even despite participating in repeated immorality. That is the beauty of the complexity of Scorsese's cinematography. You not only get to learn about the the rise and fall of a fascinating character, but you also experience the humanity within immorality.Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) the irreverent and temerarious mobster that is always willing to go one step further to prove how maniacal he can be is a tremendously entertaining addition to the story that delivers at least a few chuckles with his antics. Ginger Mckenna (Sharon Stone) as the con-artist, drug addict, trophy wife delivers another notable performance being obnoxiously destructive, impulsive, and reckless to the point that it is difficult to even empathize with her situation. Both characters, the ones Ace loved the most, end up colluding into becoming Rothstein's worst enemies, becoming primarily responsible for his downfall.Casino gets a repeated addition of Pesci and De Niro's flavor that is one of the obvious highlights. The interaction between them is memorable, so much that they have become cultural symbols in different forms. Not to take any credit from Scorsese, but it is easy to achieve brilliance with the impudent and incredibly charismatic personalities of Pesci and De Niro.We see all the debauchery of Las Vegas lifestyle and how it participates in almost every type of immoral behavior that it can. Even the seemingly legal authorities were corrupted in its own particular form. Again, it is the message that even as a person attempts to preserve its integrity surrounded by broken people, he will inevitably get pulled into their chaos.Casino will leave a mark in anyone that is interested in watching a superb story-telling, charismatic protagonists, and Las Vegas in all its degenerate glory.",

            "content": "The characters of Casino have everything that money can buy: beautiful cars, beautiful clothes, beautiful houses, and yet it is still not enough. The people that win the most money at the casinos are not the people that get the jack-pots. The money ultimately goes to the owners of the casinos. As pointed in the film, even the jack-pot and Black Jack winners end up being losers eventually if they play long enough.In the film \"Casino\" not even the people running the casinos win either in the end. They also eventually lose as if they had also played too long, which seems to be the message of Casino. Because no matter how much money is gained, the characters always want more, and they resort to acts of unspeakable cruelty to keep the money flowing, for themselves and their mob bosses back in Chicago who are financing the casino scheme.This is possibly Scorcese's most disturbing and violent film. The characters are compelling but none are particularly sympathetic. Rothstein, perfectly suited to actor Robert De Niro, seems the only character to at least have some kind of sensible code. But even he is not above resorting to acts of violence if anyone is caught cheating at his casino, The Tangiers.In addition to De Niro, the acting of the other cast members is equally first rate, with a tour-de-force performance by Sharon Stone as the most tragic character of the story. Her character, from the in-the-know casino hustler paying off the valets to the dependent drug-addict giving thousands of dollars to her old pimp and junkie, is completely believable from beginning to end. Pesci also turns in another fine performance very similar to the character he portrayed in Goodfellas as the ruthless jewel robber and murderer.The film is somewhat hampered by voice-overs that last too long in some places. The beginning voice-over makes sense as De Niro describes the operations of the casino. But then other characters chime in and it gets over burdensome. Also, the violent is incredibly graphic, even for Scorcese. Definitely not for all tastes and certainly NOT for children.Still, despite some misgivings, Casino is still a great film. Maybe neither an Oscar winner nor Scorcese's best but certainly the director's most ambitious project.",

            "content": "I did not know, when I went to see this film, that there was a true story behind it. But that was something that struck me because of the way the film presents the plot. It became evident that there was something and that was a bonus, a film that, in itself, is already capable of proving itself excellent. Despite all the comparisons with \"Goodfellas\", (I couldn't help doing them myself), I don't think Scorcese tried to repeat the dose, although it is undeniable that he likes to make this kind of films, involving mafia or organized crime (\"The Irishman\", very recently, and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", for example, not to mention the obvious \"Goodfellas\").The script shows how two Chicago mobsters manage to control and run a casino in Las Vegas until marital problems, betrayal and mistrust, addictions, greed and brutality eventually led them to their fall. There are some sub-plots that are developing equally, but everything is brilliantly orchestrated and combined by Scorcese. The film has all his style and their three hours length pass quickly. The heavy atmosphere, the brutal and raw violence, the current use of slang and f-words, are all part of a style that Scorcese associated with his gangster films. The torture scene where that guy's head was smashed into a vise is worthy of anthology, and likewise some of the scenes where Pesci gets angry and starts brutally beating those in front.Robert De Niro is one of those actors who never, or almost never, fails. And he works beautifully with Scorcese, as does Pesci. The three collaborated wonderfully here, and the result is a harmonious combination between the work of the director and the two main actors. There is not a moment out of tone. Pesci's performance was really the best of his career, much more mature and profound than in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone, in turn, had to face a difficult character, in which beauty is associated with a certain spirit of survival and a vicious cycle, that ends up leading her character to self-destruction. She has a character that requires beauty, sensuality, but also a lot of psychological depth, and the actress achieved its combination brilliantly, being nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress that year and winning the Golden Globe in the same category. She, like Pesci, achieves in this film one of her best performances ever (or at least everything I have seen of her so far). In addition to them, the film has good additions such as James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, Pasquale Cajano and Vinny Vella, among others.Technically, the film is impeccable. Filmed inside a real casino during daily closing hours, you couldn't demand a better or more detailed set. The cinematography and camera work were also meticulously done, and editing, mixing and post-production work are impeccable. The pace is good, with scenes so well linked that the whole story is crystal clear to the audience, despite the three hours length. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which harmonizes perfectly with what the film shows, and the general environment.This film is not just a follower in the path of \"Goodfellas\", although there are similarities in style, derived from the presence of the same director and main actors. It is a different film, less sympathetic perhaps, more brutal, realistic, intense, sometimes cynical and deeply critical. It is definitely worth seeing.",

The glitz and glamor of Vegas casinos has always been captivating to me.I really enjoyed Sharon Stone's character; she played the trophy wife trope flawlessly and Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were amazing as usual. The fact that this is a true story makes this all the more interesting. Ace and Ginger's outfits are colorful and fun; this film captured 70s fashion perfectly!

Nicky Santoro, a boyhood friend of Ace and now a Made-Man of the Mafia, arrives in town with an ambitious agenda of his own that soon disrupts Ace's life.....The thing about Casino is that almost everyone who thought Goodfellas was a masterpiece would undoubtedly have monumental expectations for this, what could be classed metaphorically, as a sequel.Well while it never reaches the dizzy heights or beautiful character arcs of Goodfellas, it's still a solid movie from Scorcese, and proof that he and De Niro were a the top of their games when they worked together.Even though it's almost three hours long, it's just unmissable cinema. For example, it was on TV the other night and I thought to myself 'I'll watch this for thirty minutes before I go to bed', but it's hypnotic cinematography and soundtrack made me stay until the end.De Niro is wonderful as usual, channelling a little of Jimmy Conway's attitude, but this time, Sam is a little more of a coward than before, and although he has good intentions for everyone, where money is involved, you can't please or trust anyone.Pesci surprisingly is the weak link in the film. I'm not saying he's no good, the man is a phenomenal actor, but here, he's literally doing his Tommy Devito character, and when you channel a character as memorable as that one, it's going to get noticed.........much like his face being pinned back to make his look younger.Stone gives the performance of her life as the insufferable Ginger, when an actress can give a performance where the audience has not an ounce of sympathy, or empathy for the character she's portraying, that's a job done blooming well. She deserved every award going that year, her Ginger is a poisonous, money hungry addict, evil to the bone.It's beautiful to look at, the desert confrontation between Sam and Nicky is insanely intense, but at the same time beautiful.The film follows the same narrative structure as Goodfellas had, the main character narrating the story, and certain songs depicting the year, which again is a weak point, because you just keep referring to that film.So all in all, it's a solid film, beautiful to look at, with a career best from Stone, but it feels like it's trying too much to be Goodfellas, which gives it a little air of desperation.",

            "content": "I have not had the pleasure of seeing many of Martin Scorsesee's films, and this might actually be the first. I have heard that he is a well known director with a unique style, but as I have not seen any of his films, I cannot comment on it; but if they are anything like Casino then so far I am impressed. I heard of Martin Scorsesee not from watching movies but from a Alternate band named King Missile (known for a song which they wrote about as certain part of the male anatomy that a person was able to remove, and then ended up losing, and finding it again and having to fork out $20 to buy it back - weird group). I will not go into the details of what their song was about and what they wanted to do to Martin Scorsesee even though they said that he made the best films.Casino is a movie about people and about how that begin with everything and end with nothing. The movie is based around Sam (Robert DeNiro) who is made the director of a Casino by the mafia. His childhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) comes to Las Vegas to apply his business - thuggery - to the town almost untouched by thugs. It is set in a time when the gangs ruled Las Vegas and gambling was a game of skill, and enticing people out of their money was done by the way one arranges their poker machines. The conclusion shows us that those days are passed as now the corporations own Las Vegas and the casinos only exist if their theme is worth it.As I said earlier the movie is about people, and to explore the movie we must explore the people and the relationships that they have with each other. There are three main characters and they are Sam, Nicky, and Ginger. Sam and Nicky do not change where as Ginger does. This is important because the Ginger and Nicky claim that Sam has changed, but this is differential to the nobility of his character. One might ask how can Sam be noble when there is no honour among thieves? Well, in this time there is honour and this honour his held at the point of the gun. There is a way that the mafia does things and if people don't do what the mafia tells you then you will find yourself buried in a hole in the middle of a corn field. Yet the problem with this honour is that it works on the assumption that might means right, meaning that once somebodies power exceeds your own then either you comply or suffer the consequences.Sam's character is the central character. He is clean, an spends the whole movie clean. He is a man that does not take risks, he only takes certainties. As is said at the beginning of the movie, he is a man that when he makes a bet, the entire bookmaking industry changes. As such he is the perfect man for a casino because he knows how to make money. Now he has a record in illegal gambling so it is difficult to get him into a casino, but as long as you treat the authorities in Las Vegas okay, then they won't happen you - the minute you step over the line and upset somebody, then they can put the pressure upon you.As I said before, Sam does not take chances. He is a man that runs everything his way. He is obsessed that everything runs smoothly. He does not pay people to think because their thoughts are not his thoughts and they don't know how to work the people and the floor. The example is the poker machines. He puts the big jackpot machines in plain view rather than hiding them. Hiding them keeps people away and as such they don't run the risk of hitting the big jackpot, but having them in plain view brings more people to them so that they waste more money trying to win the big jackpot. Of course his obsessiveness with things running his way is very much a flaw, as he wants to always know where his wife is, and this leads to distrust and finally to the breakdown in their marriage. It was not all his fault as he tried to marry a woman who was not meant to be married and it ended up destroying him and her. The blueberry muffin affair is another instance where is compulsiveness goes overboard.Casino is about power and the question of who really rules. In one way we see that the mafia rules Vegas from the east, while on the other hand, the authorities are so corrupt that they let them, yet if you upset the authorities then they can and will tighten their fist. Or is it the king of the thugs - Nicky - who rules. It seems like he does, but in the end he only finds himself in a pit in a cornfield.",

Not to say she did a bad job, but when you see who else all auditioned, it is odd that she pulled ahead. Stone is now more or less a relic of the 1990s.

Here's another true mafia related tale, about the corrupt vices behind a casino, where it's new boss, Sam Rothstein, (a more gentler soul to Deniro's semi frightening Jimmy Gent in Goodfellas) has a close call with death, via a car explosion, where too the Ace as he was known, survives many interrogations, and some terrifying moments of paranoia, not knowing if he was going to be the next body dropped in the desert. We see him take continual hounding by the FBI, but the Ace always managed to beat him. Of course, Deniro's faultless, his mate, mafia cowboy Nicky Santoro, (Joe Pesci, solid) bares some similarities to the incredibly frightening Tommy in Goodfellas, though I know who I'd pick, if I having to choose a room alone. Stone is at her shining moment, playing the junkie pro Ginger, who became Mrs Sam Rothstein, despite having to a constantly cling on to a scuzzy low life pimp, Lester, (Woods in one of his best performances) who maintained this sort of hold on her. Again there are violent moments that shock, one as excessively illustrated by the big boys upstairs, to players who rig games, another one involving insult, plus Pesci's foul mouthed antics, and womanizing, even doing Stone. Even more enjoyable than Goodfellas, it's running time had me worried, stretched out to nearly three hours. Casino, sort of has an excess feel to it, judging by some themes, that have us questioning if they were true, but again it's just another engrossing Scorsese hit. I dare him to make one that it isn't. A great night at home.",

            "content": "When Casino came out it wasn't too well received from what I can remember. It reunited director Martin Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi and actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci from Goodfellas. The obvious similarities between the films were used negatively against it. It was essentially seen as a lesser re-run of that earlier film. Well, I guess critics need to say things like this to indicate they know what they're talking about but for the rest of us such details are sort of irrelevant and we are only really interested in whether Casino was any good on its own right. And the answer is that it sure is. Maybe not of the standard of Goodfellas but it sure is in a similar ball-park. Like that earlier film it's based on real events, although in this case even more characters have been re-named, probably for legal reasons. It's a rise and fall crime film about the workings of a 70's Las Vegas casino, in which the Mafia skimmed millions of dollars.From the great opening credit sequence from the legendary Saul Bass, this is a tour de force of technical excellence. It' visually very impressive with great period detail. Scorsese is a master at this kind of narrative and commands our attention with his customary dynamic direction. The story is propelled by a fair bit of narration from De Niro and Pesci, who respectively play the man who runs the casino and the Mob enforcer. Both actors are on the top of their game and are impressively supported by a career best turn from Sharon Stone as a high-class hooker who gets involved with De Niro's character in a loveless marriage. None of the principle characters are especially likable or sympathetic but the top class acting from them ensures they are always compelling. Scorsese certainly has a knack of presenting damaged people on screen in convincing and enthralling ways. Like others there is a focus on harsh domestic relationships and the De Niro/Stone coupling does make for intense viewing at times. Pesci, on the other hand, is absolutely full-on and authentic as a very bad guy. In fact, Casino tops any other Scorsese film in the grim violence stakes. This is a film not exactly for the faint hearted at times. It also showcases another facet of the director's with a soundtrack of pop and rock tracks from the period, except this is his most extreme utilisation of this scene setting musical approach with song after song strung together relentlessly, underpinning events with very few gaps of silence in between. If I had to level any negativity against the movie at most I would say maybe it's a little bit overlong but even then it does have a cracking pace and keeps the attention regardless.It does seem that over the years Casino has garnered a better reputation and is now looked upon as another excellent Scorsese picture and this is the way it should be.",

            "content": "\"Casino\" (1995), here we have an example of a dysfunctional \"film\" written and directed by a very lazy film maker, known as Martin Scorsese. This \"movie\" is a painful example of being way too pedestrian. What that means, is that the film makers behind redundant types of films are afraid to step out of their comfort zones and try something different. \"Casino\" is the exact same thing as the other diarrhea stain, known as \"Goodfellas\" (1990). It's the exact same plot, except it takes place in Las Vegas instead of New York City. Granted, \"Goodfellas\" is not a total disaster though. It does have a couple of redeeming qualities. But overall, it was nothing but pure disappointment. \"Casino\" suffers the same problems as \"Goodfellas\", just ten times worse! It has a dull and predictable story, abysmal acting, cheap special effects, and a dull generic soundtrack. This story was doomed from the start, it was co-written by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the script for \"Goodfellas\". You would think that Martin Scorsese would have learned his lesson and kept his hands off screenplay duties! He should have just stuck to directing, but that's beside the point. \"Casino\" is yet another gangster film with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as two of the main characters. We'll go into more details with them later. One of the biggest issues with this \"film\" is the constant bombardment of narration. As I mentioned, showing instead of telling usually conveys a stronger impact. This is supposed to be a \"movie\", not an audiobook! In one scene, where the actions of a casino are being described in detail, it just makes this \"film\" seem more like a boring documentary than a legible piece of cinema. Seriously, every time there was any narration during the \"movie\", I shouted: \"just shut up!\" Narration is supposed to enhance the story behind the film, not be a distraction. Another big problem, is the excessive violence. You're probably thinking: \"what?\" Yes, violence in movies and TV shows usually does not bother me. But, in the rare case of this \"film\", they went way above and beyond. It was past the point of redundant. I mean, good God! I don't mind a violent movie well-told with a great story. But, any violence has to be earned and warranted. I honestly think some of these fights were added in to pad out the runtime. Isn't 178 minutes long enough?! The plot in this \"film\" is the same exact thing as \"Goodfellas\", only on steroids. How original! Now for the acting, it ranges from bad, to just plain abysmal. The best of the bad are Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. But, the problem is, we've seen them before in other Martin Scorsese films! What? He couldn't find any other actors to be in this crappy movie? He must really treat those two like royalty to keep them coming back to work for him! Sharon Stone gives a terrible performance, seasoned with cliched filth. In the case of this \"movie\", her nickname should really be Sharon Stoned. Her character just looks bored and high as a kite throughout the \"film\". Hey, if I was involved with this \"movie\", I'd be bored too, but I would never do drugs! Bear in mind, Sharon Stone is not a terrible actress overall. She has acted well in other movies and shows. So, what's her excuse here? The other actors and actresses just fall flat, as a result of redundancy and bad chemistry from the other horrible acting performances. As for the special effects, most of them were actually not too bad. However, there were some, particularly a lot of the gun and blood effects get a little cheesy. Plus, you can tell at multiple points that the baseball bats during the death scene in the cornfield are just made out of rubber. Also, Joe Pesci's character buried in the ground is obviously an animatronic robot. Finally, the soundtrack is a total joke. It's one of the most boring and poorly arranged film scores I've heard. Once again, it sounds like it was rushed together at the last minute. Film Making 101: when you notice the edits on-screen, or notice it in the audio, then something is very wrong. Editing is supposed to be completely seamless and unnoticed by the viewer at all! Now for the only miraculous positive, which is the sets/locations. Casinos always create a nice atmosphere and of course Las Vegas is a fun place to film a movie! Bottom line, Martin Scorsese's biggest issue is that he's afraid to step out of his comfort zone with his films. I haven't seen all of his movies. But, \"Casino\" is, in my opinion, his absolute worst film! It is nothing short of a pile of garbage. I'm giving this \"film\" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're ever looking to watch a great gangster, drama film, or any other movie for that matter, I strongly suggest that you find one without Martin Scorsese's involvement!",

            "content": "It is unfortunate that 'Casino' is usually perceived merely as a critique of the Mafia. Much more than a clich\u00e9 condemnation of the criminal underworld, the film delivers a mordant 'j'accuse' against the degradation of the self-destructive socioeconomic system (including cops, government bureaucrats, politicians) that generated and institutionalized the Mafia's role in contemporary Americana.Upon relocating to Las Vegas, childhood friends Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) submit their gangster experience to the disposal of the local mob network, which controls the gambling industry. Rothstein rapidly excels as a Mafia-sanctioned casino manager luxuriating in a Roman lifestyle, while Santoro successfully commands the rougher, more violent aspects of the underworld business. Soon, however, their virulent lifestyles and incessant greed leads them to a downward spiral of confrontation and deceit, accentuated by their common lust for femme fatale Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).This fascinating Franco-American co-production ought to be commended for its caustic inquiry into the rotten economic foundations of the American dream. Moreover, it achieves this without seriously compromising its solid cinematic components (storytelling, cinematography and overall cohesion), while also giving prominence to Stone's extremely well-acted, visible female character, amid all the Mafiosi male chauvinism. On the downside, the screenplay is often vaporous, and some of the inevitable violence is truly stomach churning. Yet these deficiencies should not discourage hardened fans from taking a look. Worth experiencing, 6.5 stars out of 10.",

He seems to be the kind of person who don't tolerate disrespect. He takes out anyone, at anytime, anywhere. He's the problem solver so to say. Both DeNiro and Pesci are back as a team again since \"Goodfellas\", only this time it's mob free. However, Pesci's character is a lot shadier. So when he gets cut off, he goes berserk and tries to off him. He had to learn the hard way, on who his \"friends\" were when he and his brother were taken out in the cornfield and was whacked.

Back in 1995, I wrote movie reviews for my college paper. One of the movies I had to see was CASINO. My first thought was, \"oh damn, I have to sit through a 3-hour Scorcese movie.\" It is strange because I didn't like GOODFELLAS, but I love DeNiro and Pesci. In CASINO, DeNiro and Pesci made the movie as great as it was.Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstein, who is an expert gambler. He is asked by the Midwest Mob to take control of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. He immediately cleans up the casino of crooks (in one scene, a man who is caught cheating has his hand beat with a hammer) and brings in a lot of money for the bosses. During this time, Ace meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), who is one of the most notorious hustlers in Vegas. He falls in love with her and they marry, even though she is still faithful to her ex-pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods.) Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is called in by the Mob to protect Ace and make sure no one messes with the casino. All is well for a while until Nicky begins causing trouble and that's when all hell breaks loose.This movie is almost three hours long, but the time flies right by. The supporting cast is top notch. If you are a fan of mob films, you can't miss CASINO.Rating: 9 out of 10",

But because of his underworld connection, he gets into more trouble than he deserves, including an attempt to assassinate him. This is one story that what actually happened is more exciting than any fictitious story. I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen when I first saw it. It's certainly one of the best movie director Martin Scorsese ever produced. Joe Pesci was spot on as Sam's friend Nicky. He really looked like the character in real life he was portraying. The gory ending would be climactic for a movie, but to think that it actually happened in real life is inconceivable.If Martin Scorsese had to choose a character to make a movie out of, he couldn't have chosen a better one than these two.

            "content": "Robert DeNiro has yet another great role in this 1995 Universal release. He portrays Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a professional gambler who becomes the boss of a mob operated casino in Las Vegas during the 1970's. He gets married to a smart mouthed and money driven casino hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and makes a longtime friend named Nicky (Joe Pesci) his business partner in casino operations and dealings. Nicky is very defensive of Sam and would do anything to help him make money and stay in business. He especially doesn't mind beating bloody pulps out of people who refuse to cooperate with their demands. Sam is a little more restrained and only really cares about making money so he disapproves of Nicky's highly volatile behavior on several occasions. Meanwhile, Ginger just can't seem to leave her days of greed behind and forms an alliance with Nicky and other high rollers in a quest to help her get a huge share of the casino business profits. It's a lengthy film with an abundance of graphic mob violence, drug use, sexual content and some rather colorful profanity but it still ranks as a very high point in recent cinema and a very fitting follow up to \"Goodfellas.\" Director Martin Scorsese follows up on the \"Cape Fear\" and \"The Age Of Innocence\" fiascos with a film that finds him very much back in his signature element, the epic crime drama. Nicholas Pileggi, the man who wrote the novel \"Wiseguys\" that eventually became the film \"Goodfellas\" once again adapts his novelization stories into film form and just like \"Goodfellas\", this film is a dramatized and fictionalized account that's modeled after a true story.",

            "content": "The opening narration of this epic tale pretty much sums it up. Ace Rothstein (based on real life casino owner Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal) was a very gifted individual and the way the inner workings of a casino is described is fascinating to watch. However, the more the story unfolds we are banged over the head with numerous names, situations and too much narration that really isn't necessary to follow the story.There are other problems, especially regarding the Nicky Santoro character, played by Joe Pesci. There are conflicting information about him all through the movie. Was he a major figure in organized crime or was he simply a two-bit hood. It is never quite made clear but he must have had some connection since he gets in any casino before he is banned. The friendship between him and Ace is never really fully explored either. A background sequence could have saved the viewer a lot of confusion. As they are portrayed in this movie they don't even seem to be of the same species. The way Rothstein tries to cover up where he comes from is essential to the plot but that he behaves a lot more like a socialite than a gambler is too polished to be believable.The Sharon Stone character Ginger is the most fully developed person in the movie. Her character is pretty much revealed in the first two minutes she's on screen and the way she transforms during the movie is also believable. Even though her pimp, Lester (played by James Woods) doesn't have a lot of screen time, we can guess what purpose he had in her life. Therefore, it must have been hard to cast the Ginger role as her's requires a great deal of acting skill.Like so many actors Scorsese has worked with before, De Niro, Pesci and Frank Vincent does pretty much what we expect. They are all terrific but the real surprise is Alan King, who is a comedian. Even though his character is also a little sketchy, he brings the right kind of authority to his role. He is also the one character who gives the most information as to how things operate in Vegas.The bosses of Las Vegas are mostly decorative. They are never fully explored and are therefore mostly played as fat men in suits. The only boss who seems to have any say in what goes on is the character, Remo Gaggi, and even he seems to be clueless most of the time.There are a lot more to mention but the bottom line is that even though it is very clear that Scorsese has put a lot of effort into the accuracy of the action, it is a bit confusing and I think he should have left out a great deal of the narration that doesn't really explain a lot anyway. So an 'A' for the effort but only a 'B+' for the artistry which is what I think he is trying to aspire to.",

The Nevada Gaming Commission member, a US Senator, is partly based on Nevada Senator Harry Reid, who was chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. The scene in which the Nevada Gaming Commission denies Sam Rothstein is a gaming license by is based on a December 1978 hearing when US Senator Harry Reid was the commission's chairman. This project was filmed entirely in Las Vegas (Stardust and Landmark Hotels and Casinos) and with historic period costumes, music, and props. This film is horribly editing for public TV viewing sensibilities and it should be seen in its entirety on recorded media. Several scenes are lost in the TV airing censorship and will be appreciated by film fans.*Emotion- This is an unforgettable film. It is filled with great performers that acting well in their ensemble of well-written scenes.

The director has the reputation of having his unique style and paying attention to every detail of film-making.

Based on true events, the film mainly focuses on bookie Rothstein, his marriage with the gorgeous crackwhore/con-artist Ginger and his friendship with unstable nutjob Nicky.The movie follows a smooth pace with excellent cinematography, effective visuals, slick editing and a fantastic soundtrack where the songs contribute to the storytelling. The film is longer than the usual two hour length general viewers are used to but I was hooked to the screen from start to finish. There was something so captivating about the glamorous, seductive and deadly world that Scorsese creates on screen.Scorsese's regulars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are in top form. Sharon Stone perhaps delivers her career best in one of the most complex roles in a Scorese film. The supporting cast is solid.'Casino' is no doubt one of Martin Scorsese's best and my favourite Scorsese film.

His movies are usually dark and gritty pieces but in Casino I experienced a new side of Scorsese. This movie has a big epic feeling to it unlike other of his movies. And it works so well. The film is very beautiful to watch because of the great cinematography and score. Scorsese seems to have an ability to make movies with very different kind of looks. And in this movie, I think he mixed his directing techniques of Age Of Innocence and Goodfellas. Like Age Of Innocence, it has a clean look, but the characters and dialog reminded me of Goodfellas (maybe also because of the topic of this movie).Like all the Scorsese movies, this one is also a great character driven, sometimes dark and tragic, sometimes wild and brutal piece of cinema art.

The film has similarities yes, he uses the same actors playing similar characters yes, but don't you think Scorsese realizes this, don't you think he casted them for this very reason! He not only uses the same actors, he uses the same songs on occasion, he even repeats shots, but in order to give the shot a different meaning. For me Casino is the third and probably final installment of his mob trilogy. With each film he climbs higher up the ranks! Mean Streets starts with local hoods, Goodfellas to the more organized gangsters and Casino to the very top of the chain. I think Casino is probably the finest out of the three, it is certainly the best to look at. The cinematography and use of sound in particular are almost unparalleled. He even uses music from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Mepris, which contrasts the two relationships that are falling apart. Do you really think Casino is just an overlong sequel, do you really think Scorsese would stoop that low. The editing alone is probably the best of his career. Critics are always afraid to pride new films over the classics (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull). Now they are great films don't get me wrong, but i believe Casino deserves to be up there with them, more so than Goodfellas. Some critics have gone on to the say the film fizzles out after the first act? What film were they watching, do they know nothing about narrative pacing. If the film were to continue the pace of the first act i think the majority of the audience would have heart attacks, if they don't anyway. Now get this, it's from the Rolling Stone review. OK, 'What trips up Casino is its straining toward art'. So what exactly do they think Scorsese should be straining for, it doesn't sound like they need a great deal of straining for their reviews. It's little comments like this that really get under my skin. OO Casino's too long, if you think you can put across that much information in a shorter time then you're welcome. OK, that's enough for one night, Casino is an epic gangster masterpiece. A landmark of the 90s. It's not Goodfellas no, in my opinion it's better. However, it does require the viewer to have seen Goodfellas to completely understand what Scorsese is trying to say. I hope time will give this film the recognition it deserves.",

            "content": "After films such as Cape Fear and The Age of Innocence, Martin Scorsese returns to his roots where this would be the final film of Scorsese's mob trilogy (his first two were Mean Streets and GoodFellas) before his prequel (Gangs of New York) in which we get to see Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent in their last collaboration with Martin Scorsese before adding DiCaprio to the mix. Life in Las Vegas will never be the same.The film's prologue has Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro) going to his car where he narrates about sacrifices about love, than his car blows up leaving him flying in the air. After the credits have rolled with his body flying, we get to see Rothstein before his death smoking a cigarette where he narrates about how he ran things very successfully and that he was a bookie who changed the odds for everybody; also we are introduced to characters from Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) who is Ace's best friend watching his back and says they screwed up the whole plan to take over the casinos; Ace's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is shown as innocent until we get to know her later as a street hustler who robs men for their money and hangs out with her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods).The film is very different from GoodFellas and Mean Streets were both films talked about the territory of the mafia life such as nobody dating anybody different than their races; murders becoming an exception; damaging things when somebody doesn't pay; etc. Casino is more of a document on how organized crime controls what goes on in Las Vegas. It shows people in the account room counting money; all of the managers, dealers and bosses watching one another to see if they are doing their job, rob the rich people, take care of the high officials in the city and make sure that nobody tries to cheat in the casinos.The character of Rothstein is a genius in terms of trying to take people's money and helping others get money. After his character is in charge of The Tangiers, Nicky narrates on how Sam got information on what went on with sports; he find out if the quarterback got his wife knocked up, if they did cocaine, crooked referees, even the wind velocity for the field goals. Nicky says, \"The boys back home didn't care if he enjoyed himself because Sam was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money.\" The character of Nicky Santoro is like Pesci's Tommy DeVito from \"GoodFellas\" where they are volatile when not doing things their way. We see that in Nicky's character when a patron is verbally abusing Sam when all Sam asked was if the pen next to him was his, Nicky stabs the guy in the neck until the patron starts wheezing. Sam explains, \"No matter how big somebody is, Nicky would take'em on.\" His appearance in Las Vegas worries Sam because he was going to be taking care of Sam along with his partner, Frank Marino (Frank Vincent) for which they scare most of the people away from Las Vegas and play their own game.Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) has been a call girl all her life for which she steals chips from her Iranian boyfriend while having a camera zooming in on her and is being watched by Rothstein. He goes to the craps table where he sees Ginger wanting more money from the boyfriend and than tosses the chips to the floor where Rothstein has fallen in love with the call girl. \"In Vegas,\" he says \"for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.\" Indeed it does, as Ginger robs Rothstein like Peggy would rob Al on \"Married\u0085With Children\" where she would take his money, when telling him that she is going to play some slots; Ginger also gets most of the employees on their knees as she drugs Andy Stone (comedian Alan King), one of the people working with the mafia; and gets most of the casino workers to give her things as long as she covers them; from clothes and cars, she had everything except her old boyfriend Lester Diamond who was a hustler stealing people for cash.In a movie full of serious actors, there are three comedians playing supporting characters in this crime drama; Alan King is Andy Stone has I had mentioned, he works for the mafia in which he has conversations with them about how they should control Vegas; Don Rickles plays Billy Sherbert, the Casino manager who doesn't do much except waddle around and gets hit by Nicky; Phillip Green is played by Kevin Pollock in which his character is more of the reticent for which he can't do anything or say anything just because the teamsters gave him 62,700,00 dollars, it didn't mean anything as long as he pretended to be somebody big.As much as performances go, the spotlight belongs to Sharon Stone in a great performance. Sharon has often portrayed the lured of affection for which we see her take her clothes off or try to appeal in a sexual situation. In Casino, she plays the character very mature and most likely will be her only serious performance; she'll be herself once we stop watching this film. Another spotlight belongs to Joe Pesci who won his Oscar for GoodFellas, yet he steals the show as a main character instead of a supporting character for which he gets to tell the point of view.Casino proves to be another hit in the Martin Scorsese collection with an awesome soundtrack as its own theme, performances that shine, and bad guys that people like to root for.",

            "content": "Repetition occurs in cinema at every level. If something is successful, highbrow or lowbrow, there is a good chance that those responsible will simply rerun the formula to get the same result. In 1990 iconic gangster movie and filmmaker's favourite Goodfellas was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by Nicholas Pileggi, and starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In 1995 gangster movie Casino was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by\u0085 You get the idea.Admittedly Scorsese and Pileggi did work well together, the director illustrating the writer's every word with a well-placed pan or close-up. It's a bit dizzying and the constant musical switching gets a bit tiresome, but you still have to admire the craftsmanship that goes into a picture like this, especially in Scorsese's meticulously planned tracking shots. There's one near the beginning where we follow the skimmer into the casino, and the camera eagerly overtakes him as he heads towards the counting room, really engaging us in what's going on. Or there's the tracking shot at the wedding, where Sharon Stone's flick of her head seems to propel the camera on to the next table. It's a very artificial, obtrusive way of making a movie, but it is nevertheless carefully designed to involve us in the story's world.This was the eighth, and to date, the final time Robert De Niro has starred in a Scorsese movie, and this is predictably familiar ground for him. Sam Rothstein is really just a slightly more relaxed version of the De Niro character in Goodfellas. De Niro can at least do menacing without using his fists, and of note is his articulation of the word \"dead\" when he threatens his wife. Joe Pesci's role here is nigh-on identical to the one that earned him an Oscar in Goodfellas. He's good at it though. Look at how he stabs up the man with the pen; he really gives the impression of a little guy who's had to get the kicks in quick to survive. But reliable as these two are there is very much a sense with De Niro and Pesci that they are going through the old familiar motions. The real standout in the movie is Sharon Stone. For this part she has to be angry, tearful and drugged-up, as do a lot of actresses, but to do so for such a large chunk of the movie and remain believable throughout, never slipping into over-the-top hysterics, is admirable.Being a repetition of Goodfellas doesn't necessarily make Casino a weaker movie. It has almost all the same merits and flaws as its predecessor. It is perhaps a little more lacking in true drama and comes closer to a documentary, at times being little more than a list of anecdotes, which makes the nearly three hour runtime a little wearing. One area which, for me, made Casino stand-out was its costume design. Garish as they are, there's a mad kind of co-ordination in Rothstein's suits. There are plenty of other tawdry yet outstanding outfits throughout the movie, such as an Ace of Hearts dress worn by a bit player. Sharon Stone's leather suit in her climactic scenes is memorably striking, and as such helps to highlight the fact that she's been in the same clothes for several days. For me, it's the clothes more than anything else which evoke the misguided glamour of Casino and its denizens. Unfortunately, this isn't what people tend to consider in the gangster movie, so it seems to have gone largely unnoticed",

            "content": "When released in 1995, Casino was dismissed by many as Scorsese attempting to remake his own GoodFellas. But the movie, although quite similar to GoodFellas in many respects, stands on it's own. A most fast-paced 3 hour movie containing no unnecessary tedious scenes to slow it down, never failing at any opportunity to fascinate and entertain the viewer. Enter Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a brilliant sports handicapper who takes his talents to Vegas. Ace's uncommon expertise and success with making the world of gambling pay off naturally attracts the wrong type of people in the likes of old hometown buddy now heavily connected with the Mob Nicky (Joe Pesci), and the romantic object of his affection Ginger (Sharon Stone). Sam unfortunately takes a gamble on these two and the results don't pay off as well as he would have liked. Neither Ace or Nicky are a match for Ginger, who gets in between them and ultimately plays them both for a couple of tricks.One of the film's remarkable achievements is how expertly the story is told, and Scorsese's ability to cram so many rich details into such a short amount of screen time frequently throughout. An example of this is where DeNiro's character catches on to a couple of card players using a sophisticated cheating technique so they can communicate with one another morse code style to inform each other of their opponents' playing cards which they can see from opposing tables. The way Scorsese can illustrate such rich details during a brief montage showing how the players are able to incorporate this scam to the beat of the Jeff Beck Group's \"I Ain't Superstitious\" is like watching a master teaching a free class to show how it's done for other director-wannabes.Casino also of course features fine performances from the cast - many of whom also actually happened to appear in GoodFellas. Watch for a clever nod to Frank Vincent's \"Billy Batts\" role in GoodFellas towards the film's conclusion.A masterpiece in direction, film editing, and storytelling, Casino contains scenes which may be considered by some as excessively violent, and must also hold some sort of record for the amount of \"F\" words ever said in a film. Literally every line of dialog contains the word or variations on it. The easily offended may want to steer clear.Certainly one of the great films in the Scorsese canon which makes for a fine companion piece for his groundbreaking classic GoodFellas. I hope Scorsese makes one final mobster film with DeNiro and Pesci. Casino proves that, as far these three are concerned, you can't get much better of a combination as far as movies go. Should my wish come true, hopefully Mr. Scorsese can find another classic rock song to put on the soundtrack to fit the mood of the story besides \"Gimme Shelter\" - also featured prominently in GoodFellas and The Departed.",

The narrative, the camera work, first 45 mins of this are great, and if that could have been sustained for the entire film, this could have won the Oscar.  Instead it desolves into a Vegas based Godfather knock off.Now, I don't mind some film violence; and expected it big time with these guys. But WHY the baseball bats in the cornfield? Why the Pesci Vice bit? Did we have to see the old gal get shot 3 times in the head up close like that? I think one of those scenes was enough; but having all three...overkill. There's some terrific supporting jobs here: Don Rickles, Alan King, Sharon Stone turns in one too. James Woods was fine. But when you get to the end, all you can remember is 'Batter up!'

            "content": "By 1995, Martin Scorsese had well and truly etched his name into the film making book and Casino is really just a cherry on the icing which was already on the cake; this means it's not a bad thing but just feels unnecessary. Whilst this film took me two sittings to get through (I had to cut it off with about 40 minutes remaining the first time I sat down to watch it), I can still see why it's gained a somewhat cult status amongst the masses.What's good about 'Casino' is its energy and vibrancy. The film is very colourful and attractive and it sucks the viewer into its world with several brilliant voice-overs that are informative and dark yet often funny. This is twinned with some brilliant use of colour giving us stone wall proof that cars don't just have to be metallic dark green or blue; jackets don't have to be grey Armani's or pinstripe suits \u0096 (they can be pale red!?) and that walls and buildings can be splashed with every colour of the rainbow and still look moderately average. Everybody has a favourite colour and so, when the viewer is drawn into the world giving the feeling you're actually there, sitting in the bars opposite the characters, walking and talking with the croupiers and gambling with the rest of them; it feels like there is something there for you \u0096 everyone, in fact and the colours act as a focal point as you map onto various items, objects, props and costume that bear your familiar favourite shade, making things easy on the gaze. This is how Casino's early attempt at drawing you in works.Although the film stays in the exact same gear for at least thirty minutes and the voice-overs (which you think will depart once the scene is set) remain, you can ignore it in a certain sense. There is that nagging sensation, however, that the whole opening is just a watered down back-story \u0096 explaining what happened in the first film, making 'Casino' actually feel like a sequel rather than a new, fresh film in itself.What's also odd is the fact that a lot of scenes just feel unnecessary. Pesci's character's dialogue scenes and twitchiness can only feel genuine and spookily evil for so many times and the results from his mounting relationship with a female character can be seen coming from quite a mile away. Although they feel out of place, the scenes are still entertaining enough \u0096 especially for the viewer who wants to see Pesci pile on his evil, bad-guy, 'wise-guy' caricature that he's been made famous for over the years. It's these things that bulk up the running time, frustratingly.What really grabbed the film by the scruff was the whole plot point that catapulted it into its final third. Without giving anything away, I'll mention one word: 'corruption' that involves (in some crazy way) absolutely everyone. And, as the final third reaches its, and the films, climax; there seem to be several twists and flips of the coin that involve characters floating here and then to there and then back again and then to where they were two stages ago\u0085..and so on. This was very annoying and was a disappointing, messy way to finish the film. It concludes, then re-opens and then concludes again before partly opening it back up before finally allowing the equilibrium to catch up with itself.Although brave, bold and energetic; 'Casino' ultimately felt like an excuse to pool together a couple of big name Hollywood actors, actresses and a director just to make another gangster film that everybody will probably love. If you want a film like this one but better, try Wayne Kramer's 2003 film 'The Cooler'. At least that's not as ridiculously long.",

The characters are cardboard, overly romanticized, embarrassingly conforming to what someone thinks the stereotype is, and the dialogue is pitiful.

            "content": "There are different levels to appreciate this work of Scorsese. Pileggi and Scorsese could be presenting an accurate social and political study on the manner in which casinos are run in USA. But it is also a study of how money buys power and success, and corrodes one's humility. It is written in the manner Greek tragedies were written showing the climb to power and the inevitable downfall of the powerful following the state of hubris (here the firing of an incompetent employee with the right connection}. Compare Ace (de Niro's character), thoughtful about mundane details such as alerting a stranger about a good pen that he could well lose at the bar and who winces at Nick's subsequent violent actions, to the later Ace, who is insensitive to violent actions he himself orchestrates. Compare Nick (Pesci), who seeks permission from Ace to live in Las Vegas, to the later Nick, who drunk with power refuses to acknowledge he once asked Ace's permission. In many ways 'Casino' is a director/screenplay writers film than an actors' film. Performances, though commendable, take a back seat. Is it a mere gangster film or is the film using the gangster and hustler backdrop to offer the audience another perspective of America beyond the obvious? The social commentary here is somewhat like Altman's films \"Nashville\" or \"A Wedding\".The religious Christian motifs of redemption underlie much of Scorcese's work, unconsciously or consciously, and Casino offers a viewer several perspectives, if you choose to assess his films in that perspective. (Scorsese is an admirer of Terrence Mallick, whose film \"The thin red line\", which incidentally also was pregnant with religious motifs--e.g., tattoos of Biblical references).One can also appreciate Casino as an example of good movie craftmanship. Take the sequence of Sharon Stone's introduction in the film, where she is obviously aware that Ace is staring at her. It is so well done that one notices Sharon Stone visage and actions, while the editing and direction are really top notch as well, which contribute to make the sequence superb. Sharon Stone gives a riveting performance, as do De Niro and Pesci. Kudos to Scorsese on the appropriate 70s music at various stages in the film's progress. While I appreciate Scorcese's choice of Ace's voice over commentary, I was surprised at Nick's commentary intertwining the voice-over of Ace. This method does makes sense if both are alive at the end of the film; not otherwise.",

            "content": "Everything about Casino is better and far superior to the highly overrated and bland movie that is Goodfellas from the story, the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the action and the characters. It's flashy, colorful, dark, gripping and everything a crime mob movie needsNot once through the 3 hour length was I bored out of my mind with Casino unlike Goodfellas. The true story of Sam \" Ace\" a wiseguy running a successful casino in Las Vegas who marries a troubled, broken and damaged woman named Ginger, the quick distrust and deterioration of their relationship even after they have a child, Ace's mobster friend Nicky who as aspirations to be his own mob boss causing constant trouble in Los Vegas and for Ace. It had everything you need from suspense to unpredictabilityThere were times I was expecting Ace and Nicky to not only fall out but also attempting to kill each other by the end or Ace not only giving up on his wife Ginger but ends up murdering her. None of these happens, the start of the movie is really smart as it sets you in not only towards the end of the movie but paints you a picture of what you might will happen by the time you reach to the end of the movie againAnother thing about this movie is it made me think and question the relationship between Ace and Ginger, throughout the movie it paints a one sided point of view from Ace's perspective and throughout most of the film I sided with him but as you see how angry Ginger is and hateful hating and wishing Ace dead, it made me question my perspective and their relationship. There had to be plenty of good reasons as to why the relationship ended the way it did and why it appears Ginger is painted as the truly bad oneThe action and violence is pretty brutal but it mainly keeps it on the lowdown only appearing when it's needed and it's always present in the mob world. Frank Vincent who you might know as Phil Leotardo from The Sopranos is not only in this movie as he was in Goodfellas but plays a very prominent role throughout the entire movie. Great actor and the acting from De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone is spot on. Everyone is on gameI also liked the setting of the movie in Las Vegas, it's very unique and different compared to the typical mob crime movies that usually take place in New York or Chicago. Truly great stuff.",

            "content": "\"Casino\" is not even on the top 250. It's a pity, what with so many lame movies getting much higher ratings.Wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this epic tale (based on real life incidents) unfolds with the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a mob-backed guy who is brought in to Las Vegas to operate the Tangiers Casino, owing to his expertise in the same. His boyhood pal, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) also moves to Vegas with criminal plans of his own. Sam does his job really well, exposing cheats, disposing of the weaker employees, making sure he isn't robbed of money, and ends up making big bucks for his mob bosses \"back home\". However, things change when Sam falls for Ginger (Sharon Stone), a hustler. She already has a no-good boyfriend Lester (James Woods, in a small albeit important role). Inspite of his knowledge about her manipulative nature, he marries her. She is an alcoholic, and all she ever wants is money and security. Meanwhile, Nicky continues his criminal activities.\"Casino\" is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese. The film runs for almost three hours and events take their time to unravel, and rightly so. The performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact! In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'. He appears super-cool as the Casino operator and you cannot help but sympathize with him in some later parts of the movie when he is having a bad time because of various reasons. Trust him to play an all-in-one character: a mob-connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time! His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of mind-blowing!Joe Pesci..what can one say about this guy! Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F-words with a one-of-a-kind punch is something only he can do! He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy-hood friend, Sam. Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role.Sharon Stone: Superb!! I never thought I would feel that about her performance, but indeed, she gets a hell of a chance to act here..and she does it exceedingly well! The drunk hustler who cannot find happiness is played to perfection by Sharon...I guess it is also kudos to the director for bringing out the actor in her.Then there are some wonderful, but small supporting performances by James Woods as Lester Diamond, Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Alan King as Andy Stone and Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) as Phillip Green. Special mention here, of Pasquale Cajano, who is superb as the mob boss, Remo Gaggi.The soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas. And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime!The dialog is brilliant. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing. The wonderful screenplay for the film is co-written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book. As mentioned before, the film runs for about 3 hours but there is not a single moment when you'd want to take your eyes off the screen.An under-rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics.",

            "review_title": "Very similar to \"GoodFellas\" but is that such a bad thing?",
            "content": "Martin Scorsese's \"Casino\" found him treading very similar ground to his film of five years earlier, \"GoodFellas\". From script to actors to storyline to narrative devices, the two films share several common elements. While that makes for a somewhat unoriginal movie, there are certainly worse templates to go by than \"GoodFellas\".The story is once again based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi. This time, we're treated to a fictionalized account of the rise and fall of Las Vegas casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (modelled after Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal). Some liberties are taken with the facts but the movie is generally true to life. Like in \"GoodFellas\", voice-over narration is employed throughout the film.Returning from the cast of \"GoodFellas\" were Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci. De Niro was more in the spotlight this time and delivered a characteristically excellent performance. Pesci's performance is also good but could certainly be seen as a rehashing of his previous, Oscar-winning role. Sharon Stone rounded out the stars and she delivered the best performance of her career; one that resulted in a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination. Besides these there are several other notables in supporting roles including Frank Vincent (another \"GoodFellas\" cast member), James Woods & Don Rickles, to mention just a few.Visually, the film is exceptional. Robert Richardson's cinematography was worthy of an Oscar nomination and Scorsese's direction is great as always. Like \"GoodFellas\", Scorsese also made excellent use of music (mostly popular) throughout the entire film. The sets & costumes also show remarkable style and attention to detail.In the end, \"Casino\" won't win any awards for originality but it's hard to fault the film when many of its strengths are shared with \"GoodFellas\". The movie might be a bit too long for it's own good but, other than that, I think it compares quite favourably with the vast majority of crime dramas.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's Casino is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest Gangster films ever made that's filled with brilliant direction,excellent acting and a great Rock N' Roll soundtrack making this film another Scorsese classic,one of his best films and one of my all time favorite films.Set in Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s and based on a true story,Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein(Robert De Niro),an expert gambler connected to Gangsters and because of his success he is asked by the Mob to run the Tangiers,one of the biggest Casinos in Las Vegas and help steal money for the Mob. While in Vegas he marries hooker and hustler Ginger(Sharon Stone)and receives help from friend and gangster Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci). But as time goes on Ace,Ginger and Nicky discovers that their successes will lead to violence,death and betrayal and know that no one stay's on top forever.Released in 1995,Casino surprising received a mixed reception among critics and one of the criticisms of Casino is that the film was too similar to Scorsese's earlier Gangster film Goodfellas. But,thanks to showings on Cable TV,Home Video and DVD sales Casino has now been regarded as as a classic and one of Scorsese's best films and it's rightfully deserved. If Goodfellas was about the rise and fall of a New York Gangster then Casino is about the rise and fall of a empire. With Casino,Scorsese gives viewers a big and violent epic gangster film and shows viewers a different side of Las Vegas that most people probably already knew about but not many have seen where the city of LV is being secretly controlled by the Mob and where money and violence rule the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. Casino is in many ways a tragic film where the characters in the film have success and money but there are many things that happen in the film mess up their own empire and value because when you listen to most of the narration in the film you feel like the characters are looking back at their past with regret and wishing they would have done something different. The rise and fall in this film is almost like a Shakespere play. One of the things that I always loved about Casino is the cinematography because Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson gives the film a beautiful and stylish look where the colors of the suits and production design just come off the screen and hit you in the eye. Scorsese cleverly tricks viewers with the beauty of the film and almost makes viewers forget about the violence and death that is in the air. The photography is one of the things that is different from Goodfellas because where Goodfellas seem more gritty and dirty,Casino is almost like Goodfellas glamorous and flamboyant little brother in comparison. The three main characters Ace,Ginger and Nicky,like in most of Scorsese films aren't always the most likable but have levels of depth and dimension that each characters shows throughout the film when things are happening around them whether it's buy their own doing with Aces' pride and ego,Ginger's troubled past and present,Nicky's violence or by someone else. You don't always like the main characters,but you don't hate them either. Although Casino is nearly three hours long the film moves at a quick pace and there isn't a wasted scene in the film. It's one of fastest near three hours you will ever watch. The violence in the film is bloody and deadly and Scorsese does not compromise or tone it down one bit showing what it's like when you're in the crime world. The violence in the film is so disgusting that you will never want to gamble or go to Las Vegas. Casino did for gambling and going to Las Vegas what Jaws did for swimming in the water. The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci or Sharon Stone,I highly suggest you see Casino an unforgettable and powerful Gangster and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

The mixed reaction this film has been given has absolutely stunned me, reviews range from the worst film people have ever seen to the most impressive they have ever seen. This is of course the most underrated film of all time and not enough credit has been given to Scorsese, De Niro, pesci, stone and even the supporting cast including frank Vincent. The reason for much of this films criticism is its comparisons to goodfellas. This is not goodfellas or a goodfellas inspired film! (despite Nicholas peliggi's involvement). De niro and pesci surpass their performance in goodfellas with much to spare in this film. Pesci in particular has added more venom to his performance than seen in goodfellas (which was already as venomous as a venomous snake swimming around in venom).Enough of this goodfellas talk, casinos finest quality is the development of the characters throughout the movie. The decade in which this movie covers allows Scorsese to work his magic and has time to brilliantly lay out this fascinating tale of the mob's control of a las Vegas casino...and the las Vegas streets. De niro is at his usual best which means long time movie partner Scorsese can direct with ease because nobody is better than De niro at his best. His performance is cool, calm and collected and his character is easily likable and understandable throughout. De niro's casual performance means it is down do pesci to take care of the more brutal parts of the movie, and he does this very well. Scorseses directing skills combined with De niro's fine acting and laced with pesci's raw power, not to mention a sprinkle of glitter on top in the form of Sharon stone, means there is no level on which this film does not deliver. the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be.",

It's also inhibited by a narrower scope, taking in only the 70s and the early 80s and by the end, the script dithers as much as Sharon Stone's druggy showgirl.

Ace makes the correct statement that now Vegas is the another DisneyWorld where you can take the whole family to be entertained. I remember when it was a little more adult entertainment - a great floor show, 99 cent T-bone dinners, and reasonably priced rooms - all subsidized by gambling. But what about the movie itself?... While watching the movie, I was reminded of a Saturday Night Live skit called \"Low Class Italian Theater\" presumably based on the film Raging Bull. The skit satirized movies with Italian men using the f-- word and accusing each other of sleeping with each other's wives. While I think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best films with superb acting by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone, I can't help but feel it is a little flawed by the constant verbal assault which is not totally germane to the movie. In fact, I heard more anti-Semitic remarks in this one movie than in my entire life. Furthermore, while Sharon Stone's acting was nothing short of brilliant, I think the pace of the movie could have progressed faster and the movie shortened if they had cut out much of her neurotic screwed-up wife routine. I also feel there was an audio assault with the excessive soundtracks. The acting and story line really spoke for itself and did not need every song that was added for dramatic emphasis. Nevertheless, in spite of these alleged shortcomings, I loved the movie and felt I was actually looking at a newsreel from 1973; it seemed that realistic. As mentioned before, the acting was superb and I can't believe there were not more Oscars won here. The fact that it was based on a true story only adds to its aura of a great film.

Both movies are based on books by Nicolas Pileggi, and screenplays written both by Pileggi and Scorsese. The movie takes an excellent look inside the old Las Vegas when gangsters ran it. Robert De Niro is in top form as Ace, the main character that works his way up in Vegas.

Sharon Stone, James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers round up the excellent support cast. The soundtrack to the movie is one of the best assembled. Robert Richardson, who did a majority of Oliver Stone films, does an excellent job at cinematography in his first Scorsese film. Scorsese regular Thelma Schoonmaker does another excellent job of film editing.This film, along with \"Goodfellas\" and \"Blow\" deliver the time old theme of becoming powerful, and then losing it all. I've always believed these movies are excellent at showing this theme way better than some films, especially Brian De Palma's version of \"Scarface\" (even though Al Pacino is excellent).

            "content": "In looking at Martin Scorsese's look at life in Las Vegas under control of the mob in the 1970s and 1980s, I became intensely curious as to what in particular Scorsese was trying to tell me. Was there any sort of outward message being presented in this sordid tale of greed, deception, backstabbing and violent behavior? And in the end, was this simply a spin off of Goodfellas? Many would disagree, claiming that Casino is an entirely different kind of Scorsese film, concerned more with the city of Vegas and its surroundings than anything else. Indeed, the first two hours fly by as Scorsese whisks us through the casino and its behind-the scenes facts. Long famous for the energy and spontaneity of his films, Scorsese's fluid camera snakes in and out of rooms, eavesdropping on the conversations of some of the highest and most powerful men in Las Vegas, some of which don't even live in Nevada. As in Goodfellas, there is innumerable amounts of information given. In fact, there are so many voice-over narrations going on one right after another, some may get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. All this, combined with fiercely intense performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci make this a great two hour run. Unfortunately, this is a three-hour film.The last hour of the film, for me, bears many marks of Scorsese's labor of love for these settings and subject, yet it feels to drag on and on and on. Never have I seen one hour go by so slowly that was directed by such a great filmmaker. Indeed, the main reason for such slow pacing is the fact that practically the same thing happens in every single scene. For the first two hours, Scorsese sets up nearly ever character for some sort of payoff or consequence. Now, the payoffs must come. They do, one right after the other and it is not only boring to watch but also painful. As with any Scorsese film, the bleakness and desperation of the situation is not shied away from. It is difficult to watch the relationship between De Niro and Stone crumble, in effect mirroring the mob's relationship with Las Vegas fall apart. Nevertheless, by the end, I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and cold with all these characters. Not a single one can truly be empathized with, and in the end all get what they deserve.I know it is unfair to Scorsese to compare this film with Goodfellas, but there are so many parallels that it is hard not to. Where Goodfellas succeeded in having one main point of view narrate everything, here there are too many to consistently keep track of as well as too many scenes of people being beaten senseless and screaming at each other in drug-induced rages. I do not ask Scorsese to be gentler or sugarcoat his stories; I only ask that he create a solidly discernible plot flow throughout the film as he did in Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. Regrettably, despite its many positive elements, Casino is not one of the great Scorsese's best.",

Later he is also introduced to extensive gold-digger Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), whom Sam falls for and eventually marries unaware she's still with her slimy con man boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Ultimately these encounters mean doom for every one of them, among the inevitable collapse of the mob's power.\"Casino\", maybe just for it's length is an epic movie. Showcasing both the familiar tropes of violence and greed, which leads to the downfall of any human being. But the genius is that all these people suffer different forms of fatalities, both seen before and some surprisingly original. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are as great as ever in these kind of movies. It's great to see both tread familiar grounds, read exposition while the story continues and still assume different characters. James Woods was extremely subtle in his role, which works well for him as I did not recognise him in the beginning. Finally Sharon Stone's character is somewhat the emphasis of the entire movie, and she delivers that Oscar nominated performance so tight as the object of lust it's astounding. Funny enough is that I absolutely hate her in these kind of roles because she's so good at them, all in all making her the perfect choice.Final Verdict: Though the film is long, those who can sit through it are in for another great piece from Scorsese's filmography. 8/10.",

            "content": "Casino (1995) Though Casino is not my favorite Martin Scorsese film, it is still one of his best films and of the best films ever made. Casino is intriguing, entertaining, and brutal.Casino is a somewhat long film but very easy to watch. It stays interesting the entire time and never really slows. It's a bit different than your average gangster film, concentrating somewhat more on the characters themselves than their business.To pick a favorite part of the film is kind of hard. Martin Scorsese's directing, and both Robert Deniro and Joe Peschi's roles are all fantastic. Scorsese does great with this film, and even though he has done many similar movies, this one is still fresh and new. Deniro seemingly plays the same role he usually does but it's a much deeper role than most, one of his best performances ever. Peschi on the other hand is definitely at his best, he is so intense he almost steals the film.Casino is a brutal and intense look at organized crime and Las Vegas, sometimes even hard to watch due to the violence in some scenes. It is one of the greatest films ever. Although some people know it best as the film that uses the \"F\" word more than any other, it should definitely be remembered for directing, acting, writing, etc, more than anything else. It is truly a masterpiece.The film will most likely be loved by anyone who watches it, as long as they don't have a short attention span. Any fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci, or Stone must watch this film. A modern classic that isn't going anywhere.10/10",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's \"Casino\" is an often overlooked chapter in his storied filmography, and I personally feel this is for good reason. When people talk about Scorsese, they usually like to talk about \"Raging Bull\", \"Taxi Driver\", or \"Goodfellas.\" And \"Casino\" draws a few too many parallels with \"Goodfellas\", in my opinion. Both films are told with a past-tense, first person narration of the main character(s) lives. Both chronicle the rise and fall of criminals caught up in the Italian mob. Both have excellent leading performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (no Ray Liotta this time around), who basically play the same archetypes that they did in that previous film. Both are adaptations of books, which were actually (loosely) based on real events. \"Casino\" also had the misfortune of being released a mere five years after \"Goodfellas\", which I consider to be one of the greatest mob movies of all time. While this film is by no means a bad one, it certainly does not tell the most interesting or original tale. It's a hard thing, even for a director as seasoned and revered as Scorsese, to strike lightning twice within that short amount of time with what is essentially the same film retold with a twist.\"Casino\" is the story of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro), a Jewish sports and card gambler who works his way into becoming the floor manager of a Las Vegas casino; his best friend Nicky Santoro (Pesci), a hot-headed associate in the mafia who is sent to Vegas to take care of the dirty work; and Ace's wife, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), a former chip hustler who marries Ace for his wealth and valuable jewelry. The movie borrows the flashback style of \"Goodfellas\", as De Niro and Pesci frequently pipe in with comments and explanation about what's going on. Again, that worked all well and good in \"Goodfellas\", but in this one, that kind of storytelling seems to kind of get in the way of characterization and the foundation of a distinct and followable plot line. I know that both movies were based on books, where talking in the first person is literally how you tell the story, but I would much rather have been shown some of the things that we were told by the leading characters through narration. This movie just has way too much of it, and way too often. By the time if feels like we get comfortable with a scene, we are whisked away again and given an exposition dump.I also believe that it worked better in the previous movie as it told a long-term narrative, spanning decades. The plot of \"Casino\" only takes up a timeline of around five years. The first hour or so is dedicated to introducing us with the nitty-gritty operations of Ace's casino, the relationship that Ace has with Nicky and Ginger, and with some of the main players involved in this criminal underworld. After this, we turn to Ace's legal and PR battle with the state gambling commission, who end up denying him a gaming license needed to continue operating and growing his casino. Ace and Nicky then both make a little too much noise for themselves, much to the displeasure of the mob bosses. The movie shifts focus again in the final act, with the three main characters' relationships to each other gradually deteriorating and falling apart.\"Casino\" just seems to lack the oomph that Scorsese packed with some of his other work. I'm making a lot of comparisons with this film to \"Goodfellas\", but I really do see this as just an inferior version of that masterpiece. I felt a lot more engaged with the plot in that one; there seemed to be a clear moral message as the greed, danger, and paranoia of the mob life tore Henry Hill apart and caused him to slowly lose grip on reality. In \"Casino\", Ace is never the one at fault for anything. He's always taking the heat because of someone else's mistakes. I'm not saying that every film of this nature needs to be melded with some kind of a message or chronically flawed characters, but I don't find Ace that compelling or interesting. The movie is based on real life gangster Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal. Apparently this movie is considered much more historically accurate than \"Goodfellas\", which took a lot of liberties with the stories that it was based off of. Adherence to historical fact may work better in a documentary film, but this is a Hollywood crime drama.Comparisons with \"Goodfellas\" aside, this is still a really good movie that I definitely recommend sitting down and watching. I personally wouldn't put this on a list of \"must see movies\" or anything, but it does work very well as a crime epic, and it will definitely help satiate the hunger of a mob movie fan who may be sick of watching \"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas\" on repeat. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci give terrific performances as always, the costumes and sets do a really good job of transporting the viewer to 1970s Las Vegas, and Scorsese's uses of the tracking shot while De Niro and Pesci narrate are very visually pleasing. Scorsese chose to go with radio hits for this film's soundtrack again, which also really lend to the time period (although I personally hate the choice of the Devo cover of The Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"). In all, \"Casino\" is too technically impressive for me to feel justified giving it a score of 8, but this is a low 9 for me. I did enjoy watching it, but it does have its flaws, it's not a masterpiece, and it also just feels like it's way too derivative of Scorsese's earlier work.",

The police tried to stop it, but it was their money which was bringing the city to life. De Niro is great, as usual, Pesci is a show-stealer, and Stone, a novelty in Scorsese's work (as Ray Liotta was in \"Godfellas\"), has a much-earned oscar nomination in the role of an empty woman whose path leads to decay. Scorsese's direction is fantastic (I recommend this as an introduction to his work), flamboyant and lusty as it has always been, and this is to me one of his best works. See it and marvel at it.",

            "content": "It would be easy to forget Martin Scorsese's Casino, or to dismiss it as derivative from his previous works like Goodfellas. But in my honest opinion as a moviegoer, that would be a horrendous mistake. I had more fun with Casino than I have had with every Scorsese movie except Taxi Driver. Casino extends for almost three hours, but unlike Gangs of New York, it doesn't sprawl - every scene is necessary, interesting and well-done, from the first to the last. A great deal of Casino is exposition, but its good exposition - and enough interesting stuff happens during it that it is still a lot of fun to watch. The most distinctive element about Casino is the casting of Sharon Stone. She is simply superb as Ginger, with a remarkable range displayed throughout the film. Her debut scene is cheeky and flirtatious, and I was as hooked on her as DeNiro was. Throughout the film, she convincingly descends into alcoholism and substance abuse, and she more than holds her own in her many screaming fights with DeNiro.Casino reunites a lot of the elements of previous Scorsese films, as well as a lot of the elements, but it manages to bring a lot of fresh material to the table. The voice-over doesn't get distracting, and I loved in the final scene where Pesci's gets cut off just as Nicky's fate is revealed to the audience. Its almost as if the narration is coming from the future, and the future dies the second the hit men lay hands on him. The tracking shots, freeze frames and excessive violence are all here, but he uses them for a reason - because they're effective.The interesting element of the DeNiro/Pesci/Scorsese partnership is that between this film, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, the combination is always shaken up. In Raging Bull, DeNiro is the dominant to Pesci's submissive. In Goodfellas, they were more equal. Here, Pesci completely runs over DeNiro. The two guys are capable of such great things and are convincing no matter what side of the partnership they are on. As I already said, Pesci is brilliantly belligerent, exuding power and arrogance far exceeding his performance in Goodfellas. There are subtle changes in their performances, but ones that bring a whole new dynamic to Casino. One of the most important things I felt was the total dominance he had over his lovers - he would kiss them once and then force them to perform oral sex. He is in charge.DeNiro gives a very under-appreciated performance here as Ace, because its so refreshing to see DeNiro claw for his power and not be 100% in control at all times. I also really bought his love for Ginger - Scorsese wisely refrains from his protagonist's usual womanising ways in developing Ace, and as a result, it brings a lot to his personality. It made their love story so tragic. Casino's screenplay really should have been nominated for an Oscar. It helps a 3 hour film remain thoroughly engaging. It is packed full of killer dialogue, wicked insults and eventful story archs. I loved every moment of the relationship between Ginger and Ace, and I loved the fights between Pesci and DeNiro. I loved the exposition about the FBI tracking Pesci. I loved the running of the casino scenes and the voice-over. My favourite line in the whole movie was the \"holes in the desert\" surrounding Vegas explanation. It was so well done, and I'd never thought of it before.I loved Casino. I could easily watch it again and not get sick of it. DeNiro and Pesci and Scorsese work fresh takes into old moves, and Sharon Stone and the screenplay are simply amazing. Any Scorsese fan, put this on your to see list far far above his more famous The Aviator, Gangs of New York or The Departed.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese have gained a lot of respect and power through his films. Ranging from Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his career have spawned one magnificent movie after another. His films are powerful, violent, well-crafted, well-directed and well-written. You can also say that in a lot of his films, there's a sense of ambition. In the case with Casino, it qualifies as another great piece of film-making from him.The story begins in 1973, where Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, (Robert De Niro), is sent to Las Vegas to run the teamsters-funded casino called The Tangiers. In the Tangiers, the mafia controls every aspect of activity. Sam becomes the boss of the casino, giving him full responsibility to run it. His best friend, Nicky, (Joe Pesci), is also involved with Sam's business of running the casino, giving Sam all the protection he needs. But, when a woman walks into Sam's life while playing on the craps table and also causing a disruption, he spots his eyes her. The girl's name is Ginger (Sharon Stone). Soon enough, Sam and Ginger get married. But, what Sam doesn't know is that Ginger is a prostitute and her unfaithful actions to him comes from her long-time pimp, Lester (James Woods). When Sam finds out about Lester, he takes matter into his own hands. As the film progresses, Sam's dreams are shattered when he starts to lose control of his casino empire and everything becomes too complicated to handle or bear.The photography is very well done and it creates a sense of vibrant to the world of Las Vegas. Furthermore, Scorsese shows us how the casino operation works. There's one scene in the movie where Nicky narrates about what goes on in a specific room called the \"Count Room.\" In the Count Room, casino managers count up all of the money that is collected from the players. It turns that the mob controls the casino and Rothstein is calling the shots. But, as the movie progresses, I felt that the film turn into a \"How to\" movie, where the viewer learns a thing or two about mob operations in Las Vegas.There are other parts in Casino that I really like. Another criticism that I have is the relationship between Sam and his wife, Ginger. In this relationship, we see that Sam really love her, yet what he doesn't know is that Ginger doesn't love him. Sam, as a person wants to do right and set certain things right because he wants them to be this way. However, in the case of his relationship with Ginger, he is trying to help her get over her drug addiction. But, like the casino business, he can't seem to control her, and therefore, the result is very fatal and destructive.Another thing that Sam can't control is his relationship with Nicky. Just like his wife and his casino managing, Nicky is a giant complication to Sam. He's out of control and throughout the entire movie, we see Nicky getting more and more arrogant about setting up his part in Las Vegas. That proves to be too much for Sam because he doesn't want Nicky get out of control. As a result, Nicky is becomes his own enemy toward the mob and that, his fate is ill-fated.What Scorsese does in this movie and also with Goodfellas is that the mafia world is being used as a crutch and that the main character of both films set their standards toward the mob. Yet, even though his promises are convincing, they are really not what they seem to be. In other words, what one would warned to another, another does the impossible. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill is told by Jimmy Conway to never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut. In the end of Goodfellas, that promise is broken, yet there is a sense of resentment and regret. In Casino, the characters are all infatuated by what goes in Las Vegas. It's almost as if Scorsese change the location from New York to Las Vegas. All the performances in Casino are astounding. Robert De Niro is excellent as Sam Rothstein, the man who wants everything done, but can never predict the problems that he has to face. Sharon Stone gives, I think, an Oscar-nominated performance as Ginger. This performance proves that Stone can act under so much pressure and destruction that creates her character to be convincing. Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his performance in Goodfellas, is effective as Nicky. Some people would say that Pesci is playing in the same field as in Goodfellas. But, Pesci is playing a character here. A character would can snap if he is push too far. All three performances really hold the movie together and all three should be given a certain amount of respect to their characters.Scorsese continues to make movies after Casino, with other future works like The Departed and Gangs of New York. But, Casino is his second boldest. I say that because his latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is probably his most boldest yet. With the evidence of Casino, he really scores high with this masterpiece. He captures the life and glamor of Las Vegas life, yet I have to say that this film and Leaving Las Vegas really brings us to the world of Sin City, where the bright and shining lights are covered behind a sense of toughness and crime. Another film that failed to live up to Casino or Leaving Las Vegas is Showgirls, which fails to capture the toughness of being in Las Vegas. Casino is bold, bloody and brilliant and its ambition takes us deep into the heart and crime of Sin City. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.",

His 1995 film, \"Casino,\" is cinematic poetry and heart-wrenching tragedy rolled up into one. It is one of the best films ever made.Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a professional gambler, and one of the best of his time. The setting is 1973. Rothstein is connected with the Mafia, who wish to open a casino in Las Vegas. They realize Rothstein knows the business and they put him in charge. His boyhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) wants to give Vegas a try, and Rothstein has no objections. Eventually, the De Niro character falls in love with Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who may or may not have the same feelings towards him. As time passes, Nicky starts taking over the town of Las Vegas through murder and extortion. He is labeled the local mob boss, and this begins to cause trouble for Rothstein. The public exposes him and the casino of being mob-lead, and this movie is about how something so glamorous, can be turned so ugly, simply by the actions one decides to partake in.I don't think there's any question; Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors who ever lived. He manages to piece together perfection each time he makes a film. They are entertaining and magical, but remain harrowing and relevant. All film students should watch his technique carefully. No one, however, could impersonate his genius.The acting here is beyond great. Robert De Niro is absolutely fantastic as Ace Rothstein. He is one of the best actors who ever breathed, and he gives another example as to why. Sharon Stone does a wonderful job as the emotionally disrupt and confused wife of Rothstein. Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro is superb. He is nothing short of brilliant in Scorsese pictures, and here, his streak continues. Great supporting performances from James Woods, Frank Vincent, and Kevin Pollak.One of the greatest things about this movie is the story. It all started brilliantly, and then it all turned around, simply because these people choose to live their life as they do. They're in it for the money, but what's the point of money when you lose everything because of the life you chose? The story is all the more fascinating knowing it's based on fact.The screenplay by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese is without flaw, and the dialogue is stunning.When you wrap everything together; the directing, the screenplay, the acting, and editing, you are reminded on the film's tag-line: \"No One Stays at the Top Forevor.\" That may be, but this film might be at the top forever.

The plot centers on two childhood pals (DeNiro and Pesci), both \"connected\" and shipped out to Vegas. DeNiro's charismatic character Ace Rothstein runs a casino and hotel, while Pesci's strong-arm thug Nicky Santoro delights in causing old-fashioned mayhem. The difference in their approaches to Sin City will eventually cause them to be at odds with one another. Sharon Stone plays a grifter and prostitute whom DeNiro's character marries, to his eternal dismay, as she cannot shake her old ways. An almost unrecognizable James Woods plays her loser boyfriend. Everyone is at the height of their careers here. The dialogue is sharp, the editing first-rate, the vistas of a now-vanished version of Vegas truly astounding.

            "content": "Casino is an absolute masterpiece. It is easily one of the very best movies ever, but ya it is no Goodfellas, so i guess it stinks. If Casino was titled Goodfellas 2, then I could understand the critiques, but it is a totally different movie, err. None of them make any sense. Every reason I have read that supposedly makes this movie bad is something that doesn't even factor in to whether a movie is good or not. Too much violence - first off, Casino is not excessively violent. The things that happen are but it's obviously not so severe that it's too repulsive to bare or anything close (same goes for Goodfellas). That's nonsense, just like all the other excuses. I am still waiting for one reason to why Casino is not a 4-star, all-time classic movie. I can understand how some can watch it and perceive that it's boring, but you have to listen...there's so much going on. So much depth to the characters. And Scorsese is a genius with editing and directing a film. Casino is an unstoppable movie. It's easily cemented into my top 10. It is one of the most underrated movies with a 3 out of 4 star rating; that is an insult to this masterful film. What are you guys seeing? Nothing is wrong with it. Every scene is powerful. Way to go Scorcese. You give us another cinema classic, and get no love. This movie should be top 20 in the Top250 list, a perfect 10 outta 10.Brilliant depth in the acting and writing, great pace, great soundtrack, great storytelling, a superb attention to detail, natural dialogue, and top-notch directing.",

            "content": "Casino is currently the last film in the legendary De Niro-Scorsese pair-up, and has aged incredibly well, after being underrated and dismissed as a clone of Goodfellas upon release. Indeed, the film sometimes might seem a remake. De Niro is the coolheaded professional, Pesci is the crazed psychopath, as the audience are again taken on a trip into the criminal underworld that predictably falls from paradise to hell.Yet, it would be more accurate to call Casino a comparison piece to Goodfellas, as they match well while going off in satisfying tangents. The first hour of both is essentially the same setup. A glamorous exposition of their current gangster high-life, setting up the game and the players. Its quintessential Scorsese, with tracking shots, voice over exposition and a brilliant, catchy soundtrack. But here they diverge, as Goodfellas, the much shorter film, continues to deal with the work and its consequences, while Casino really delves into its characters as they lose themselves. Casino is certainly a character driven narrative (one could argue Goodfellas is instead a plot driven narrative made perfect by its characters). Our leading trio, the aforementioned males and Sharon Stone in a masterful portrayal of an enigmatic, destructive hustler, all inflate their egos with a deluded conviction of the correctness of their respective visions. In part because of being the lead, and in part as the least destructive character, De Niro's 'Ace' comes off best to the audience, but all are afflicted by delusions of grandeur and greed.The film juggles the character's conflicts and growths well within the three hour film, which is itself a gorgeous depiction of the 'classical' period of Vegas' history, lamented as a relic today. The design, the visuals, the mood feels a different time, and is arguably Scorsese's most well-realised world. The soundtrack adds further to that. And Scorsese's direction is on top form, as is expected, and one finds it difficult to forget Scorsese's masterful hand guiding the film.In terms of the performances of the leads, while De Niro is undeniably excellent, he is really the base from which the other two launch. Joe Pesci is at his very best here, surpassing Raging Bull and Goodfellas, and while the role is essentially a retread of the latter, it's expanded, deeper, and thematically goes with the film; the character is still a wild-card, but not nearly as much as a black sheep. His ego, his desire, they fuel him. Sharon Stone rounds it off, deserving of her Academy Award nom, providing a physical manifestation of Vegas: the money, the excess, the greed, the lure of self-destruction. Her relationship with De Niro is the core of the film.The film is certainly excellent. And one tries not to compare it too much to other Scorsese films, especially Goodfellas. Yet its unavoidable when considering their similarity in theme, style and even cast & crew. Casino basks in its own excesses more than necessary- the length particularly. And it does many things right, but nothing much new. It's Scorsese at his most derivative of self, with the possible exception of being one of the few of his notable films to portray a strong leading woman (who is an independent character of herself) alongside the many men. The film is almost lazy in its unoriginality. And unfortunately it never matches the memorability of, say, Goodfellas.Nonetheless, Scorsese is on top form, with a fantastic setting and cast, and worth a watch.",

Most people love Goodfellas, and when they then move on to see Casino, get a bit disappointed that it didn't give them the same vibe or feeling as Goodfellas.I should know, because that's how I felt the first time I saw Casino. I was fresh into a discovering Scorsese films and watched Goodfellas first, a day later, Casino. And after listening to all the hype about Goodfellas and being in that type of mood, I thought Casino fell short.A few years later I watched Casino and loved it, absolutely loved it. It's a slower moving, riveting, slightly disturbing dive into the world of excess. Complete excess. As the characters dive deeper and deeper into their stories, we realize that the film is indeed NOT like Goodfellas in the sense that the characters are not clawing their way to the top with the audience sort of cheering them on and enjoying the cowboy show. No, in Casino the characters ARE at the top, and we have the uncomfortable experience of seeing how they deal with it. There are no REAL obstacles against these people, except for their own vices. What we are left with is a very disturbing and deep tale.I encourage anyone watching this movie for the first time to CLEAR the expectations and hype setup by Goodfellas and Scorsese's reputation overall, and really give this film the time to deliver what it delivers in an amazing way.I also encourage anyone watching this film again who is so decidedly against it (or definitely thinks that it is inferior to Goodfellas) to rethink their position and watch it again with a different mindset.",

The top of the criminal underworld food chain. That even makes this film even more fascinating to see how Mob operations are run, where they get their dough, and just how ruthless and self-serving people can be. Martin Scorsese and Co, with this film, deliver an epic crime tale of deceit, corruption, betrayal, told with a great attention to detail of the story and characters involved.The only downside is that it might feel like a little bit of a re-run from \"Goodfellas\" since the key players are not only the same actors, but playing similar characters.

Robert De Niro is at his personal best as he give a white hot performance that could melt the varnish right off you kitchen table. Never has a man delivered his lines with such power and personal angst as this man, he is truley one of the most gifted actors on the planet. But it is not De Niro himself he is also giving an amazing script by Nicholas Pileggi, the same man who brough us Goodfellas and one of Americans greatest directors of all time Martin Scorsese. Joe Pesci is also fantastic as a violent mobster who is like a walking time bomb. Sharen Stone and James Woods are also in top form as well. It is the three hour plus story of the owner of one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. We go through his ups and downs of life and his business. This is by far one of the grestest movies ever made and I am shocked at how even though it is over three hours long it never becomes boring and in fact even blinking might make you miss to much of this amazing gritty and very powerful drama. I have also found that out of all the actors De Niro is one of the only people who actually make swearing sound cool and you better believe there is a never ending stream of it here. If you like Goodfellas this movie is not to be missed since it follows the same basic formal just on a much larger scale. Not to be missed at any cost",

            "review_title": "May I Be So Bold As To Say: This Movie Is BETTER Than \"Goodfellas\"?",
            "content": "This movie has been criticized by many for being a reworking of sorts of Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi's previous true-crime classic film, \"Goodfellas\", and in many ways, that idea holds water: it uses many of the same actors, the same kind of sudden, spontaneous, unflinchingly brutal violence, the same SteadiCam direction, and of course the glitzy period soundtrack - not to mention the extreme use of the \"f\" word (422 times - and this time, not all of them are from Joe Pesci!). Yes, it has all that. But, in my opinion, \"Casino\" is actually BETTER than \"Goodfellas\" in many ways. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything (pretty much) just clicked.Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in one of his best performances) is a very skilled hustler and gambler who takes over (at the behest of the Mafia) the Tangiers Casino in 1970's Las Vegas. Soon, he's on the top of the world, with him and his cohorts making millions of dollars in an intricate money-making scam - not to mention a beautiful, sexy wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone). But things start to fall apart when Rothstein's childhood friend-cum-mob enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew, representing \"the big bosses\" back east, arrive to make sure everything goes smoothly. Soon, Rothstein's empire falls apart, from an increasingly leaky scheme, sloppy playing by Santoro and crew, his wife's infidelities and drug use, and pressure from the Feds, state government, and the local county commissioner (L.Q. Jones). Finally, Rothstein watches as pretty much everyone around begins to tumble, and he finds he must watch his own back as well.This movie is simply marvelous to behold. Scorsese's direction and Robert Richardson's direction are beautiful, taking Scorsese's wonderfully fluid directing style from the mean streets of New York to the glitzy neon jungle of Las Vegas. Scorsese and Pileggi do a wonderful of showing the glitz, glamor, corruption, and spectacle of old-time Las Vegas, through the utterly beautiful images, and the fantastic dialog. This movie's screenplay isn't laugh-out-loud funny like \"Goodfellas\", but it's just as memorable and well-put together. The violence, as in \"Goodfellas\", is bloody and unflinchingly graphic (particularly Pesci's interrogation of a rival mobster and the death of Pesci and his brother), while not at all glamorized.The acting is solid all around, though that's to be expected. De Niro gives a truly outstanding performance as Ace, who comes across as a normal guy who happens to have had a multi-billion dollar cash cow fall in his lap. Sharon Stone, who I don't much care for, does an excellent job portraying Ginger's wild and crazy nature early on, and doing a fabulous job of showing her downward spiral. Pesci is solid as always, and his performance here (despite the abundance of \"f-cks\") is actually more subdued than in \"Goodfellas\", though just as good. The rest of the supporting cast - Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, L.Q. Jones, Dick Smothers, and Frank Vincent, among many others, all turn in wonderful performances, even in the smallish roles. The only flaw is James Woods, who, as Stone's loser ex-boyfriend, is perfectly cast and does what he can, but is more or less wasted. The period soundtrack is simply gorgeous, and truly helps to enhance the atmosphere. Unlike in \"Goodfellas\", where the music was mostly solid but did have a few out-of-place songs, all of the music clicks.99 out of 100 movie buffs will tell you that \"Goodfellas\" is a classic, while \"Casino\" is merely a pale attempt to live up to that film by Scorsese. I can't speak for more than the minority - but I actually think that \"Casino\" is a more solid version of the package that \"Goodfellas\" delivered. Both films are classics that I'd recommend to anyone; it's just a matter of personal preference.My score: 9/10",

            "content": "The movie had the issue that many people were expecting this to be Goodfellas 2. And if that is the mindset you have going into this ... you might not be as enamoured as others who are free of those thoughts. Even though the movie is meant to work or be an unofficial sequel to Goodfellas (and can be seen as part three if you count Mean Streets into the lore/universe created), this is quite the different beast.And come to think of it, Mean Streets is more of connecting movie or a movie that this is more related to. De Niro being again De Niro, but Keitels character being split into Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone - maybe Stone a bit more, but in a completely different relationship ... and while you could waste time comparing and thinking what is better or not, you could just sit back and enjoy what Scorsese is giving you here.And he starts off with a bang (literally) ... now what follows is more sombre, more laid back in a way. Though there is the famous \"is this your pen\" scene that could easily have been from Goodfellas. It just sets you up to show you there is violence in this and what the relationship is between the two main male characters. It will evolve and go places, so it is fun to watch that journey of it.Funnily enough in Film School you are likely to learn that voice over is not a good thing to use. Good thing no one told Scorsese about that ... because I'd argue it works quite well here. Having said that, I would understand if some feel this does not work at all - or if this is too violent (even if that only happens in from time to time and can only be seen as spikes now and again).All this being based on real life and real characters. And while you may hate certain characters for the way they act and how they pull others down, the performances of the actors is incredible to say the least. I'd say Sharon Stones character is anything but likeable and she really gives it her all - not minding how ugly she looks in the process (mostly on the inside) ... Kudos to her and Scorsese for getting that performance out of her.",

            "content": "I'm a first time viewer of Casino, and it was nothing short of amazing. Where do you even begin?First of all, I've never seen 3 hours of a movie go by so quick. There is literally never a dull moment, and I was truly shocked that the rapid pace of the movie never let up for a moment; it's like a deep breath with no time to exhale. Ironically, however, it doesn't feel rushed. I wanted to take a restroom break, but if you miss one minute of the movie at any point, you can miss a lot, if only a great piece of dialogue or acting performance, in addition to plot developments.Secondly, from Pesci to Stone to Deniro, Oscar worthy performances were all across the board from the leads. These were very difficult roles to play as well as they did, and much credit for that has to go the Scorcese for directing.Next, going into viewing this for the first time, I feared its resemblance to Goodfellas (Deniro, Pesci playing very similar roles) may make me think less of it because originality is one of my biggest factors in rating/scoring, but other than a few similar scenes, it really did actually feel fresh and unique. Pesci in this one is actually far more vicious than in Goodfellas as hard as it is to believe, and I actually preferred his acting in this as the better performance, which I wasn't expecting. It's hard for Deniro in this genre to top Goodfellas' Jimmy Conway, but I would have to say his performance was at least equal to that, if not slightly better due to more emotional range in certain moments.The themes of this movie stretch all across the board, from loyalty to betrayal to marriage fidelity, trust, corruption, and the list goes on, but the one that I liked the most was at the very end, when a main character concludes, \"Why ruin a good thing\" regarding a certain talent. This matched a theme that had just preceded it, which showed how as time goes on, situations evolve, and things change, but the narrator adapts to that by sticking with what he is good at despite that.I'm sure some people will find a few things they didn't like, but this is based on a true story, and the realism was very good. It didn't feel too embellished. The style Scorcese used to film and edit, along with the music, was classic Scorcese, and as of now, I think it may be a little bit better overall than Goodfellas in creativity, except for a couple of scenes in Goodfellas that are better. It's not about comparing or debating which film is better, but pointing out that Casino is right up there very close to, if not on par.Finally, this is just great overall filmmaking as a whole. It is a true \"epic\" crime drama. When watching it, you really get that magical feel that you are watching a classic story and movie. It's the kind of movie that makes you enjoy your popcorn or snacks while watching even more, as you are confident from the start to the middle to the end that it will continue to deliver top notch entertaining scenes. And does it ever..8.3/10",

            "content": "The real life story of how the Mafia - through dubious front men - won and lost casino gambling in Las Vegas.Hard to see how director Martin Scorsesse could really go wrong with a script and subject like this. Totally down his street. This is almost Goodfellers Part II and to make this more obvious they even have some of the same cast - including Robert De Niro as Sam Rothstien the mob front man taking heat from the overworld AND the underworld.If this film had have been made before Goodfellers (probably the best organised crime picture ever made) then it would have been better received. This is not as good and requires too much setting up (almost documentary style) and we don't really care quite as much. It also has a nasty underbelly.The message is that gambling is for idiots and in this world nobody trusts anybody else. This is not a point that you have to go searching for, because it is pushed down your throat through voice-over and then underlined through action. People here are cold and in it for themselves; although this may be true-to-life.I love the little scenes that are truthful. The smiling receptionist setting up the robbery of the guest. People being lured in to debt for the fun of handing out punishment. Casino cheats being dealt with on the spot. It presents a view of 1970's Las Vegas almost as if it were a middle eastern country where thieves have their hands removed. The real thrust of this film is the feeling of being at the cross-roads. Where legitimate business and organised crime meet. De Niro has to play both sides and this is not without danger; as the opening and closing scenes demonstrate. Joe Pesci represents the old school rob 'em/shoot 'em world of the mob. A thuggish money earner while de Niro is a rob'em through a fountain pen type. Uniquely, in my own viewing experience, they share voice-overs giving different spins on the same events.Despite being a thug I prefer Pesci because he is walking the only path that he knows. He is a good thief because he is brave and immoral. \"It is all about the dollars.\" He says. De Niro (Rothstien) had choices and made bad ones.Despite being garlanded Sharon Stone does nothing with her \"love interest\" role apart from looking good and doing some shrieking. Like everyone else she is selfish and me-first, a Las Vegas hustler who lives as a parasite. While interesting, in that it gives the story some variety, the fact that she hooks up with the De Niro (who has his doubts - even in voice over) shows that no one is quite as smart as they like to think.Scorsesse is good at the making people human with little subplots or humour, but he loses the film in some of the violence. It goes on too long and merely drags us through the gutter with the characters. It also cuts against the grain and timing of what goes before. Casino isn't a great film because it doesn't hang together well and we don't care about the main three characters. They made a pact with the devil and they have to abide by the consequences.What remains utterly baffling is the final reel in which the old Las Vegas is blown up to be replaced by the corporation, family safe, version which is sneered at in final commentary: Almost tearful about the dying of America's last wild frontier. In Scorrese's world nothing is worse than being boring, safe and Mafia free...",

Basically the film gives us an insight into the dark world behind the glitz and glimmer of Las Vegas, the gambling capital of America, maybe even the world. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) runs one of the biggest and most successful casinos in Vegas, the Tangiers, with Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) helping him out, they are the mobsters that know everything there is to know about the running of a casino. They know how that the customer are never the winners, the money goes through a system of checks, they can spot the cheaters, and they know how the staff should be doing their jobs in the way they want. For about an hour and a quarter the film consists of the two friends, since childhood, narrating their knowledge of the gambling business, and then Ace meets Ginger McKenna (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Sharon Stone), a sure fire charmer to lure rich gamblers into the joint. Ace is the smooth operator, while the often troubling Nicky is the violent one who will beat someone if they cross the casino. As I mentioned, there is a dark side to the world of Las Vegas, and that is seen by Ace and Nicky, as Ace is lured into loving a hustler who he wrongly trusts with his most treasured assets, and Nicky gets involved with too much violence, drugs and alcohol. In the end, the whole casino and all of its building blocks come tumbling down, all the key staff members and mob heads are killed, including Nicky who is beaten heavily and buried alive, Ginger gets shot, and Ace only just survives his car blowing up. Also starring James Woods as Lester Diamond, Toy Story's Don Rickles as Billy Sherbert, Rush Hour 2's Alan King as Andy Stone, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, L.Q. Jones as Pat Webb, Dick Smothers as Senator and Frank Vincent as Frank Marino. DeNiro and Pesci both create vibrant gangster like characters, and Stone certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination for being a real hard-edge vamp, filled with the same sort of stuff GoodFellas gave us, the lust for power, the domination of money, some sleaze and some really graphic scenes, it is certainly a must see crime drama.

This film is one of the three or four greatest organized crime epics.The texture, the rhythm, the pace, the color, and the horror of Las Vegas are captured with bold brush strokes.The costumes, the music, the editing, the cinematography..all are brilliant. I will comment on the acting... Robert De Niro portrays someone hes never portrayed before in a Scorsese film..a cool headed, calculating near genius.His Achilles heel is his pride in his intelligence. He cannot imagine that he can make a mistake, and it leads to his fall. Joe Pesci offers a better performance than in Goodfelllas, because his character has more screen time and is far more complex. Yes..he is a violent, destructive man. He also imagines himself to be extremely loyal, a good family man, etc. Note how reluctant he is to torture the guy using the vise..its just that he knows that if he doesn't, HIS head will be in the vise.Note the weird grace notes , like combing the hair of the woman he shoots. Finally, Sharon Stone.This is a woman who who is pitifully weak and confused, for all her outward bravado. James Woods (a stunning portrayal) plays her like a Stradivarius.). The last shot of Ms. Stone in the movie(I will not give it away)is terrifying-and pitiful. every performance in this movie,from the biggest star turn to the smallest cameo,is dazzling..the use of Stardust at the end is brilliant. This is a fabulous film, which will-eventually be seen as a great one.",

            "content": "Many have said that this was Goodfellas on a grander scale, and in many ways they're correct, but this isn't detrimental to the movie. The story is a fascinating look at how one of the most iconic cities came to be and how the influence and money of the Mafia built the world famous Las Vegas strip, how the Mafia's empire in Vegas came to be and in the end how (and in some cases literally) it came crashing down. The use of narration is well done and the acting is simply brilliant, Robert De Niro is in top form as the flamboyant bookmaker turned casino manager Sam 'Ace' Rothstein whose tyrannical no nonsense management style would contribute to his downfall. Joe Pesci picks up from where he left off in Goodfellas playing psychotic enforcer Nicky Santorio brilliantly whose violent temper ends up bringing trouble to just about everyone he comes into contact with. L.Q. Jones turns in an underrated performance as the deceptive commissioner Pat Webb, whose easy going good ole boy exterior disguises his real power and influence. Likewise James Woods portrayal of the sleazy pimp Lester Diamond while brief was well done. Onto Frank Vincent and I couldn't help but think he got some satisfaction over getting his own back on Joe Pesci when near the end he does to him what Pesci did to his character in Goodfellas, I think its safe to say he enjoyed that. But the star of the show is Sharon Stone who turns in an outstanding performance as the prostitute turned hustler Ginger McKenna whose devotion to her former pimp boyfriend, her drinking and drug addictions and her reckless behaviour would end up leading to her ultimate demise, Stone put herself through the grinder for the movie, losing so much weight the production team were actually worried about her, changing her hair styles and the emotional outbursts which were done brilliantly, and Stone's performance as a result was Oscar worthy. The portrayal of the mob bosses was also very well done, particularly Pasquale Cajano as Remo Gaggi, who gave a convincing performance as a ruthless mob boss. The rest of the supporting cast were all solid, Kevin Pollak, Alan King, Don Rickles and Billy Allison all turned in fine performances. The movie has got some criticism for its level of violence and profanity but this is the world of organised crime which wasn't exactly known for its eloquence and for its gentleness when it came to 'taking care' of things, so a subtler approach wouldn't have been an accurate depiction of the people and the events the movie is based on. So for those fans of gangster movies and even for history lovers like me this movie is a must see.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese certainly has shown an interest in crime stories. He explores the gritty details of the worlds and the players involved in the games. This particular story focuses on a particular gaming world-the one found in the gambling mecca of the United States, Vegas. Appropriately, the movie is called 'Casino.' Throughout its three-hour runtime, it unpacks a great deal. The first 45 minutes or so lay the foundation. We're exposed to thorough details of how the gaming world in Vegas operates and what it takes to succeed in the business. It's fascinating. For a while. My philosophy is if a movie is three hours long, it better have great reasons for being three hours long. This one felt like it could have been trimmed in a few places, but that didn't happen. Scorsese likes to make long films, so we're left with this monstrously long creation. He takes his time, cuing up one Rolling Stones song after another, letting events play out at a leisurely pace. It's all interesting and well-crafted (because its Scorsese), but it takes nearly two full hours before the pivotal conflict arises. Before then, the characters' lives are bit too peachy, too easy. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play childhood friends who take different business avenues in life, each finding success and power that they find appealing. De Niro wants to play it straight and run a legitimate casino, and he should-he's great at it. Pesci seeks the illegal angle, becoming one of the most infamous mobsters in the world of Vegas. As I said, their lives run smoothly (for the most part) for too much of the story. Everything goes downhill when Pesci steps on one of the wrong gangster's toes, De Niro deals with legal issues over a gambling license, and the biggest doozy of all-De Niro's wife loses her mind. In a force of nature performance from Sharon Stone, De Niro's screen wife Ginger becomes the most compelling and despicable character over the film's final hour-this is when Stone really starts to go for it. No spoilers here, so I'll just say that her reputation as one of the worst movie wives of all time is well-deserved. As circumstances spiral out of control, Scorsese blasts a couple more Rolling Stones songs and opens up his bag of mesmerizing camera tricks. His catalog of film techniques can fill an entire book shelf on its own. His application choices don't always appear to make sense, but they certainly catch the eye, which may be the primary intention. I'm a big fan of Marty's work, so I'll see anything he has made. While this isn't his best, it's still an entertaining and worthwhile film.",

Its always a treat to watch DeNiro act in these types of movies - even if he is rehashing old ground.The movie kind of felt like Scorsese was trying to top Goodfellas but I think he ended up a little short. i give it a 6 out of 10.",

We follow the rise and fall of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein,played by a brilliant(as always) Robert de Niro. He becomes boss of one of the biggest casino's in town,the Tangiers. As an old master gambler he knows all the tricks of the business,so that in a short period of time the Tangiers becomes the biggest Casino in Vegas. But then the problems start: first of all he meets a girl,Ginger played by a beautiful Sharon Stone and then an old friend comes to town to help him with the casino,Nicki Santoro(Joe Pesci in one of his greatest performances!). Nicki brings Ace into a lot of problems because of his aggressive way of solving things,like molesting a guy with a pen and putting someone's head into a vice. In the meantime Ginger can't keep away from drugs and booze while she also still has a relationship with a pimp,Lester Diamond(funny performance by James Woods).Above that all,she also starts to screw Nicki. At the end Ginger dies of an overdose,Ace survives a car bomb and Nicki(who set the car bomb) gets viciously murdered in the desert, he gets beaten with baseball bats and is buried alive.casino is a beautiful movie about love,money and deceit in a sinful town. We get to see a great view inside the Casino and look at things that we otherwise would never get to see. The shots of Las Vegas are especially nice to watch,just look at one of the first shots of the movie,a great view over Las Vegas in the middle of the night.Here you can really see what a small city it is and that it is surrounded by absolutely nothing.The performances by the actors are without exception high-class,especially the leading players:De Niro,Stone and Pesci. Joe Pesci is my favorite in this movie because of his quick dialogues and his unstoppable swearing. The directing by Martin Scorsese is as always flawless. His movies with Robert de Niro are of an unreached high level,just look at other films like Goodfellas,Raging bull,Cape Fear and Taxi Driver.Although the movie can be really brutal at times(the scene in which Joe Pesci gets killed is really sick) the humor in some scenes are absolutely ingenious.Watch closely at the scene in which de Niro is behind his desk in his underwear and the scene in the grocery store with the old lady who can't her son swearing all the time,hilarious!Overall,Casino is one of my favorite Scorsese movies and it is a shame that it is so underrated,also in this database. 10/10",

Her character began as a shooting star and deteriorated to a burnt out derelict. She should have won the Oscar for this awesome portrayal. Direction was meticulous with each shot and scene saying something pertinent to the plot. I did not appreciate the F word used so many times. it tends to cheapen the film. What did we do for sixty years before the F word was used?? I'm fortunate in viewing the film on TV where the filth was dubbed over. I remember seeing a film called \"Glen Gary, Glen Ross\" I had to leave the theatre due to the senseless filth in the language. I mean really stupid, unnecessary profanity. Later I saw the film on TV sans the filth. It was a very good film. I have nothing but praise for Casino and all connected with it. Kudos to Martin Scorcese.",

            "content": "Many consider this film as a sub - GoodFellas (1990) rip off, due to the style of the film and the nature of the violence and dialogue. While I agree that there are certain similarities, it must be considered independent from Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece. Indeed, Casino expands on GoodFellas and improves it.We are now forced to care about Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his downward spiral. In GoodFellas, we viewed the world of Henry Hill, but we were never really cared about him or his friends. Joe Pesci's performance as Nicky Santoro is, for me personally, far more disturbing than Tommy De Vito. Santoro is more vicious and is prepared to back stab Rothstein over business and his wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone, in an Oscar nominated role, and rightly so). Even the violence is considered more graphic. I know a few people who were distressed by the intensity of the violence and had to stop watching the film. This is, surely, a success on the part of Scorsese and his cast on the fact that they are able to get such gut reactions from people who have been raised on slasher films, such as Halloween (1978).There's also more of a story to Casino, which makes it a more engaging tale. No detail is too small for Rothstein, even down to the number of currents in a bun. It's a fascinating view about the rise and fall of the mob in Las Vegas, the playground of the world. The interesting thing about Rothstein is that he isn't actively involved in the violence, but he certainly doesn't condone it. Watch his face as the guy's hand is smashed with the hammer.My only complaint is that James Woods is pretty weak as Lester Diamond, Ginger's former pimp. Considering his performance as a gangster in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), we know he can do much better than that. I don't know what Scorsese was thinking there.Other than that, I give Casino a 9 out of 10.",

It's right up there with Goodfellas though with Casino there isn't the same level of irony and humor that you find with Goodfellas but it's entertaining nonetheless.  This is a tale of unchecked greed, out of control egos, excessive behavior, and ultimately self-destruction that occurs as a result of all the money, power, and obsession.  The violence is right on par with Goodfellas maybe even more so and the violence is VERY necessary (including all the head shots) because it is both crucial to the story and faithful to what actually happened in real life.  I love the two old guys in jogging suits running around killing everybody (they were Felix \"Milwaukee Phil\" Aldersio and Charles \"Chuckie\" Nicoletti who were credited with 36 killings).  This was a tremendous performance for Sharon Stone and I'm sure it was the best of her career.  She makes you loathe her, despise her, and hate her but she somehow manages to  make you feel sorry for her by the end. DeNiro is dead on as usual and Pesci puts on a show that almost rivals Tommy DeVito.  Casino may not have been as popular as Goodfellas but I believe the acting was just as good and the story was just as gripping. Scorsese must have been proud of himself and this was my favorite movie of 1995.",

With the exception of \"Once Upon a Time in America\" they were all good.\"Casino\" is a semi-true story about Las Vegas in general and the Tangiers Casino in particular. Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) was such a gambling savant that the east coast mafia bosses wanted him to run the casino to make them money. It was an elaborate set up that made money for everybody. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) was the muscle to protect Sam and Ginger (Sharon Stone) was the trophy wife.But all good things come to an end. All it takes is a little greed, a little lust, a little envy and you have the necessary ingredients for a colossal crash.\"Casino\" was good, and if it weren't for the bad episode of \"Days of Our Lives\" that happened between Ginger and Sam, then it would've been a lot better. I'm not a fan of watching dysfunction. If I were, then I'd watch Jerry Springer. Sam married a woman who was a hustler. A woman who reluctantly married him. A woman whose love he had to buy. If those aren't enough warning signs, then you're either blind or resigned-resigned to the fact that you'll have a life partner who you can never completely trust. It was just nerve-wracking watching them two and their dumpster fire of a marriage. If that could have been excised from the movie, then A.) it would have been much better and B.) it would've been about thirty minutes shorter. Those are two plusses in my book.Mafia movies always seem to yield positive numbers: box office bucks and reviews. \"Casino\" was one of the many successes from the machine.

I get the feeling while watching it that I could re- order most of the scenes and it would play just as well.

When Sam found his daughter tied to the bed, he should had her killed Ginger (or at the very least cut off ties to her altogether).Sam leaving the keys to the safe deposit box in a flimsy locked desk drawer was stupid.Pesci's character is supposed to be smart and loyal, but allows Ginger to manipulate him.I might of liked Don Rickles character...if he had more to say.Too much ad-libbing from various characters and it showed.Too long of a movie (especially without a real plot).

The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself.",

They intertwine and twist into the great drama that is the individual man's life, and there are countless scenes here that will remain memorable: the introduction of each major character, Joe Pesci interacting with his young son, Sharon Stone interacting with her leeching ex-boyfriend, the scene where Robert DeNiro stands in the desert as the dust from Pesci's car kicks up around him, and the countless scenes of upper-class suburban Los Vegas juxtaposed with the chaotic, grimy personal lives of those who inhabit it.This movie is pretty long, so if you are not the type who likes to sit down for three straight hours, then I wouldn't recommend this one to you, but for everyone else, feast away.

            "content": "Casino is often hailed as one of Martin Scorsese's best movies, and rightfully so. I first saw it when I was 16, but now 6 years have passed and I admire it more. Not only is it one of my favorite Scorsese movies, but it is one of my favorite movies of all time.The plot follows Robert De Niro as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a Mobster who runs a casino. While he gets rich and powerful, his closest friend Nicky(played by Joe Pesci) and his gold digging wife Ginger(played by Sharon Stone) try to take over, and this leads to everyone's fall.Many elements of Casino justify it as one of Scorsese's finest works. For instance, the main actors-De Niro, Pesci, and Stone- all give some of their greatest performances in the movie.My personal favorite is Joe Pesci as Nicky, playing the ultimate villian in the movie. He's someone to fear, and that is very effective. In one scene, a casino guest insults Nicky, and in response to this he brutally stabs him in the throat with a writing pen!In another scene, Nicky tortures a guy for 2 days and nights to get some information out of him. His last resort is a vice tool to nearly squish his head in. His violent behavior bites him back in the end, but I won't spoil that for you. This is easily Scorsese's most brutal film, and that works to it's advantage.Sharon Stone looks lovely, but it's clear from the moment we meet her that she has an ugly heart. When she and Ace meet, he showers her with wads of cash and mountains of gold jewelry. Her alcoholism and smoking is another story. Ace eventually sees right through her, but removing her from his life proves to be an uneasy task.Then there is Robert De Niro, in his 8th and final role with Scorsese, that is- until The Irishman. His role as Ace marks one of the best in his career-his whole career, not just with Scorsese. He's a tough guy filled with greed, and he plays both characteristics very well.Apart from the acting. Casino has some of the best cinematography to come out of a Scorsese movie, up there with The Age of Innocence. In fact, Saul and Elaine Bass did the gorgeous opening title sequence, just like they had done for Age.Casino is also paced quite well. Even though the movie is a couple minutes shy of 3 hours long, the time goes by very quickly. If you checked the time stamp and you were an hour into it, you would wonder where the time went.For it's acting, cinematography, directing and other marvelous reasons, Casino truly is one of Scorsese's best movies. Those who love his work- or crime movies in general- should invest the time to see it. Casino is a gamble that is well worth the shot.",

If you've ever been in a casino then this movie will really let you appreciate all that goes on in the background.This is a story about love, obsession, greed, ruthlessness--most of all this story chronicles the life of a Casino manager, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), and his ascent to power in 1970s Las Vegas.  Sharon Stone stars as Sam's debutante, Ginger McKenna and Joe Pesci is the crony, Nicky Santoro. Much of the story revolves around these three altogether very different characters.  Unlike Goodfellas, where the crew was trying to get money, power and women, the crew in Casino already had it--they were trying to keep it from competitors, law-enforcement and most importantly--each other.This movie is severely, SEVERELY underrated.  There are moments when it would be safe to assume you'll know what will happen next but, other times (and I won't mention anything specific--except the corn field that is) you won't know what hit you.The camera work is incredible, the story is fantastic and the characters are nothing less than superior.Overall, Casino is not a movie for the faint-of-heart but, a story that is gripping, moving and deeply entrenched in mob tradition.9/10 stars!",

            "content": "Casino (1995) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a scammer and gambling expert, who is sent by the mob to Las Vegas to get his hands around some casino and casino activities for them and send them home money routinely. The job seems fairly straightforward and easy, especially with how good he is at it, until he falls in love with the wrong woman and some friends join him that push the envelope too far while performing their activities.This movie is directed by legend Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas) and stars Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Joe Pesci (Lethal Weapon 3), Sharon Stone (Sliver), James Woods (Vampires), Don Rickles (Kelly's Heroes), Alan King (Cat's Eye) and Alan King (Goodfellas).This movie is an absolute masterpiece and the concept of having two narrators was unique and perfect. De Niro and Pesci were awesome at telling the tale as it unfolded. The cinematography, depiction of the casinos and era was perfect. The acting by everyone is absolutely tremendous and the mannerisms, reactions, facial expression and how people snapped and treated each other was brilliant. The storyline is so unique, well-paced and fascinating from beginning to end. The ending unfolds well, and the final \"whacking\" and outcomes are crazy good.Overall, this is American cinematic gold that I would score a 10/10 and strongly recommend.",

            "content": "The first half of the 1990s was a glorious, competitive time for mob films. Okay, so we started off with the disappointing (but far from terrible) The Godfather: Part 3, but later that year Martin Scorsese released GoodFellas, which many people consider to be the definitive gangster film. In that same year came Miller's Crossing, and Quentin Tarantino added to the palette with both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. In 1995, Marty hit back with Casino, redefining the blockbuster genre in a way that wasn't emulated until some twelve years later, when Nolan got his hands on the Batman franchise.Comprising of an all-star cast headed by the incomparable Robert De Niro, Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, America's finest bookmaker in the 1970s and 80s, whose knowledge of the industry lures him to Las Vegas. At the behest of the Mafia, he becomes the executive manager of the fictional Tangiers casino. Childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes along for the ride, and all seems to run smoothly until a desire for women, wealth and the very essence of Vegas sends the gambling empire into a tailspin. Expect nothing less than utter professionalism in the direction department. Scorsese gives the audience an excellent look into the luxury, excess and emotion that defined Las Vegas for so long. The visuals are striking, displaying the bright lights of the city in external scenes, and giving the film a glossy undertone during internal scenes; a highly unconventional technique, but one that reflects the tone perfectly.As with most of Marty's masterpieces, Casino is unique in the way that it dosen't follow a structured plot. Rather, the film is, for lack of a better phrase, a whole bunch of 'things' that happen, and how they impact on (or are caused by) the main characters. In fact, a positive aspect of the movie that isn't recognised by most is just how much influence the characters have on the story. The first half of the film is concerned with how Ace and Nicky run the casino: turning over profits, keeping customers happy and dealing with cheaters. The second half deals solely with each character's personal issues, and how they destroyed something so valuable from the inside out. We see how Ace's hustling wife Ginger (Sharon Stone, in a career-best performance) turns two former friends against each other, while slowly killing herself as well. There is no doubt that the events of the second half are on a smaller scale to those of the first, but so much more emphasis is placed on the former because of the magnetism and excellent performance of each actor.Drama is on high supply for the film's entire three-hour run time, but allows for some well- written comedy to complement the pace. For all the excellent younger actors Scorsese has worked with in the past decade, none of them convey the effortless on-screen chemistry of De Niro and Pesci, whether they are joking with each other, or wishing death upon one another. At its simplest, this can be called the ultimate guy's movie. It features shooting, swearing, suits, money, fast cars and even faster women. Delve a little deeper, and you'll appreciate the practically flawless acting, indulgent cinematography and a cautionary tale just as critical of greed and the flaws of human beings as Wall Street or Scarface. I take issue with this film's tagline: 'You don't stay at the top forever', because it will take one hell of an effort to knock Casino off this movie-lover's list of top 20 films.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Of course, longer than it really should be, with maybe too many shots of the counting room and cash being channelled noisily, but then everything here is appropriately excessive, not least the violence. The language is confrontational, the lighting and colour shrill but the seamless editing draws us along, in what is essentially a rather slim story, eager to indulge further in the gluttony on display and arrogant swagger, shamelessly celebrated. I'm not a great fan of De Niro but he does well here, his rather flat delivery providing excellent contrast to the performance of a lifetime from Sharon Stone. Despite the amazing skills of Scorsese in bringing off this amazing cinematic epic with such pizzazz, it would have been a lesser film without Stone. Much criticised, she is undeniably an actress who with the right incentive can, seemingly effortlessly, lift a movie way out of the norm. If not more important than Taxi Driver, this probably is the better film due to the exuberance and sheer love of cinematic movement on display, oh and awareness of the importance of a superlative soundtrack.",

On the one hand Scorsese glorifies the old casinos. When Ace laments in the end, that today Las Vegas is nothing more than a gambling Disneyland, we suffer with him. It's a place run by emotionless businessman. On the other hand, however, Scorsese knows about the victims that the old system claimed, about the abyss behind the shiny surface. The film is acted very well by the \"Goodfellas\"-duo Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, while the biggest surprise for me was Sharon Stone. For me Ginger is a victim of this system, although some people might argue that she herself is responsible for the situation she's in. In the end, she is not the only victim and many other problems will be solved in the desert surrounding Las Vegas.",

            "content": "The simply titled \"Casino\", one of many Scorsese/ De Niro collaborations, tells the fact-based story of Las Vegas, 1970. Many themes are present, most notably the power of money and greed. The usual suspects are here, and both De Niro and Joe Pesci fit their roles very well; De Niro the suave, level-headed thinker, and Pesci the volatile buttonman.Five minutes in, and an appropriate title popped into my head: Goodfellas Part II. All the signature aspects of that bar-setting film are present in Casino: smart-talking, wiseguy narrators, constant music in the background, constant action and furious dialogue, swearing (you won't BELIEVE some of Pesci's rants), and dripping mafia style. One thing that isn't the same though is setting: Las Vegas.The stakes here are higher, so lots about the movie has been scaled up as well. The plot is rich, with many angles. Goodfellas had a more contained story with less to explain, or it was just explained better. The first 20 minutes of Casino tell you all kinds of Vegas info very quickly. I hope you know your gambling. I don't want to say it's a fault, because it's very necessary, but it seems almost rushed. But it's not like it would affect the runtime, the film is almost 3 full hours. I'm a fan of that though, this is a bog movie with lots to tell. And because of great pacing and exciting moments, it's a 3 hour treat.The content has been elevated too. Violent and vulgar, this is not a film for kids. But it's all important. Pesci's character Nicky does most of the swearing, probably 300 or so f words from him alone, because he's always in a foul mood, which makes him unpredictable. Then there's the violence. Starting with a scene involving a pen, this is super-duper violent, showing just what people do to get what they want, or because they're crazy Nicky.If you told someone this was a Scorsese/Tarantino collaboration, they'd probably believe you. Scenes with the vice, hammer and bat are right out of the Tarantino killbook, or out of Dead Rising. They keep you on edge and are brutal.Casino takes everything about Goodfellas, minus Ray Liotta, and puts it in Vegas. Except for a confusing start that can't really be dealt with, the only reason Casino didn't enjoy the success of Goodfellas is its bland name and being released 5 years later. See Goodfellas, then see this. 8.9/10",

DeNiro on the other hand in my opinion should have earned a nomination as well as Sam Rothstein the casino owner.

I have however been to Atlantic City and can understand how the glitter and jingle of the slots can be so mesmerizing, or more precisely saw just that happen numerous times. I never felt the tug, my suspicions confirmed one day at the local casino when I popped a token in a machine and lo, it came up 'bar' 'bar' 'off by one'.

Robert de Niro reaches one of his best performances ever as Rothstein. Sharon Stone is very good as Rothstein's girlfriend. I guess the Academy at this point understood her potential since she got nominated for Oscar. With Basic Instinct she should've gotten it. Joe Pesci is as good as he always is playing the same character. He really got his way of pronouncing the F-word.

This isn't a sequel, but it is pretty much the same movie with a different location and list of characters. This can be done by the same director or a different one. In this case, Martin Scorsese made Goodfellas in 1990, creating one of the greatest movies of all time. In 1995, he came back with another movie of the same caliber as Goodfellas.Casino is the story of the rise and fall of a casino in Las Vegas called the Tangiers during the 1970's and 80's. Casino operator Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) try to make this casino the best there is while making a huge amount of money for themselves, their wives, and for the \"bosses\" back home. They use some interesting methods of persuasion for cheaters in the casino so they never come back, and of course there are payoffs to police, security, politicians, and anyone else who needs to be \"taken care of\". With so much corruption in this town, they fit right in.Sam's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is the woman of his dreams, or at least that's what he thinks. Together, the two of them go on a roller coaster ride through everything. Just when things are looking great, the whole operation falls apart. The Tangiers is running smoothly, no one is ratted out, and they are becoming kings of the Las Vegas strip. Little by little things crumble down into oblivion. Snitches, FBI agents, and all sorts of trouble rain down on this paradise in the desert. Scorsese does a nice job of illustrating the rise and fall of this casino. It is very reminiscent of Goodfellas, the story being the rise and fall of the crime family. Casino the same idea with a different story. The good thing is that there isn't a problem with that because the movie itself makes up for it. Scorsese brings back De Niro and Pesci from previous movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas to make this movie worth watching. The addition of Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Ginger, gives the movie more of a reason to watch.The only problem with this movie is that is really long, running just short of three hours. Some parts seem to drag on, but with the changing storyline, it's always something new. Scorsese does what he does best and that is tell a great story. His use of narration throughout the whole movie by De Niro and Pesci is very well done. The transition from the 70's to the 80's is noticeable in the equipment used in the casino, the clothing, the music, and the lifestyles they pursue. Whether it's watching the casino floor or taking some guys out back to \"talk\" with, there is a lot to watch and be entertained by. The hard work put into running a casino and all of the in's and out's are exposed. It's a hard life out there, but when a problem arises, all they have to to is dig a hole in the desert and let the pistol do the talking. Casino is a great story that is definitely worth a viewing at least once. As the saying goes, \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...\". Thankfully this movie got out for us to see.",

Casino is probably the best Vegas movie you'll see. I'd call Fear and Loathing a close second. Leaving Las Vegas, to me, was well acted, but boring and overly \"arty.\"So yeah Casino is a slick piece of craft. Slick cinematography, slick design, slick acting. But the heart and soul we'd find in Goodfellas is clearly missing from this take. The mechanisms of greed, the procedures of skimming are fascinatingly and warmly documented here, but the people are just not very interesting.

I guess that if my expectations weren't so high for this movie I would have enjoyed it more, because a good deal of the time I enjoy no-brainer action movies, but I was hoping for a good movie, which turned out to be a regurgitated and much less plausible version of Scorsese's classic film.  But it's not all that bad of a film, I mean the flashy images of Las Vegas and the casinos were well shot, and some of the dialogue was good, but I didn't keep me interested for 3 hours. 5/10",

            "content": "Scorsese's follow-up to Goodfellas is a monstrously entertaining drama about a mafia run casino in Vegas. Robert De Niro plays the chain-smoking control freak Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of the Tangiers casino by his mob buddies, most notably Nicky Santoro. Santoro is played by the one and only Joe Pesci, who may very well have topped his performance in Goodfellas. Nicky is a killer, thief, gambler, and muscle-man, who wants the world and is willing to go over the heads of his bosses to get it. Sharon Stone completes the trifecta of immorality as Ginger, a hustler who Sam convinces to marry him even though he knows she doesn't love him. Though the movie is largely the story of the mob embezzlement of Vegas, and the inner-workings, dynamics and politics of running a casino, the relationship between the three main characters is key to the plot.The plot is told unconventionally, and as the story takes place over the span of ten years, many of its scenes feel like anecdotes. But each one adds something great to the whole story. Everything builds to something, there's not one wasted second in the entire 3 hours. It seems to go by very quickly because it is so entertaining. The three leads are absolutely flawless and the drama that unfolds is truly engrossing. All three change as the movie progresses. Ginger starts off as a happy, free-spirited woman, but when she marries Sam she starts a descent into darkness. Sam's controlling tendencies are largely to blame for her slide into drug abuse, greed and compulsive lying. She resents him controlling her, he doesn't trust her enough to give her any space. She spirals further by running away with their kid and Lester, then later tying the kid to the bed when she went out to drink. Sam is the kind of person who tries to do the right thing in all situations, but with Ginger he sometimes overreacts and escalates problems further. Their deteriorating relationship threatens to sink the whole casino scam.Meanwhile Sam's over-protectiveness of his own casino lands him in hot water with the gaming commission, and Nicky's own actions make him a target for the FBI. Both are unable to let go of the monster that they created, Nicky refusing to leave town to let the heat on him cool down, and Sam unable to step out of the limelight of running the casino. The relationship between Nicky and Ginger is interesting because for once we see a human side of Nicky. She ends up sleeping with him, complicating things further. When the house of cards quite literally comes down, the bullets fly in classic Scorsese style. Only Sam is left unscathed, somehow coming full circle, hopefully a much wiser man.Scorsese directs this movie at full-speed, tearing open the rotten underside of Vegas in the 1970s for all to see. From taking us into the inner workings of casinos, to mob shakedowns, husband and wife quarrels, political manoeuvring, and tying it all together, you're always involved. This is a must-see film and one of the best of the 90's.",

I love Scorsese and Robert De Niro and this is their best film together after Raging Bull.Sharon Stone is very good in this film and as always Joe Pesci is very convincing.This film deserves a place in the top 250 and it also deserved some oscars. The movie lasts for 3 hours,but it feels like 1 hour, I mean...It`s never boring and I can watch this movie every day and not get tired of it. It`s absolutely a brilliant film and the acting is beautiful and thank you to Nicholas Pileggi(co-writer and the book).The movie is so realistic in every way and it`s truly a masterpiece.Robert De Niro handles the role as \"Ace\" perfectly and this is maybe he`s best role after Jake La Motta(Raging Bull). Joe Pesci is always great together with De Niro and this role is very similar to the role as Tommy in Goodfellas(also directed by Scorsese). And last but not least,Sharon Stone. She really deserved that oscar because in this film she is so great and manages the role great.So you have to see this film,it`s one of the best ever.It` really a bit touching to because in the end they lose everything. The music also is absolutely great and this is a clear 10/10. Scorsese+De Niro=SUCCESS!!",

It is a dream becoming a nightmare.In some ways Casino is better than Goodfellas and in others it is similar. This similarity could be seen as a drawback but for me Casino is the sequel to Goodfellas. Both are based on true stories about the mob written by Nicholas Pileggi and are an achievement that can only be compared in quality to The Godfather 1 and 2.  The magnificent opening of Casino shows Martin Scorsese using a more grand style. The wide open vistas of the desert are contrasted with the neon world of the gambler and the old neighborhood of the mob bosses. Robert De Niro is very effective in being the \"rational\" one who pleads that if everybody just follows the \"rules\" they would all be winners. His irrational equal (including in acting ability) is Sharon Stone who will not be tamed and helps to bring the whole house of cards down. In the Godfather films and in Goodfellas there are winners as well as losers. Casino is about losing it all.I felt Pesci's limitations were shown in the \"romantic\" scenes between him and Stone. Still, I can't think of anyone else who can do a better job playing a ruthless thug. And this drawback was more than made up by the excellent James Woods as the slimy boyfriend. Great stuff.\nCasino juggles success, corruption, vicious violence and farce in a broad sweep that never fails to impress. It's tale of destruction in some ways leads to sympathy. For these characters are like children who can never learn. They can never see the cause of their downfall, themselves.",

Two of these dinossaur mobsters are Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci. Once friends, when the going gets tough however, they become bitter enemies. Will they all go down the drain or will they somehow find a way to survive this downfall of the mob in Las Vegas? That's the story.Photography, soundtrack, editing, everything is done brilliantly. I personally think this is Scorsese's last greatest work of his carreer. Everything got a bit bland and predictable later on. But with \"Casino\" he delivers a magnificent portrait about GREED. \n\"Greed is good\" that was the motto of the bankers who in the end took over the mob.\"Good Fellas\" is the most popular and critically acclaimed american mob classic next to \"The Godfather\", but I think \"Casino\" deserves that second place more. This movie truly cares for it's characters. They become true to life. However obnoxious, crazy, violent and destructive these characters might be, I felt I got to know them as if I was their neighbour. However brilliant this epic is, I guess it is not really suited for those who just want to see a fast and funny action movie about the mob. It is nothing like \"Goodfellas\". \"Casino\" is slowburning, subtle yet twisted and without the usual glorifying of violence, although it has lots of it on display...Clocking at 3 hours this is one heck of an epic about how the banks took over the mob's rule in Las Vegas. Gambling became a legit business for banks at the beginning of the eighties.The same debt ridden banks that later went on to cause the most destructive global economy crisis in recorded history. I applaud Scorsese for that stinging observation at the end of this movie. And I applaud him even more for making this masterpiece. What a fascinating story to watch. Very impressive.",

The performances by Robert DeNiro as the tycoon scapegoat Sam (Ace) Rothstein, Joe Pesci as the wiseguy, menacing \"big man on campus\" Nicky Santoro, and Sharon Stone, as the emotionally disturbed, afflicted, and ballistic Ginger, among others, lend way to perhaps the most amusing and engaging story ever captured on film. I felt a great deal for these characters: their successes, troubles, and demises, as \"no one stays on top forever\", and I received an indelible conception of the operation of the mob in my residence of Las Vegas in the early 1980s. The script is fantastic: hilarious at times (this humor especially driven by the brilliant Joe Pesci, who can perform the most grotesque, audacious acts and still come across as hilarious), yet also serious and interesting, in examining down to the bare core the details of the mob underworld and its operation of casino empires. The direction by Martin Scorcese is definitely Oscar-worthy: rich, sincere, and relentless in focusing on various themes chronicling the volatile story. I especially appreciated the music, correlating with the film's themes most befittingly: light, heavy, dark, comical, etc. This film, besides being an engaging, amusing, and captivating tale about the body of the mob, is an excellent, and almost impeccable, production, wherein everything, from the direction, the acting, the screenplay, the music, and the editing, compliments whatever theme a scene is trying to achieve. Not for everyone, especially for those who might be allergic to obscenity (as this is perhaps the most profane film I've ever seen). Yet if you enjoy hardcore, serious, and comical stories about success, greed, and personal destruction, \"Casino\" fits the bill perfectly. For me, this is the best \"mob\" film ever, and a genuine classic in style, story, and deliverance. **** out of ****",

            "content": "Casino is a film about the mob empire that secretly ran Las Vegas in the 1970's and early 80's. Casino follow's Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein(Robert Deniro), a professional gambler who is given the task by the Mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas. His good old neighborhood friend, Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci), is a wild, demonic gangster that is assigned to watch Ace's back. Ginger(Sharon Stone) is a hustler and ex-prostitute that Ace falls in love with. All three main characters have flaws. Some have minor flaws while others have major flaws. Each character's flaw leads them to their own demise. Casino is a film about money, power, and greed. This gripping tale show's how something good can go straight to hell.The characters are well developed. Ace is a cool character. He is a pretty smart guy and is a perfectionist. He is the best at what he does and he knows it. And what he does is illegal, but he does it in a clean way. But Nicky on the other hand is not a clean guy. His business is roughing people up and stealing. He is the muscle of the Mafia in Vegas and his job is to make sure know one messes with Ace and that know one messes up the money making scheme. Both Ace and Nicky are street guys who have been given the chance to do something big with their lives. When they each moved to Vegas they both had their own small goals and then one main goal that they both shared and that was making money for the Bosses back home. Then Ace meets Ginger. And everything gets turned upside down. Ginger is a hustler with a rough past, but Ace is drawn to her. Her beauty and style mesmerizes Ace. There is something about her that makes Ace go wild. Ace falls for Ginger and they get married. But even before they get married the viewer sees some instability in Ginger. And when she finally is married all of her instability is put on display. Half of her instability comes from her continued relationship with her ex-pimp, Lester Diamond(James Woods). Lester is a true sleezeball. Lester continually uses Ginger for money. His actions and even the way he dresses completely sells him as a sleezeball. These four great characters intertwine through the film creating great drama.Ace is the main protagonist. Ace has to push to get his gaming license in order to run his casino. Nicky creates a bad rap for Ace and the casino because of all his suspicions in crime. Nicky eventually ends up starting his own gang and begins robbing the locals of Las Vegas. Meanwhile Ace has a troubled marriage with Ginger. Ginger becomes more and more unstable. Ginger becomes an alcoholic and eventually a drug addict. She cheats on Ace with Lester and eventually with Nicky. Ace suspects that this is going. But he cannot stop loving Ginger. No matter how crazy she becomes he always gives in. Ace thought he could change Ginger by marrying her but all she wanted was his money. Ace himself becomes absorbed with the casino and his power. And Nicky is overwhelmed by greed. Nicky's goal is to take over the thrown in Vegas. In the end the Mob empire in Las Vegas collapses as do the lives of Ace, Ginger, and Nicky. There is one criticism I have on this film. I would like to comment on the narration. The film is filled with narration. The first narrator is Ace and the other is Nicky. The first hour of the film is like a documentary of Las Vegas in the 1970's. There are brief pauses with actual dialog but they are only brief. The narration continues through the movie but lessens in the second half. But never goes away I might add. The narration did do a good job of filling in the gaps. Sort of like Goodfellas. I liked Ace's narration but I felt annoyed by Nicky's. I didn't think it was needed. Deniro's voice is smooth while Pesci's voice is kinda annoying. But who am I to criticize Martin Scorsese. If he wants two narrators then he can get two narrators. ACTING4. Joe Pesci plays the usual wacko gangster like in Goodfellas and he has it mastered. I have never met Joe Pesci and I'm sure he doesn't act like Nicky but he is so believable that you start to wonder if he acts like that in real life.3. James Woods plays Lester so wonderfully. He is the definition for creepy and slimy. He does a great job of being a low-life looser.2. Sharon Stone is the only woman who could play Ginger. I know a lot of people hate Sharon Stone and find her annoying, but in Casino you are supposed to hate her. And she does a good job of being the person you hate.1. Robert Deniro was in my opinion the most impressive in the film. I think this is one of his best if not the best performance of his career. He plays Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein so well. I cannot say that I like Ace but he's pretty cool. Deniro is so smooth. Even when he gets angry he is smooth. Deniro's performance was the best.OTHER ACTORS-- Don Rickels, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, and Frank Vincent also star in Casino and they do a great job with their more minor roles.WARNING!!!!! Casino is a very dark, brutal film. Full of very Strong, graphic, and brutal violence. There is also very strong language that is said through out the whole three hours of film. To finish I would like to say that Casino is a great film all around. With great acting, directing, and with a great story that is similar to a Shakespearean tragedy. Go watch it!!!",

The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.My main beef with the movie is two fold.One is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters \"cool\" and full of \"attitude\" and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.My second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how \"cool\" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from \"cool\" gangsters.I think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.I don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",

They can make you laugh and cry pretty much at the same time. The film follows Ace Rothstien (De Niro) when he gets the biggest prize a gambler can get: his own casino. Of course he has to pay the mobsters who gave it to them. He also has to deal with the violent and costly exploits of his friend Nicky (Pesci). Joe Pesci again perfects the loud mouth loose cannon character as he did in Goodfellas, but i think here he was given a more important part. Robert De Niro can not fail. You can see the stress and anger in his eyes in this film. Martin Scorsese is the world's greatest director. Screw the Academy. He should have won the best director Oscar several times by now. I would love to see him do more work with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This is a classic gangster picture that is always compared to Goodfellas.

There are hundreds of movies like that, but Casino is another movie is a very special one.As usual in a Mr Scorsese picture the acting is great, the three main characters, De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pecci are outstanding, how they mix, how they make alliances and how they break it is just marvelous.The story of the rise and fall of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein must be seen more than once to appreciate all the details of the story, from the dialogs to the costumes, everything fits in its place and is central to the story.This is a great Martin Scorsese Picture, as good as he can be.",

In fact, it takes suggested ideas from those two films, and others (\"The King of Comedy\", \"Vertigo\", etc.), and expands them, explores them, and gives us an entirely new perspective.  I always appreciate a director who gives us things we haven't seen before, or at the very least, gives us a new way of looking at things we have seen before.",

It's impossible to get into the lives of characters, they seem to just narrate themselves, then start narrating others, then the others take over and start narrating themselves and it just goes round in circles. I'm not even sure what's going on. Robert De Niro is running a casino, he's banned a few people, there's been a few fights and that's about it, I'm over an hour in and I really don't know where this is going. Also, why does De Niro basically always seem to play himself? He's basically the same in every single film he's ever been in, apart from a couple where he's been slightly more angry than normal. More importantly though how has it taken me all this time to realise this? He's like the most boring actor ever. You only need to see one De Niro film and you've basically seen them all. I've still got the film playing, but it's basically background noise. When I've finished on facebook I'm turning it off and going to bed. This film has done nothing but made me angry. 2.5/10",

Well I didn't.  However, I could have had one and the movie would still have reached my expectations.  I thought it was absolutely brilliant with some funny scenes and some great acting.  The movie talks about, as it says in the title, a casino.  But it's not just a casino.  It's THE casino ran by Sam \"ACE\" Rothstein (De Niro).  Ace is the best football handicapper in the country but is so good that you could say he cheats when he bets.  Plus he never bets unless he is sure to win.  But in Las Vegas, running a casino requires help.  So his bosses in Kansas City send down one f his best friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), to watch his back.  As usual, Pesci plays a rather crazy character who seems to be particularly fond of being a gangster.   In Vegas, Ace marries Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and complicates his life by doing so.  Sharon Stone is incredibly brilliant in her Oscar-nominated role as the woman who begins the whole catastrophe and is as beautiful as ever.  However, things between Ace, Ginger and Nicky spice up and lead to disasters and multiple murders.  \"Casino\" is one of the best Scorsese-De Niro movies.  The script by Nicholas Pileggi is as good as the one he wrote for \"Goodfellas\".  It's excellent.  Now enough said.  It's up to you to see it.",

I loved the Sid Vicious \"My Way\" at the end of Goodfellas, but Sam Rothstein bemoaning how Las Vegas has become a faceless Disneyland built on junk bonds is touching (\"now when a whale comes in with a suitcase packed with millions, some high school student wants to check his social security number...\"), especially when he takes off his shades at the end, and gazes sadly into space, reminiscing.",

Martin Scorsese really is the master of gangster movies, no doubt about it, yet the novelist Nicholas Pileggi deserves kudos too.  People say this movie tries to hard to be like Goodfellas and I think thats a terrible description.  The reason for this I think is that Joe Pesci's Nicky is too much the same character as his Tommy in Goodfellas.  If they had of put someone else in that role, possibly Benicio DelToro or an Edward Norton with an Italian makeover, then Casino would have gotten more individual praise.  To me, this film is on equal par with Goodfellas.  Well done again Scorsese & Pileggi.",

Although Stone and Pesci are impressive, De Niro once again steals the show for me. The scene when he drags Ginger out of the house is one of his best scenes to date. Pesci once again takes the roll as De Niro's best friend Psycho/Ladies man killer. He is excellent, although his performance in GoodFellas was his finest hour. Stone gives her best performance to date. You really hate the character, as Martin Scorsese intended. I do believe, that although it is similar to GoodFellas, it is different in its own way, as GoodFellas makes grit look glamorous, and Casino makes glamour look gritty. And so, I leave you with this.

Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are great. Sharon Stone outshines them all. She is the best actress ever to perform in a Scorsese movie. She beats Juliette Lewis in Cape Fear which was kind of a hard thing to do but Sharon made it look easy.

Many see Casino as simply a continuation of Goodfellas, after all it is set in the decades succeeding the events of Goodfellas. However, I feel Casino stands out as an equal to Goodfellas as a crime drama and in some ways, it fell it may be superior.Casino follows Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), a gambling handicapper, who takes control of the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Along with friend and mob boss Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), Sam ensures the money keeps rolling in and makes sure the bosses 'back home' get a little extra by 'skimming' from the casino's profits. As the years go by, Sam marries working girl Ginger (Sharon Stone), thinking that he can ensure her trust. However, money, drugs and betrayal ultimately get the better of them...I think what I really like about Casino is the destructive love triangle of Sam-Ginger-Nicky which dominates the second half of the movie. I think their is a greater sense of ambition and the individual than Goodfellas, which was mainly concerned with the family. I also sympathised more with Sam than Henry Hill, as Sam has to cope with Ginger, who is troubled by drugs, alcohol and former lover/pimp Lester (James Woods).Whilst it may be difficult to live up to Goodfellas, I think Casino does a pretty good job.",

Despite of this movie is been made 3 hours long the screenplay is captivating despite being slow.Acting in the movie is superb and Scorsese knows how to get best out of their actors and on the other hand the actors also never disappoints. Robert De Niro should be now considered as modern day legend and Sharon Stone in the character of Ginger was equally charming and effective, she is the perfect example of beauty with talent. Joe Pesci was also very effectively marvelous and did a fantastic job.Screenplay of the movie is as mentioned earlier is slow and despite of the length of the movie and slow screenplay the movie never looses it's grip and will keep you engaged throughout the movie.

            "content": "\"Casino\" is at its best when its essentially just a very stylish, masterfully done documentary on the history of Vegas and the back-room dealings with the mafia. The primary plot of the movie is good, but doesn't have the same kind of replay value and ultimately just above average.The film's dramatic story is good stuff, but what's important about \"Casino\" is the overarching information it reveals about Vegas, and the amazingly sleek and fun way it does so. Nearly 15 years after Casino, the story depicted in this movie has become essentially the official version of the history of Vegas. It's assumed that something more or less like what's depicted in the movie is what really happened in Vegas from the 1960s and 1970s. Most people don't want any more information - Scorsese's version of history is good enough. And why not? Some of the fine details are wrong, but Scorsese basically used a feature film to unveil to the public for the first time a generally accurate history of organized crime in Las Vegas. In many ways this is what Coppola did with the Godfather - no, every fact isn't true in either film, but both create a narrative, the general gist of which the public accepts as the story they want to believe about a certain chapter in the history of crime.The second reason \"Casino\" is so influential is purely stylistic. This movie is chock full of very indulgent, flashy scenes with very overt camera work, heavy narration, catchy music, busy scenes with dozens of characters at times, and generally a style that is very forceful and exciting. This sort of style seems to have become a mainstay of Hollywood films that were big-budget and looking for box office returns, but also wanted some respect from the critics. Some of the major films that fit that description over the next few years - Boogie Nights and Ocean's 11 pop to mind - hang their hat on scenes directed very much in the lavish, showy way Scorsese does so well in Casino.Altogether, \"Casino\" stops just short of delivering on the promise of its stellar first hour. Perhaps Scorsese wanted to avoid reusing too many of the devices he used to wrap up \"Goodfellas\", but unfortunately, with Scorcese putting away the cinematic fireworks after intermission, I think people remember all of the excitement of the first half, and the second half is just a blur of the stars gradually heading downhill in the predictable ways. Still, with a first half like that, the full film can't help but be a classic, if an uneven one.",

            "content": "I find it strange how few people mentioned love and marriage when writing about this movie. I think mixing these two with criminals running the business is a combination which makes Casino what it is - a movie with unbelievably smoothly told story which covers many aspects of running the business but personal life as well. That is important since it's not sheer incompetence which brought this guys down; it's lust and dishonest in their personal sphere, especially Sam's unhappy marriage. That's why this is the very first line in the movie: \"When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.\" That, and other few lines, immediately set the tone and give us the key for proper understanding of the movie.On to the acting. De Niro performing Ace has now become my favorite performance. He's totally convincing in distancing himself from mob guys and positioning as someone how knows the \"know-how\". He isn't a street gangster but a handicapper given a casino to run. That's also important because Casino is, in contrast to Goodfellas, a movie about guys higher in mafia hierarchy. It's sad to see De Niro now starring in movies \"Dirty Grandpa\" alike. Joe Pesci in funny and intimidating, almost psychotic. Sharon Stone really did deliver once in a lifetime execution. Accompanied with other great cast members, Casino feels and runs like a quasi-documentary; it's convincing and realistic.To make it short, Scorsese managed to re-tell a multiply layered story based on actual events and give a good insight on how Las Vegas works. I'd recommend you to check out real characters and actual events after you see the movie to broaden your scope and realize with what commitment to details was Casino made.",

Robert De Niro is a great actor, but he was wrong for this movie. For one, he doesn't even bear a slight resemblance to the real Ace Rothstein. He is just sleepwalking through the entire movie, and his cigarettes seem to be more animated than he is. Sharon Stone is good in her role, but she is just so unlikable that you don't feel any sympathy for her. Same for Joe Pesci. He has none of the humor that he brought to his role in \"Goodfellas\", where he played another mob psycho.That is why I hate this movie, because all three lead actors are so unlikable that you don't care what happens to any of them. Only the supporting cast, led by Don Rickles and Alan King breathe any life into this movie. James Woods is great in his limited role as well. Funny how you sympathize more with his scumbag role than you do with the other three. Woods could have been the lead in this movie. It just goes on FOREVER, and there are long stretches where you feel like nothing happens. A great cure for insomnia.This was the last Scorsese/De Niro film, but hopefully not the last.

Sharon Stone was good too,was really beautiful though she looked like a stoned whore most of the time.Too much of vulgarity coming out from her mouth didn't look appeasing.

            "content": "Casino is often regarded as a second-rate Goodfellas. It's seen as a bloated sequel to Scorsese's gangster masterpiece. But personally, I think it's just as good as its predecessor. It's an amazing film.However, I can kind of see where people are coming from when they criticise it. Yes, it's excessively violent. Yes, it's bloated. Yes, Pesci plays a character similar to the one he played in Goodfellas. And looking at individual scenes you can make comparisons between the two films: Sam (De Niro) falling for Ginger (Stone) is remarkably similar to the scene where Henry Hill falls in love with Karen after she screams at him at the cab stand, Nicky (Pesci) beating a man with a pen can be linked back to Tommy beating Billy Batts, and the final half an hour where Sam is battling with his wife is filmed in the same frenzy as the day of Henry Hill's arrest. But rather than hurt the film, the familiarity works in its favour. After all, the films both deal with the same world. Therefore, if you've seen Goodfellas, you can plug straight into Casino. But while Goodfellas was about the street level Mafioso, Casino goes one step higher. It's about a more powerful branch of the Mafia. And because the film is dealing with Las Vegas, a city that is loud, brash and devoted entirely to money, it's appropriate that the film is bloated and over the top. Vegas is no place for restraint.The film starts with Sam being blown up. Then the titles kick in and Sam spirals through a neon hell. But rather than see Las Vegas as an ugly, unnatural city, the city is described as paradise on Earth. And really for someone that loves money, someone that is devoted entirely to the accumulation of wealth, it is indeed paradise. And there's a fantastic shot at the beginning where you see Vegas at night through the clouds. As far as Sam's concerned he's looking down on an Earthly heaven. In this place anything is possible. And continuing the operatic theme of the film, the gangsters in Chicago, the guys who have entrusted Sam with the Tangiers casino, are described as gods \u0096 and with the way the sequence is filmed they could be looking down from Mount Olympus.But although the film starts as a dream it eventually becomes a nightmare. And of course, money, sex and drugs are the corrupting influences. But as grim and violent as the film is, it's also very funny. I mean, Pesci as Nicky, whether intended or not, is a laugh riot. I could just listen to the helium-powered Lilliputian actor rant and rave all day. One of my favourite scenes has to be when he confronts Sam in the desert. It's beautifully built up as a dangerous showdown \u0096 Sam looks for holes in the desert and then Nicky drives through the dust (there's a wonderful shot of Nicky's dust trail reflected in Sam's sunglasses) \u0096 but once Pesci begins mouthing off, I can only smile. \"You Jew mother******, you!\" Another great Pesci scene is when he puts someone's head in a vice. Again the content is less than savoury, and Pesci is entirely convincing as a psychopath (\"Don't make me be a bad guy,\" he says with a wonderful sense of the absurd), but Pesci's screaming fills me with joy. \"Charlie M? You made me pop your f****** eye out of your head to protect that piece of s***? Charlie M? You dumb mother******!\" And then there's the scene where Nicky is talking to some showgirl. He's talking about food (pounding pink veal, no less) and then once he's led her into his car, he applies pressure to back of the woman's cranium and lies back in the time-honoured way that men do when they receive blow-jobs in movies (there's a similar moment later with Pesci and Stone, which also has me laughing, such is the way the scene begins with the characters bitching about Sam and then descends into rampant horniness). But Pesci has even more great moments: the bit where he insults the dealer, the way he intimidates a banker, the stabbing with a pen and the line \"Peek-a-boo, you f***s, you\". Oh, and there's also the bit where he murders one of the casino's business partners. What I love about the scene is the way that Pesci laughs as he narrates the killing \"\u0085the boys decided to settle out of court.\" It really shouldn't be funny, it shouldn't amuse you to see someone treat life so casually, but that's one of the strengths of the film: the way it refuses to take a moral stance; Pesci's character gets a kick out of the killing, so that's the way it's portrayed.But of course, a scene that isn't funny is Nicky's killing. Although having said that, I do get a chuckle out of the way that Nicky's narration is interrupted when Frank Vincent hits him. But the beating is incredibly brutal and actually does something rather extraordinary and makes you feel a small measure of sympathy for Pesci's character, especially when he's imploring his friends to stop beating his brother.And it's also quite extraordinary that the film makes you feel a little something for Ginger (Stone is excellent). After all, by the end she's a completely repugnant character \u0096 she even does coke in front of her daughter. But rather than being just a bad person, she's portrayed as someone who has been messed up by Las Vegas and her relationships. Therefore, although it's easy to hate her actions, it's harder to hate her as a person.And it's the relationship between Sam and Ginger that gives the film its heart. Sure Pesci's antics are the most entertaining, but buried beneath the violence and the squeaky cursing, you have a perverse love story, and a very affecting one at that.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone. Now there's a group of people with which to make a movie. Casino takes place in Las Vegas in the 70s. Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro) is sent to Vegas by the mob to run a casino for them. After a while they also send Nicky Santoro (Pesci) to keep the wheels running and to act as muscle for Rothstein. Unfortunately, these two have very different ideas on how things should be run. Ace would like nothing more than to run his casino, pay his \"honest\" dues to the mob and to just sit back and relax. Whereas Nicky wants to climb all the way to the top, no matter how many bodies he has to leave on his wake.This movie is often compared to Goodfellas, Scorsese's previous masterpiece. And I can definitely see why. We have the mob, gangsters a plenty, rags to riches themes, and even two of the same actors, although Pesci is deservedly in a much bigger role this time around.And yet Goodfellas it ain't. It's plenty good on its own merits, but it lacks that degree of identifiability a proper old time gangster film has. The 70s and Las Vegas muddle up the story, make it seem that much dirtier. Drugs flow freely, no one can be trusted and none of the main characters is at all likable. Which is most definitely the point, but it is also the reason why I prefer Goodfellas. A much better comparison mood-wise would be Scarface, although that takes an even harsher stance on the viability of the gangster lifestyle. Whereas this movie is kind of half-n-half.Still, a good movie by any measure. Well worth a watch for all fans of the gangster genre.",

However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10 You Don't Stay At The Top Forever...",

            "content": "Casino is the meaner, sleazier, louder, more aggressive, and more bloated younger brother to Goodfellas.It'd been a while since I'd seen Casino and wanted to give it another shot. I still feel, to some extent, it's the only Scorsese movie that feels a little too similar to a film that came before, in that it really does play out like Las Vegas Goodfellas at times.That's not a terrible thing though. Scorsese might be my favourite filmmaker and Goodfellas would crack my top 5 of all time, but I think Goodfellas tells its story better and feels more original, having been released first. I also feel like the characters are more human in Goodfellas. Even though the sympathetic characters do terrible things, there are still characters with sympathetic qualities, whereas everyone in Casino feels like a violent monster, and it's a big ask of the viewer to spend three hours with this many bad people.That might sound blasphemous, and I don't take any pleasure liking Casino less than most Scorsese fans. It's just how I feel.But all that negativity aside, it's Scorsese more or less firing on all cylinders, so there's still so much to like here. The one thing it does that's distinctive (compared to Goodfellas) is capture the look and feel of its setting beautifully. Is Goodfellas set in LA or New York? I always forget; the setting doesn't feel so important. But Casino is unmistakably Las Vegas-set.Pesci and De Niro do their thing fantastically. Sharon Stone is great but unfortunately most of the movie, her character's a bit one note. She's fantastic in her early scenes, before she marries De Niro's character and spirals into drug addiction, so I think it's the script's fault for simplifying her character.Oh well. Lots of quotable lines and good visuals abound at least, plus a typically rocking soundtrack. It's a good movie, but still not nearly one of my favourites from Scorsese, I'm sorry to say.",

            "content": "Simply one of the best gangster films out there with an excellent \"true\" story yet strangely underrated. Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more. I think most of the reason Goodfellas is rated higher is because it came out first and some people see Casino as a rehash. I do not care about that myself, they're both great films.I've seen this film over a dozen times and it still has yet to get old. It's filmed beautifully and the music seems to fit the time periods and helps to establish the overall environment of it all, as it should. DeNiro and Pesci were conceived by God himself to play their parts in films like these and are always a joy to watch. Sharon Stone as Ginger is a definite standout. I honestly didn't know she could act until she was in this movie. She portrays the drug addicted ex-call girl turned wife of Sam Rothstein, the mob friendly casino boss. The film is quite violent and some denounce it for being gratuitous as if the mob goes by the same standard. It's just a movie and if you enjoy watching films in the same genre, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The language is also fairly harsh, mostly from Nicky (Pesci), but it helps give it a gangster feel. Plus, it doesn't help that there's so much voice over in the film, which is were a lot of the profanity comes from. That's just how mob guys talk, come on now. Didn't you know? All of the wise guys that I know do the same. Even though many consider voice overs a cop-out in filmmaking, I honestly can't imagine the movie any other way. It definitely works and at least it's not Ray Liotta's voice.As previously mentioned, the cinematography is beautiful, all that panning and sweeping...love it, and it works. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence in which the operations of the casino are explained.......also the intro to the meeting in the desert where the camera focuses on Sam's sunglasses as Nicky drives madly across in the reflection, stirring up a storm of sand. Simple, but great. Even more interesting are the true parts of the story. I did some research and the film does mix and match some things around, but for the most part it is true. In actuality, the true story was much crazier and it involved the skimming of four casinos, not just one, one of which was the Stardust....all were ran by the real Sam Rothstein, Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal. And yes, the character that is supposed to be Nicky (Tony \"The Ant\") really did do what he did in the movie with a vise. The fact that it's based on a true story does make it a little more enjoyable to me, especially since it's pretty damn close.What it all boils down to is one of my favorite films that I've seen, and one of the best mob movies ever...just like Goodfellas. I think most just don't give it a fair chance. Had Casino been released first, I think it very well could replace GF in the Top 250. Some will hate me for saying this, but when it comes to this category of films, Casino is only second to the Godfather films. Now watch my body turn up in a cornfield.",

I have seen close to 500 movies in my day - everything from DC Cab to Fast Break to A Bronx Tale - and Casino is without a shadow of a doubt the best I have ever watched.  DeNiro is sublime, Stone gives the best performance of her career, and Pesci is at his obnoxious, menacing best. The costumes, the score, the dialogue.  My brother and I can have whole conversations with each other talking only in quotes from the flick: (\"Mr. Clark I don't think you understand what it is I do.  ...  About the time I'm coming out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.  And I'll bust your head wide open again.

Then I saw Casino during my sophomore year in college, and, for me, nothing has come close cinematically.  If you loved the gore of The Untouchables, then this is for you.  If you loved the tragedy of Carlito's Way, then Casino is for you.  If you loved the authenbticity of Donnie Brasco then this flick is for.  Hell, if you loved the warped, anal retentive Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, then Sam Rothstein will blow you away.  Whatever you want in a movie, you got it here - with the notable exception of minority actors, save a few Japanese \"whales\" inserted only for storytelling purposes.

            "content": "I love Bob DeNiro and Joe Pesci. And I think in the right hands Sharon Stone can do a great job. But in this film, the best thing was seeing DeNiro in a brilliant new suit each time he appeared on screen. Here are my issues with the movie: *The background soundtrack, all popular songs, almost always drowned out the dialog. I find that after watching a lot of movies, if the director doesn't feel 1) that we're going to get the message and/or 2) that there are some concerns over whether the scene is working or not, the quick fix seems to be, \"Pump up the jam!\" This is a terrible mistake. It makes it difficult to understand what's being said and the audience starts to lose what might be important information. This was a consistent problem throughout the film. *As the movie went on, Joe Pesci slowly rose to the position of God. There's a scene where he yanks a phone off the wall and smashes it into Don Rickles, who works at DeNiro's casino as some kind of ancient security guard/yes-man. The point is... he works at the hotel and no one, not a single person, came to his defense. Joe, as Nicky, was allowed to slap, kick, sucker-punch anyone he goddamn wanted to without the least bit of concern as to whether there would be any repercussions. *DeNiro signs a paper (at least the film makes it look that way) giving the contents of a money-filled safety box to Sharon Stone (who plays his wife, former prostitute, Ginger). Okay, that's his business. But, late in the movie, after she's gone on her inexplicable drug/alcohol binges, has tied up her daughter (Really? So she could have a night on the town?), and had an affair with Nicky (like she would!!!), she literally breaks into DeNiro's desk, as a police escort stands nearby, gets the key to the safety deposit box (because... somehow Bob got it back from her, even though he signed over the contents to her so that she would \"never have to worry\" if they broke up?), then goes to the bank to get her money (it's hers, Bob signed it over to her!) and then Bob is screaming into the phone, \"She can't do that. She can't legally do that\" ... and yet... he signed it over to her? So, in fact, she CAN do that. *Marty would like us to believe that Joe returned home every morning, no matter what, to make breakfast for his darling little boy. You've got to be joking. While his wife did what? This man was an inconsiderate pig who thought women were mouths to put on his nether regions. Was this scene put in to show his \"sensitive\" side? He was a pig! So what that he made breakfast for his kid?! Did he ever think of what kind of role model he was to that child?... Yeah, I didn't think so. *When Bob and Joe would argue, despite the fact that a lot of the dialog was funny, smart, smack-in-the-face kind of dialog, people don't talk like that. In other words, there was ALMOST no reaction time in between lines. You'd HAVE to know what the other person was saying to respond that quickly! I didn't buy it, although I enjoyed the exchanges. *As others have pointed out, when Bob is screaming and yelling at people, he's kinda fun. But when he does this pathetically lame speech about what \"love\" is (no wonder Sharon Stone felt queasy about getting involved with him), all I could think is: This freak is a loser and he'd be better off buying \"love\" for the rest of his life. Sharon as Ginger tells him quite frankly that she doesn't \"feel that way\" about him. But Bobby won't take no as an answer... and, boy, does he pay for that. * The overuse of the F word and every variant associated with. Why, Marty? It got so irritating and tiresome that it lost whatever impact they thought it was going to have. *The voice-overs!!! Please, no! I was willing to buy one (Bob's), but then Joe chimes in, too, and then later, Frank Vincent, one of the many henchmen, chimes in, too! As others have said, this is lazy storytelling, there are things these people could NOT have known, and forced me to think, \"Okay, whose story is this? Am I rooting for anyone? Or is anyone who happens to be sitting in the studio when Marty wants a voice-over forced to get up and start jawing?\" I found it be intrusive, abusive and a coward's way out of telling a story. *The level of violence was gag-inducing, covered with the loud soundtrack I mentioned before. If you like seeing people shot in the head, if you like seeing both men and women violently killed, if you like seeing Cosa Nostra type murders up close, including seeing Joe Pesci's character beaten to a pulp and buried alive, then you will be sure to have a good old time. IF there was a story, it was about pathetic, stupid, sad, self-involved people whose only interest was money and squashing anyone else, and children, if there were any, bore the brunt of collateral damage. Sharon Stone snorting coke in front of her child! With her pimp berating the child! On the verge of harming the child! Yeah, yeah, I know; \"harsh reality\" torn from the pages of real life. So, if this is the sad mess of people's lives that you want to wade through... and three hours of it... have at it. IF Marty had actually done a bit more character development and not have essentially 1-2 note performances by every person in the film, then it could have been great. Right now, the best thing about it were Bob's suits.",

It's almost like director Martin Scorsese keeps wanting to make \"non-poetic\" gangster movies as a rebuke to the Godfather. perhaps not. But his gangster movies are always \"realer\". And less likable. All the more reason as to why I enjoyed this movie very much.Dinero as usual gives and outstanding performance. As do Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone and James Woods. Don Rickles steals the movie. There is great tragedy on this comic's face. The Voice Over narration works well in this movie and I was interested in it all the way through. The songs also kept me interested. Where do they get all of these old songs? it was really great. The editing and pacing kept it moving very fast, but not so fast that you couldn't easily follow the story line.It's violent, sou you would want to warn any youngsters before you watch it with them.",

            "content": "this is a rare gem of a film which is based on the true story of Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal and Anthony \"The Ant\" Splitoro renamed Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro for the film.Playing Sam Rothstein is none other than Robert De Niro, supported by Sharon Stone as Ginger Rothstein, Sam's wife, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, Sam's friend. There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?! De Niro really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is to women. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board this is arguably one of De Niro's finest performances This is also Sharon Stone's best performances, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with a certain horror Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nom But im afraid the real show stealer here is Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing and hilarious, yet disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker he should have won the Oscar that year without a doubt his best performance.The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything the viewer without making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.Overall, this is one of my favorite films of all time and definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film, valuing it has one of the ten best movies ever made.",

            "content": "Easily surpasses Godfather and Goodfellas. The story is written very carefully and presented beautifully, with perfect narratives and dialogue throughout the movie.The characters are quite complex and display much depth, played by actors that live and breathe for these roles. Robert De Niro couldn't have been better; even though he plays similar characters in flawlessly in many other movies, this one hit the jackpot. Sharon Stone's performance is exceptional, especially during the end of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if she really was on drugs just for the movie. Joe Pesci hits the same note as De Niro -the highest one. Like De Niro, he plays similar characters in other movies, but in this movie it fits in with the other characters and the story so obviously, it wouldn't have been the same without him, nor his character. Like all other mafia-type movies De Niro and Pesci have been in, their characters, in contrast, portray a wide spectrum of opposite attitude, feelings, and motivation that is simply entertaining to watch.In a style parallel to \"Goodfellas\" that's become the signature of Martin Scorsese, this movie might seem like just a repetitive sequel set in Las Vegas. But don't be fooled, this film is as underrated as Titanic is/was overrated, whether you judge by popularity, box office gross, or critics' ratings (or even IMDb's present user rating). Casino is a masterpiece and will not disappoint keen viewers.",

            "review_title": "Perhaps The Best Gangster Film I've Seen",
            "content": "Just to give a bit of background, I thought I'd start by explaining what it actually takes for me to score a film 10/10, because at this point the top score on here has lost a lot of it's significance. Not that this is a serious issue obviously, but I thought I should open by stating exactly how good I think a film should be in order for it to justify a rating like that, and hopefully in doing so the point will be put across as to how highly I rate this film.For me, a 10/10 film is a film whereby not only each and every facet of is at least of a very high standard, but one that is so good that there is literally no single aspect of it that stands out as being even marginally weak, whether that be the acting performance of a character, a particular scene/section of the film, the dialogue or any other aspect that could be picked up on. Right from the off, the film must set a standard and a tone and keep on that course so as to at least remain within the same bracket of quality, whilst also excelling in every possible aspect along the way. Any deviation from this path represents an imperfection in terms of the way the film is balanced, and as such will prevent a perfect 10/10 score from being given.Given this criteria, take The Godfather as an example: a timeless masterpiece that is rightfully held up as one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is sublime, the plot is compelling and the characters are all well fashioned. Despite these strengths however, Michael's development at the start is not handled with the same precision and quality as the rest of the film in my opinion. It stands out as being more rushed and less carefully crafted when measured against the rest of the film, and I felt the opening stages were in need of a couple more scenes to bridge the early phases of the transformation with what followed. This stood out for me in context of the quality of the rest of the film, and I would therefore deduct half a point on that basis. The difference in quality here is enough for me to call it a sizable imperfection in a relative sense.Another example to use is Once Upon A Time In America, which is sometimes labelled 'the best gangster movie ever made', with people highlighting the exceptional plot and the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morrocone. These are, of course, valid points - the music is amongst some of the finest ever made for film, and the plot is as absorbing as it is complex. That being said, the acting is considerably lower across the board than in other classics in similar genres (Goodfellas, Godfather I and II, City of God, etc), and the score is often applied over-indulgently: the melodies of Deborah's theme and the main theme for example are destroyed by the end of the film, and scenes are sometimes made to seem exaggerated and jarring as a result. On top of that, there are occasions whereby these beautiful melodies are highly inappropriate, with one particular rendition actually making me laugh loud because of how bizarre it was (hint: the Cleopatra part of the film, after the...incident...in the car).For those reasons, despite it's strengths, that film is an 8/8/5 for me. Very good, but there are too many imperfections and imbalances.Anyway, I give that brief analysis of those two up there in order to illustrate my view that there are no literally no such relative imperfections and imbalances to point out with Casino. The film starts off well paced and sharp, and from the very offset it maintains an extremely high standard of acting, storytelling and pacing throughout.Even nitpicking, I cannot think of a single weakness, and on top of that the strengths are seriously strong. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, as usual, are fantastic in their roles, and I honestly can't remember ever seeing anyone play a character like Sharon Stone plays in this so well. For all the right reasons, she made me feel hateful, angry and unpleasant. I cowered and cringed because of how well it was acted, and I spent most of the time watching her thinking about how much I wanted her character to meet a horrible, yet just ending.Seriously... this film is a must-watch. There are a lot of unfair, unfavourable comparisons to Goodfellas in here, but I honestly think this is better. Does Goodfellas keep up the same standard of plot like this does throughout? I don't think so personally - the closing scenes are slower and weaker, where as Casino maintains an extremely high level, delivering accordingly right at the end. The ending is satisfying (for whatever reason - no spoilers here), and the tension that has been built up throughout is sufficiently capitalised on. Goodfellas, on the other hand, more peters out by comparison.That is obviously is not to criticise Goodfellas - as a film that's about as close to 10 as you can get without it being 10 in my opinion. It's just that Casino is better paced, more consistent and more complex and nuanced in its plot. As well as this, it gains from the greater emphasis on De Niro and Pesci, who both play superior, more fleshed out characters in this. The combination of these two and Sharon Stone in conjunction with this plot makes for an absolute masterpiece, and I highly recommend this film to anyone with even a passing interest in film and Scorsese. I was in awe of it throughout and think that, alongside Raging Bull, it's probably the most underrated film I've come across so far on IMDb.",

Directed by Scorsese, starring De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone in a stand out performance The true story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro), a shrewd, Mafia-connected casino operator, whose assured, mannered existence is undone by his devotion to his flighty wife, Ginger and his boyhood friend Nicky (Pesci), a wild card who fancies his chances on Ace's patch. De Niro and Pesci narrate the extended opening, detailing the mechanics of skimming money from the casino to pass onto the bosses back home. This sequence ends with the glorious introduction of Sharon Stone's showgirl hustler Ginger, all fur, jewels and blonde ambition, who casts gambling chips into the air. On a security monitor, De Niro watches her exuberant transgression, and falls in love. So begins his downfall, and the end of Mob rule in Vegas. Where Goodfellas explored the allure of being a Brooklyn wise guy, with a hair-trigger comic sensibility, Casino emphasises the remorseless fear and grind of a mobster's life, all its attraction purged in two horrifically violent set-pieces. One, a torture scene with a vice, has been rightly condemned as gratuitous - but it is the closing beating that truly disturbs, two men brutally disfigured by repeated whacks with metallic bats that, as they are tipped into the grave, their featureless faces frozen in a contorted howl, it's almost as if a new species has emerged from the violence, only to be suddenly, cruelly, aborted. There is no romanticism in this view of the mafia. Scorsese making a gangster film with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro raised no eyebrows, and led some critics to accuse him of hitting a rut. All the same, with its ferocity and maturity, particularly in the responsibilities weighing upon the wise guys, Casino can be seen a closing chapter in the evolution of a gangster community, from its street heyday in Mean Streets to its adjustment to the new drug trade in Goodfellas to its final giving way to the power of the corporations in the Eighties. Verdict The closing chapter in Scorsese's American Crime trilogy, Casino is superbly acted and quite astonishingly obsessive about detail, money, and the mob's decline.",

I also like to start reviews of positively so I will say that I loved the world that was set up in this film, the whole mobster world hidden behind the guise of casinos in Las Vegas was a very entertaining aspect to this movie. Robert DeNiro is really good in this film I loved the scenes he had with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone he was very imposing and did a great job in this film. Joe Pesci was good but it definitely felt like we've seen things like this from him before. But by far the best performance in this movie was Sharon Stone she was amazing in this movie she was perfect at conveying a damaged and sick woman with no way out and her break down scenes are just amazing to watch. This movie is extremely violent but I loved that about this movie, the violence was effective it showed the brutality of this system and made it feel all the more realistic. However I think this movie has some very big flaws that people has ignored. For one the first 30-45 minutes of this movie are nothing but exposition through narration your given all the inner workings of this world and everyone in it but it just doesn't work because it's given to you all at once and your struggling to catch up and should have been given slower and more gradually across the movie. Another massive issue that has been addressed with this movie is how many similarities it has to Goodfellas but it never comes close to matching that films greatness. Since its structured and layed out so similarly to Goodfellas the film feels like it has the massive hole in it, since the characters that DeNiro and Pesci are playing in this film are so similar to their characters in that movie you feel as if there should be another character in it to fill the place of a Henry Hill but there isn't and the film never recovers from that. This film is also very long and makes for a lot of moments to drag on and I wasn't really satisfied with how they wrapped up Sharon Stones character arc. Casino is a flawed movie it's got some really good performances, it's very well directed and has a great world to it, but the simple fact is that we've seen movies like this from Scorsese before and it's has far to much narration given out over to long a time. Though it's far from Scorsese best it's still a solid film. B-/71%",

But last night I sat through the first two hours, and although I wasn't bored, I was reviewing what I had seen in my mind, and frankly it didn't add up to much, really.  It was almost the same rags-to-whacking-people-to-riches-to-whacking-each-other-to-rags story of Goodfellas, without the sense of humour.More seriously, for Scorsese as a filmmaker, was the absence of any real involvement in the relationships between the characters.  Why Ace and Nicky are best friends is never really explored - all we really see between them is animosity.  Sharon Stone is a beautiful woman, but I was hoping to see something more to indicate exactly why it was Rothstein fell in love with Ginger, other than him telling us so.  The line about trust at the very start of the film is important, but never really seems to be followed up, as it is clear that not only did Rothstein not trust his wife from day one, he was never given the remotest reason to.  Ginger's obsession with riches and jewellry is demonstrated, but never explored, other than perhaps to indicate that she had no taste in jewellry!I could see absolutely no reason for this movie to be as long as it was, except that it included a lot of scenes that, made by a different director, would have ended up on the cutting room floor.  The whole sequence about the bosses getting annoyed about being skimmed from their skim, to the KC operator moaning about his expenses, to his mouthing off to his parents in the Kansas store, was an utter waste of time (and the faux-reality acting of the mother complaining about his swearing, was a major change in style which only served to jerk you out of the movie you were watching.)Scorsese made his name by handling different films with different styles, but still making them inimitably his own: Mean Streets is different from Taxi Driver, is different from Raging Bull, is different from The Color Of Money, is different from Goodfellas.  Not many directors have sustained such diversity and originality over 20 years.  But Casino lacks the originality of its predecessors, and it lacks the emotional heart which is essential to any good film.",

Ace Rothstein - played by Robert DeNiro, a Scorsese regular - is probably the perfect model of what every aspiring gentleman wishes to one day become. The gorgeous Sharon Stone's performance is probably the best in her career as Ginger, but it is really Joe Pesci who shines most in this film.

The way Scorsese brings you into the world of the casino and shows you the then-criminal element of its inner workings will give every viewer that curious yearning to participate in the dangers and defiance that all great crime movies instill.

Also, Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars and called it the 5th best movie of 1995.I can totally understand this movie getting a 9 or 10, especially if seen on TV, but as it is, the language is overdone and bothersome after a couple hours.In short, it is a good movie , but not for those offended to language.",

            "content": "Casino isn't as amazing as Goodfellas, but is still a cinematic masterpiece by Martin Scorsese.Casino tells the story of Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) that is given the task to run a Casino. Things are going great until trouble happens from his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci), as he wants to do what he wants, and his wife Ginger (Sharon Stone), as she wants to get her hands on a lot of money. Sam's success slowly falls down and politicians soon put him in increasing danger.Casino may be 3 hours long, but it kept me entertained for that long. The acting from the three main cast members are excellent. De Niro does a bang up job, Pesci does a hilarious job, and Stone does a wonderful job. James Woods and Don Rickles also do great jobs playing their characters. The story was also very great and understandable, and ran in a pretty smooth pace for 3 hours.All in all, Casino is a magnificent masterpiece from Scorsese that holds up nearly 25 years later.",

            "review_title": "Fascinating movie yet a bit too long",
            "content": "So I have to admit Martin Scorcese hasn't disappointed me yet. After having seen Taxi driver, Raging Bull(two of my favourites) and Goodfellas, I began to watch Casino expecting to be disappointed(because it can't surely be as good as the three I mentioned!). But it is quite impressive. The basic plot line is about a man named Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein(Robert de niro) who is put in charge of managing a profitable casino, one of the biggest in Las Vegas.Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci) is sent along with him to Las Vegas in order to protect him. Sharon Stone also stars as a woman named Ginger whom Sam later marries. The movie first details the intricacies of the casino business and the fake unlikeable nature of the people there. It then details the fall of Ace Rothstein and his buddies. I was quite surprised with the detailed description of the casino business. This is something that I had not expected(I had expected a straight forward gangster story and instead I get a fascinating portrayal of the casino business. I was enthralled by the working of the casinos(maybe sometime I have to travel to Las Vegas!). Any person interested in the gambling business and the crime network in US should watch this movie. It is interesting to watch the way these casino owners \"skim the top of the profits\" and masquerade it under the legitimate business banner. Another aspect that I liked about this movie is the totally unlikeable characters. Only Raging Bull(of scorcese movies) has this kind of a unlikeability and most people are likely to be turned off by that. I do agree it has shades of Goodfellas but I don't agree that it imitates that movie. There are many differences in the characters themselves. For example, the character of Nicky Santoro is quite different from Tommy of Goodfellas. Nicky is a cold, calculated person who doesn't mind doing the dirty work. But he isn't exactly egoistic or impulsive. He is mostly level headed. Sure he resorts to violence in the same way as Tommy but Tommy had different motives. Nicky is quite clever and not impulsive. The performances are quite noteworthy. I was most impressed by Sharon stone's portrayal of the gold digger Ginger. It was a multifaceted performance that showed the different sides to Ginger in this movie(It is weird we don't see much of Sharon stone nowadays, she had so much promise). Ginger is not just greedy, she has a sensitive side, she has weaknesses, she is just human. She is not portrayed as any worse than the rest of the cast. Most of the time we don't sympathize with the main characters because they are so unlikeable. Robert De Niro's performance as Sam Rothstein is quite good and he excels in the scenes where he is totally clueless and exasperated as to how to handle his wife. His contrast to the cool and calm type of character in the first half of the movie is noticeable and that adds to the excellence of his performance. Joe Pesci(he is fast becoming one of my favourite actors) is quite exceptional in this. The scene where he confronts Ace is an example. One of the things that may trouble viewers a bit is the complexity of the plot. There are many characters and incidents and sometimes people may not be able to keep track. But I loved the complexity aspect and it just reflects the amount of hard work put in by Martin scorcese and the crew. So what is the negative aspect? It might be the length. It is too long(even for a Scorcese epic) and it might be a bit too much for some people who are not used to such long movies. I don't mind long movies but I feel the length could have been shortened. But I don't understand which can be removed as almost all scenes are central to the character development. My rating 9/10(the length is somewhat of a problem)",

            "content": "When I first saw this movie on the big screen when it was first released, I was overwhelmed, and not in a pleasant way.  The only other Scorsese film I had seen in a theater was The Age of Innocence.  Casino simply had too much dirty words, blood n guts, insanity, strife, drugs, and messed-up stuff in general for me to enjoy on an initial screening at a movie theater.  The surreal lighting didn't help matters.  However, I recently watched it (on a much smaller screen) and liked it. Robert DeNiro's character, Ace Rothstein is likable, even though he could be a jerk.  He never once hit Sharon Stone's character, Ginger, unlike Joe Pesci's character, Nicky Santuro.SPOILER ALERT I guess what I liked about Ace is he never really changed, despite the fact that Ginger and Nicky agreed to the contrary just before one of their disgusting love-making marathons.  He really was a tight-wad even before becoming big in Vegas, and he knew Ginger and Nicky were slime right from the start.  He saw the good in Ginger, and that's what he was attracted to when he decided to marry her.  She wasn't just a call girl to him. Unfortunately for her, she must have not valued that good in herself enough to stay out of trouble and stay alive.  As for Nicky, when he first decided to come to Vegas he DID consult Ace.  Ace's gut was against it, but he decided to agree because he and Nicky were friends.  If Ace had trusted his instincts to begin with, he might not have gone through the same troubles he had.  In the end, we see that Ace goes back to doing what he did before he \"became big\", which helps prove he never really changed-  he just acted on his instincts in the environment he was in.  He made some big mistakes, to be sure.  But the beauty of it is, he didn't \"play the game\"-  he was himself.  And basically, that's what this movie is about-  an environent in a particular time.  Ace, who, besides being an excellent gambler, really has no outstanding qualities and is something of an everyman, chronicles what it was like to be in his position in a way that people can sympathize with.Ginger's demise is, to say the least, the most satisfying of the movie.  I found nothing about her character appealing, except for perhaps the first scene in which she appears.  From then on, she personifies fakeness, emptiness.  It's really sad that the one person she kept running back to was such a sleazebag (James Woods).Nicky's death was pretty tough to watch.  The setting in the corn rows is creepy and the images are very grotesque.    Sharon Stone and DeNiro are suberb in this movie.  The tension between them in certain scenes is incredible.  It seems like some of the scenes are improvised, they're so dead on.  Well-acted, well-directed, well-written, highly recommended.",

One thing i absolutely loved about this movie is the narrative style that the director employed in this film, it gives the viewer the capacity to meticulously understand and follow what is going on the movie and why certain people (Joe Pesci) are just the way they are. I must give kudos to Sharon Stone she was absolutely brilliant in this film. Robert DeNiro was and is mostly always absolutely brilliant in every movie he's in. But for me Joe Pesci stole this film he was absolutely hilarious. Don't get me wrong this movie was in no way comedic, but Joe somehow made you laugh the way he had absolutely no respect for anybody whatsoever, thanks to him i now know what a \"Sand Ni*ger\" is (ha ha ha)....",

It follows the career of a gambling expert used by the Mob to run the Tangiers Casino from 1973 to 1982.As the three-hour movie opens, we see \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) survive a car bombing. The film then jumps back to his earlier career as a sports gambling handicapper who makes a lot of money for his Chicago-based Mafia bosses. His childhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), is an enforcer the Mob sends to Las Vegas as protection for Ace.Ace falls in love with a former prostitute and casino hustler, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). She finally agrees to marry Ace, though she still has a strong loyalty to her former boyfriend, a gambling loser named Lester Diamond (James Woods). The film follows the gradual collapse of relationships among the three primary characters, the over-extension of Nicky's reach into the Las Vegas crime world, and the FBI's pursuit of Ace and Nicky. Unusual casting has four comedians in significant secondary non-comedy roles in the film--Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollak, and Dick Smothers.\"Casino\" is too long and too choppy for the first 45 minutes as Scorsese was trying to set up the characters and the Las Vegas setting. It was like whipping through the photos on your digital camera. After that, it settled down a bit, but the plot still wandered, leaving loose ends by its conclusion. Unfortunately, \"Casino\" was not as good as Scorsese's earlier Mafia film, \"Goodfellas.\"",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's Casino isn't the most well executed crime-drama classic, but it's exactly what Mafia fans want: a brilliantly performed, brutally violent and entertaining story of money, greed and power. Like most of Scorsese's old crime movies, you can expect heaps of rough language and very graphic violence. The film also features the masterful acting of Robert De Niro, Jo Pesci and Sharon Stone, in addition to amazing graphics and unforgettable effects.However, most will discover that although this classic is very entertaining, it's also not Scorsese's best work. There's just not such great emotions in it. But if you adore the old and classical Mafia movies, especially ones like The Godfather and Goodfellas, you cannot skip this one.Throughout the film, there's also remarkable soundtrack that, to be harshly sharp, is an impossible abomination to hate. It suits the settings, motion and brutality well, but is just true first-class music for the background.The film is too graphic for kids, but is a film that older teens will enjoy with their parents. Casino is a must-watch movie for big fans of director Martin Scorsese, or anyone who really enjoys his films, because this movie is really good. It's another great Mafia classic that again makes you realise that all of the really good gangster movies usually come from the 70s and 80s. There's no genius out their who can recreate the exact same feelings, quality and pace.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

A cash cow that ultimately ends up with the Mafia in Kansas City. Intertwined in the story is Sharon Stone as prostitute/substance misuser Ginger McKenna who marries Rothstein and whose gradual descent into marriage split/attempted kidnap of Rothstein's daughter is one strand of the collapse of the then successful casino operation. Other factors are the strict Las Vegas authorities that refuse at first Santaro and then Rofstein employment in the gambling industry.The downfall of the operation forms the backdrop to the end of the film and some pretty gruesome deaths even by my standards of film viewing! Scorsese delivers yet again. It may not quite live up to the standards of 1990s GoodFellas but certainly is still one of the best films of the decade.Scorsese 'viewers' will be aware that his films are quite long in duration but many plot points would be missed if they were edited. Stick with his films and don't lose your concentration is my advice.If I found one criticism it was the Joe Percy character Santoro who almost replicated his GoodFellas role as a pretty nasty mobster whose attitude was he would rather kill you with three bullets to the skull rather than one.I'm glad I watched and my Scorsese tour continues albeit with a few coffees to keep me going!",

This is a true story (with names and places changed) depicting the life of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein and his friend Nicky. Sam is a great gambler, and works his way through the years, eventually landing a job running a casino in Las Vegas. He watches for cheaters and uses his friend Nicky (a man in the Mafia) to get rid of problems using violence. The Mafia protects Sam in return for scamming money from the casino. When Nicky starts to get careless with his tactics (even getting kicked out of Vegas' casinos and put on the infamous blacklist) and Sam's wife gets hooked on drugs and is cheating, things start falling apart. The FBI comes after the Mafia hard, and the Mafia in return starts to come down on everyone. As the story goes on things fall apart more and more. Sam and Nicky stop being so close, and violence gets worse and worse. This was a well put together movie. Excellent acting, great directing, and an amazing story come together perfectly.Soundtrack: 8- Most of the time the music works for the movie, but there were a few moments where the music didn't fit in the film.Script: 10- The writer knew how to write mobsters well.

He convinces her to marry him and give up her job for the pimp.  He gives her a gift of millions of dollars worth in jewels.  What De Niro is not aware of, but becomes suspicious of, is that she is still secretely with the pimp with meetings and phone calls.  When they are caught at a restaurant, she msut plead for his life.\nPeci makes trouble in Vegas.  In one scene, he plays blackjack and throws vulgar remarks at the dealer while he throws the cards he recieves out.  In one scene they find a thief on the inside and spend days torturing him with with woodshop supplies untill they get names.  Eventually, Pesci works his way up to being band from Vegas completely.  The FBI eventually gets on to all of them.\nSharon continues to be the perfect little wife, snorting coc and drinking away.  They have a daughter together who gets the luxuries of witnessing all of this right before her.  Eventually, she breaks out to find Woods, bringing their daughter with her.  While they're there, they make cash and get a good share of coc.  Eventually, De Niro tracks them to get their daughter back.  Saron, high and more out of it then ever sleams back when she breaks away from Woods.  While running an eran, she did the thoughtful thing of simply tighing their daughter up on her bed and leaving.  Sharon continually threatens to leave and the yerns for the jewels so that she can get money and dump De Niro.\nRivalry starts up with De Niro and Pesci.  Pesci starts getting jobs on his own, still dodging the Feds who have gone as far as hring lip readers. Eventualy, Sharon finds her way into Pesci's arms and they have a short go for something.  Eventually, however, Sharon just schemes to get off cash and Pesci kicks the whore out.\nThis film is based on a true story, yet seeses to be realistic.  There's a scene when a man at a blackjack table is caught counting cards.  He is brought out into a back room and they breack his hand with a hammar.  One very cardinal rule in any organization with publicity.  Always appeal.  To take a mafia tactic like that on an ordinary civilian, would be desastorous for business.  People would be disgusted.  Thaty doesn't seem to bother the story, however.  Even though it should.\nPesci's sharacter couldn't be more exactly like his character Tommy from \"Goodfellas\".  Still cold blooded.  Still aggressive and unreasonable.  The most noble character in the film is De Niro.  I can't even get into how annoying Sharon Stone got, whether it was sincere or a good performance, it just got old, stupid, and aggravating.  Ya want De Niro to just simply draw his gun and blow her to bits, but he won't because after all thiss \"I love her.\"  This after she bardged into his house to get the key to the bank where she can collect her wealth.\nYes, the film is violent and gorey.  They should have spent much more time on that then all the other crap that is boring and annoying, not gripping. I'm glad to see that it didn't go on to any real success.  An osar nomination for Sharon and four stars from Roger Ebert who is simply in love with Scorsese.  That's all except for, I believe, a script nomination which I certainly don't appove of, other good review that may have come up, and, of course, the movie goers.  It's a shame so many of them likd this film. Plenty of other good or great mafia films out there.  \"Goodfellas\", \"Bugsy\", all three of \"The Godfathers\", and probably much more.  This is certainly a waste of time and it seems like a considerable deal of effort went into it. Too bad.",

The rise and fall of the mafia's strong-hold in Las Vegas is told brilliantly as if its the Holy Roman Empire. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci together again, what more do you need? Now I loved the voiceovers in GOODFELLAS because it kept a good pace going in the film. Same goes for CASINO, along with excellent cinematography and lighting. Some scenes may be a little too gory for some viewers, but I loved them, it really made the atmosphere more intense and raw. I've heard different responses to Sharon Stone's character, I thought she did a really good job, it's hard to get engrossed in a shallow, heartless role like Ginger. This definitely goes down as one of my all time favorites, a brilliant masterpiece by far. \"....And one by one the dominoes began to tumble....\"",

            "content": "Director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Oscar-winning actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci reunited for this three-hour epic tale of the rise, fall and resurrection of a casino proprietor.  Set in Las Vegas from 1973 to 1983, \"Casino\" tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro, in one of his most underdeveloped roles) who makes his mark as one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas.  He has money, notoriety, connections, everything...except that special woman.  Enter Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone in a knockout performance that earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination), a flashy, high-maintenance, money-driven cocaine hustler/prostitute who eventually becomes Mrs. Sam Rothstein.  Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is Sam's hotheaded friend who become a major player on the gambling scene himself, until greed and distrust bring their glittery (albeit volatile) decadence to a monumental halt.  With all of the film's star power and energy, it still just takes a long time to get where it's going (wherever that is).  Whether it was Scorsese's handling of this particular material, or Nicholas Pileggi's inability to adapt his own novel to the screen, \"Casino\" is just a few notches short of achieving real meaning and depth.  However, the film certainly deserved more nominations than it received (its only one being for Stone's characterization of Ginger): Pesci's explosive supporting role, Robert Richardson's vivid, colorful cinematography, John Dunn and Rita Ryack's costumes and Jack G. Taylor Jr. and Rick Simpson's Art Direction/Set Decoration all went unnoticed by the Academy.  Artistically, \"Casino\" is a visually sumptuous masterpiece.  Storywise, the movie fails to deliver in certain areas.  An uneven mixture, but it IS a handsome production.  *** out of ****.",

All the leads are magnificent; the writing sharp and funny; the direction confident and spellbinding in its aesthetic sensibility; the editing tight and witty; and the soundtrack, providing CONSTANT background atmosphere, is perfect. The whole thing looks beautiful, with a dazzling array of incredible interiors and costumes that perfectly capture the era, the story, and the characters inhabiting it.Epic in scale, as all Scorsese tends to be, the movie plays out like a Greek tragedy, with every character on a trajectory that only leads down into spectacular, violent, drug addled oblivion. Fascinating, riveting, inventive, gaudy, and funny \u0096 a success on every level and one of the greatest films of the 90s.NOTE: The head-in-vice scene is painful.

Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her. It's Scorsese's oldest tactic, which is to make you interested in awful people, and perhaps seeing the traits of them that are overlooked.

Based on the true story of Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro this was bound to be good and by geez it delivered. Voiceovers, constant background music and also constant swearing (423 f-bombs!) result to make a very powerful film that is very well acted and also is told brilliantly. Scorsese uses a method which he also used in Raging Bull where he begins from near the end. The first voice-over really gets you interested, as soon as Robert De Niro's character says this you know the film is going to be good: 'When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had'. This first line got me interested immediately and I am sure it will make most viewers want to watch for the whole three hour period. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci come together in a film for the third time and once again they click instantly, De Niro the successful guy who runs the casino, Pesci the man who stops anyone get in De Niro's way, it really is great stuff and you really start to believe that they are the characters and are not just acting. Sharon Stone showcased her talent like no one thought she could in this film and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and get you into the film with such ease it seems like you can't see or hear all the carnage that is going down on screen. Music plays a huge part in the film and in fact there are 61 different songs used in this film, most of them actually being proper songs that are not soundtrack songs. The one criticism for the film is that sometimes the music was on at unnecessary times and you could occasionally not hear as well as you might. To compare this to other Robert De Niro-Martin Scorsese films would (in my opinion) put it third on the list and this was certainly an amazing film. Comparing it to other gangster films is a bit different but I would still say it it up there with such masterpieces as The Godfather, if not possibly better.

They marry and he hopes to \"make\" him fall in love with her one day, because her true love is a pimp (played by James Wood). Needless to say the last hour or so of this movie is vicious as we see the FBI crackdown on all the schemes the mobsters were trying so hard to hide in the casinos.

Anyway, De Niro is at the top of his game again, this odds making genius a drastic departure from his Jimmy in \"Goodfellas\", who was a homicidal thief and nowhere near as brilliant as this figure who mastered the art of staying out of trouble, until his wife and best friend ruin it all.Nicky, the thug Pesci plays here (based on Tony \"the Ant\" Spilotro), is different from Tommy, which earned him an Oscar (and Mr. P gave a short and sweet, \"It's my privilege, thank you!\" speech, letting us see not all prize winning performers have to spend an eternity on stage, thanking the whole world!). Tommy was ashamed his brother testified against certain people you don't rat on if you want to live in Brooklyn much longer. That inspired the spark plug of \"Goodfellas\" to be the craziest, most vicious killer of the whole bunch. His role in \"Casino\" is slightly more subtle and for much different reasons. Tommy never would sleep with his friend's wife, like the Vegas bound troublemaker from Chicago that he plays here does.A very insidious kind of betrayal takes place with Ace's future wife, Ginger, Sharon Stone's relentless hustler. This woman lets us see the hollow shell her character really is. After taking all she can from anybody she can, this creature runs off to her scumbag pimp Lester, played by the great James Woods, giving him her money and love, not realizing or being lucid enough to care he's the ultimate parasite. Sam can brush off Lester easily. His protector from the windy city who comes to the desert and screws up what should have been their paradise is another matter.Pesci shows this wise guy Nicky is his own worst enemy and everything he touches turns to hell. Tommy would have kept a modicum of common sense and loyalty to his buddy, not wanting all that money, power and success to blow away like so much dust in the Nevada wind.",

            "content": "(70%) \"Goodfellas in Las Vegas\" holds up as one of the better crime movies of the 1990's. It's a movie of two halves with the first covering the operation as a whole with quite a lot of detail regarding the inner workings of their sleaze pit, and the second deals more with the downfall of each character. Sharon Stone plays one of the most hateful god-diggers ever, and Joe Pesci is more or less the same character he played in Goodfellas. The movie ends with other side of all that money, jewels, and luxury in a bitter tasting manner with a really quite brutal death scene highlighting the reality of greed and power and where it can lead. This is undoubtedly a good film, but Goodfellas is better, funnier, and overall stronger.",

He then glosses their inner-relationships with magical camera work, and a soundtrack which captures the essence, and emotion of the era. Although, essentially a mob-drama, this film is about the relationships of the main players, and their relationship with the mechanics of the mob. What people think about the mob is that they go around killing people indiscriminately. However, the intrinsic reason is the money, they want to continue seeing the kickbacks, the green. I think De Niro gives an honest portrayal of a Casino boss who just wants things to run smoothly; the casino, his marriage to Ginger, and most importantly the machinations of the mob.  He is outshone here though by both Stone and Pesci, who's captivating, repulsive characters, makes for a sympathetic viewpoint of De Niro's character. My only fault here is the ending, which in its entirety resolves the fates of the other characters, but with De Niro's it ends so matter-of-factly that it compromises the outcome of the film.A veritable feast of film. 9/10  7/10 if you don't like swearing.",

            "content": "It's amazing how some shows tend to glamorize my adopted hometown of Las Vegas...How everyone who lives here has tons of money and the best of all indulgences under a sunny sky and neon nights. Well, \"Casino\"  gives everyone a good primer on what NOT to do if you are a local. I particularly liked Rothstein's narrative on how everything is choreographed and coordinated to separate the happy tourists from their money. A little cynical, but otherwise very accurate and enlightening. Anyway, the movie is an entertaining look at the way life was out here, back in the 70's. A lot of the old-timers (some of whom knew the actual players on which \"Casino\" is based) tell me that they miss the good old days when the town was cleaner, less crowded and safer to live in. It gives a slight thrill to see the glamour and excitement, but never fails to remind us that there is a gritty and seamy side to the town. Then again, almost every American town has a \"City Confidential\" of its own. Even the real people that these characters are based on had a lot of just day-in, day out routine. Anyway...DeNiro did a great job portraying Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, even though Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal was not a particularly exciting person in real life. Joe Pesci played a very convincing Nicky Santoro, but a little more over the top than what Tony \"The Ant\" Spilotro was supposed to be like. Sharon Stone was even more compelling in her role as Ginger McKenna, because she was very accurate in her portrayal of Geri Rosenthal, Frank's beautiful but troubled wife. The timeline is a jazzed-up and high-compression version of Vegas from '73 to '83, thanks to Scorsese's action-packed touch and all-star soundtrack. I thought it was a crowning touch that most of the filming was done at the Riviera, as it is one of the classic \"old Vegas\" joints and definitely was in the same league as the Dunes and the Sands once upon a time. All in all, a great movie that tells a great story...Just remember that you have to remember that for once, fiction is a little more entertaining than truth.",

            "content": "I have always been fascinated by the Mafia underworld and I have admired Martin Scorsese's work since a young age. Scorsese has brought us several good gangland films, like Goodfellas in 1990 and The Departed in 2006. In between the two, he brought us Casino in 1995.Casino tells the story of Frank Rosenthal (Portayed by Robert De Niro under the name \"Sam Rothstein\") and Anthony Spilotro (Portrayed by Joe Pesci under the name of \"Nicky Santoro). The film's subject is the 1970s casino skimming the mid-western Mafia families built an empire on. The movie is basically about two hoods from Chicago who get to the top of the world, only to be dragged back to the ground.The film is a first person narrative, much like Goodfellas. It is told from Nicky Santoro and Sam Rothstein's perspectives. One of the many attracting factors is that the film is Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the novel of Casino and the novel of Goodfellas as well as being involved with both screenplays and Martin Scorsese, who directed, also wrote. The result of these two geniuses in their fields working together was a great script.The performances were also great. I believe Sharon Stone was nominating for an Oscar for her portrayal of Ginger McKenna (based on Geri McGee-Rosenthal), Sam's greedy wife. Joe Pesci, playing a similar role to what he did in Goodfellas, comes back with a vengeance as a brutal Mafia hit-man. And of course, Robert De Niro is great lead (as always), as the smart and cool Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein. The film also has a great supporting cast, including Don Rickles and Frank Vincent.All in all, Casino is a great movie. The movie is not as good as Goodfellas, but almost reaches the point to being just as good. I enjoyed both of them.10/10",

DeNiro here is a Jewish guy, schooled in 1950s hoodlumism, but his \"Jewishness\" is confined unfortunately to the stereotype who lets others fight for him and is actually worried that his best fiend Pesci won't stop filandering with his wife. \"what if he doesn't stop?\" he whispers to Stone, in a very bizarre scene.Stone's character is also a mite mixed-up: she can work the system down to carpet fibers in the lounge, is a lying thief like all her friends and clients, but is initially shy on the idea of marrying a multi millionaire who can secure her future 500 times over? think I'll toss my VHS in, one more time, you know, just to review.........................",

This Shows how Money,Greed and Power can change a human being into doing very bad and horrible things.The Performances from De Niro as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein who is a very excellent and clever gambler and Pesci as Nicky Santoro who gets obsessed with money and power after coming to Vegas are excellent as they Potray there characters perfectly and at times acting like real mobsters, their chemistry in the movie in the scenes together is great and the dialogue delivery of both throughout the movie is also excellent and they narrated the story perfectly..Sharon Stone also does a very good job as Ginger McKenna who gets frustrated after some years of getting married with Sam and gets greedy of the money which is in the bank, she portrays her role very well as a alcoholic greedy for money, with a bigger influence to the movie in the latter part of it, making the movie a three sided battle between the actors.Martin Scorsese does an excellent job in directing this and showing the dark side of Las Vegas and the Casino world with quite a bit of violence and abuses but at the same time keeping the viewers interested in the movie,and how the city can make a person obsessed with Money,Power and Greed, with helping the characters adapt to their roles very well,and also helping Sharon Stone give one of her best performances of her life,also utilizing a good story which he also had a part in writing very well in making a great crime movie in which he is such a perfectionist in.The Story which was actually based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi was excellent and reveals the dark side of Las Vegas and shows that it always is not the greatest place on earth, due to an excellent screenplay from Screenwriter Pileggi himself and Martin Scorsese. The Background music in the movie is also excellent as it is in any Scorsese movie and great job from the legendary director and Robbie Robertson in giving some great songs in the movie which suit the scenes perfectly.This Is A Great Crime Film on how Money,Power and Greed can absolutely change a person into doing very bad and horrible things,and its perfectly shown by Mr Scorsese along with a great acting from the acting trio.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese has a penchant for making great movies and he literally owns the gangster genre. Casino shows the life of the mobsters who run the casino and the elaborate measures that they take in order to avoid being arrested. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci star in this movie and both of them leave a mark by playing nuanced characters with great finesse. However, Sharon Stone, who plays Ginger, the wife of De Niro's character, is the one who steals the show with a crazy, tumultuous performance of a greedy woman who has gotten mixed up in drugs, alcohol, etc. and has lost control over herself. She has irresistible charm but her egoistic tendencies manage to get the better of her.The direction by Scorsese is highly energetic with constant camera movements, beautiful cinematography and a voice over that suits the movie. The first half, in particular, is highly entertaining as the audience is shown how a casino works. The movie is a tad bit too long clocking at almost 3 hours. As a result, it loses a bit of steam towards the end. If you cannot stomach violence, then this is not the movie for you. But, if you liked Goodfellas, you are going to love Casino.",

            "content": "There's no denying this is a great movie. It's a crime epic, frankly, but while I'm being honest I will say that it takes well over half an hour for anything to really \"happen.\" That said, for me, the real pull in this Scorsese \"classic\" is undeniably Joe Pesci. When compared to Goodfellas, I'd choose Goodfellas over Casino every day, but even in that film Pesci was a favorite. In Casino he has more room to shine, and he delivers a disturbingly great performance beginning to end. This isn't to say that De Niro and others aren't superb; De Niro really excels in the last hour. It's such a cohesive movie, inspired by real events too, that it often feels like a documentary. Which I think is probably the biggest compliment one could give a movie and its actors. My main gripe is the heavy narration in the first two hours and the length. It often felt like a lot of the script was repeating itself, especially in the first act. At three hours and very little \"action\" within the first two, but enough talking to give you a headache, I couldn't wait for the third to be over...but that's when the movie really gets going. Knowing about all the improvisation throughout the movie, especially between De Niro and Pesci, and James Woods, made me respect the acting even more. Although not a movie I'll ever watch again in its entirety, it certainly had many memorable scenes.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is without a doubt one of the finest individuals to ever sit behind a movie camera having directed great films like \"Raging Bull\", \"The Departed\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Gangs of New York\", \"Hugo\", and \"The Aviator\" this movie is a welcomed addition to that already masterful resume for me. This movie is the ninth collaboration between Scorsese and his right hand man Robert De Niro and so far it's their most recent until their upcoming Netflix film \"The Irishman\" comes out later this year. De Niro stars as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein who owns a casino in Las Vegas called the \"Tangiers\" and happens to be based on Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal who started out as a sports better in Chicago and the mob decides that he would be a potential asset to their income and decides to send him to Vegas to run a casino. Rothstein then moves down to Vegas to run the place and not long after his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) along with his brother Dominic (Philip Suriano), and his associate Frankie Marino (Frank Vincent) are sent by the mob bosses to make sure everything in the place runs smoothly. Rothstein's trusted manager is an older guy named Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) who at his side at all times during working hours and also watches everything that goes on and makes sure nobody does anything wrong. Then one day while the casino is in operation Rothstein sees a blond haired woman who he instantly falls in love with named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who is a hustler and former prostitute who has a pimp friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods) who she has known since they were kids and sometimes presents obstacles in her marriage to Rothstein. The movie's story is more than just the rise and fall of a mob family but also the downfall of one man's life, relationships, and wealth. Scorsese is a director who pays an immense attention to every little detail in his movies which makes it feel like you are there in the movie with his characters going through certain things in their lives, and in this case presents the excess that the characters live in perfectly proving that money can't make your life happy no matter how much you may have, and there are dire consequences with messing with a mobster's trust. This is one of the most violent gangster movies I've ever seen. Scorsese's direction is always in top form especially with this movie and his screenplay that he co-wrote with Nicholas Pileggi (who also co-wrote the screenplay for \"Goodfellas\" as well as the books that both films are based on.) Robert Richardson's cinematography is excellent same with the editor by Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The acting is also superb especially by Stone who nabbed an Oscar nomination for best actress who managed to get the movie its only nomination. But however my only problem with the movie is that it seemed a little bit on the long side for me which makes it seem a bit drawn out and at the same time is justified due to Scorsese's fast pacing and deep focus into Rothstein's personal life, and as a result is one of the best inside stories about a gangster I've ever seen along with \"The Godfather\" series, \"Scarface\", and \"Goodfellas\". The movie is one of the best of its kind and is a near masterpiece.",

Every Martin Scorsese film is a wonderful gift, even the ever-so-slightly disappointing 'Shutter Island'.'Casino' charts the rise and fall of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) who is assigned the task of running a Las Vegas casino. Things go decidedly pear-shaped when his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) decides to join him in the gambling capital of the world. A real firebrand with a very short fuse, Nicky is violent and erratic and attracts too much negative attention. Soon things are spiralling dangerously out of control.Sam courts and marries a beautiful hustler named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in the performance of her career). But her surreptitious ongoing relationship with sleazy ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond (a wonderfully oleaginous performance by charismatic character actor James Woods) pushes Sam to the outer limits of his endurance.Like 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' is based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi. And while 'Casino' does not reach the dizzying heights that 'Goodfellas' did, it is still well worth your time. Sharon Stone steals every scene she is in; casting her was a big risk - she was perceived as more of a sex symbol than a serious actress - and it paid huge dividends. She delivers a bravura performance and is a genuine pleasure to watch. As Nicky, Joe Pesci simmers with that deadly rage which made his character of Tommy DeVito in 'Goodfellas' so frightening and so electric to watch. And in a straight role, Don Rickles is very good as Billy Sherbert.Clocking in at just under three hours in length, 'Casino' never feels overlong. And, once again, Scorsese fills the film with wonderful songs by artists such as Fleetwood Mac ('Go Your Own Way'), The Moody Blues ('Nights in White Satin'), and - of course - The Rolling Stones ('Long Long While' and 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking' (which opened the film 'Blow'). Lavish, violent, and almost operatic in its dramatic scope, 'Casino' is highly recommended.",

But then you'll miss the best dialogue of any gangster movie in 25 years.  It's overwhelming how quotable this movie is.  People that write this film off need to explain where the weakness in this film lies.  Even the soundtrack is incredible.  The acting is ridiculously good and should be the measuring stick for all films within this genre.

It feels forced and unnatural. Sam appeared to me like someone who acts rational and intelligent, it does not make sense for his character to suddenly want to marry an escort and then be surprised that she only is after his money and does not really love him. There are a few scenes where Sam acts really stupid e.g. when Ginger comes back to his house with the police officers, he lets her in the house and then later is surprised that she took the key to the bank deposit box with her.All in all, good movie.

'Cape Fear' was pretty much a solid thriller as well, but that film was a little too tense and frightening. This is really his one film where you can safely switch off your brain, and just relax and watch Scorsese do his thing. The fantastic visuals, the humour, the incredible sets and of course the masterful editing all together contribute to what is finally a lavish and jaw-dropping feast of a film. The way Scorsese directs his actors and sets his scenes with such utter perfection - the whole thing just makes you giddy with delight and blows your senses. Also, this movie is going to make you love 70s' American music - I guarantee it ! All the actors are a pleasure to watch here. In particular, James Woods as the \"country club golf hustler\" is hilarious - strange, why doesn't Scorsese cast him more often ?? Sadly the film is unable to keep up the kinetic pace of the first two hours, and becomes somewhat dull and overlong near the end. BUT - this film very much falls into the category of must-sees.",

            "review_title": "The dizzying climax to Scorsese's Mafia trilogy",
            "content": "Like Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" and Tim Burton's \"Ed Wood\", Scorsese had created a bit of monster for himself when he released \"Goodfellas\" in 1990. He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as \"Goodfellas\" is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in \"Casino\", Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in \"Goodfellas\". It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than \"Goodfellas\", but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of \"copying himself.\" (How can a filmmaker \"copy\" himself anyway? Nobody has moaned about Spielberg constantly re-visiting the days of WWII.)Merciless in presenting his strict attention to detail, Scorsese chronicles the rise and fall of Las Vegas under the grip of the Mafia from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Utilizing endless freeze-frames, multiple voice-over narrators, incessant music, swirling cinematography and eye-bruising set decoration, Scorsese brings us deep into the diamond-crusted bowels of the big business of Las Vegas and how the mob \"skimmed\" all they could from it for over a decade. Robert De Niro brings a subtle gravity to the role of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a genius gambling pro from Chicago recruited by the Mafia to manage and operate the four largest casinos in Vegas. Rothstein's insurance arrives in the guise of childhood friend Nicky Santoro - now a hotshot Mafia captain (and rendered with crushing brutality by Joe Pesci). After years of successful slumming as a mid-level gambler, Rothstein sees Vegas as his shot at legitimacy. He tries to solidify his dream by marrying a high-class Vegas prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who despite her glamorous exterior and sturdy attitude, is ultimately emotionally lost and still desperately hung on her greasy pimp / boyfriend, Lester Diamond (nicely underplayed by the eternally sleazy James Woods).  Ginger tires to escape Ace's marital clutch while still enjoying the perks of being the wife of the most powerful man in town, while Nicky disregards Ace's \"nice-and-neat\" policy of running business in favor of violent extortion and rampant thievery over everyone else in town. Ace sees the coupling together of his rocky marriage to Ginger with Nicky's aggressive attempts at taking over Las Vegas as problematic, but pride & greed prevent him from acknowledging the true severity of the situation. When Ginger and Nicky's frustrations with Ace inadvertently turn them toward each other, all hell breaks loose.There are probably very few other films that hit the three-hour mark and fly by as quickly as \"Casino\". Longtime Oliver Stone cinematographer Robert Richardson gives Scorsese's Las Vegas a polished, glossy look; bathed in neons, pastels and solids of every color imaginable. God's gifts to Editors - that being Scorsese's number-one partner in crime, Thelma Schoonmaker, creates a smooth but frenetic pacing in Scorsese's storytelling. The music - which encompasses a bizarre brew of blues, swing, classical, doo-wop, rock and even punk - works wonders. Only Spike Lee is as skilled as Scorsese at utilizing music to re-create an era instead of merely advertising the film's accompanying soundtrack. De Niro's take on \"Ace\" Rothstein - who's obsessed with doing the job right - allows Scorsese to splurge on showcasing the in's-and-out's of Vegas. We see Ace chastise reckless dealers, slightly overweight dancers, and beleaguered chefs in excruciating detail. This is not limited to Ace's perceptions, Scorsese explains how money is won and lost, and how it is stolen - whether by the mob or by the players. The first hour of \"Casino\" could easily pass as a documentary on the mechanics of operating a gaming establishment.Aside from the usual mainstays, De Niro and Pesci, Scorsese has assembled a stellar cast. Both Sharon Stone and James Woods give fiery interpretations of their tortured characters. Stone really surprised everybody with her performance here, but really - how many people would agree to act in a Martin Scorsese picture and sleep through it anyway? Vegas comedy legends Alan King and Don Rickles also appear in straight roles as a casino manager and a mob front, respectively. The great character actor/comedian Kevin Pollack also offers his talent as the mob's squeaky-clean front man. No performance falls flat here.One way to angle the film for yourself if you're at all put-off by its structural similarities to \"Goodfellas\" need only regard this - \"Casino\" is basically an explanation of what would have happened to the characters in \"Goodfellas\" had they succeeded beyond the middle-class comfort of where they roamed. The film also contains the novelty value of displaying De Niro's ability to juggle! I try to be concise when writing reviews and not ramble as I have done here, but it is difficult to do so with a film like \"Casino\", because it is a film so crowded in its presentation. It's a traditional American Mafia story about gluttonous, reckless, greedy people. Nonetheless, it is another Scorsese masterpiece.",

            "content": "Unfortunately, many people have slanted view that 'Casino' is basically 'GoodFellas' with a different name. I can definitely see why people would feel that away, after all it's a mobster movie based on a true story, Joe Pesci plays a crazed mental midget, Robert DeNiro plays the sly and cool leading male and f-bombs are dropped almost every second. I don't criticize people that feel 'Casino' is a bit of a rip-off, but I believe it's not. My experience of viewing Martin Scorsese's brutal and bloody classic 'Casino' is that it's similar in a lot of ways to 'GoodFellas', but it's a different film. 'Casino' isn't so much about the ups and downs of organized crime, as it is about how Vegas really got started, and it just so happens it was started by a greedy, ruthless and scary syndicate -- the Italian mafia.'Casino' follows the true tale of Jewish tough-guy, Sam 'Ace' Rothestein (Robert DeNiro). In the heart of the 1970s, Ace is approached about running the Tangiers Hotel & Casino casino floor, which is run by the mob. Ace is told by another Jewish mafia associate, Andy Stone (Alan King) that he doesn't won't even require a gaming commission license to run Tangiers, since the gaming commission is ten-years behind registrations. Everything seems to be set financially for Ace, as long as he allows the mob soldiers to skim a percentage of the casino's money for the bosses of the different crime families. Ace is being protected by his best friend and mob capo, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew of misfits. Nicky is cruel, lascivious, greedy and has a very short temper that when tested causes him to act outrageously violent and demoniac. Things are going great between Ace and Nicky, then Ace meets the seemingly beautiful and kind, but actually selfish and rapacious Ginger (Sharon Stone). Ace falls for Ginger and the two eventually get married, but have severe marital problems involving Ginger's old flame, the sleazy and conniving Lester Diamond (James Woods) and Ginger's drug and alcohol abuse. When everything seems so perfect and mirthful for Ace, his world falls apart very rapidly before his eyes. His wife is crazy, he's loosing money, he's having problems in general with the Tangiers casino and his once solid but now rocky relationship with the malignant goon, Nicky. The film also stars Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, Dick Smothers, John Bloom, L.Q. Jones and Kevin Pollack as the owner of the Tangiers Hotel & Casino.What 'Casino' really boils down to is being a tale of avarice and it's consequences. The film starts out very optimistic and satisfying for all the characters, but quickly and abruptly turns sour for everyone. It perfectly demonstrates how money and wealth consumes you and changes you; especially in the case of having Ace and Nicky be bosom buddies in the beginning but end up loathing each other so much that they considering whacking one another. 'Casino' may drag a tiny bit in it's two hour and fifty-nine minute runtime, but when it's all over it turns out to be an excellent film. Martin Scorsese does another incredible job behind the camera, while the actors are even more solid in this one then in 1990's similar mob movie 'GoodFellas'. Robert DeNiro should have earned an Oscar nomination for his perfect portrayal of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein the Jew with Italian-mob connections who always plays his cards right. Joe Pesci is great as to be expected as the barbaric and cutthroat gangster, Nicky, but no where near as excellent as he was as the heartless waste of human life he played so impeccably in 'GoodFellas'. But the show really belongs to Sharon Stone in an impressive and remarkable performance as the crazy but ultimately pathetic junkie trophy wife of Ace. I never really thought she was a good actress until 'Casino', and in the film she really proves herself. James Woods is ideally cast as the film's undeniably unlikable parasite and Don Rickles is very upstanding in his role. The film features Frank Vincent (who you may know as the creepy mob villain, Phil Leotardo in HBO's hit drama 'The Sopranos') as Nicky Santoro's right man. The film has a lively music score and Scorsese and Nicholas Pillegi deliver a fine screenplay.If you haven't already, take three hours to sit down with a big ass bowl of popcorn and watch Scorsese's 'Casino', but only after you've seen 'GoodFellas'. You may not enjoy or appreciate it's brutal violence, crude language and overall staunch ferocity, but hey, odds are you may enjoy it if you give it a chance. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #115",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese has been hailed as one of the greatest modern directors ever to take on the Silver Screen and for good reason. With a unique style that involves strong themes of crime and redemption, virtuoso camera work, quick pacing, and violent imagery; Martin Scorsese has carved his name into the crime genre and the movie world as a whole.Now, many know Scorsese for his gritty and violent crime films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and The Departed, but I think the Scorsese style (at least the visual style) shows through best in his Crime epic, Casino.In Casino, Martin Scorsese uses some of his best camera work and his most stunning compositions to pantomime the feel and atmosphere of an actual casino. The quick movements, the flashing lights, the almost schizophrenic nature all comes together to form one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.IT doesn't just stop at the camera-work. The way the story is told also plays a big part in this subtle dance. The film almost seems like one gigantic vignette as Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci narrate for good chunks of the film as it lays out the story. It seamlessly glides between Vignettes, montages, and narrative story telling to almost make it like watching a novel.If there were ever films to come so close to being like paintings it would be The Seventh Seal and this.",

            "content": "Casino is one of my all time favorite movies. The narration is great, the music is wonderful, everything is just great. The movie always gets back to the point. Goodfellas showed us that real gangsters weren't about \"whacking\" everyone; it's about making money. Casino shows us the same thing, all the lights, all the comps, it's all been arranged just for us to get YOUR money. Even much later in the movie Nicky remarks, \"The f*%ckn' bottom line here is, cash\". The music in the movie is so fantastically placed that the movie begins to resemble a musical in some points.A few things I have always wondered: 1) Why oh why isn't this movie on the top 250 list??? 2) Why are the names changed form the book?In goodfellas, the names are the same. Henry Hill is Henry Hill. In Casino (the book) Sam \"Ace\" is actually Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal (If I remember correctly).This is such a great movie. The pace is so fast and the dialogue and narration are so tight that all 3 hours just roll by without notice.Probably my favorite thing about this movie is that it has major replay value. It isn't a rental. I can watch this movie a few times a month or even in a week. Some movies get stale after one or a few viewings. I feel that all of M Knight's (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) movies fall into that category. They're great movies, but you just can't watch them over and over. Casino is one of those special few that you can pop on and enjoy, not just fall asleep to.",

            "content": "Trust. The fascinating theme and moral reassurance for Martin Scorsese's attempt to hit critics and audiences as hard as he hit them with his classic, Goodfellas. Unfortunately, his arm isn't strong enough to smack the audience on that level. However, he does leave a great impression thanks to his style, control, of course the two components that make his films the best of the best: his film editor and Robert DeNiro.In Spanish, \"money\" is translated to \"diniro\". Hiring Robert DeNiro to star as the leading role in a film centered around gambling. The irony is fascinating. Thrown into a role that is more simplistic than past roles Scorsese has put DeNiro front and center for, DeNiro delivers the goods and is the MVP in Casino, when his two co-stars are given much more to raise a circus with. Speaking of, Joe Pesci. While one may question the actor's range with his role choices, no one can deny him the praise he deserves at knocking these types of characters through the wall and then some.Talk about more irony. Sharon Stone was the only cast member (or crew member for that fact) to receive an Oscar nomination for her work in Casino. She gets to cry, she gets to yell, she gets to do drugs, but hardly is she ever to scratch below the surface and bring something real out in her character. Ginger is resorted to Stone's awkwardness on the screen, struggling through scenes other actresses could've killed by throwing a hissy fit. She doesn't work in the role. Not that the role isn't rooted in clich\u00e9, unoriginality, and lacks the development needed to make this trite stereotype a quality character.Much of the film is montage with narration guiding the viewer through the quick action. Scorsese films have tightly strung editing, but nothing ever like this has been produced before. The film barely gives us full length scenes until the last third, but those are drown in Stone's distracting acting efforts. It's a complete mystery to me how Casino was shot and edited; there are so many scenes to get caught up in that last 20 seconds at most some of them. Major props to the editing and Scorsese. I'm aware giving Scorsese praise in that fashion is redundant and expected with each film he directs, but here it's earned considering this is one of his weaker efforts.The film's running time is a monstrous one, and coming from a person who checks their watch incessantly in a film that's over two hours, I didn't feel the length once. It kept me interested and invested in the happenings of the story. The viewer almost rides it like a raft down a river. But, just because it's watchable doesn't always mean it's worth watching. In this case, it is worth the flaws. Flaws, in which the film erupts with as does the opening scene's car bombing. The story is fun, minutely intriguing, and entertains us with the back dealings of Vegas and then seem. But somehow the story and the characters sometimes feel like they are struggling to stay above water. Casino is very reminiscent of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, homaging the plot arc, specific scenes, themes, subject matters, and the iconic endings.When I was growing up, my mother demanded respect at all times. Even when we were giving her respect beyond any of our peer's efforts for their parents, she still never felt it was enough. She was never going to be satisfied For DeNiro's character, Trust is his version of my mother's trust. He falls in love with Stone's character, knowing her tarnished reputation and her art of conning, but still he chooses to marry her and forces her to be loyal to him. Deep down he knows that he shouldn't trust her, but he lives reality as if she was worthy of his trust. Just as the average joe wants to believe Vegas is an honest place and in gambling you risk it all, but as the saying goes The House Always Wins. Perhaps DeNiro strives for personal strivings for trust result from his view of the unlawful acts of the city. Even though he tries to maintain legitimacy in his end of business dealings, maybe real trust cannot be found in Las Vegas.RATING: 7.5/10GRADE: B+",

Pesci is the great little tough guy of our generation. The movie is certainly a drama, but there are also many comic components. I like the continuing interplay across several movies between Pesci and Frank Vincent. In Raging Bull, Pesci attacks Vincent. In Goodfellas, Pesci kills Vincent and buries him. In Casino, at the end, Vincent kills Pesci with a baseball bat and then \"ships\" and buries him. I believe most people like the violence- they just don't want to admit it.",

            "content": "Once again Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pileggi, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci unite for another epic mob movie, based on a true story. Casino tells the story of Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of a mob controlled casino. Joe Pesci plays his friend, Nicky Santoro, from back home years ago who comes out to A) Protect Sam and the casino and B) make some cash for himself. He does just that. Along the way, Sam begins a relationship with Ginger, a hustler at the casino played by Sharon Stone. It tells the story of how the mob controlled casinos, and how people like these helped mess it up. From the opening scenes, one can see that Scorsese is following the Goodfellas format of flashback/voiceover work, but this benefits the movie. DeNiro and Pesci are on top form again, as is Sharon Stone surprisingly. Over all, a very well written, acted and directed film, the only drawback being it's length. Word of warning, this film is very violent at times. You would have heard of the vice scene by now as it helped garner this film some notorority, but it isn't the only one. If you can handle the violence and language, then this is a very rewarding film experience.Best scene: DeNiro busts some yokels trying to cheat at the casino, and proves that a hammer and a kind word work better than just a kind word.",

I think the reason why people don't consider this a classic is because everyone has to constantly compare this movie to Goodfellas and because of this they say that Casino is somewhat of a rip off of Goodfellas, WHY? Because it has a similar cast? BIG DEAL. In my opinion I actually think Casino is better and more enjoyable and not to mention more realistic, in the movie pretty much all the gangsters are extremely violent which is what gangsters are in real life, this case, you've gotta point out the character Nicky (Pesci) for that since there's a scene where he actually stabs a tough guy with a pen and makes him begging for his life and another when he crushes a guys head in a vise. And Ace (DeNiro) when he caught two cheaters in his casino and had one of them get his hand smashed with a hammer.The plot is very, very easy to get into. It explains how the Mafia controlled the casino in Las Vegas which created a sort of a multi-million dollar gambling empire and at the end the entire empire crumbled, just like that. It's a great story, I love it.The acting is excellent, Robert DeNiro is as good as ever, Joe Pesci always good at playing the violent psychotic gang member. And Sharon Stone should've won the Oscar that she was nominated for her flawless performance.This film is without a doubt worth watching and is one of Scorsese's best.",

The real truth here is the heart of mankind, which is filled with evil. The perpetual lure of sex and violence, end of the world hypocrisy, the false faces that cover the insatiable lust and love of money. Man's inability to avoid corruption, the ease with which he walks and rides roughshod, to roll in destruction and without remorse. The real world extremes of what people are capable of. Of what seeds are planted in the soil of the human heart, and the flowers of evil that are nurtured and grown. Martin Scorsese is an end of the world prophet here, and this underrated masterpiece is one of the brightest sermons he ever delivered. A latter day warning to mankind that the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.",

Well, don't come looking for any of that \"Bam, your dead\" -kinda action. Be set up for some really gory executions.

Casino is a mob story about a multi billion dollar casino operation that Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) owns. He is joined in Vegas by a mad mob boss; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to make sure no one messed with Ace. Both De Niro and Pesci give fine performances. Joe Pesci as usual plays the mad man absolutely brilliantly. Even though these two were on top form, Sharon Stone gives a unforgettable performance. Stone was robbed of an Oscar and this film also deserved an Oscar. If someone can tell me a better film in 1995 I'd like to know what it is because it would take something special to over shine this masterpiece. This film, even though so brilliant and watchable was rated 18 for a good reason. There is about 400 f-words mostly used by Joe pesci and the c-word is used once by Robert De Niro. Also this film has some of the most disturbing violence I have ever seen. In one scene the mad Joe Pesci puts a guys head in a vice and squeezes it until the mans eye pops out. Thats just to name one violent scene, believe me there are many more.Besides that the film is amazing . The acting is brilliant and the film is highly recommended to any gangsta movie fan, or even if you don't like gangsta movies you will enjoy it. Fantastic, but not for the young ones.",

Goodfellas is not good, it's great but Casino is different. Yes it is a mob movie and it's within 5 years of the great Goodfellas but it takes what was innovative in GF and it improves it. The colours, the set design, the costumes and the music really leaves an impression, almost like Scorcese was showing off his one of kind, unique style and finally perfected it. I love Goodfellas but Casino is something else, it's rich and long, the characters are almost too much, but it works. It is well worth the almost 3hr commitment ,it captures a mob story set in 1970s Las Vegas, a Las Vegas that will never be seen again. I High recommend this.",

I love Rickles cast as the manager, and his joke about the private jet problems, \"Hey, better down here than up there, you know what I mean\". Pescis' scene rousting the 2 hoods inside the Tangiers is just typical of his acumen as an actor.

Robert De Niro, in one of his finest performances, plays a well-to-do perfectionist whose obligation is to get things done right. A superman for running his Casino, his kryptonite is Sharon Stone. She's a sultry casino hustler who makes her way in big bills by making sure all the \"insiders\" are taken care of. De Niro is in love, but she warns him she doesn't love him, but still agrees to marry him. There's also Joe Pesci, playing a loud-mouthed, violent buddy of De Niro's, who will jump on anyone who makes him feel threatened.All in all \"Casino\" is a terrific ride, and also very long. One is of course, reminded of \"GoodFellas\", because Pesci plays basically the same role he played there. And of course there's all the violence and destruction, but we like this. For three hours, I was never bored. I was aware how long I had been sitting, but I never found myself tapping my fingers. Scorsese knows how to keep his audience intrigued, and this is a good thing at 180 minutes.Then there is Sharon Stone. I must say I was very surprised with her performance. She is over-the-top in many scenes, but her character is initially an annoying child. So this is how she is supposed to play it. Trust me if you don't think Stone can play it cool, watch \"Basic Instinct\" again. Although she never has had a very impressive career, she has had her share of good roles (Along with \"Casino\" and \"Basic Instinct\", watch her in \"Total Recall\", \"Last Dance\" and \"Gloria\"). She earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and deservedly so. I think her performance is astonishing, and definitely puts \"Casino\" into a higher league then it would have been had it not had her in it.",

The story is something that will keep you on the edge of your seat a complete drama that you won't ever want to miss. When i first bought it because i had heard it was a great movie. After it was over i came out in a daze. It was so much to take in. In one great movie. I couldn't stop watching it after that and i watched it every day after that. The cast was incredible and well picked. It had something in store for anyone who loves a good gambler movie. It shows Las Vegas at its baddest. It shows you what you really want to know. Joe Pesci was a great Nicky. He did a good job at being the crazy bad boy. Robert Deniro, did an amazing main character. This is my all time favorite Deniro movie and that is saying a lot because he is an amazing actor. A most see film.",

            "content": "Casino is less of a film about casinos and gambling and more of a film about two mafia men's very different attempts to build a new life in Las Vegas or build a foothold mafia colony in Nevada.The casino and the gambling industry is simply a backdrop to the story - the film could've been about any other industry with little changes to the main story, which is the two men, almost completely disconnected from the mafia bosses, who run things their own way in a bizarro-land.It is a bizarro-land in that what's illegal is legal (gambling and bookies are legal), the businesses (casino houses) are very powerful and have their own muscle, there is no mafia presence (other than themselves), no street crime, no rival families or gangs, law enforcement is not as organized, a different kind of government/way of doing things/getting permits and licenses that they're used to, and how they adjust to this completely different environment.If one were to group mafia films into categories: beginnings of an organized crime family, rise/decline of a family, rise/decline of an individual member/boss of the family, wars between established families, and so on, this would be its own category of mafiosos in a completely unfamiliar environment.The film is long, but doesn't feel long. It's packed with story - the scenes are short, dialogue is to the point, it is filled with events. It is a long story condensed and cut down to almost 3 hours rather than a short story stretched with long panoramas, filler, story threads that go nowhere, mood scenes and such. There is no fat in the film and the story to footage ratio is almost 1:1 - you can't cut anything without affecting the story.It's a great film, not just for its time, but for all time. It's not the most original film, but how original can a mafia film be nowadays? It's not high on originality, but it's high on quality.",

Scorsese peaked with \"Goodfellas\" and tried to re-create that magic with the same screenwriter, Nicholas Pileggi. He cast his usual trusty team of DeNiro and Pesce and Sharon Stone to play Ginger. The best of these was Stone, who reminded me of a lot of fake, greedy women I met in Las Vegas. DeNiro's character was just not likeable or sympathetic to me. Pesce was over-the-top psychopathic and his attempt at a Chicago accent was probably accurate, but annoying and distracting. James Woods was great as the slimeball Lester.\nI thought the affair between Stone and the much shorter Pesce was comical.\nThe violence was too much, causing my date to shudder. Did we really need to see one of the gangsters spitting on the hero? Do we need to give the weak minded more examples of depravity?",

Casino, is another masterpiece with Las Vegas connection by Scorsese. The narration has no depth as in \"Good Fellas\". Sharon Stone looks stunning and probably the beginning of her typecasting in movies. She plays the drug addict to the hilt. The movie is very close to the Vegas that existed in the Sixties and Seventies. Ace Rothstein's attorney portrayed by Oscar Goodman is now the current Mayor of Las Vegas. The movie is incredibly gripping with great acting that has tradionally expected from a Scorese film, but the Casting will never be like the \"Good Fellas\".The movie takes off where the masterpiece \"Bugsy\" left-off when it comes to the Las Vegas history. The scene where the brothers are done away with is gorily authentic you see only in Scorsese movies.

            "content": "When I first saw this movie I found it to be better than Goodfellas. Imagine my surprise upon reading reviews for this film that many critics proclaimed this to basically just be Scorsese going over old ground and being too much like Goodfellas. Why they presumed this I can see, but when looked at closer it is actually not that much alike.The cast contains a number of similar faces in each movie such as De Niro, Pesci, Vincent Etc. But on the whole I found Casino to be more gripping than Goodfellas and just as well made. A scene near the end of this movie has the consequences of the characters actions throughout the movie shown to music by the animals in the form of the house of the rising sun. In Goodfellas the same similar consequences are shown to music from Derek And The Dominos' Layla (another captivating scene).Going over old ground or not you can't deny that Casino is another winner for Scorsese, and if you think Joe Pesci was nuts in Goodfellas. you ain't seen nothing yet. From the soundtrack to the camera-work to the editing this film is almost perfect. Another reason I prefer this to Goodfellas is De Niro. He has a lot more to do in this than what he did in Goodfellas and the film benefits from him being lead again. James Woods also shines in almost a cameo role the way he struts in and out of the film several times then showing up for comedy effect later in the film. Sharon Stone got best Actress at Oscar for her performance (though good, I'm not her biggest fan) and she probably deserved it.The opening credits should also get a mention for being quite possible the best I've ever seen and any film that opens with the 'death' of Robert De Niro would have anyone hooked. In Conclusion this is a total masterpiece in my eyes and was way the best film of 95 and the fact it was beaten to best picture by Braveheart sickens me.",

Right.. Riiiight.Nope.He was robbed, yet again so finally he won for Departed in 07. Thank god.This flick is probably not as good as Goodfellas but I liked it more when I first watched both.

I've heard people say that this was simply Scorcese's attempt to remake Goodfellas in a different part of America.  I would say that while the idea behind it is the same, this has a very different feel to it.  Goodfellas was pure gangster stuff.  It was Liotta's \"Hey, this is a cool life\" description of how everything happened.  Casino was more \"How we f***ed everything up\" from the view of the cool De Niro. Scorcese simply used a winning formula, his usual winning cast and his usual classy soundtrack technique to put together what is the most absorbing film I have ever seen.  It may be very complicated to understand how the 'skims' work and which boss is which, but that's unnecessary.  The harrowing scenes with Pesci remain in the mind and De Niro's ice cold reactions as Stone falls apart make this a brilliant film.  Watch it.  Watch it again.

Not to mention Alan King (remember him?).So, it was with anticipation that I got this one, and started to watch. It started out with a healthy dose of narration, reminding me of Goodfellas. But this time it was DeNiro doing most of the talking.But then he didn't stop.This is a three-hour movie, and about an hour of it, if not more (I didn't count the minutes) is Abe Rothstein (DeNiro), or sometimes Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), narrating the background. I mean, Ray Liotta did a good job in Goodfellas, but this is overboard, guys. Enough gabbing, and let's see the characters do what they do best, and let the story fold out through the scenes.So, the story is about two gangsters, Abe Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, who are small-time bookies some place \"back home\" - in some non-descript town anywhere between Dallas and Cleveland, where gambling is definitely a no-no. The \"bosses\" there send Rothstein out to Vegas to manage a casino that they bankroll. Except for the source of the funds, Rothstein is now involved in a legitimate operation. And that's where the first conflict arrives: he's not used to being a law-abiding fellow. But he gets it real quick, and in no time at all, has a babe for a wife (who had warned him that she's not the marrying type), Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).Then his buddy Nicky comes out to Vegas, and wants to help. But Nicky is the bouncer. The violent guy, and he wants to do it his way. So, he gums things up with his beatings, and threats, and stabbings. And these things are still illegal in Nevada, folks.So, the rest of the movie is how these conflicts pan out: Abe Rothstein trying to be legit (and it's not only his own demons, but there are some shenanigans going on in official Nevada as well), trying to be married to a former call girl of a wife (who just can't keep her finger out of the white stuff, and still has the hots for her former pimp), and Abe trying to get along with Nicky, who just can't keep his hands - and switchblades - to himself.Sounds like a cool gangster movie, and the potential is there, folks. In fact, I think not only the potential is there, but the scenes are there, too. The acting is fine (although DeNiro has done better jobs elsewhere), but the killer here is the editing. There were just too many scenes that could have been cut out, and the movie pared down to 2 hours or so. It just went on and on and on.So, if you want to see these guys on the screen, by all means watch this movie. But beware of the high price you pay in time invested.",

Also amusing is Don Rickles' stone-faced portrayal of the casino manager--he hardly says a word, let alone a wisecrack.The film is extremely violent from the opening minutes. It is also rather long (nearly three hours), but the cinematography is so beautiful--and one is always flinching, preparing for the next gruesome confrontation--that the time moves quickly.

            "content": "\"Casino\" is another modern classic from Martin Scorsese. Drawing parallels with his earlier \"Goodfellas\" , \"Casino\" again teams Scorsese up with writer Nicholas Pileggi having De Niro & Joe Pesci in lead traditional favourite of Scorsese. The result is a truly engaging tale of mobsters setting up a new gambling empire in Las Vegas and the subsequent ripple effects that involve the local authorities and the police.A joy from beginning to end, \"Casino\" is an example of a perfect movie. There's nothing you'd want to change about this film. It's full of memorable scenes that are rich with outstanding performances and dialogue and it simply demands a repeat viewing.Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert De Niro plays Sam Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and Casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorsese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorsese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Scorsese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of \"Satisfaction\" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.Being a complete movie buff, I generally don't watch films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorsese is definitely one of them. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to any movie buff - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, \"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert De Niro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joe Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.My Rating \u2013 9/10",

            "content": "1995's Casino saw Martin Scorcese continue his masterful exploration of the American underworld, calling on the talents of Messrs De Niro and Pesci to portray the corrupt background of Las Vegas in the seventies.De Niro and Scorcese, when working together, always come up with the goods (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy), although their previous collaboration, Cape Fear, was a slight dissapointment in comparison.\nCasino tells the story of the  rise of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro) to the top of the gaming community in Las Vegas, albeit with the help of the Mob and resident psychopath/long-time friend Nicky Santoro (Pesci), as well as concentrating on his rocky relationship with Vegas hustler Ginger (Sharon Stone). Between the heists, the stunning cinematography, seamless editing and sumptuously glamorous visuals, Casino is seriously compulsive filmmaking. De Niro and company are all on peak form, creating believable and fascinating three-dimensional characters. Scorsese's direction is smooth, confident and incisive, using a terrific array of shots and technical tricks to take us through the real deceptive nature of Vegas. The film is often hilarious due to the animated trauma of the characters (see Santoro's furious reaction to Tony Doggs spilling the beans about his boss) as they try to deal with the trials and tribulations of being first-rate gangsters.The critics were shockingly unkind to Casino, saying that it was a poor man's Goodfellas. I wonder what everyone's reaction to Casino would have been if it had come out first and not Goodfellas. The truth is is that Casino, while lacking the strong narrative of Goodfellas, is in many ways a stronger film in terms of acting, direction and in terms of being simply more entertaining. Goodfellas is very professionally made, but at its peak, Casino really does impress more, especially in its more dramatic moments. De Niro and Pesci are given more room to explore their characters, and Sharon Stone is just brilliant, proving that there is more to her than the trashy exploitation of Basic Instinct and the awful Sliver. Also this film has probably the best soundtrack of any film made in the 90's. Just check out the stylish use of the Stones' classic Can't You Hear Me Knocking as Pesci introduces his gang of \"desperadoes\".",

The expulsion of the Mob from Las Vegas also serves to reinforce Scorsese's recurring themes of redemption and ascension; here both are mutually exclusive and to be redeemed and delivered from hell means an existence in purgatory. (Heaven, meanwhile, is reserved for the blue-haired innocents who have become the guests of the corporations that have purged Vegas from sin.) By the time it's over, Scorsese seems exhausted; he doesn't have anything left to say on the subject and it looks doubtful he ever will. Still, if he never makes another masterpiece, this will be a fitting coda on a remarkable subject.",

The irony is that while Vegas is seen as a separate universe where vice is as commonplace as streetlights, it's probably the only HONEST city in the world. Every other city is as full of vice and corruption, but Vegas is the only place that admits that these things are at the core of our lovely civilization. Scorsese has many tools at his disposal; here he uses his scalpel and Bedazzler above all else. The one thing that really bugged me (other than the usual Italian-American stereotypes, but what are you gonna do) is the OVER-use of voice-over. Voice-over is pretty annoying to begin with, but here it's just way too much. It almost sucks the life out of the movie (especially when coupled with Scorsese's snappy montage style). Visually it's quite breathtaking, and the performances are top-notch, especially from Sharon Stone, who emits a raw energy not common among today's leading ladies.",

Scorsese has a fascination with the mafia and there is a lot you could say about the mafia, unfortunately most of it wouldn't work for a Hollywood film so he keeps telling practically the same story over and over again which is unfortunate. So once again we see this cool mob man played by Robert De Niro in a superb performance who is well standing in the community, and than we have his boy-hood friend the psychotic played by Joe Pesci who once again deserves and Oscar, and well we go from there. The film is masterfully written, acted and directed with very nice visual effects but is to familiar and long to be very engaging.",

A cheap gangster who for some reason commands respect that you would not expect from a five-foot two-inch loser. He was much better as the clich\u00e9d role in \"My Cousin Vinny.\" In another (better, shorter) Scorsese movie, \"Goodfellas,\" he would have been pretty good if he had been 30 years younger. But it was like watching my mother play Scarlett O'Hara.Every single scene is an argument. That gets tedious after a while. Alan King and Don Rickles are miscast in dramatic roles. This was made when Robert DiNiro was already always playing a clich\u00e9d version of himself. Sharon Stone tries hard, but her role is not well written. Is she good? Is she evil? Why does she pretty much disappear from the middle third of the movie and spend the last third screaming? There are some Scorsese movies that are actually OK, but this is not one of them.",

The acting is on another level, so amazing that These emotions were brought out by the audience watching! Sharon Stone's Excellent performance as Ginger i thought stole the show. A straight up lovable hustler turned drug addict. Stone not only en captivates the role and fits the image, she also nails what i think, is the best performance of her career.Robert Deniro as Sam Rothstein once again consistency is the true mark of a great actor and Deniro nails this role to a tee as always. I see Sam as the Good guy of the movie! A good man who just wants a quiet life we as the audience feel compassion towards him throughout and i sense of sorriness as he loses all of his riches Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro amazing as always in this film i see him as the Lovable character, the moments of comedy, the vicious streak all together make such a great personality This film could be Scorsese's best however many opinions will fly around and at the end of the day it becomes hard to say which is his best Casino 10/10",

May not be the same wisdom as he had in Goodfellas, but much more of a brutal, ego filling mobster - at first protecting, but jeopardizing all the Mob influence had in Vegas which was the beginning of the end for them controlling casino's and their teamster ties. Scorsese masters the filmaking of these longtime actors, with Sharon Stone coming along for the ride, with truer feelings than in any other mob movie he has made. This was more, of a drama - soap opera than what can be called a mob movie. If you haven't seen it which is doubtful.

            "review_title": "One of my Absolute Favorites!!!",
            "content": "Ranking along with my all time favourite films, Casino is based on the true story of Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal and Anthony \"The Ant\" Splitoro renamed Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein and Nicky Santoro for the film.Playing Sam Rothstein is none other than Robert De Niro, supported by Sharon Stone as Ginger Rothstein, Sam's wife, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, Sam's friend. There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?!De Niro is fantastic (as usual) and really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board, easily one of his greatest roles.This is also Sharon Stone's best performance, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with horrific consequences, Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nomination.And of course there's Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing, hilarious yet completely disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker, It's an incredible performance and ranks up there with his best.The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything to the viewer without ever making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time and definitely one of my favourite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film.",

            "content": "Robert de niro , joe pesci and even frank vincent turn out together in another movie following the highly under-publicised (though not underrated) raging bull, and goodfellas. They are put on the Las Vegas stage with beautiful precision by the best director never to win an Oscar, Marty Scorcese. This time Sharon Stone joins in this tough, violent and very foul-mouthed gangster movie, plotting the fortunes and eventual misfortunes of a Casino manager (de niro), his mob friend (pesci), and Ginger, a Vegas hustler (Stone).Despite being about forty minutes too long, this film is a superb mix of scorceses documentary style on how the casino never loses money (if only I'd known that before going to Vegas!!), and how Stone literally sent the two main men in Vegas (de niro and pesci)to failure.Although probably not as well flowing as Goodfellas, Casino has many of its own qualities. The music is superb, the subtleties in the script very impresive on about the third viewing, and the violence more bloody and horrific than I have seen in most Hollywood mainstream titles.As much as I love Scorcese gangster films having marvelled over this particular one, and of course Goodfellas (forgetting the slightly disappointing and amateurish Mean Streets) I hope this does not end the partnerships of the actors and director in movies. Note how without De Niro or Scorcese, Pesci has failed to play a very serious (main charachter) role in a blockbuster Hollywood movie!!",

He would have taken care of that long before, especially after he learned she was sleeping with his friend. That said, Sharon Stone's performance is out of this world.",

The characters are perfect, you can love them or hate them as if they were real. De Niro and Pesci both do great jobs, but Sharon Stone is outstanding. I think that in Casino she has achieved her best performance ever. I'd recommend this film to everybody. Either you've seen it or not. If you 've not seen it, because you are missing a wonderful picture. And if you do have seen it, because each time you watch the film again, you can discover new things. I like it much more every time I see it. The story is perfect. One event leads to the other and there are no gaps or unexplained things once you've finished watching the movie. Dialogs are very real.

            "content": "\"Casino\" (1995) is director Martin Scorsese's analytical, if overly graphic, critique of mob rule and its loss of control over Las Vegas' gambling empire. It stars Robert DeNiro as Sam Rothstein, a hand-picked inside wise guy and front runner. Sam's put in charge of one of the biggest gaming palaces on the strip, The Tangiers. Initially he's assigned to clean up the penny corruption of local shady con artists. After all, the mob can't be the one's getting scammed. However, when Sam meets Ginger (Sharon Stone) the sexy and devil-may-care high rolling courtesan of the blackjack tables, he throws caution and the advice from his mob bosses to the wind in favor of a good time. This already volatile situation is further stimulated by the arrival of Nicky Santora (Joe Pesci), a thug in a fancy suit with a decided disregard for the niceties of gracious living. Nicky presents himself as Sam's indispensable appendage. But it isn't long before his uncontrollable behavior threatens to topple Sam from his roost. With the mob bosses getting very nervous over Nicky's rising body count and Sam's flamboyance in the work place, it isn't long before everything falls apart.Scorsese populates his cinematic landscape with a veritable who's who of contemporary stellar and old time talent, including Don Rickles, Kevin Pollack, James Woods, Dick Smothers and Alan King. After some smart talking and fast shooting at the crap tables, Scorsese takes us on the real tour of Vegas \u0096 in its corrupt byways, brothels and hidden cemeteries out in the middle of an unassuming corn field.The Anniversary Edition of \"Casino\" has been remastered for DVD. The anamorphic picture element is free of the dirt and debris that the prior bare bones release of this formidable film had. Colors are rich, vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. There is a bit of color bleeding during some of the underexposed scenes, but perhaps this in keeping with the film's original texture. Blacks are deep and solid. Fine details are fully realized throughout. Only a hint of edge enhancement intrudes (and then, only briefly) on an otherwise impressive transfer. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a real punch and kick to the bass and rear speakers, particularly with its emphasis on vintage background music. The brutalization of Nicky with a baseball bat is even more viscerally disturbing in this new sonic mix. You can actually hear subtle nuances in breathing as they bludgeon him to death. Extras include a bevy of making of featurettes, including interviews with many of the principle cast, some nice behind the scenes junkets, deleted scenes, and an extensive backstage look at the real life incidents that inspired the film. Bottom line is, this is the version of \"Casino\" fans have been waiting for.",

Ace was a hell of a fun character to see. as the film evolves you see a lot of drama in the world of ace and it goes from great to good to bad to worse and Robert De Niro rolls with the punches and fights fire with fire like no other actor i know of could have done. not since The Deer hunter has De Niro starred in a film that captured my emotion on such a scale. an absolutely brilliant character played by an absolutely brilliant actor. the character of Nicky Santoro being a quite versatile role required someone who could be sensitive, funny, bold, brilliant, scary, intimidating, and admired in the same character. well they cast the best choice for my money when they cast Joe Pesci. aside from the brutal heartless side of him that comes out when someone interferes with him or his job he was an admirable character. someone who could do what it takes to get the job done while at the same time being a good friend to Ace and also having a wife and a son. its not easy being such a serious character I'm sure but only Joe Pearce would know how challenging it was to tackle this role. when someone told his friend to stick a pen up his A**, well let me tell you he didn't have one shred of decency in his character. he took the pen and stabbed the man at least three dozen times. such a moving character, who has a popular restaurant of his own where he was in some eyes more famous than the famous people there had so many traits that were evolved in this film. hands down this role was handled beautifully and masterfully by the skills of Joe Pesci who in my opinion is the best choice for such a serious mob role. Sharon stone takes her role as the money obsessed, drug addicted, alcoholic, whore Ginger. she only cared about money and a boyfriend who took it from her. for some reason even when Ace proposed she was still tied to that loser lowlife pimp who ran her life. in the film she even tries to finance his bullshit by taking Aces money. when Ace finds out you almost wish he had killed both of them. because when the good pl' boys beat him down and leave him in a mess in his car ginger cries and sobs like he didn't deserve what came to him. tell me honestly do you think you would deserve getting beaten by three men at once for sneaking around with the wife of a casino boss with mob ties, then trying to take 25,000 dollars of his money. well you decide for yourself. each character gives you a reason to like or hate them. but only good actors can assure that you will feel both throughout the film. if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend it. if you have like mob movies you will love this film. And even if you don't love mafia movies but enjoy a movie with good acting, good storyline, good accuracy, or any one of the above and more you will find this movie quite to your liking. without doubt a two thumbs up.",

            "content": "Scorsese knows how to make an interesting movie. What's great about Casino is how real the violence and emotions of the characters are. First is the acting. Sharon Stone gives a terrific performance and Ginger, the out of control don't-you-know-she'll-be-trouble-girl. Robert DeNiro as Ace is also a very wise choice, because DeNiro can play the complete opposite of his character in Goodfellas. Jimmy in Goodfellas was a strong and intimidating man, while Ace is always hiding behind Nicky. Speaking of Nicky, Joe Pesci gives, I think, an even better performance than in Goodfellas. His character doesn't look like much, but his acting makes him so much bigger. Also, the chemistry between the three is outstanding. For example, when Ace confronts Ginger after they leave the restaurant. You see Ace's absolute disgust of Ginger. And, when Nicky and Ace meet. Joe Pesci doesn't give 'forced anger' like so many other actors. The viewer feels like they are watching their conversation.Next, the story. Pileggi and Scorsese really tap into life in the Mafia. We see what really happened during those times, and how corrupt the whole system was. We also see how the mob dealt with its problems. Through violence.Next, the violence. Scorsese shows us the twisted way the mob dealt with its problems. The torture scene is incredible. I found myself disgusted with it, but at the same time, I couldn't look away. Scorsese knows how to draw the viewer in. We may not like what we see, but we are attracted to it anyway.And finally, the music. The music really fits with the mood of the scene. The 'I can't get no satisfaction' song goes perfect with the confrontation between Ace and Ginger after they leave the restaurant. The music is basically telling the story for us. Ace 'can't get no satisfaction.'Truly a wonderful film. Scorsese creates another visual masterpiece for the ages. 9/10",

The acting from from a superb cast was marvellous,(James Woods must have scrubbed himself clean after the movie was finished because he really became Lester the sleaze-bag).

Even in comparison with the over-the-top Scarface, it lacks real value and true substance. Some scenes with Joe Pesci are memorable, but the rest of the movie seems like a waste of space. Scorsese's career revolved around mobster movies, and this was just too slow of a movie.

This time they work in what I think is the most detailed film of the mafia. Based on a true story.De Niro stars as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a former gambler who has been given the job as head of the casino by the mafia back in New York. Sharon Stone is Ginger, a casino hustler who basically uses Sam for his money so she can give money to her poor low life friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods). Joe Pesci is Sam's right hand man Nicky Santoro, who basically did not want to help Sam operate but make money by cheating with Sam knowing. Sam did not mind but one day Nicky got caught cheating and he is not allowed into any of the casinos. After that he starts working with the mob and starts to become one of the heads. Sam later has scandals going on with publicity that now he cannot control the casino no more. Ever since then, he has now been having trouble with Ginger and Nicky.Very heavy movie indeed. Sharon Stone has indeed done the best performance of her career. I would have given her the Oscar that year instead of Susan Sarandon's \"Dead Man Walking\". Pesci does in a way resemble his same Oscar winning character in \"Goodfellas\". Pesci is one of the biggest villains around in this movie. The violence, the swearing, and the drugs is a little too much in this one. That's its only problem. A very little bit less would give it the shot. I'd give it a 9.4/10.",

Casino tells the tale of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (DeNiro) a New York bookie and his pal, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) who move out to Las Vegas and create an empire. However ones money hungry wife (Stone) helps to bring it down.The first third of this film features almost constant narrations from Ace and Nicky. These narrations play a great role in the film because it takes you far in depth to Ace and Nicky's Las Vegas operation.To those of you who really enjoyed Scorsese's 1990 film \"GoodFellas\" there is no doubt in my mind that you will enjoy this film. It features Joe Pesci playing almost the same character he played in \"GoodFellas\". This film also features Sharon Stone, who was nominated for an academy award as hooker Ginger McKenna. The film also features Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, James Woods as Lester Diamond, and Don Rickles as casino manager Billy Sherbert. If you are a big fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, or Pesci you will no doubt enjoy this film. This film deserves a 10/10 rating and is a must watch for any DeNiro, Pesci, Scorsese, or mob movie fan who has never seen this movie.",

She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my \"Rober DeNiro: A history of his films\" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has \"hired\" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace \"I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!\", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours.

            "content": "Martin Scorcese - the film's director - is known for directing some excellent movies. MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL have been great successes and Scorcese's start into the organized crime genre commenced with a loud bang with the box office success GOODFELLAS (1990). However, I believe it is Scorcese's post-Goodfella's work that he should be commended for - excellent movies such as CAPE FEAR (1991), CASINO (1995) and GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) have gone wholly unnoticed. While receiving 10 Academy Award nominations, GANGS OF NEW YORK didn't receive one and CAPE FEAR and CASINO were blatantly disregarded by the Academy - a gross oversight and disappointment to all Scorcese fans. IMDb users have also chosen not to put CASINO on its top 250 list - another blow to this wonderful film.CASINO revolves around an ex-criminal Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro). Rothstein is the successful - albeit corrupt - owner of an illegally run casino in Las Vegas. Rothstein is running the casino successfully and without many hitches.Enter two big obstacles in the form of call girl Ginger (Sharon Stone)and psychotic friend (sort of like Tommy DeVito in GOODFELLAS) Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein marry's the irresistible Ginger and Nicky starts up a brutal mafia racket in Las Vegas, leading to the slow destruction of Rothstein and his empire.CASINO was brilliant. Supported by excellent acting and masterful direction, this film is one which must not be missed. Scorcese's Vegas is violent, sexy and, in parts, appealing and this three hour epic portrays this very well. CASINO is a not-to-be-missed gangster film that you cannot fully grasp without seeing it twice. However, I ask this of all IMDb users who love this film: GET IT UP TO THE TOP 250!!!",

It's release date is irrelevant, however similar, since stories make up movies, not release dates.With that said, Casino is a striking and glittering rise and fall epic depicting the mafias' crooked grip on an early Las Vegas. Based on a true story, it stars Robert Deniro as Sam \"Ace\" Rostien, a dead-on and almost obsessively methodical gambler used and highly appreciated by mob bosses to run an efficient money machine named The Tangiers Hotel and Casino- an establishment, like all others at that time, whose initial investments were OK'd by the mob. Joe Pesci stars as Nicki Santuro, who works under the same bosses to protect their golden child, while Sharon Stone plays Ginger, a high-end Casino hustler who sooner than later wins Ace's rare affection in one sparkling moment while in his Casino. James Woods reaches the pinnacle of genuine sleaziness as Lester Diamond, a childhood friend of Ginger's and bottom of the barrel moocher and hustler. The film, using voice over and gliding explanatory takes, encompasses a brutal and almost \"behind the scenes\" type story of what went on in the early years of sin city, before commercial giants put their foot down and legally out financed everyone else. Under the guidance of Martin Scorsese, rich characters are proudly lived out by Deniro, Stone, Pesci, and Woods even in his small role, who all fit their character to a T. Thanks to Robert Richardson as cinematographer (The Doors), Casino not only excels at being an exceptional tale of money and trust, but also arrests the viewers attention with whirring motion, glowing color, and beautifully composed framing and lighting. The ever popular Soprano's has nothing on this movie. Music, locations, and editing serve the story as well, making it one of Scorsese's most solid works to date.",

Good lord this film is wasted potential. It's from one of my favourite directors and it has a great cast (hell even in this mess of a film the performances are pretty good), and the last Scorsese mob film is a contender for my favourite film of all time, and yet, this film was a near-complete waste of time. So what went wrong? Well, really this film suffered a death of a thousand cuts. I'll tell you this, the film certainly did not start out strong with opening credits that went on way too damn long and were quite dull, and on top of that even the music playing over the credits was sub-par. For that matter, I really didn't like a lot of the score/soundtrack for this film (in fact a few times I found the songs used rather distracting), which is saying something because this is a Martin Scorsese film and usually I love the soundtracks in his films, which brings me to this film's use of voice-over narration. As everyone and their mother knows, Martin Scorsese is usually very good at knowing how to use voice-over narration. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street, and the Irishman are all in my opinion films where voice-over is done brilliantly, so it pains me to say this voice-over in this film is terrible. For one thing, it's much too overused. Seriously, I was half an hour in and I think there had been like maybe 5 minutes where there wasn't a narrator talking. It does get better, but it's still overused. For another thing, I just didn't like the voice-over narration. Something about De Niro's voice I think, but I just didn't like it very much. This film gets compared a lot to Goodfellas, and while I can definitely see the basis of the comparison, Goodfellas is the far superior film. For example, while both films are rise-and-fall stories, Goodfellas does that job a lot better, whereas here I was left saying \"not much of a rise in this rise-and-fall story is there\", and even the fall was rather lacklustre. More than anything though, this film just really wasn't very interesting. It was extremely dull and I had to resist the urge to turn the damn thing off the entire time. What I liked about this film I didn't like that much, and what I disliked really really bothered me.",

Flawless, beautiful, bad ... brilliant is what Casino is. Las Vegas, the late Seventies, early Eighties, a place in the middle of nowhere set up only to make money for the big bosses and the fast hustlers. Just like Deniro puts it: the players don't stand a chance. Of course with lots of money comes lots of trouble ... and lots of killing. Joe Pesci is Nicky Santorro, a rough-and-ready but nevertheless smart bully with his own gang ready to hit the jackpot in Vegas by robbing from every booky he can get his hands on and stealing jewelery from the rich gamblers. Paragraphs of words that you wouldn't say in the presence of your parents come and go like little children in a candy store. It's the dialogues and the way they are thrown in your face that makes this movie so impressive, really. If you you like strong dialogues, genius and hysterical acting and are totally in for the maffia way of life on screen then you should get a hold of this one because you will be blown away, I guarantee you. Goodfellas was fantastic, but in my opinion this one is even better.",

Casino kinda reminded me of what was going on in GoodFellas which was released 5 years before Casino in 1990. While GoodFellas was mainly focused on a story full of gangsters in NYC, Casino tells us a story of them controlling those guys. It was very interesting and fascinating about how these people in Las Vegas running a Casino club and controlling the money and then fall from the heights of power when things start catching up to them. For example, when Nicky and his brother were beaten to death by their own crew just shows that sometimes you gotta be careful who your doing business with. An amazing film and a great worth of time for you to watch it if you haven't seen it before.",

Santoro? or devito ?the point is i dont think there is any difference . 7/10",

But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who \"stole\" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose. The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film. However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters.

Robert DeNiro is completely believable as casino operator Sam Rothstein, and Joe Pesci delivers a frightening performance as the psychotic Nicky Santoro. With great attention to detail, great historical accuracy, and graphic realism that will make all but the most hardened movie- goers cringe, Scorcese delivers a full- throttle look at the mafia in Sin City before their fall in the mid- 80s. Definitely worth your time, if you can handle brutally realistic violence and non- stop profanity. The only thing that prevents this from getting a 10 out of 10 in my books is the fact that I personally found the character of Ginger, Rothstein's wife, to be slightly too prevalent, and to have received too much screen time.

Goodfellas, however, really impressed me, and Casino, following in the same tradition as Goodfellas, scores big time as well. Like Goodfellas, it knows how to tell an intriguing story, makes its characters complex, and does not establish any heroes within its cast. The actors work remarkably well as an ensemble, not letting either of the three be the star, and displaying reality and charisma to their roles without becoming campy.Casino works in the same way as The Godfather did, telling a fascinating tale of the mob, murder, corruption, and power. It does not give us anything that we don't want, having spectacular camerawork in the traditional Scorsese fashion, but not removing anything from the actual story. Going against what some have stipulated, De Niro and Pesci do not reprise their parts from Goodfellas; these characters have their own meat and style to them. Casino reminded me of the reason why I love movies; hopefully Scorsese will continue in the same tradition as this in the future, and not jerk me around like he sometimes does.

            "content": "Since GOODFELLAS, Scorsese's gone beyond Great Director status; his talent, vision and confidence, combined with his unofficial coronation among serious moviehounds as King of the Medium, have elevated him to Virtuoso. Every one of his 90s projects feature staggering camera movement, audacious violence, tour-de-force visual setpieces. The opening of this film - DeNiro spinning up and out of an exploding Caddy in glittering slo-mo, segueing into credits superimposed over state-of-the-art montage work...your opinion of the film's morality aside, it's the kind of jaw-dropping stunner that has become a Scorsese trademark. Like the Copa sequence in GOODFELLAS, it's the unbridled brio of a director who has not just Arrived, but occupies a plateau where his only remaining competition is with himself. If only he had the ability to pull back now and then and maintain some perspective...but his style of complete immersion into the story he is telling, more and more often these days, leaves him adrift without a moral compass here. And, Lord, could CASINO use one. It's not simply the violence on display, but the soul-dead callousness of every last living, creeping or crawling thing in the film that numbs me even as I'm awed by the compositional fireworks of the filmmaking. Everyone in this film is either vicious and corrupt, or weak and corrupt, and several characters are both at once. The 'love' story between DeNiro and a shrill, hollow Sharon Stone is like a sick parody of romantic love. The gangster/buddy angle is nil, as we see from frame one that De Niro and Pesci's 'friendship' is mutually suspicious and parasitic. The Vegas 'backstory' angle, which dominates the first hour, is visually riveting as you'd expect - Scorsese employs every type of shot in the lexicon of moviemaking here, taking the viewer on the ultimate insider's tour of how a casino operates - all in the service of the most cynical of themes: the fix is in, there are only predators and prey, and the prey deserve their agony - otherwise they'd be in on the feeding frenzy. This is part of the increasingly ugly side of Scorsese: his conscious sacrifice of any moral center, the better to solidify his appeal to the sociopath audience, probably embodied in the gangster types he grew up with in Little Italy. Or am I alone in noticing that the amoral-adolescent audience (of ALL ages) who fetishize unfeeling 'hardness' respond and identify so strongly with his latter-day work, almost as visual aids to help achieve a zen-like serenity in ruthlessness? I've heard audiences laugh in approving hilarity at some of the most appalling brutality in his films, dating back to RAGING BULL but really emerging with GOODFELLAS, which parallels his increasing disregard for protagonists who represent any kind of moral conflict. The Joe Pesci of RAGING BULL was a torn and vulnerable individual; the Pesci of CASINO is a conscienceless thug, period. You feel nothing when he dies, not even revulsion at the blood and viscera of the scene. He's one more fly whose time has come to have his wings pulled off. There are no more Charlies (of MEAN STREETS) in Scorsese's urban films, or even Travis Bickles, to truly disturb an audience by awakening their own dormant conflicting emotions. There are only Max Cadys, Nicky Santoros, Jimmy Conways. Heroes, even nominal ones, are quickly trivialized into hypocrites, cowards, rats and larval psychopaths. One wonders if Scorsese, for all his brilliance, could have ascended so high in the current pop-culture firmament without throwing out any belief in something better than remorseless efficiency and murder-as-commerce like so much sentimental ballast. He could have been, still can be, the Michaelangelo of cinema. Of course, Goya was a great artist too, but how long before he abandons being Goya for Joe Coleman?",

            "review_title": "The usual comparison with GoodFellas",
            "content": "First up, you definitely need to be in the mood to see this movie. I can watch a three hour movie no problem but with this movie It can really feel like three hours if you are just watching it for the sake of something to watch. Comparison with GoodFellas is inevitable and personally, I think that both movies are just as good as each other. Casino has certain qualities that GoodFellas lacks and GoodFellas has certain qualities that Casino lacks. Casino doesn't quite have the density of secondary characters that enriched the world of GoodFellas. It really felt like a community but then, that was the point of GoodFellas; that Henry Hill was being invited into a big family of sorts and that he would witness it's love and appeal but also it's horror and debauchery. Casino is more centred around 'Ace' Rothstein and Nicky Santoro. The secondary characters are there to provide their cog in the story and then go home. However, Casino has more grit and really conveys the pomp and greed surrounding the so-called \"high\" society of Vegas, not just the pathetic punters. It is also a benefit to hear of how the casinos work under the gaze of the Mob through the heavy use of voice-oveR. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are a fantastic double act and one cannot hide a certain envy towards Scorsese that he is able to wield the acting might of these two in his movies. Just seeing them having an argument is an acting tour de force (whatever that means, but I know it's positive). It's amazing that, like Temeura Morrison in 'Once Were Warriors', in that little scene with his son, Joe Pesci can make Nicky Santoro seem sympathetic. This must surely be the hallmark of a great actor. These are two actors at the top of their game under one of the greatest directors of all time, not just today. Enjoy. That said, Sharon Stone is as good as the madonna-cum-whore, Ginger, who starts the movie as a real figure in the world of gambling but ends up as a spiteful junkie, not even caring towards her child. I have not seen many of her films but I am sure that, just like Bruce Willis, if given the right roles or right director, she can act as good as the best of them. The supporting players such as; Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and L.Q. Jones manage to make their characters fresh and interesting in the time space given to them. The violence is one thing that people always comment on when it comes to this film. There is no doubt that it is pretty strong violence but what gets me is that the scene where Nicky stabs that man with the pen never gets a mention whereas the 'head-in-a-vice' scene always does. I see the pen scene as being a whole lot more graphic and shocking than the vice scene. This is because, with the vice scene, you get a couple of big warnings before hand so you know what will happen (also, the violence is more suggested, even though you can see what is happening to the victim, you do not see the gory details). With the pen scene, however, it takes you totally off guard. The close up of the pen entering the neck is more akin to Hostel than GoodFellas. It certainly took me off guard. What I want to talk about, finally, is the climax. Is it a climax? If so, it is a very played out climax. Maybe because it concerns the fates of several characters in the movie as opposed to just one big bad guy. Certainly Nicky's fate is drawn and bloody and the re-invention of Vegas is a part of that climax. It is a frank and final ending to the film and probably very fitting, as it shows us that crime doesn't pay for some people. In conclusion, I think that Casino is a definite Scorsese classic and one that should gain as much praise as his more lauded works. Despite some minor quibbles, it is up there with the better of Hollywood movies and hopefully will mature as time goes on rather than being regarded as the naughty younger brother of GoodFellas",

But...This is one of the most disgusting and revolting movies I've ever seen. I had to take a bath after seeing it. Right through this movie, I kept asking my self, \"Do I REALLY want to know about these lowlifes??\".I promised myself that I would never watch it again - I'm only posting now after having recently read the book of the actual events. Far, far worse than \"Goodfellas\" (No, I'm not talking about moviemaking here).",

            "content": "\"Casino\" is basically a spiritual sequel to \"Goodfellas\": Martin Scorsese reunites Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent to tell the tale of a mobster's violent rise and fall in 1970s America. \"Casino\" isn't quite as good as \"Goodfellas,\" but it's still a great movie in its own right. Scorsese, the master, avoids remaking \"Goodfellas\" by introducing new themes of doomed love and Catholic guilt that help to create a layered, engaging story. As he did before with New York City (and later with Boston) Scorsese uses the city of Las Vegas perfectly as a setting, portraying it as a sleepless town of bright lights and flashy cars ready to be taken advantage of by the American underworld. We experience the energy and excitement of the city's nightlife just as the characters do, and we understand why they'd want to escape to this lonely city in the desert where their dreams could come true - only for them to be dashed on the rocks of dirty money and broken relationships.As always in a Scorsese picture the cast is excellent. Every actor is amazing in \"Casino\", especially Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. My favorite aspect of the movie is Robert Richardson's cinematography, which uses lighting and color to emphasize the film's dynamic setting and create a haunting atmosphere during the film's scenes of gangster violence. On nearly every level \"Casino\" is a great movie - except the pacing. This movie doesn't need to be three hours long; the third act in particular drags well past its sell-by date. And while Scorsese didn't replicate \"Goodfellas\" when he made \"Casino,\" he still tells a familiar story that had already been done better before. Between \"Casino\" and \"Goodfellas\" I easily prefer the latter, but that doesn't mean \"Casino\" isn't a great movie. 9/10.",

The voice-overs work perfectly on De Niro, while Pesci gives the most explosive performance of the film, even better than he is in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone is perfect and should have won the Oscar. Amazingly, this film is the telling of a true story, based on Nick Pilleggi's novel. Great storytelling and the supporting cast is good,too. Scorsese doesn't use score, he uses source music, just like in Goodfellas. The use of source music fits in this story as it covers the 60's to the 80's. Underrated movie, although Stone was nominated, but nobody else, give me a break. Another thing I like, none of the acting is over-dramatic, they deal with the issues as they are.",

It's the film that never sleeps. The characters interact on a 22/7 basis and maintains a strong atmospheric intensity throughout. The end though is much like that in Goodfellas, where all the top-men who know something end up getting wacked by the Mafia. An done of the best thing about this film, as all sorcessee fans probably know, is that there's nothing false or 'Americanised' about it, it is written from a first person's perspective.

            "review_title": "Scorsese's most compelling drama",
            "content": "Totally compelling to watch. Robert De Niro at 43 years of age packs his best performance since Goodfellas! I've always admired De Niro as an actor. His narrating, acting, and undeniable talent as an actor is there for all to see. It may not quite be the movie Goodfellas was. But, I'd put it 2nd best in the whole MOB Movie franchise. A strong, ambitious story about a multi-million dollar Casino deep in the lively city of Las Vegas set back in the year 1983. Mr Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro)is given the opportunity of a lifetime to take on the job of running the huge Tangiers Casino, the biggest casino in Las Vegas. He marries the beautiful sexy wildcard \"Ginger\" McKenna played by the gorgeous Sharon Stone who looks elegantly dazzling. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's bodyguard or \"Muscle\" if you like. His job is to make sure nobody messes around with the golden jewel. Later on Sam's relationship with Ginger totally disintegrates leaving Sam and their daughter Amy in an out of control situation with the circumstances resulting in the crazed Sharon Stone going on a rampage of madness until she finally gets arrested by an FBI agent and taken to jail. Nicky Santoro also has every FBI agent in the city watching him with great suspicion thinking he (which he was) behind multiple murder plots. The problem was that they always had to let Nicky go because there were never, ever any witnesses or evidence that he murdered these people. Very late on into the Movie near the end, Nicky and his brother (His closest friend) named Dominic are mercilessly & tenaciously beaten down in acres of cornfield around the desert of Las Vegas and buried alive in holes & filled with sand. The scene is excruciating to watch as the beating is realistic and extremely graphic to watch. Nicky's friend Frankie was responsible as he had basically just had enough of Nicky's evil behaviour and finally puts an end to his dominance. Frankie and his murder plot chums use wooden baseball bats and metal crowbars and whack Nick & his brother with them very hard. Seconds after Mr Rothstein faces a NDE as a bomb is planted under his car. Ace survives with minor burns thanks to a device under his seat that saved his life. He is seen on a stretcher being wheeled into an ambulance with the emergency docs saying \"You sure are lucky, mister.\" Everyone should take precaution that this movie isn't for the faint of heart and contains incredibly graphic and realistic torture scenes that should not be watched by people who can't watch bloody scenes. Also there is around 600+ swear words including 430 uses of the infamous F-word including 3 racial slurs which should also be avoided if you dislike profanity. The Acting is absolutely outstanding and spot on though with a great cast, story, and director. Movie Tag: \"No one stays at the top forever\"",

DeNiro and Pesci again make a dynamic duo here. One of the greatest assets in my opinion was getting to see plenty of Sharon Stone's gorgeous legs. The whole main cast was above and beyond...plus being an Alan King fan, this made the movie a plus to me.However, there are some senses that I felt should never been in the movie, but being by Nicholas Pileggi's book, they were. Unforgettable scores by many big 60s and 70s bands, all the way up to the 80s.Overall, a very impressive film, despite the length, which was great, but maybe more elements could have been added.

Now, here we have Sharon Stone. Her character is so imbalanced, from the time she is introduced, to the end, that there really is no justification for it. Here are some major flaws with her performance/character: * She's on top of the world at the beginning.* She snags a millionaire playboy, Sam.* She still has feelings for Lester (ragged James Woods).* Golddigger.* Child endangerment issues.* Screws Nicky (Pesci) several times.* Druggie.Now, what kind of a woman, for no real reason at all, would ditch the rather handsome Sam, to screw Lester and Nicky. Her character is so unreasonable, that we want to see her killed, like Nicky and his brother. All scenes, without Stone, are quite enthralling.

            "content": "Casino is an excellent and very accurate portrayal of events that shape a part of the recent history of Las Vegas. For those of us who have been in Las Vegas for the last 30 years or more, we well remember Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal (portrayed in the film as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein), the diminutive but brutally violent Anthony \"The Ant\" Spilotro (Nicky Santoro), casino front man Alan Glick (Philip Green), and the early days of the Stardust Hotel (The Tangiers). We also recall Spilotro's crew, \"The Hole in the Wall Gang\" who, as depicted in the film, were notorious for jewelry store heists wherein their method of entry was, yes, drilling holes in the walls. Rosenthal ran more than one casino at the height of his authority, including the Fremont, Hacienda, and Marina Hotels.Of course, the time lines in the film have been doctored a bit for the sake of story-telling. For instance, the man (named Bill McCarthy) who's head Spilotro (Santoro) put in a vise and tightened to the point of popping an eye out of it's socket actually occurred back in Chicago, prior to Spilotro being sent to Vegas to protect Rosenthal and the Stardust's skim. Incidentally, Spilotro was first sent to Miami to function in the same capacity of protecting Rosenthal. In the film, Santoro's reputation was primarily built through the torture and murder of the fella in the vise. In reality, Spilotro's reputation was well in place, at least among the wise guys, by the time he arrived in Las Vegas. As for Rosenthal, we remember his awful television show after his first tangle with the GCB although, to this day, Lefty emphatically denies ever juggling on the show as Deniro did in the movie! Though, another truth in the film, once the increasingly power-hungry and reckless Spilotro became involved with Rosenthal's wife, Geri (Ginger in the movie), things were already going downhill. In 1986, the bodies of Anthony and Michael Spilotro were found buried in an Indiana cornfield. They had been bludgeoned to near-death prior to being buried. The amount of dirt in their lungs indicated they had been buried alive. Geri Rosenthal was, indeed, found dead in a California motel from a \"hot load\", a drug overdose. Alan Glick still resides in California (if memory serves) in a well fortified residence, likely still wary of retribution for his role, ignorance aside, in the downfall of the enterprise.Nicholas Pileggi got a lot of it right, as did Martin Scorsese. Casino is a great film. It was an extremely interesting time in Las Vegas in the 70's and 80's, one that I am not likely to ever forget.

Superb story based on events that happened in real life.Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movie and those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst the grey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others' accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personal uselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time. Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's always someone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if you screw things up.",

Like Leaving Las Vegas, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or Vegas Vacation. Even some dull video for the city to attract tourists would have been an improvement.Imagine Goodfellas without Ray Liotta and his oddly charming narration. You'll end up with something like this. Basically a remake minus the only interesting character. It'd be like making Pirates with just Orlando Bloom and that anorexic girl and her freakishly long neck. EAT SOMETHING! Wear shoulder pads too. Every time I see the end of that movie where she's standing way up over the rocks it looks like her head is going to fall right off that skinny neck of hers. I just can't watch it. And I can't watch this either, but that's not her fault. It's just two guys doing the same thing they've done a million times before sleepwalking for 3 hours so they can pick up an easy paycheck while that guy with the big eyebrows sits back and tells them to hurry up and get it over with so he can ditch them and start a new life with Leonardo DiCaprio. And who can blame him. Leo is younger and much more handsome.",

But this one made it less entertaining, always having concern for my neighbours on my mind. Disturbing them bigtime. DUH! Recently, I heard, they had details of this movie from an insider, which made it even more appealing for me to watch.In the end, it's down to Las Vegas, it's show, it's showing off, it's mobster, it's betrayal, it's cheating, it's about gambling.Well made, entertaining though three hours of movie time.

Of course they are going to take dramatic liberties as all films do but it's still close to what really happened. Even Frank Cullotta (Who's story it's based on) played a hitman in the film and did versions of the hits he participated with in real life. Pesci is fantastic as always. Sharon Stone as well. Only thing for me that was a source of annoyance was the accents. We from Chicago don't sound like NYC people. It's a harder accent to mimic than NYC but it is doable.

Consider yourself warned, but don't cheat yourself out of watching a masterpiece. Just keep the remote control handy.In this film, both the camera and the soundtrack are characters in themselves.  Scorsese's lens clings lovingly to De Niro, who gives one of his best performances.  I agree with other comments that the first 40 minutes are outstanding and completely draw you in.  After setting up this universe, Scorsese literally demolishes it.  What really struck me was the haunting sense of inescapable doom the viewer feels as everything unravels right before your eyes.

Martin Scorsese's fascinating film \"Casino\" knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. It's based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who had full access to a man who once ran four casinos for the mob, and whose true story inspires the movie's plot. As IMDb rightly puts it it is a film of greed , money , power and most importantly deception. In terms of acting De Niro steals the show as 'Sam Rothstein' as well as Sharon Stone who also portrays a very convincing performance. I believe the explanation of how 'Rothstein' runs the Casino are the most intriguing scene's of the whole film (as in how it is shot and acted) with De Niro giving us an 'in absolute character' performance. My only dislike for the film is what most people have recognised when watching it and that is it's similarity to 'Goodfellas' ( characters and narrative) and the fact that Joe Pesci plays the same little angry Italian everytime but this pales in comparison to the positives. Ultimately , having of finally watched this film after years of wanting to i regard it as one of the best of that decade and recommend it highly.",

Pesci is his same great self... and De Niro shows us once again why he is the best actor of the last few decades.  I found that this story was very engaging and the insight it offered behind Las Vegas, crime, and casinos was very interesting.  The direction of this movie is superb... each scene carries emotion and brilliance.  I truly believe this movie deserves to earn a much higher IMDB rating.

One of the flaws of 'Goodfellas' though was Robert de Niro playing a dull character. Well, guess what? Scorsese thought it'd be interesting if that de Nero character had a whole movie to himself. De Nero gives a fine acting performance that lends itself to a believable character. But it's just hard to get over the fact that he's playing a manager at a casino.Our two other big stars are Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. I really wasn't crazy about either. Pesci could care less when he read one of his many voice over narrations. And it was 50/50 if he actually did something of note when acting. A far cry from his 'Goodfellas' performance. Sharon Stone was just a lot to take in. Her sophistication and smarts at the start of the film melt away as soon as she marries de Nero.This is definitely a good mob movie. Yet it can't be called a masterpiece. The three hour run time definitely feels it, the acting is hit or miss, and voice over narration enables a bad tendency in Scorsese of having drawn out stories.",

Just about the only thing there to remind you that this is a 3-hour film is the fact you have to get up and change video cassettes 2/3's of the way in.  While the film is not as great as Scorsese's other mafia epic \"Goodfellas\", it is told in the same narrative style and lets you view the other side of the mob in Las Vegas. DeNiro is once again dynamic in his role as a Casino operator and Joe Pesci (one of the most underrated film actors of his generation, save for the Oscar he got for \"Goodfellas\") gives one of his patented high energy, ruthless and funny performances as the Mafia enforcer from New York who is sent to Vegas by the mob to keep things in line in Vegas.  Sharon Stone also does a surprisingly good job in her role as a strung out gambler and former call-girl that becomes the apple in DeNiro's eye, easily the best performance of her career.  But the film is not about individual performances, per-se, like \"Goodfellas\", the film is an exercise in brilliant story telling, style and superb filmmaking skill.  The visuals, colors and images in this film are among the most mesmerizing of any Scorsese film since \"Taxi Driver\" and as many IMDB users have noted, the soundtrack of the film is among the best in film history and is used perfectly along the way and plays an important part in the storytelling. This is among an elite class of mob movies and an excellent film on its own rites.  How Martin Scorsese has never won a \"Best Director\" Oscar in all these years of brilliance is Hollywood's greatest mystery.  Lets hope he's due for a \"Lifetime Achievement\" one pretty soon.

The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself.",

DeNiro and Pesci have performed their respective roles so many times they could do them in their sleep, but the singular performance comes from Stone, who shows a range and skill heretofore unseen. Her fight scenes with DeNiro are jaw-dropping in their intensity.\nThere can be too much of a good thing, and this movie proves it. Better editing could have made it a true classic, but it drags at points and brings in too many secondary characters, thus losing focus. It's worth watching, but it's not for the squeamish or for those with short attention spans.",

It's much deeper than, and the metaphores are obvious. Martin Scorsese always uses religious elements, usually Catholic, in his movies to accentuate the story, but here he decided to go for the big one and tell the classical tale of God.Yeah, you heard me. God. It's so obvious that it surprises me that no other reviewer has mentioned this. It's simple, DeNiro's character is God, trying to create order in this thing he has created, while Pesci's character is Lucifer, always rebellious, always trying to break free and create something of his own. Pesci's character is even named Nick, which is an old name for Satan.",

            "content": "Ehh. Everybody compares this movie to Goodfellas (which was one of the most horrendous movies I've seen that wasn't outright 'bad') but in truth it was much better. It was much worse than what Scorcese is capable of at the top of his game, however, which makes it watchable. Dancing around the theme of redemption, like so many Scorcese films, it tells of Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a crook trying to redeem himself and go straight, and who ends up running a fancy casino. Awesome, right? Wrong. He falls in love with a hooker (Ginger), marries her, and then his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci, playing a trigger-happy psycho for once!) comes and wants his share of what Vegas has to offer. Except Nicky's not even trying to go straight. Ginger ends up an abusive, cheating junkie bitch on wheels, and Nicky, by virtue of his relations with Ace, ends up messing Ace's life up in a big way. A main theme in this movie is trust - Ace begins with saying there can be no love without trust, and by the end it turns out Ace shouldn't have trusted anybody. Robert De Niro gave a pretty good performance - nothing compared, of course, to Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, or The King of Comedy - but he is from head to toe a fundamentally good guy with his head on right, who in fact tends to live too much in his head until he crashes for Ginger. He recovers quickly enough, though, and although he isn't perfect, we want him to win. One of the interesting points of the performance is that even though Ace is so logical and tough, when he gets hurt it's unbearable. Joe Pesci was OK, nothing compared to his performance in Raging Bull of course, and while I'm tempted to say Sharon Stone was awful she wasn't that bad. In my opinion Scorcese was a lot better before all the expensive sets and frou-frou camera-work. It just gets in the way of his message. I guess ultimately it's about how your life adds up at the end of the day, and how you can escape your past. It's got a very Catholic tone to it with respect to absolution - it seems to convey the thought that if you're just sorry enough for your sins, everything will work out.",

However, this movie was very underrated, and was a great film! I'll mention some points. POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!  Martin Scorcesse has many gifts, but one of them is knowing how to put the perfect music in a scene. The songs in the movie were perfect in every scene. Especially \"House of the Rising Sun\" at the end, when everyone got whacked. Another point was great acting. Deniro should have been at least nominated for an Oscar, and Sharon Stone did a very good job. The best acted scene in the movie was when RD went to that restaurant, and met SS after she tied up their kid. Deniro was SO good in that scene. It's brief, but great!!  ANOTHER POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! Also, the violence was brutal, especially at the end. Where you see about 5 people get shot in the head. Nasty. Also... BIG SPOILER!!!  is when Pesci and his brother were beaten to death with the bats. Very bloody, and gross. However, I REALLY love this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone!!!",

And I believe that Casino is better than Goodfellas, but not by much. This film is very in depth about the lives of gangsters and how casinos are managed. Parts of Casino feel like a documentary. Robert De Niro delivers one of his best performances as Ace. Sharon Stone is unbelievably believable as Ginger, who drastically changes as the film continues. Joe Pesci steels the movie yet again, playing Nicky, who acts very similar to the character that he played in Goodfellas. The lighting is beautiful and very shiny. Scorsese pulled it off once again.

The best performances in the movie come from Sharn Stone, the uptight weasel-y wife of Deniro's character, and the best performance goes to the ultra slippery snake weasel character played by James Woods. And in the spirit of Scorsese, expect to hear a lot of great music numbers throughout.

Secondly,the plot is more complex as a result. It interweaves the lifes of gangsters, professional gamblers, pimps into the corrupt day to day workings of a las vegas casino and thirdly the ending has far more conclusion to it than goodfellas.Yes Goodfellas has a better Soundtrack but casino has epic classical music which symbolises this idea of extreme power, the casino being a form of heaven and the casino manager(Robert Deniro)playing a metaphorical god.It is certainly underrated and certainly should be placed higher up in a pedastool.Believe me this film is stunning, this film is a classic and this film is the best of all gangster films.

But, I'll even go so far as to say that it works better now.Ways in which \"Casino\" is better than \"Goodfellas\":1) The setting is better. 2) The story is deeper and more complex. 3) The characters are much better developed. 4) DeNiro is brilliant in a bigger role. 5) Pesci is great in a much better role. (His character isn't so 1-dimensional.) 6) Sharon Stone is great in her best performance. 7) James Woods is excellent in a supporting role.In addition, the movie contains one scene which I consider to be one of the greatest ever.  It was the scene late in the movie in which Pesci's and DeNiro's characters meet to air out their differences.  Two great actors meet with the desert as a backdrop in the movie's key scene.\"Let's get one thing straight.  I'm what matters out here, not you and your f**king casino, or your f**king TV show.\" ...The story is very well-told, even if it's a little longer than it needs to be.  But, the scenes where Sharon Stone and James Woods are fighting with De Niro (the obvious places for substantial edits) are such compelling acting/drama that I wouldn't want the movie to be any shorter.\"Goodfellas\" falls just shy of \"Casino\" in so many ways.  Had \"Goodfellas\" been made later, not only would it be considered \"Casino 2\" but it would not even be held in as high regard as \"Casino\" is now.Scorsese improved upon what was a great movie-making formula.",

The gorgeous shots of the casinos with Scorsese's stylist approach are amazing. Go watch Casino- It is one of the best films of the 90s.",

            "content": "Las Vegas is a mythical place, a yellow brick road destination that came into being on the backs and bucks of men on the fringes of society who weren't constricted by petty, hypocritical morality. Naturally, it's a town of broken losers, desperate dreamers, and cold remorseless opportunists. So the most definitive, most emblematic American city is a paradox, promising pleasure but thriving on pain. This is the grim landscape that Casino occupies and Martin Scorsese is our gracious tour guide, pointing out all the garish, notorious landmarks with near reverential diligence.DeNiro is convincing as the Jewish numbers expert Casino manager, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, beholden to the mob and loyal to his would-be tough guy boyhood buddy, Nicky Santoro, played flawlessly by Joe Pesci, who shows up in town and complicates Ace's life. Ace has complicated things for himself, too, by hooking up with ex top dollar whore, Ginger McKenna, played by a raw and riveting Sharon Stone. Ginger's alcohol and drug soaked mind leads her into the arms of the wrong guy, the worst possible guy, setting the stage for an inevitable tragic showdown. No one escapes unpunished, but then again no one entered the game innocent.It's a chilling image of a fiery hot world, burning white on the fumes of people's hope and fear, but it's a vision that's somehow sympathetic to the sad, twisted souls who choose to inhabit this godforsaken outpost. There's never an easy score, never an unearned jackpot. Every nickle and dime in Casino is hard fought, paid for with blood, sweat, and tears. It's often gruesome to witness the brutal depravity that passes for human behavior in Scorsese's films but it's never depressing. There's a sinister satisfaction to be found in all his dangerous, dark shenanigans, just like when you finally accept that you do in fact enjoy seeing other people get hurt. Or get killed.It's not as groundbreaking or as awe inspiring as Raging Bull, or as epic as Goodfellas, or as ambitious as either. It's a somewhat more nuanced, mature version of that patented Scorsese style, this time not so much rejoicing in the opportunity to depict unconscionable violence, but certainly not ashamed of it's lurid excesses. If you choose to see all this as an expression of the curious - maybe demented - American psyche, then Scorsese has done his job. I think he's done it damn well.",

In contrast, Casino delivers an interesting and unique twist, because it is set in Las Vegas which is special in this context. Add the superb acting performances and ingenious direction, and we are talking about an uncovered diamond.Casino is one of those movies that will either increase in value over the years, or become lost and then rediscovered by a new generation of movie buffs who will then be puzzled why this gem was missed by the contemporaries...",

I agree with all previous comments that 45 minutes to an hour could have been left on the cutting room floor, occassionally it felt like I was watching the same scene two or three different times.

To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.",

Every movie with gangsters in it will have the same kind of characters because that is the characters the mob is filled with, smart ones, raging bulls, good earners etc. There is a Nickey character in every mob, a hard raging machine that you just don't mess with because he will fly off the handle, their is someone like his boss Remo who seems calm and cool but was the most important man in the mob and he just needs to push a button and thats it lights out, then there are good earners like Ace who may not be Italian and cant be made, but they are around because they are useful and smart and great at making money for them.

The only real problem with this film is it's similarity to Goodfellas. A lot of the plot points and characters can be directly compared to Goodfellas even down to the casting.

Casino takes many chances with the plot but it is wonderfully voiced-over by Ace and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci). I believe the voice-overs makes Casino interesting because it feels as if we are eavesdropping in a secret place.

Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone. The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . An easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us. And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration. This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything. As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here. Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more. But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell. What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob (Robert DeNiro) who wants to be a big player. His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be \"legit\" in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.",

I don't say that lightly, as there are a lot of great movies and mankind has done a lot of amazing things for us in the past 100 years, but Casino really is one of those movies that you would like to think every other movie since its release should try and live up to in terms of quality. The performance out of Sharon Stone is just amazing, Scorsese uses her to her best and you really feel that any other movie Sharon Stone has done just might have been wasting her true talents. Of course Scorsese is the real talent here and Casino is way up there with Goodfellas (although not as good as Goodfellas, but the fact that Casino is still one of the great movies of our time is just a testament to Scorsese's skills.Of course this is an R rated movie, it has liberal use of violence, language and drug use, so it is not one for your kids. But even though it has a lot of violence and such, not once did I feel I was offended, only that I was experiencing the movie exactly as Scorsese intended it. And I think it's safe to say that he intended it to be a masterpiece.You could point out a billion technical faults with Casino, but I would never see anything wrong with it. Although I don't feel it does it justice, as it seems many critics are happy to give full marks to any old movie, I give Casino an honest 10 out of 10, five stars and a highly recommended tag.",

The story is absorbing, and there are some compelling stretches - unfortunately these do not last. The major flaw for me is that the film is overlong for the story it tells. Sharon Stone's performance is good, but I couldn't help but feel the confrontation scenes between Ace and Ginger were too similar. I think a little cutting could have turned this very good 3 hour film into a superb 2 1/4 hour film.The violence is very heavy-handed, possibly overdone, but doesn't detract from the characters. Good acting and some sublime visuals make this one worth your time. This is a solid Scorsese flick, which means it is very good indeed.James",

He doesn't play the typical Italian here. If he sees someone cheating at a table, he lets them go with a warning instead of killing them.Joe Pesci, on the other hand is very similar to the character he played in 'Goodfellas'. His job is to make sure that nobody messes with Ace. He ends up going too far. After sleeping with Ace's wife, not taking orders from the bosses back home and doing things his own way, it's obvious he has to suffer the consequences.Sharon Stone is at her best here as the gold digger and drunk wife.Overall, 'Casino' is a well acted movie, but as I said it's not for everyone to see.

Casino is only slightly inferior to Raging Bull, Taxi Driver being altogether the best, but Casino takes Scorsese back to his roots : the Mafia, although instead of having his native city New York as a setting, this time he chooses Las Vegas, with the casinos and (obviously) the cash. The story is roughly based on true authentic anecdotes from the 70s. It's about a master of gambling, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert de Niro), hired by the Mafia to control a casino, the Tangiers. He meets and marries a respected prostitute, Ginger (Sharon Stone), and one of his old friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), comes into town. The actors are excellent, Robert de Niro is just perfect as usual, Joe Pesci plays his usual small, but completely out of control, violent gangster and Sharon Stone is as beautiful as ever, getting less and less when she starts to drink and take drugs...things start well for the couple, but \"no one stays at the top forever\"...A great film, with superb travelings and shoulder-held camera-work by the director.

If you like Scorcese's style (pauses, tracking shots, voiceovers, Rolling Stones music) then this is well worth checking out.Having said that, it only ranks after Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Goodfellas.

Notice how Sam is lit much differently when he is in his home with Ginger, showing he does not have full control and does not have his god-like status there as he does in the Casino. **Trivia**: ** DID YOU KNOW... that the \"Tangiers\" Casino hotel (as they call the casino in the film) Was based on the Sands? **DID YOU KNOW*... *...That Casino is based on a true story and a lot of the names weren't changed. **Major film Inconsistency*: in the first scene, Sam is shown flying from his car in the car-bomb explosion but later when they show how it actually happened, he gets out of the car just as it's blowing up and is never blown out of it at at all.",

            "content": "I once saw a small piece of Casino, one of the later scenes in the movie between Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone. Based on the scene, without knowing what was going on, I formed a notion that the movie was another loudmouthed violence film. I mentally, subliminally, resisted seeing it for the six or seven years since, even after taking in Goodfellas. It was seeing The Departed--twice--that convinced me to look into the picture.Everything that can be said about its direction, camera-work, style, dialogue and overall quality has probably been said. But one thing that most reviewers have overlooked, and a nuance of the movie that I believe provides much pleasure in the watching, is how it addresses change. In this light we may interpret Scorcese's shots of coins running through the casino, like blood through veins, as sly visual clues.On into the movie, Pesci and Stone share a line about how DeNiro's character has \"changed.\" But one of the points Casino attempts to make is that no one really does change, no matter how hard they may or may not try, and no matter how hard someone tries to make them. After all of his friend's warnings and urgings, Pesci remains the hardheaded opportunist gangster; despite his old friend's growing disgust, DeNiro continues to try to make money within Vegas's politicized atmosphere; and Stone goes steadily along a destructive path to as much money and material goods as she can lay her hands on.One of the genius things about the film, if so instinctive and everyday for us viewers as to be almost subliminal, is that the story is situational. Situations change, relationships between characters may change, but the characters themselves rarely do. The ways they react to these changes around them may or may not be expected, but they are the ways real people would react. Pesci and DeNiro were always a thug and a penny-pincher, respectively, but they grew up as friends; their surroundings never created a conflict between them before they went to Vegas. Similarly, Stone always coveted the material, but her new relationship with DeNiro begins to strain her sense of independence.This is a movie that functions in layers of action and psychology: violence as a means to an end, the effects of power and greed, the straining of relationships, how we adapt to new situations, etc. All played out by a cast of very capable actors by the hand of a very able director.",

Even in comparison with the over-the-top Scarface, it lacks real value and true substance. Some scenes with Joe Pesci are memorable, but the rest of the movie seems like a waste of space. Scorsese's career revolved around mobster movies, and this was just too slow of a movie.

            "content": "\"Casino\" gives a gripping and fascinating inside view of the World's gambling mecca during the 1970's and early 1980's. The film is based on Nicholas Pilegg's true accounts of two childhood friends who end up running a casino and various businesses on behalf of the local mob \"back home.\" Las Vegas at this period in time wasn't about fun and glamour but greed and money. One difference that makes \"Casino\" stand out from other mob movies is the sense of \u00a0history of Vegas that Scorsese brings into the narrative. The city itself is as much a subject in \"Casino\" as the characters and plot. Las Vegas, due to its sheer profit and power had always let entrepreneurs, mobsters and even corporations flourish. However, relatively quickly Vegas destroyed them for its own financing and status before allowing others to come in and take their place.\u00a0\n\nRobert De Nero and Joe Pesci play the two friends, Ace and Nicky, who end up running their mob operation in Las Vegas. Throughout the movie both actors also add narration to some of the flashback scenes to give context which works to great effect. Sharon Stone is excellent as Ace's wife Ginger, an expert hustler who can't shake off her dark past including her former pimp Lester Diamond ( James Woods ). The story of \"Casino\" is told with Scorsese's usual meticulous eye for detail, high energy and pacing and he really gets the best once again from his two go to main actors. There are many regular Scorsese support actors and a host of cameos including Frankie Avalon, Steve Allen and future mayor of Las Vegas Oscar Goodman.\u00a0\n\nDespite the lengthy running time \"Casino\" is so fast paced that the time goes quickly. It's escalating tension and compelling story keeps engagement right until its rather sad concluding statement \" The big corporations took over, Today, it works like \"Disneyland\"",

            "content": "The great Martin Scorsese turns his cinematic eye from the 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas' of New York, to the Midwest mob's takeover of Las Vegas in this gangster film, another feather in his cap of classic gritty crime dramas. He once again teams up with his muse Robert De Niro and runner-up muse Joe Pesci. While it may seem as though they're simply re-inhabiting their 'Goodfellas' roles, the characters and performances here are different enough to worth noticing. De Niro's Sam Rothstein is something of a fussbudget, a sports handicapper who mingles with the mafia and helps them make a lot of money in gambling. He's detailed, precise, and knows the in-and-outs of winning money. So, naturally, they set him up  to run the Tangiers Casino. Pesci is Nicky, the enforcer sent to oversee and protect Sam and the casino operation. This isn't the gung-ho street cowboy from his Oscar-winning turn in 'Goodfellas.' His Nicky is a bit more subdued, if barely. He's an ambitious and greedy man, masking his violent tendencies under the guise of a big boss and family man. The most emotive role goes to Sharon Stone, and she plays the hell out of it. As Rothstein's wife, she plays a woman who knows how to charm and seduce the rich and powerful, but is underneath it all a broken girl and lifelong survivor who longs to just simply be cared for, and after a while only finds solace in pills and booze. Scorsese ably populates the supporting cast with faces that feel Vegas lived-in: James Woods is a manipulative pimp, Kevin Pollack is the clean-cut front man, Alan King is a connected Vegas insider, and the great Don Rickles just LOOKS like someone who been in Vegas a lifetime, even if he isn't here to score laughs. There's familiar voice-over, although it adds insight to the characters motivations, and there's more melodrama than one may expect from this genre. But the production values are first-rate, with cinematography, costume, set design, editing, and music brilliantly capturing the lurid seductiveness of this glitzy oasis in the middle of the desert. At three hours long, it's a hefty drama but Scorsese and his cast keep us fascinated and deliver a rather brisk movie, all things considered. It may not quite rank with his classics in the genre, but Scorsese knows how to fuse a gangster film with heft, gravitas, and even entertainment value",

Front man Philip Green serves as the casino and hotel CEO, but Sam unofficially runs everything. Sam quickly doubles the casino's profits, with cash skimmed directly from the count room and delivered to the Midwest Mafia bosses. Chicago boss Remo Gaggi sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to protect Sam and the casino. Nicky makes sure everyone is kept in line, but his own criminal activities start drawing too much media and law enforcement attention. He recruits his younger brother Dominick and childhood friend Frankie Marino to gather a crew that specializes in shakedowns, burglaries and jewelry heists. Nicky is eventually placed in the Nevada Black Book, banning him from every casino in Nevada. Sam meets and falls in love with beautiful hustler and former prostitute Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). In 1969 they have a daughter, Amy, and marry, but their marriage is quickly thrown into turmoil due to Ginger's relationship with her longtime boyfriend, con artist Lester Diamond. Sam has Nicky's crew beat Lester when they catch him accepting $25,000 from her. In the mid-1970s, Ginger's problems intensify as she turns to drugs and alcohol. In 1976, Sam fires slot manager Don Ward for incompetence. When Ward's brother-in-law, Clark County Commission chairman Pat Webb, fails to convince Sam to rehire Don, Webb arranges for Sam's gaming license to be denied, jeopardizing his position. Sam starts hosting a local television talk show from inside the casino, irritating both Nicky and the bosses back home for making himself such a public figure and bringing unneeded attention. Sam blames Nicky's recklessness for ongoing police and Nevada Gaming Board pressure, and the two argue furiously in the Mojave Desert. When the Midwest bosses discover that people on the inside are stealing from their skim, they install incompetent Kansas City underboss Artie Piscano to oversee the operation. Piscano ends up keeping detailed written records of the operation. Additionally, an FBI bug placed in Piscano's store for a separate crime catches him talking in detail about the skim, prompting a full investigation into the Tangiers Casino...\n\nUpon its release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, although their praise was more muted than it had been for the thematically similar Goodfellas, released only five years earlier, with some reviewers criticizing Scorsese for retreading familiar territory. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Impressive ambition and bravura performances from an outstanding cast help Casino pay off in spite of a familiar narrative that may strike some viewers as a safe bet for director Martin Scorsese.\" Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four, stating that \"Martin Scorsese's fascinating new film Casino knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. Like The Godfather it makes us feel like eavesdroppers in a secret place.\" He added, \"Unlike his other Mafia movies (Mean Streets and Goodfellas), Scorsese's Casino is as concerned with history as with plot and character.\" Philip Thomas of the Empire praised the film while highlighting its similarities to Goodfellas. He gave the film five stars commenting \"It may not be Scorsese's greatest work, but this guy feeling a little off-colour is still far, far better than most people on fighting-fit form. It only gets more impressive as time goes on.\" The film's critical profile has increased in years after its release, with several critics expressing that, in retrospect, they feel it is a more accomplished and artistically mature work than the thematically similar Goodfellas. (via Wikipedia)\n\nAs mentioned in the critical response \"Casino\" is a bit too similar to \"Goodfellas\", however this one feels even longer than the latter and it\u00b4s too slow and too talkative to me. We get a great cast by far, but that\u00b4s not enough as the storyline is not that intriguing and it just goes on and on. And I would argue that Pesci\u00b4s role, Nicky Santoro, is way too similar to his role in \"Goodfellas\". And to be honest, I dont\u00b4think this is amongst Stone's top performances despite the fact that she got a Golden Globe Award for her role as Ginger McKenna. I would argue that \"Goodfellas\" is a better film than \"Casino\". \n\nTriva: \"Casino\" was released in 1995 to a mostly positive critical reception, and was a worldwide box office success. Stone's performance was singled out for acclaim, earning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.",

It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.\n\nCasino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.\n\nThe story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.\n\nOverall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I loved seeing De Niro star in a serious, prestigious movie (I've not seen Raging Bull as of this writing and thought his Godfather Pt 2 turn was a little overrated) but he ended up helming a movie that I can't help but compare unfavorably to its fairly legendary peers. When the plot starts going off the rails in this one it becomes a little too frantic and the root cause of the turmoil was his tremendously bad decision to marry that lady in the first place; it wasn't a decision I could sympathize with and the resulting craziness felt like his just desserts.",

            "content": "A couple of wise guys take charge of a casino for back home.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's epic crime drama Casino (1995) is like if Mean Streets or Goodfellas largely took place in Las Vegas. It's very refined and slick in how Scorsese directs Casino with a fast pace and a surprising amount of black comedy. Scorsese regales you with his sleek recreation of 1970's and 1980's Las Vegas and the story of how a Jewish mobster takes over the Tangiers luxury casino and hotel on behalf of the Italian mafia in order to launder money through a legit business back home to the elder mob bosses. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's narration is pithy and absorbing as they take you through the ins and outs of casino dealings and day to day practices of the time. It's quite clever of Scorsese to have these two charismatic actors lend their voices and personality to this hilarious and fierce narration.\n\nWriters Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi are brilliant with smart storytelling that lets you in on the violent payback and sleazy lifestyles of the rich and influential. I believe every word of this story and how deftly each casino security measure and mob conversation plays out is completely realistic here in Casino. I did not fully understand Casino when I first saw it as a young man, but now it's like a spiritual successor to Mean Streets and Goodfellas in every sense.\n\nRobert De Niro is excellent as the calm and measured casino boss Sam \u2018Ace' Rothstein. His increasing frustrations and rage show an inner foolishness that never lets his ego stop him from preventing his own downfall. Sharon Stone is simply lovely and entertaining as Ace's cocaine addicted escort-wife Ginger McKenna. Her screams of defiance are shocking and hilarious in a breathtaking performance. She's totally believable as this strung out, greedy, grifter. \n\nJoe Pesci is a riot to watch scream and murder to his heart's content as the hothead made man Nicky Santoro. Casino is yet another example of Pesci acting just as well as Robert De Niro in this fiery and fearsome performance as the ruthless and unflinching Nicky. The sheer audacity of Ace and Nicky shows how their lives were over with their first mistake of coming to Las Vegas and trying to rule over the mafia bosses there. De Niro, Stone, and Pesci are formidable leads.\n\nJames Woods is perfectly cast as a sleazy pimp named Lester Diamond, clearly only out for himself. Don Rickles is fun as the casino manager Billy Sherbert with his loyalty to Ace. Alan King is interesting as the constantly concerned middle man Andy Stone. Kevin Pollak is very funny as the front man politician Phillip Green. Pasquale Cajano is wonderful as the soft voiced elder mafia lord Remo Gaggi. Frank Vincent is great as Pesci's henchman Frank Marino with his seething anger and two-faced conversations. \n\nCatherine Scorsese's cameo is really adorable and funny at the deli owner Piscano's mother. Vinny Vella is so good as the incessantly complaining Artie Piscano. Nobu Matsuhisa Erika von Tagen Nick Mazzola David Rose John Bloom Joseph Rigano Philip Suriano Melissa Prophet Bill Allison Joe La Due Joseph P. Reidy Craig Vincent Carl Ciarfalio Gene Ruffini Dominick Grieco Clem Caserta Daniel P. Conte Joey DePinto Jack Orend Paul Herman Jed Mills Claudia Haro Ffolliott Le Coque John Manca Ronald Maccone Joseph Bono Frank Adonis Anthony Russell Stuart Nisbet Alfred Nittoli C.C. Carr Peter Conti Steve Vignari Frankie J. Allison Steve Schirripa Millicent Sheridan Frankie Avalon Safi El Masri\n\nThelma Schoonmaker's editing is so sharply cut around all these tough guy antics and FBI observations that 179 minutes passes by and Casino doesn't even feel half that length. Scorsese is the only director that makes epics feel like you're on an adventure into the lifestyles of the rich and infamous. Robert Richardson's cinematography not only looks incredible with ultra wide shots of the desert where wiseguys get whacked and buried in the sand, but stylish with all these creative shots around the casino floor.\n\nProduction designer Dante Ferretti recreates an older era of casinos with lavish style and immaculate detail. You never question the year. Jack G. Taylor Jr. helps with keeping the time period realistic with his lovely art direction and flourish. Rick Simpson and Daniel Ross' set decoration looks like the 70's and 80's with all the loud colors and tacky furniture. \n\nI liked the grounded, yet explosive visual effects from Craig Barron for the car bomb to various gunshots and other killings. Composer Roy Hawkins writes a fine score for Casino with plenty of playful cues. I love Scorsese's old school soundtrack full of The Animals and The Rolling Stones alongside other Scorsese favorites. Rita Ryack's costuming is so flamboyant and stunning with goofy pastel suits for Robert De Niro and extravagant dresses for the ever sultry Sharon Stone. Tricia Sawyer's make-up makes Stone glow and all the guys sweat with a raw look to Casino.\n\nIn short, Casino is a burst of energy from Scorsese clearly having fun with his favorite actors telling an outrageous and killer crime narrative like only Scorsese could tell.",

After shunning the channel a couple of weeks ago in my take down of some truly rotten movies, I aimed a dig at Dave for never to my knowledge showing a great film. Well that ends tonight as everyone sits down and enjoys one of my favourite Scorsese films. For me, Casino is up there with his best (The King Of Comedy [1982], Goodfellas [1990]) pulling superb performances from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (as usual) and especially Sharon Stone who is sensational. Casino was one of the first Scorsese films I ever saw, which is probably why I hold it in such high regard, but the way in which it interweaves the story of violence and betrayal around the inner workings of a Casino and the Las Vegas scene is fascinating. It's also an excellent example of what Paul Verhoeven was aiming for when he made Showgirls (1995), and, sure, he fell way short of this, but Casino at least gives you a blueprint of an idea of what Showgirls should have been, and I still defend it.",

An epic about streetwise, determined, greedy, self-obsessed, and fundamentally distrustful individuals, the flaws that expose them, and the city of grift and greased palms that attracts such personalities. Characters will uniformly smile at your face before pulling a knife a few seconds later. The film is a master class in worldbuilding and character development, creating a consistent sense of engagement despite the focus on voiceovers, which there seems to somehow be a frequent perception as a cheap trick in serious drama, more of a Guy Ritchie movie (still Pesci seems like he's more reading off a script if the camera's not on him, more often than not). DeNiro brings his usual degree of capability, but I can't say his performance is really exceptional in his distinguished career; it's Stone's sincerity and Pesci's raw ferocity (coupled with a few eminently quaotable and eloquent outbursts) that steal the show. The soundtrack is well-selected but weaved in with a degree of subtlety. Scorsese's direction is as on-point as I've ever seen, and is to me the best of his crime filmography (yes, even better than Goodfellas), and is only really topped in the director's output by Raging Bull, with Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York in close company.

Casino, in short, is the story of Las Vegas becoming what we know it as today.\n\nThe based-on-a-true-story format works well here. The action is believable and the times-of-the-era feel is well done. It was funny that when I went to Vegas all I could think about was how it felt like I was in this film instead of the other way around. That's some good storytelling.\n\n5/5.

The characters are so realistic you could have a full conversation with every one them.  I like how every character has something wrong with them just like people in real life.  This is one of Robert De Niro's best performances of all time.  The plot was amazing with its pacing and progression.  I loved how the beginning hooks your attention with the man's car being blown up.  I also like how the narrator doesn't say in the beginning \"Now you're probably wondering how I got into this mess...\". It shows that some things are better shown than said.

Considering especially in comparison to how alot of movies are like in quality these days (2019 and so on) this film to me is truly an excellent one. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were fucking amazing in this film and Sharon Stone is a bomb and fire quality actress in this film. I hated her guts in this film.

            "content": "This is Goodfellas (1990) but even more so as we get screeds of voiceover, excessive violence, materialism and over-the-top characters stuffed into a nearly three hour film that is almost too gratifying. Although it doesn't reach the heights of Goodfellas the film still boasts it's own draws with the performances of Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone, the entertaining script and the marvelous visuals. Having more Goodfellas-style films couldn't be a bad thing when they are produced by the same team and are just as funny and oddly fascinating as that masterpiece.\n\nRobert De Niro stars as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a Jewish handicapper who is affiliated with the Mafia is hired to work at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas where he achieves immense success. Before long Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, has followed him and he becomes a successful enforcer at the casino. The real problem starts when Rothstein falls in love, or lust, with Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone, a shallow, entitled former prostitute who lives for money and material objects but is emotionally dependent on con-artist Lester Diamond, James Woods. When Rothstein makes some poor hiring and firing decisions he begins to alienate higher-ups in the Mafia and in the Las Vegas area, leading to disaster.\n\nWe understand immediately what type of film this is going to be from the first shot of De Niro's being torn apart as it floats in the sky whilst flames rage around it, apparently representing hell. When voiceover narration from Pesci and De Niro kicks in you feel even more assured in knowing what type of film you are getting yourself into and it doesn't disappoint. I was never bored for nearly three hours and as the film swung from crime drama to family drama everything still felt exciting and connected in a way that only Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi seem to able to create. They take real stories that sound absolutely fake and they turn them into films that are at once ridiculously excessive but also engrossing period pieces and jigsaw puzzle Mafia films that are immensely satisfying when all is said and done.\n\nOne of the things that makes Casino so riveting is the inclusion of small very specific details that are both funny and informative about the character. It's no surprise that my Father remarked upon hearing Rothstein complain about his blueberry muffin and then go do something about it that he was \"fair\", this is a detail that explains that Rothstein likes to be in control of everything but also that his motivations can seem reasonable. When McKenna tells her baby \"Look, Daddy bought me all this jewelry because he loves me\" and later snorts cocaine in front of her we know that she is a train wreck. These deviations from the central plot of the film are beguiling but they give you more fleshed out characters and enhance the effect of plot developments.\n\nStone gives her greatest performance in this film as the rotten to the core McKenna whose death due to a drug overdose seems inevitable when you trace her journey from a very young prostitute to a woman who couldn't want for more but does. Her dangerously dependent relationship with Diamond, James Woods really captures the essence of his character in the few scenes he appears in, is one of those strange features that appear in Scorsese films that does humanize her in some way. When we hear Woods' creepy voice as Diamond strings McKenna along even after her marriage and he describes seeing her \"For the first time at 14\" we understand why she relies on him so much and keeps returning to him again and again, he is the only parental figure she ever really had. Of course everyone else in the film is great but that goes without saying, I find it sad that Stone wasn't able to get more roles that showed her acting talent after this astonishing performance.\n\nI would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Goodfellas (1990) and adult audiences in general. It's a violent good time with an unusually brilliant screenplay and Sharon Stone's best performance as a drug-addicted materialist. That is why it is his ninth greatest production. What's not to love about the film that is essentially an extension of Scorsese's greatest triumph?",

And I think they both starred in Once Upon a Time in America and I've heard that it's a really long film. With Robert De Niro's last collaboration between Martin Scorsese, this film is based on true events of what happened in Las Vegas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci played Sam Rothstein, aka \"Ace\" and Nicholas Santoro, aka \"Nicky\", They're both childhood friends in real-life. It's kind of an interesting story about those two friends are getting alot of heat on Las Vegas of who's going to run the Casino. I really like this movie even though it is very similar to GoodFellas with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci narrating but what can I say, there's nothing wrong with that and this is a phenomenal film with great performances and story and it has some good tunes in it.

Goodfellas maybe a better made film but this film in my opinion Casino has a bit more to offer.

            "content": "Gangster movies hold almost zero appeal for me, and Casino just felt like another gangster movie. It was shocking how similar it felt to Goodfellas, a movie 5 years earlier also from Scorsese. I didn\u2019t need a retread of that movie because it did nothing for me, but at least this one had a sympathetic protagonist. Centering everything around Robert De Niro\u2019s character was smart, because he was the one guy who seemed to be fighting not to fall into the criminal underworld. Watching his decline was difficult, but it made sense. Sharon Stone plays the obnoxious, spoiled wife better than I expected because she\u2019s not a very good actress otherwise. And Joe Pesci was the same old Joe Pesci you always get, hot-tempered and foul-mouthed. Speaking of foul-mouthed...I\u2019m just mystified that this passes for good writing. When you are so unimaginative and lazy with the script that every third word is an F-bomb, it gets tedious. I like smart, witty dialogue that grabs you and takes full advantage of the power of words. Casino sounds like a group of middle-schoolers who just discovered they could get away with swearing were responsible for the script. Language is such an amazing tool that can truly impress the audience, but this movie just beats the audience over the head with a baseball bat of profanity. The voiceover is tedious in Casino as well. It is necessary only a couple of times, and yet we get 3 different people delivering it. (I almost laughed aloud when the third guy started.) I do have to commend Casino for one thing. It pulled a bait-and-switch on me. The opening scenes upset me, and I was ready to get angry because it was utilizing a trope that drives me crazy in films. However, they turned things around later in the movie, and I was delighted that the film went that route. (I\u2019m trying to remain vague to avoid spoiling the plot.) While the subject matter holds little interest for me, and I get tired of the way Casino presented it, this isn\u2019t the worst gangster movie I\u2019ve seen. Thanks to a likable character leading the film, I was engaged almost the whole way through. The ending that surprised me was enough to make Casino a movie I didn\u2019t hate. I won\u2019t watch it again, but at least it was tolerable to watch the first time.",

I was surprised at how tangled of a story the movie managed to convey in an understandable way.\n\nThe sets, the clothes, the overall production of this movie really blew me away. With the exception of gun action, everything else was perfect and extremely authentic looking, really gave the movie the feeling it needed to seriously portray this tale.\n\nThe three stars of the movie were all total masters of their game. I was extremely impressed with Sharon Stone, it made me sad I don't really see her in big productions anymore.\n\nI thought about it, and I think that my only problem with this movie is the whole \"I'm gonna show you how this story ends at the first 5 minutes and then rewind to the beginning\" shtick. While I can understand and appreciate this kind of storytelling, for me it simply spoils the story and takes away from me the possibility to wonder what will happen and to think about how certain characters will turn out.\n\nI wanted to be excited about how Sharon Stone's character would affect things and in what ways, but I always remembered the beginning where it's all spelled out for you, and that bummed me out.\n\nAnyways, besides this one issue, I enjoyed everything else.

A cash cow that ultimately ends up with the Mafia in Kansas City.\nIntertwined in the story is Sharon Stone as prostitute/substance misuser Ginger McKenna who marries Rothstein and whose gradual descent into marriage split/attempted kidnap of Rothstein's daughter is one strand of the collapse of the then successful casino operation.\nOther factors are the strict Las Vegas authorities that refuse at first Santaro and then Rofstein employment in the gambling industry.\nThe downfall of the operation forms the backdrop to the end of the film and some pretty gruesome deaths even by my standards of film viewing!\nScorsese delivers yet again. It may not quite live up to the standards of 1990s GoodFellas but certainly is still one of the best films of the decade.\nScorsese 'viewers' will be aware that his films are quite long in duration but many plot points would be missed if they were edited.\nStick with his films and don't lose your concentration is my advice.\nIf I found one criticism it was the Joe Percy character Santoro who almost replicated his GoodFellas role as a pretty nasty mobster whose attitude was he would rather kill you with three bullets to the skull rather than one.\nI'm glad I watched and my Scorsese tour continues albeit with a few coffees to keep me going!",

Joe Pesci is amazing in the role of a brutal and violent Mafia boss. Although his character is utterly terrifying, you can't take your eyes off him. Sharon Stone is also terrific though her role is only minor. At nearly three hours, \"Casino\" is a long film that drags towards the end.

The standout, though, is Sharon Stone as Ace's troublesome wife, Ginger, who can't be satisfied even when she scores the jackpot.  Behind the camera Scorcese crafts a nice crime epic that mostly tells how mob lost Las Vegas, but doesn't quite hit the point across.  Like the book by Nicolas Pileggi, it is by the numbers and only touches on how the mafia built & shaped Las Vegas, such has bringing in big name acts or modernizing sports betting.  He also doesn't point out how the mob losing Vegas was inevitable, as gambling & prostitution being legal made it impossible for them to operate against legitimate businesses & corporations, though he does point out that once mob violence started growing, it accelerated the process.  Scorcese once again doesn't sugar coat the mafia, showing them for the brutal thugs that they were (what happens to the principle characters is downright sickening), and despite it's oppressive length of 3 hours, remains mostly enjoyable throughout.   Overall, a good crime film but in no way a great one.",

Another thing that comes to mind is that it is extremely obvious that this film was directed by Martin Scorsese. This film hits all the trademarks like casting Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, having a bunch of Italian mob gangsters all talking in New York accents, violence, narration, a femme fatale, a broken marriage and a greedy, power-hungry protagonist whose pride is their downfall. Although, even if it seems like I have seen all this before, it's still really good. It's not like watching Adam Sandler trademarks over and over, it's watching a master at his craft create another great film. After watching, I definitely want to go to Vegas now. The way Vegas is shot makes it look like a paradise even with all it's violence, sex, drugs and scandal. Also, this might be my favourite Robert De Niro performance. Sure, I haven't seen Taxi Driver or Raging Bull yet, but for some reason this was my favourite performance of his. Joe Pesci on the otherhand is one of the best swearing actors. He has this bulldog demeaner to him that makes his vulgar language just a treat to listen to. Sharon Stone, seemed like she could have been played by any actress but she has good (or bad depending on how you look at it) chemistry with Robert De Niro.

It's very similar in feel to that of Goodfellas, with the narrative, filming style, age, actors and namely the attitudes of each actor.  Joe Pesci plays the same short tempered badass who will shed no tears or waste a minute on someone who he thinks is outta line, and beat them to a pulp.  De Niro is the same quiet and very kind, yet ruthless head of a small band of friends within a much larger operation.  It's a great story, and that is the highlight of the movie. It gives a good impression of the lives of real gangsters, and is a compelling and intense story throughout, and strays from being stuck just inside of the Casino which is its namesake.  The acting is of course top notch and impressive, which in the end makes the film, along with the story, script, and narrative.  The action is more of story and brutal killings or tortures, which are portrayed well, although when someone is shot it is a bit lacking of bullet effects, unlike the other movies mention all above.  Overall great movie, does take a third place behind Heat and Goodfellas for its genre, but it's a high ranking list only for the best.",

DeNiro is great. Pesci is great. Don Rickles is great. James Wood is great. Sharon Stone is good. she is my biggest flaw with the movie. her character is the most annoying and irritating character I have ever seen.

Casino is essentially Goodfellas with a Las Vegas twist, which is quite odd coming from a director as diverse as Scorsese. Casino may have the same admirable technical qualities to be expected from someone like Scorsese, such as smooth cinematography and fitting production and costume design, but it's not even close to matching the same narrative gravitas of Goodfellas. It's the same rise-and-fall plot featuring characters that feel too similar to those in Goodfellas: Joe Pesci's characters in this and Goodfellas are nearly indistinguishable. Casino gets a bit of a pass for being adapted from true events, but still feels all too familiar. The film also runs far too long: many plot points in the nearly three hour runtime feel expendable and seem to drag. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's disappointing to see someone like Scorsese ultimately make the same movie twice.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is arguably one of the top 5 greatest directors of all time. Between his manic camera whips, classic juke box jams and fervent narrative it's impossible not to be wrapped up in some of his movies. He's an amazing visual showman. While may not be even in the top 10 Scorsese movies (his work is so prolific that it's a complex list), it would still be one of the best movies in any year of release.\nThe operatic melodrama about the rise and fall of 1970's Casino wiseguy Ace Rothstein is eerily similar to the directors best known film Goodfellas. It a dark, complex, nostalgic tale staring Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci again. There's the same style of omniscient narrative that  front-loads thorough details of a criminal operation, which he did once again in The Wolf of Wall Street, and with humor he glamorizes the criminal world, while never fully condemning their pursuit of happiness in a corrupt society. The unique factor here is Sharon Stone. In quite possibly the best performance of her career, she is a standout. While De Niro calmly moves through the underworld like a patient shark, and Pesci uses brutal violence (and a pen, and a vice) to express his swift anger, Stone, as Ginger, is luridly fashionable and dangerous as a former prostitute, drug addict who manipulates every man she talks to except her former pimp. While Rothstein never bets on the wrong horse, he knowingly makes a big risk by marrying and trusting Ginger.\nThe performances are of course great and filled out by solid acting from Don Rickles & James Woods. The story told here is the most impressive. While many consider Las Vegas to be Disneyland today, there was a time when it was overwhelmingly run by the midwest Mafia. Everyone worked for somebody and it was, and likely still is, the most legal criminal operation in the United States. Money lines the pockets of all those who look the other way, while every year millions of Americans are willingly robbed blind as a means of entertainment But damn if it isn't a fun time.",

When it starts off, Casino feels a lot like Goodfellas all over again, but with more fun. However, once the story kicks in, you can find it's key differences from the other works of the director. The film has fine performances from De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone (in particular). Casino tells the story of greed and lust for money and it tells the tale with style and sufficient grit. The film has a good ending also and sadly Pesci plays the same kind of role he played in Goodfellas.",

However, when we finally did get it, not everyone was left as satisfied as they had hoped to be. Casino provides more of the same of what we've come to typically expect from Scorsese as a director; whether that's graphic violence, Italian stereotypes, blatant/excessive/vulgar language, and even the occasional domestic violence. However, just because Casino isn't very original, that doesn't necessarily mean that the film has nothing to offer. If there's at least one thing that can be taken away from this film, it's undoubtedly the performances. Robert De Niro does well as the perfectionist gambler turned casino manager, Ace. Joe Pesci, while not as comical or over-the-top here as in Goodfellas, still gives a nevertheless entertainingly violent, if mostly restrained, performance. I think it was pretty obvious that Scorsese wasn't going to top Goodfellas, or ever could for that matter; I mean, how could he? After all, Goodfellas is renowned by many (including myself) as his undisputed masterpiece even to this day and is as perfect as a gangster film can get. Hell, this film is essentially Goodfellas in a Las Vegas casino setting anyway, so I couldn't help but compare the two and everything that this film does, Goodfellas does significantly better. I think Scorsese just felt as if he was obligated to do another film but didn't really have anything new to offer us, so he just rehashed one of his previous films and the subsequent result is Casino. Despite all that though, I still think that Casino is ultimately a solid and entertaining film but doesn't amount to anything more than simply that, especially in comparison to some of Scorsese's more innovative and memorable work.",

This is a big, bold and grandiose movie that is typical of the esteemed filmmaker, but he covers a lot of well-known territory and re-visits a lot of themes and plot devices he has dealt with before.\n\nStill, no one tells a story quite like Scorcese and here he re-teams with screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi who wrote the novel that this is based on, and the end result is a vibrant film despite its familiarity. It's full of violence, humor and great, larger-than-life characters, beautifully brought to life by this exceptional cast.\n\nRobert DeNiro knows this part very well, mostly because he's played it a time or two before, and Sharon Stone gets her first real chance to show what she can do with a great part. However, it's Joe Pesci who really shines here once again, playing a variation on the same character he played in \"Good Fellas\". Granted it's the showiest part in the film, but there's a reason that Pesci keeps getting cast in these roles. Quite simply, he's electric on the screen.\n\nEven though the film (and the novel before it) is a work of fiction, you get a real sense of the history of Las Vegas from this, and I mean the real history, This isn't the lesson you're going to learn in school, but it sure feels authentic enough. \"Casino\" doesn't rank as one of Scorcese's best, but even a good film from the director is better than almost anything else in theaters.

Sharon Stone plays one of the most hateful god-diggers ever, and Joe Pesci is more or less the same character he played in Goodfellas. The movie ends with other side of all that money, jewels, and luxury in a bitter tasting manner with a really quite brutal death scene highlighting the reality of greed and power and where it can lead.

Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her.

Aside from a 24 karat cast, the visuals and narration by De Niro steal the show. In fact, it's as if the Casino itself becomes a character. The 3 hours carry you through the procedural functions and operation of casino management and security with charismatic technique and an influential style. I'd even say that Casino's capture of process and action is something to study, something visually stunning, something I wouldn't say, however, is to sacrifice three hours of your time to admire Casino's outstanding cinematography.

However, Ace's mobster best friend (Pesci) and ex-hustler wife (Stone) threaten to topple a multimillion dollar mafia empire. \n\nThe film combines elements of drama, comedy, and even sprinklings of documentary as we are educated on nearly every aspect of running the corrupt casino via lovely tracking shots.\n\nA criticism of this film is that it is overly long and \"boring\" to many audience members, perhaps resembling Scorcese's previous mob flick GoodFellas a little too much stylistically. Another is that the film is exceedingly ugly with its bright and flashy set pieces, gaudy wardrobe and fast camera movements.

A film that is as good today as when I first watched it, if not a million times better. The only word to describe this masterpiece is \"perfect\". Perfect directing, a perfect protagonist, perfect antagonists, a perfect soundtrack, and a perfect story. Quite possibly the greatest gangster-drama ever made, in my opinion. This film cemented for me that Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time, and no one will be able to take that title away from him. If I could rate this higher than 100% I would. In short, \"Casino\" is and will always be, the greatest film I have ever seen. Period!",

            "content": "Casino is very similar to Martin Scorsese's previous gangster effort, Goodfellas. It largely follows the same distinct style, brings over many of the people that made Goodfellas and is a second acclaimed gangster tale.\nCasino exposes the underworld of Gambling by revealing the corruption and violence in the town of Las Vegas before they became about corporations. It dramatises just how evil the source of gambling is, and just how violent people would become in the corrupt world of gambling. It educates viewers on the past and takes them on a 3 hour journey to teach people just what kind of hell lay beneath the expensive and glamourous buildings of Las Vegas.\nBut Casino is full of talking, and there is a lot of it. I found it to be overloaded with excessive talking over a period of 3 hours and a lot of predictable plot dynamics which never really took me by surprise. I found that to a certain extent, Casino was generic. It just seemed like it was a piece of the dying spirit of Martin Scorsese's older films, and in particular his collaborations with Robert De Niro in their final teaming up together. It just doesn't have the originality or dramatic impact that their films like Goodfellas or Taxi Driver did, and it feels like it's a story that's all been told before. Even though it does educate viewers on the history of casino crime, it just doesn't seem all that interesting this time around. Its kind of odd, but Casino has a story that's not the best to choose, yet Martin Scorsese finds a good way to do it. \nLuckily, Martin Scorsese's taught direction does ensure that Casino fits in as a visual experience which benefits from the fine style of the film, the strong script, the fine cinematography and the sufficient amount of violence to entertain viewers in the mood for a visual experience. His gritty touch on the story is successful, and the cast manages to keep the power of the story up.\nRobert De Niro is, as ususal, powerful and strongly dramatic as a lead. His charisma is as strong as ever and he carries the story strongly, supplying fine line delivery and strong grip over the script to ensure that finding an issue with him is a challenge.\nBut really, it's Joe Pesci who is again, absolutely awesome in his third collaboration with Martin Scorsese. His aggression is intense and despite his small size his furious talent for line delivery manages to seriously intimidate audiences very well in the blink of an eye and make a continuously entertaining and memorable presence for viewers to remember Casino by being a constantly powerful entity of a character.\nBut its Sharon Stone who is the surprisingly strongest part of the cast. In her finest lead role not to feature such sexually suggestive nudity she reminds us that she can in fact act and she can do it very well without using her body as a distraction in Casino by using a gripping tenacity over her lines and emotions to secure an Academy Award nomination for her talents.\n\nSo Although Casino is not one of Martin Scorsese's finest efforts and can be boring and prolonged at times, it still stands as a well acted and well made piece of cinema.",

And the writing does an impressive job at creating rich, interesting characters, and at explaining how the casino scram worked.  Additionally, the set designs and costumes do an incredible job at showing the extravagance and decadency of '70s Las Vegas.

However, without a doubt it is the cast that give this movie it's substance, style and status as a classic. De Niro is that satisfyingly traditional De Niro  and Pesci is perfection in the role of mobster Nicky Santoro, then throw Sharon Stone in who is so convincing I almost didn't recognise her at times.

The casino racket plot (along with all the other subplots) all start at their highs and tumble down to failures. The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.\n\nMy main beef with the movie is two fold.\n\nOne is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters \"cool\" and full of \"attitude\" and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.\n\nMy second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how \"cool\" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from \"cool\" gangsters.\n\nI think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.\n\nI don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?\n\nhttp://www.storycharts.ca/story/118044/5275456790069248/Film/Casino",

            "content": "After bringing us the outstanding 1990 crime drama GoodFellas, critically acclaimed director Martin Scorsese, author/screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, and stars Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci team up again for another crime drama five years later called Casino. What's interesting about Casino is that it's basically GoodFellas all over again only set in Las Vegas. It's a good thing no one came up with the idea of naming this film GoodFellas in Las Vegas, since it would make it all the more obvious to us that they're trying to recreate the same movie. That being said, does the fact that Casino bares countless similarities to GoodFellas make it bad? Not at all, it's simply a way of summarizing the movie in a nutshell. Regardless, let's take a deeper look at what we've got. \n\nCasino tells the story of a Mafia member named Sam Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) who is sent to Las Vegas to run a casino funded by the Mafia on behalf of mob families living in the Midwest. His friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is also eventually sent to Las Vegas to watch his back. The main reason they are both there is to oversee the casino operations which largely centers on illegal activity. Basically, the Mafia has rigged the casino so that none of the customers win anything, and they make millions of dollars off of their money without the customers knowing a thing about it. Essentially, Sam and Nicky are there to make sure that their \"skim\" goes according to plan. But all of that changes however when a fellow hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) enters their lives and eventually interferes with their business to the point where there's no way they could possibly fix whatever costly mistakes erupt. \n\nThe first couple minutes of Casino, when we're being introduced to the process of how these Mafia-ruled casinos work, are arguably where the most fascinating part of the entire picture resides. We not only learn that the scamming this casino gets away with on a regular basis is supposedly normal, but we are also given the scary conclusion that wasting money on gambling is the main reason people go to Las Vegas in the first place. It definitely makes people who haven't been to Las Vegas before question whether or not they want to go out of their way to a city in the middle of a desert just to lose vast sums of money. I know that it wouldn't be a town I'd want to go to yet based on what I've seen here. So I thought Casino had a fairly strong introduction based on the kind of world it was introducing us to. \n\nThe rest of the film was pretty decent with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci turning in strong acting just like they did with GoodFellas. However, I felt that most of the main narrative was not as compelling or focused as I wanted it to be. The storytelling simply felt a little fragmented for my taste, and the love story between DeNiro and Stone doesn't help with that either. For the record, I respect that the love story does contribute to the events that take place in the second half of the film. Also, Roger Ebert's comments on how different this love story is compared with the love stories in Martin Scorsese's previous works are justified to a certain degree. Regardless, the love story still didn't do much for me at all and I think a crucial reason for that is Sharon Stone. \n\nI don't think I've seen much of her work and the ones that I do recall seeing aside from this film are Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Antz. In my opinion, from what I've seen, she looks physically great, but her acting is too over-the-top for my liking. I'm having trouble placing my finger on it, but something about her acting just seems inappropriate for the movies she stars in. While I acknowledge that some of her roles including this one require her to be very dramatic, she has the distinction of being too childishly over dramatic that she ends up feeling way out of place in her films, this one included. \n\nWhile I still think Joe Pesci acts out his role reasonably well here, his role is maybe a little too identical to his work in GoodFellas. And although I do feel that the story does lose focus around the halfway point, for some reason, I still find Casino watchable enough for me to recommend it overall. And again, this is mainly because of the theories this film shows us regarding how a mob-run casino would operate. There's a well-directed scene involving the casino managers asking a customer to leave because he is placing his feet on the casino tables. Without revealing too much, the payoff of this scene isn't quite what you'd expect at first. The same thing could be said for another scene involving the casino managers dealing with someone who is maybe having too good a day at their casino. If that scene doesn't scare you off from playing and winning too much at a casino, I don't know what will. \n\nIf you're looking for a story and characters that will impact you the same way Scorsese's earlier films like GoodFellas did, you might be disappointed by what Casino offers. However, if you're looking for a picture with a fascinating premise that introduces creative theories along the way and will settle for something that is at least watchable, then I think you'll like this film fine enough. As for me, though I don't think Casino ranks among Scorsese's best by a good bit and I probably don't have that much interest in looking at it again, I was satisfied enough with seeing it once. Like Las Vegas itself, approach at your own financial risk.",

Anyway, Martin Scorsese goes back to his roots with Casino showing brutally realistic gangster violence and profanity. Is it over-the-top? Maybe. But that is necessary. It wouldn't get its point across if it wasn't over-the-top. Casino also represents something much larger. The rise and fall of an empire, through corruption.",

Good violence, strong plot and great cast. Sharon Stone is very sexy and psychotic, although I will admit I got tired of her screaming after the second hour of this long film.

            "content": "Five years after delivering one the mob genre's finest films in \"GoodFellas\", director Martin Scorsese reunited with screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi and several of the same actors - mainly Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci - to focus on another true-life crime story. This time he takes it away from the mean streets of New York and focuses on the deserts of Las Vegas. The results may be highly similar but they're just as impressive.\n Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) is a smooth and ambitious type that moves out to Las Vegas to become the operator of the Tangiers Casino. Things go well for him until his volatile childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) arrives to get in on the action and Sam falls in love with conniving, unbalanced and untrustworthy, showgirl Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). Before long, a cycle of drugs and violence ensues while Sam struggles to hold onto his casino license and the mob back home are less than happy with the results.\n The hallmarks of Scorsese's style and structure - that were so prevalent in \"GoodFellas\" -  are all on show again here. He has his usual reliable cast, delivering voiceover narrations that take us through the events and there is regular use of classic tracks from The Rolling Stones. His directorial techniques and are also on show; from flash-cuts to freeze-frames, crash zooms and montages. In other words, Scorsese is doing it all over again and it's these very techniques and stylistic flourishes that have drawn some criticism Casino's way for being too similar to his aforementioned crime classic. To some extent, I can understand these gripes. There is definitely a feeling of repetition and lack of originality in it's approach. The most obvious comparison being the casting of Joe Pesci. As good as Pesci is (and he is very good) it may have served Scorsese better to cast someone else in that role. The character is too similar to Pesci's Oscar winning Tommy DeVito. I'd liked to have seen (another Scorsese regular) Harvey Keitel, for example, just to mix things up a bit and he's proven beforehand that he's an actor that plays off DeNiro very well. That being said, there is an argument of 'if it ain't broke, dont fix it'. It does tread old ground and doesn't really bring anything fresh to the table but it's old ground that's worth treading again. Where Scorsese does succeed, is in his casting of DeNiro. In \"Goodfellas\", DeNiro was underused but here he delivers some solid work. He has a less showy role than those around him, making it easy to overlook just how effortless he is. He's rarely offscreen for the entire 3 hours of the film and shows an absolutely commanding reservation. Other great inclusions in the cast are a weasel like James Woods and a surprisingly outstanding Sharon Stone. She takes a back seat in the early stages but when she properly enters the fray, she delivers a very powerful and layered performance and the convincing catalyst for the unravelling of the characters' indulgent lifestyles. She was rightfully Oscar nominated for her work here and very unlucky not to win. It's a testament to these committed performances and Scorsese's expertise that this film still manages to stand alone as a very fine piece of cinema in it's own right. Added to which, the lavish production design by Dante Ferretti and Robert Richardson's sublime cinematography bring the whole glitz, glamour and corruption of Las Vegas to fruition. \n An enthralling and intimate portrayal of the decline of the mob in the 1970's. It may not be as tightly constructed as \"GoodFellas\" but how many film's are or ever will be? If this is the only criticism that can be appointed to Casino then there's no point criticising at all. Another fine addition to Scorsese's canon.\n\nMark Walker",

From a stellar cast of regulars - De Niro, Pesci and a new addition Stone as a drug-crazed double-crosser, as the film ticks along the stakes get ever higher. Sure, the director is treading extremely familiar ground but he does so with remarkable style. It makes sense that he would continue to reassemble the old crew because, unlike many of the characters in this film, his go-to mob actors can always be relied upon even when the pacing feels a little too deliberate or the narration becomes a bit bombarding. De Niro takes a markedly different approach in his portrayal of a put-upon crook with a heart who, in the end, is really looking out for his kid. It gives the film a much-needed moral center especially when we are seeing him being typecast all too often. Perhaps the fact that this film lives in the shadow of Goodfellas is inevitable but it could be said that lightning nearly struck twice for Scorsese.",

Just as Pesci says at the beginning, \"we fucked it all up, it should have been great...\".\n\nWhat makes me love Casino is its powerful cast that showcases the good from nearly everybody, especially Stone who plays DeNiro's hustler wife who in the end loses sight of her own life.Though it does stretch it's run time, Casino is  brilliantly acted, well constructed, and gorgeously rendered. The film is a brutal look at the mob's control over Vegas during the mid seventies so expect the same flashes and tuned up style that came from Goodfellas with all the violence and musical choices kicked up a notch.  \n\nOne of my favorite Scorsese films!

Those who enjoyed Goodfellas will find much to love here. Scorsese holds incredible talent for directing epics with themes of greed, deception, and power; a sort of modern-day Coppola. Casino is brilliantly inky and lurid, boasts an incredible cast, and astounds at every turn. The 3 hour watch literally flies by as the viewer is captivated by the phenomenal performances. A gorgeously cinematized, wholly arresting piece of cinema. Scorsese never disappoints.",

Scorcese has Robert de Niro subtle, meticulous, and ruthless, Joe Pesci is every inch the tough-guy gangster who never backs down, but has a temper that is rather too immature and loose. Sam Rothstein (de Niro's character) is efficient and serves his bosses well - he's always sending the goodies back home! Sharon Stone's Ginger is a wreck, drug-induced, unstable, irrational, and apparently, very stupid. Now, how did she lure Rothstein's cool cat personality to fall for her? That's everyday life for you - the smart, cool ones do fall for those types - beautiful, with a personality and body to match, until the gold sheens off the statuette day by day. Pesci's fight scenes are brutal, but real. There is no pretence in these scenes - there is enough violence in the world to disguise such brutal depictions on celluloid. I enjoyed the desert scene, when Rothstein captures the essence in his narration as Pesci's character races through the desert - you didn't know what you could get from Pesci's character. Casino is just a magnificently handled subject, Scorcese has not gone over the top or over-done it, it's impeccably handled, the actors are just apt in their parts, and it is just fascinating to see how the gulf spreads between de Niro and Pesci's characters. Thumps up for Casino - if I may dare say it, it surpasses Goodfellas in its power and impact, and ultimately overpowers Scorcese's later movie, The Departed. Yes it does, I'm betting on it....with Sam Rothstein's back-from-the-dead character on the line!",

But that was something that struck me because of the way the film presents the plot. It became evident that there was something and that was a bonus, a film that, in itself, is already capable of proving itself excellent. Despite all the comparisons with \"Goodfellas\", (I couldn't help doing them myself), I don't think Scorcese tried to repeat the dose, although it is undeniable that he likes to make this kind of films, involving mafia or organized crime (\"The Irishman\", very recently, and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", for example, not to mention the obvious \"Goodfellas\").The script shows how two Chicago mobsters manage to control and run a casino in Las Vegas until marital problems, betrayal and mistrust, addictions, greed and brutality eventually led them to their fall. There are some sub-plots that are developing equally, but everything is brilliantly orchestrated and combined by Scorcese. The film has all his style and their three hours length pass quickly. The heavy atmosphere, the brutal and raw violence, the current use of slang and f-words, are all part of a style that Scorcese associated with his gangster films. The torture scene where that guy's head was smashed into a vise is worthy of anthology, and likewise some of the scenes where Pesci gets angry and starts brutally beating those in front.Robert De Niro is one of those actors who never, or almost never, fails. And he works beautifully with Scorcese, as does Pesci. The three collaborated wonderfully here, and the result is a harmonious combination between the work of the director and the two main actors. There is not a moment out of tone. Pesci's performance was really the best of his career, much more mature and profound than in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone, in turn, had to face a difficult character, in which beauty is associated with a certain spirit of survival and a vicious cycle, that ends up leading her character to self-destruction. She has a character that requires beauty, sensuality, but also a lot of psychological depth, and the actress achieved its combination brilliantly, being nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress that year and winning the Golden Globe in the same category. She, like Pesci, achieves in this film one of her best performances ever (or at least everything I have seen of her so far). In addition to them, the film has good additions such as James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, Pasquale Cajano and Vinny Vella, among others.Technically, the film is impeccable. Filmed inside a real casino during daily closing hours, you couldn't demand a better or more detailed set. The cinematography and camera work were also meticulously done, and editing, mixing and post-production work are impeccable. The pace is good, with scenes so well linked that the whole story is crystal clear to the audience, despite the three hours length. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which harmonizes perfectly with what the film shows, and the general environment.This film is not just a follower in the path of \"Goodfellas\", although there are similarities in style, derived from the presence of the same director and main actors. It is a different film, less sympathetic perhaps, more brutal, realistic, intense, sometimes cynical and deeply critical. It is definitely worth seeing.",

At the center of this movie is the rise and fall of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a gambling expert and mafia associate who lives the good life as a casino operator in Las Vegas - at least before the decline of his career and his personal life. The film tells a compelling story containing themes of power, greed, deception, and betrayal. Scorsese's direction is brilliant as always. The performances are stellar as well. De Niro \"aces\" his role as Rothstein, as does Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro.

It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It doesn`t come off as nearly repetitive as \"The Godfellas\", even though we`ve seen Presci and De Niro in many such films. This is in a huge part achieved by major role by Sharon Stone, who exceeds all expectations. There is nothing simple about her character. She never comes off as simply bad or good. Sometimes you understand her fears, sometimes you condemn her. Nevertheless, she made her own plot in this movie. From others we see the same excellent actor work, though I liked the Rothstein`s character a lot more than in other such productions. This is because he never stopped being human. At some point he even enjoys the gangster life completely, although he always chooses the more in between solutions. Joe Pesci did the rest by creating an excellent villain, though sometimes also a bit confused. The music, the camera work also excellent. Almost 3 hours of sheer virtuosity.",

The length is not unnecessary - all of it is used to develop the story and characters with excellent narration and acting. You see a film like Scarface and it's mostly just a montage - a brilliant one, but nevertheless too much jumping around. However, Casino manages to get the story across in a very believable way. The personal issues are so deeply explored, and the fact that Robert De Niro is a \"good guy\" really adds an extra perspective. In every other film, everyone ends up being a baddy and gets whacked or goes to jail. But in this one, it was interesting to see the story from two perspectives - De Niro's and Pesci's. The two actors suited their characters' roles perfectly, and the pacing was inline with how quickly one can imagine events developed. The rise, the top and the fall all got their relative share of the action according to how long they last. Best of all, the movie was not about doing crime for the sake of it - it was actually mostly about business and not killing people randomly with a few deals being used as a cover-up. The direction and general style of story and development etc. are almost identical to Goodfellas, so if you enjoyed that this is definitely worth watching as well.",

It has the same cast from GoodFellas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci but I still can't believe that I haven't seen Raging Bull which I really want to. And I think they both starred in Once Upon a Time in America and I've heard that it's a really long film. With Robert De Niro's last collaboration between Martin Scorsese, this film is based on true events of what happened in Las Vegas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci played Sam Rothstein, aka \"Ace\" and Nicholas Santoro, aka \"Nicky\", They're both childhood friends in real-life. It's kind of an interesting story about those two friends are getting alot of heat on Las Vegas of who's going to run the Casino. I really like this movie even though it is very similar to GoodFellas with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci narrating but what can I say, there's nothing wrong with that and this is a phenomenal film with great performances and story and it has some good tunes in it. I am a fan gangster flicks and anything else and that's that.",

And he has found himself actors who are able to convey his message effectively. Casino deals with this subject in the business of gambling.\r Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is doing good running a casino for the Mafia in 1970s Las Vegas. Things get tricky as first Ginger (Sharon Stone) and then Nicky (Joe Pesci) come into his life. They're both unstable and careless, and have no vision for their futures like Sam has. Their antics get him into trouble time and again.\r Like Scorsese's other movies, the plot takes a backstage to the characters and their personal quirky moments. He instead relies on multiple voice-overs to propel the plot forward. The plot does thicken with time, and not for good. It felt like he wasn't sure if he should concentrate on the characters or the plot development. Goodfellas found that balance ingeniously, so did his later movie The Wolf of Wall Street, both of which deal with the same themes.\r The acting was sufficient, I suppose. De Niro does a decent enough job. Pesci's character is too similar to the one he played in Goodfellas. In essence, he is a character actor. Sharon Stone also did a good job.\r I couldn't feel excited during a single scene in the entire movie. There was no sense of danger and urgency, despite the breakneck pacing. The film was just a scene after scene of greed, violence and narration. It got old after a while.\r The production design, which brought the 1970s to life, did a wonderful job. The same camera angles were used as were in Goodfellas. The camera zooms in on people's faces the same way.\r I found the movie a bit underwhelming. I felt like Scorsese wasn't done with the subject that he started out to tell in Goodfellas, and hence returned to it. He should have just made a single movie about it, or he should have made this one so different from the first that no one could have found any similarities.",

Pesci pretty much repeats his short-tempered mobster from Goodfellas. Both films have similar eclectic rock backgrounds (including heavy usage of Rolling Stones songs). Plus the f-bomb is dropped pretty frequently. Yet Casino still has some positive points to help it stand on its own. From the great writing to the beautiful cinematography, Casino isn't a slapped-together and hastily-made effort. It is a great film with a great story that starts off on a documentary-esque note but slowly reveals itself as the gritty crime drama Scorsese fans fervently crave. The cast is great too. Pesci (who really is the only one who can play short-tempered gangsters like Nicky Santoro) and Stone (surprisingly) shine in their roles. But it is De Niro that deserves the cake as Ace Rothstein as he gives an exceptional performance showing emotion while smoothly restricting it with inner power.Of course, there are some scenes in Casino that feel overdone with language and/or violence to the point where the scene looks comedic. Plus there are scenes that kind of allude to Goodfellas (especially the Pesci beatdown scene) since actors from the former film are reused in Casino. And that kind of ruins some of the original magic that Casino holds, as it isn't a wholly new film. Nonetheless, the Scorsese-De Niro-Pesci trio rock well, regardless of the flaws.",

Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci were phenomenal here as expected and, though I heard evidence to the contrary, I never thought the violence was too much.

The characters were well crafted and their arcs very interesting to follow. There were a lot of them, sure, but it was never too overwhelming. In addition, the true story aspect of this made the story really work and I can see why Scorsese was drawn to this, as it feels like a very Scorsese film, as thematically it is similar to many of his other works. For the most part, it felt a bit like Goodfellas in a casino, but I did not really mind that. The only thing that really stuck out to me was the narration.

Thus while Goodfellas palpable sense of realism compensated for the lack of dimension in its story, Casino fails miserably in both departments. What it appears we're left with is 180 minutes of lowest common denominator sleaze and violence.

Casino opens with short sequence in 1983 before moving on to the meat of the story, which is related through flashbacks. Director Martin Scorsese makes heavy use of voiceovers, employing disembodied monologues by both lead actors -- Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci -- to fill in gaps. The sheer volume of words sporadically detracts from character development, but it is integrated successfully enough not to seem overly intrusive. In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Scorsese. Although not the director's top work, this is nevertheless compelling film making. Casino sparkles like its fake diamond of a host city. The cinematography, which uses surprisingly few tricks other than freeze-framing to emphasize key moments, is crisp and clean.(Top tier film from a top tier filmmaker).",

I no longer have to question how hard it would be to have the job of a Casino owner; this movie showed me. How fast things spun into disaster with Sam's wife, best friend, and the entire casino! The resulting mayhem is an absolute mess contributed with greed, thirst for power, violence, betrayal, dishonesty, and a lot of lives taken in some gruesome manners. Beyond flawless acting from the iconic duo Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, it truly compliments the professionalism of the way this was filmed. It was overwhelmingly real and worldly, I cannot say I was watching a movie. Such a well made film.",
