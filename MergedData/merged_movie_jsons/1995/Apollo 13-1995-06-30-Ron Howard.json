I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.9/10",

Not only because I am so terribly interested in the exploration of space and the historical events that have taken place - but because it's a great film with excellent performances and a truth-telling style. Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!Just the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.The performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever. The question is, how do you get home? That question is as old as humanity itself.You can tell he put his heart and soul into this one. And the fact that this happened to the American space explorers is hardly noticeable. Good job.",

            "content": "Probably one of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic film despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. Not only is this film wonderfully acted, it also presents a nearly flawless portrayal of the time period, even down to the slide rulers that were used to do calculations. The audience is literally taken back in time to the 1960's, and all of these universally exciting events are brought back to life, and this is one of the things that makes this movie so special. So many films try to do this, and the vast majority of them fail miserably, so it just feels so good to occasionally see it done right.\nAnother thing that was used in the perfect amount in Apollo 13 was the special effects. I am entirely against excessive special effects, because if they aren't justified in being in the film, they can sometimes ruin the film by themselves (remember The Perfect Storm?). The special effects in Apollo 13, however, served the film very well. Of course, the most significant special effect in the film, aside from the space scenes, was the zero gravity, which was done flawlessly. I'm just glad that they decided to go up in one of those Zero-G planes for these scenes, rather than have the actors drift lazily around and act as if they are in zero gravity, because that would have taken a lot away from the film. Apollo 13 has an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic.",

Except for some language problems, it's good storytelling and so interesting that it made me want to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.The movie is fairly long at 140 minutes and there is not much \"action\" but there is a lot of suspense and first-rating acting, both of which should keep anyone's interest. Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it. You can usually count of Director Ron Howard putting out an interesting and well-photographed film.What also was interesting to me, too, was to see these actors, most of whom usually play volatile characters- or did prior to this film - act in such low-key roles. I refer to Ed Harris, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon.By the way, one of the young Lovell children was played by Miko Hughes, who became a co- star in a film - \"Mercury Rising\" - several years later.For such a tense story, with these astronauts lives on the line, none of the astronauts or people at NASA or anyone's family members are ever seeing praying throughout this ordeal! You can bet, in real life, a lot of prayers were answered on this mission.Overall, this is good movie-making and recommended.",

            "content": "Apollo 13 (1995)**** (out of 4) Ron Howard's excellent re-enactment of the Apollo 13 mission, which left three astronauts in space with a damaged ship and not knowing if they'd be able to return to Earth. It's always a wonderful achievement whenever a filmmaker can take a story that everyone knows the outcome to and still manage to make it intense. APOLLO 13 is without question one of the most intense films you're ever going to watch because as soon as the trouble starts in space, you the viewer, are pretty much curled up in a ball worried about every other problem that pops up throughout their situation. It's really amazing when you think how intense it is to just watch a movie so just imagine what it would be like really being up there not knowing your fate or being a family member on the ground not knowing if they are going to see their loved ones again. Director Howard perfectly mixes in these personal dramas with the stuff going on in space and I thought he did a wonderful job at balancing the two. Needless to say, the most amazing stuff happens in space as we see the three men trying to work their way out of the situation. How the film bounces from them to the families to the people in the control center is just remarkable to watch and the level of drama is just so high. Another major plus are the terrific performances. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan are just flawless in their work but so is the rest of the cast even down to the smallest role. APOLLO 13 is great entertainment that works on pretty much all levels and is without question one of the best of its type.",

The movie really has done a good job on showing how inventive people can be in times of need, and on recreating the emotions that the crew, their families and the people in the flight command center had to go through.If you ask me, the film really was at its best as soon as the crew was actually taking off in their rocket. Before that the movie was a little bit too slow to my taste and it didn't have that much to say. However, from the moment the problems with Apollo 13 started I was sitting on the edge of my seat. It all felt very real and you just have to empathize with the crew and their family.Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton,... all did a great job showing us the astronauts, their families and the flight crew on this doomed mission. Their performances made \"Apollo 13\" one of the better movies of the nineties. I reward it with an 8/10.",

Exactly ... and that is how we get to learn our crew.Very well casted and very well played. Now if you know the real life story of what occured, you may not be as much on the edge of your seat as others. But I do believe even those who know how this ends, will find themselves really rooting for the people involved and really being glued to the screen as they say.Very well made film that gives us as much tension and drama as we can take.

            "content": "I'm honestly a little blown away by how much I liked this film. I have heard nothing but good things, and I went in expecting it to be good, but I never would've expected to be so captivated by it. Apollo 13 is probably the best space movie I have ever seen, at least as far as ones based on actual events go.While movies like First Man, Interstellar, or even Gravity, have certain moments that are extremely tense, this film keeps that tension going throughout. Apart from the very beginning, I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 140-minute runtime. Especially once the, now infamous line, 'Houston we have a problem' is said, the tension just keeps on ramping up and never eases until the final credits start rolling.\nTension, and especially high tension, is what's crucial for these types of movies to be successful. Space is, after all, uncharted territory for most of us watching and having that tension present, adds to the anxiety of the unknown. Another thing that is very much explored in this film is the idea that once you are in space, no one will come to the rescue. Add all these things together, and you will have a tense environment. Something that this movie captures incredibly well.Something else that I found fascinating, was the way that the situation in this film was solved. The whole mission was done with basically less computing power than we now have in our pockets. To not only be able to undertake such a mission, but to solve the biggest problem that NASA had ever faced with nothing but human ingenuity, is quite astonishing, especially for someone like me who has lived most of his life used to having computers everywhere. In many ways, this movie celebrates how capable we humans are and how far we can stretch ourselves when needed.What Apollo 13 is, is an incredible story told very well. It captured me and my attention from the very get-go and held onto it until the very end. It's emotional when it needs to be, and the ending can only be described as spectacularly triumphant.\nAs mentioned, I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this film. It had been on my watchlist for forever, and now I'm wondering why it took me so long to watch it.",

            "review_title": "A perfect movie",
            "content": "This review is designed for people like me who have seen Apollo 13 dozens of times. Apollo 13 is one of my favorite movies for several reasons and here is a short rant: the movie was robbed at the 1995 Oscars. It could have been Best Picture and either Ed Harris or Karen Quinlan could have won best supporting actor/actress. At the time the movie was released, people wondered whether it would be Tom Hank's third Oscar in a row. The role of James Lovell was too \"normal\" and the movie too much of an ensemble film for him to have had a chance. Of course that doesn't take anything away from his brilliant, understated performance.The movie premiered around Memorial Day 1995, and I saw it that first weekend in an old-fashioned multi-plex (before stadium seating). Seen in a theater, this movie wraps you in and rockets you back to 1970. It also puts you in a fourth chair in the Command and Lunar modules. I was around for the original Apollo 13 incident: I was the same age as the younger Lovell daughter. Yet, even knowing the whole outcome, I was still enthralled with the intricacy of the whole plot and all of the characters. The \"corridor control burn,\" where the astronauts have to floor the engines and get the LEM back on course was especially exciting in the theater. I think all of the air got sucked out of it by people gasping! Last year I was lucky enough to meet Tracy Reiner, who played Mary Heise. She told me some neat insider information about the movie, such as how they filmed the Lift off scenes at Long Beach, CA and not Florida. Tracy also said that in the arresting scene where she and Marilyn (Karen Quinlan) gaze upward at the ascending rocket, with tears in their eyes, they are actually watching a hanky being hoisted up a flagpole. She also said she filmed most of her scenes with a broken toe.One of the movie's best scenes was the docking sequence. In the hands of a lesser director, it would have been a ho-hum, forgettable scene. Yet Ron Howard rachets up the drama by cross-cutting between Ed Harris and the actor playing Deke Slayton as they worry about Jack Swigert, a last minute replacement performing a critical command module maneuver (\"C'mon rookie, park that thing.\") As many other reviewers have said, the producers did a perfect job re-creating 1970. I laughed at the part where the one Lovell daughter says about the other \"She's still moaning about the stupid Beatles breaking up!\" The older daughter swishes the door open and shoots back \"They're not stupid, you're stupid!\" This brings up another point: whoever did the costuming for the movie absolutely nailed the look of 1970 clothing and hair fashions. Yet, the movie was not nominated for a costume Oscar. I guess you have to be an 1800s or earlier period drama to be considered for that category.At the time the incident originally occurred, we followed along in social studies class. I always knew that they would get the astronauts back safe and sound, but of course, I was an innocent kid. Still, the way the producers handled the re-entry was absolutely breathtaking. I can still see the condensation from the instrument panels dripping down on Lovell, Heise, and Swigert. There was such a dramatic build-up of the broadcast delay from re-entry, it had me and everyone else in the theatre going \"Wait a minute...\" until the static crackled and James Lovell's voice triumphantly booms over the speakers. Everyone in the theater cheered just like the people in mission control.Apollo 13 didn't get the credit it deserved in the year it was released but it is still one of the best movies ever made, period.",

            "content": "As if to prove that the number 13 is truly unlucky - as superstitious people have been telling us for years - the 13th Apollo space mission was a catalogue of disastrous mishaps from start to finish. Ron Howard directs this film version of the events surrounding the ill-fated mission with great attention to the technical detail, making it almost documentary-like in approach. But while some documentaries are rather cold and distant, Howard remembers to keep the emotional drama in his film tense and involving, just as it must have been as the events unfolded for real back in the spring of 1970.Astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) has long dreamed of setting foot on the moon, and gets his chance when chosen to be a member of the Apollo 13 moon landing mission in 1970. The three man team also includes Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton). During their flight to the moon, the three astronauts make regular live transmissions that they believe will be televised down on Earth. However, their TV slot has been axed without them knowing it, as no-one seems particularly interested any more in the rather dull and technical terminology associated with space travel. The mission is destined to become the centre of everyone's attention, however, when a routine oxygen tank procedure goes awry and leads to an explosion. The Apollo shuttle is suddenly marooned in space, with little power, little control and little air. The objective of landing on the moon is replaced with the sole aim of getting the astronauts back home alive. In Houston, scientists struggle against the odds to plan a way to bring the astronauts back to safety, working around the clock to solve various logistical problems facing them. Meanwhile, Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must hold together her family as they face the terrifying possibility of losing their beloved Jim. And aboard the shuttle itself, the three astronauts endure several days of unrelenting doubts and fears as their very lives hang by a thread\u0085.Apollo 13 is a superb recreation of the true story. Its most impressive achievement is that it manages to generate genuine gnawing tension in spite of the fact that most viewers already know the outcome. The performances are first-rate throughout, with Hanks, Bacon and Paxton exceptional as the endangered space travellers, Quinlan totally convincing as Lovell's distraught wife, and Ed Harris in commanding form as the mission controller sweating it out down in Houston. William Broyles Jr and Al Reinert provide an excellent script, which makes absolute sense of the potentially confusing technical dialogue, and also explores the emotional toll of the ordeal realistically and effectively. The final scene especially, in which communication is lost as the astronaut's re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, is so taut that you can feel your heart thumping inside your chest. The film is a celebration of human determination \u0096 some have criticised it for its unapologetic flag-waving and patriotism but such criticisms seem, to me, to be missing the point. This is not so much about America conquering the odds, more a film about the human spirit in general conquering the odds. And that's a message that we should all take from the film with open arms. Apollo 13 is an outstanding film indeed.",

The great news is that with the promise that it had 'Apollo 13' delivers.For starters, it's a technical tour-De-force. It's beautifully photographed, the space setting is enough to leave one in awe and the special effects still hold up incredibly well today. The music score is provided by the now regrettably late (as of two years ago) James Horner. To me it contains some of his best work.It is a hauntingly beautiful score that gives a real sense of adventure, tension and mystery, \"All Systems Go-The Launch\" in particular, the opening trumpet theme and \"Lunar Dreams\" very close behind.There is a great script too, regardless of accuracy or lack of it 'Apollo 13' is up there with having one of the most quotable scripts for any film that decade. Ed Harris has the best lines, but the most unforgettable and oft-quoted line is \"Houston we have a problem\". The story is the kind that leaves one in awe, biting the nails with its high levels of suspense, wrenches the heart in a poignant way and also very inspired. 'Apollo 13' is lengthy and deliberately paced but neither are issues, like they could have been potentially, everything else is just too good.Howard's direction is some of the best he's ever done. A huge asset is the acting, which is nothing short of excellent and often more than that. Tom Hanks excels with an ordinary character that he plays with understated command. Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are welcome contrasts, Gary Sinise is a reliably strong presence and Ed Harris' superb performance to me was the best performance of the cast.In conclusion, brilliant film, no problems here. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Many would argue that, because it is based on true events, history ruins the ending of Apollo 13, and thus, its thriller aspect is worthless. I will confess to ignorance here: I knew next to nothing about the real-life mission, and thus, I was able to really enjoy the movie's thriller aspect.The first half hour of Apollo 13 basically introduces the main characters. Its slow pace actually helps it in the long run; it plods along and finds its own, comfortable pace. Some mightn't like this, but I did. As soon as a little complication is introduced involving Gary Sinise's character, the movie skyrockets forward and doesn't stop. Characters that we've gotten to know and care for are then involved in one scary series of events, making the film that much more thrilling.Ron Howard really knows how to direct. The suspense sequences of Apollo 13 work out fantastically. He doesn't add unnecessary material to the film to make it more popular to the masses. There is no \"asteroid field\" sequence that a superficial teen audience would go crazy over. As a result, the film really feels like it is taking place in outer space. This adds a layer of realism to the (fantastic) special effects, and the film is that much better.An added bonus is Tom Hanks in the lead role as Jim Lovell. He is one of the few popular actors who really deserve all the praise. Hanks adds a touch of humanity to his role; he doesn't feel like an unerring, invincible protagonist, and he doesn't feel like a \"Gary Sue\" who will mess up at all the appropriate times. As the ship's crew begins to argue, Hanks joins in the shouting, trying to \"break it up\". But it isn't his voice that stops the arguing. Hanks makes his character and the danger he is in feel real. That takes real talent.But Hanks is not the only one who deserves praise. Every single actor in the film, from Gary Sinise to Ed Harris, does a fantastic job. Their characters are not imitations of real-life personages; they are their own. Everyone seems to fit their character perfectly, even Jim Lovell's elderly mother (who is introduced lamenting that her son's broadcast is not on TV).Arguably, Apollo 13's most pleasant surprise is found in its gentle inclusion of comic relief. It doesn't seem intrusive or inappropriate. The best way to describe it is \"gentle\". For instance, two world-famous astronauts are introduced to Jim's mother as regular, ordinary young men. It's funny and doesn't seem forced into the plot.The Verdict: Apollo 13 is a splendid little film, thrilling when it has to be, comic at times, and carried all the way by splendid performances from all the actors. Solid direction and superb visual effects just add to make it the great film it is.Overall Rating: 10/10",

            "content": "Apollo 13, in my opinion, is one of the finest films of the 20th Century thanks to its incredible cast, emotionally tender direction from Ron Howard and James Horner's incredibly patriotic score to top it all off. It's 90s filmmaking at its very best; it balances practical effects with CGI perfectly in a way that just feels... right for Apollo 13 in particular because it's one of those movies that was at the 80s-90s Hollywood aesthetic crossroad.The zero-gravity scenes in the Apollo 13 are still remarkable today thanks to the little 'trick' the filmmakers used to make it seem like the actors were really in space: controlling the trajectory of a plane by having it fly up and down in a way that they emulated the 'weightlessness' the astronauts experienced during the near-disaster that was Apollo 13. Gravity could almost be interpreted as a plot-point in the story: it shows that the Apollo 13's situation nearly spun right out of control and that without the help of NASA they wouldn't have been able to focus on their rescue effort; this essentially makes Apollo 13 a disaster movie that has three astronauts trying their damnedest to come back home: dear old planet Earth.Apollo 13 is a classic for good reason: its sensual direction, the characters, the music and the space sequences are the stuff of cinematic dreams. And it all really happened. This is a story of human will, progress and fighting against the odds. It's remarkable stuff.This is one of my all-time favorite movies. 5/5 stars.",

            "content": "I am at a loss as to why some people criticise this movie unless they are far to young to understand the period and the importance of the space program at the time.Anyone who has been to the Smithsonian in Washington DC will appreciate that these were pretty crude instruments to travel to the moon and back. I would'nt cross town in one of these but men of determination, dedication, vision and belief set off for what has been until now the greatest adventure of all time.Inevitably something was always going to go wrong and this was Apollo 13. That through ingenuity, analysis, and bravery under fire (so to speak) the crew returned to Earth is every bit as remarkable as what the story suggests.The settings are realistic, down to clothes, hairstyles and the like. The fusion of the event with the more mundane aspects of family life add to the realism. The acting is strong and believable, and I particularly liked the interpretation of Lovell's wife, who manages to blend support of her husband, with fear and concern, while trying to run a relatively normal household.The parts of the three astronauts are well portrayed. Hanks, who I wax and wane on does a good job and Kevin Bacon is plausible as Swigert, even if his bachelor status is a bit overcooked. Gary Sinese, as always, is terrific and his role in the rescue of the mission is a little overstated, but he is just as good here as he was as Capt. Dan in Forest Gump. Ed Harris, also as is usual, is very good (and I particularly liked his waistcoat).This makes a great companion piece to The Right Stuff, another of my favourite movies, and anyone interested in the space program, and where it came from, should have both in their DVD collection, along with the documentary piece, In the Shadow of the Moon and the TV series From the Earth to the Moon.",

Some might say they love it just for the effects; but I believe that it has a great story, and a perfect selection of actors, perfectly cast. Ed Harris excels, as does Tom Hanks - and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are each superb in their roles.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that it encompasses so many parts and peoples, and appeals to so many, that by the last reel you feel that if they don't make it through, you have lost some of your closest friends.In short: a minor masterpiece.",

            "content": "Apollo 13 has that don't tell me, the sky's the limit, when there is footsteps on the moon, feel to it. Directed by Ron Howard, this out of this world movie was very successful on bringing the exciting and the entertainment value. One small step for a man, is indeed one giant leap for mankind. Adapted from the book, 'Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13', by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The movie follows astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) aboard Apollo 13 spacecraft, attempting for a Moon landing mission. En-route to the moon, they suffer from an on-board explosion that deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. This force NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turn the mission into a rescue operation to get the three men home safely. Can they get the men back to Earth or will the astronauts, perish in space? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; since the movie is based on true events, the movie does have a predictable outcome. Anybody, who readt the history books, or saw any NASA program, knows how the events ended. Still, there are some really dangerous moments that might surprise some viewers, and make you jump, out of their seat, wondering if the crew was going to live or die. Even if you were the biggest NASA fan; the movie showcase a lot of things that you might not, know about the mission. You don't know the gravity of the dangerous situation until you watch Apollo 13! Indeed, failure wasn't an option. This movie was intense! Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. It will leave you more of an impact. While, Apollo 13 shot for the moon and it kinda miss, at least, it's among the stars. Every actor in this movie shine. Tom Hanks was great as the leading man. The supporting cast was equality as good. My favorites had to be Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, Head of Mission Control and Gary Sinise as astronaut, Ken Mattingly. I even love the cameo from the real life, Jim Lovell as a captain of the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima. One thing, that I didn't like, about the film, is how negatively, the portrayal of Jack Swigert was. They portrayal him, as a weaker astronaut, compare to the others, because of his lack of training, and bachelor status. In real life, Swigert was a well-trained Command Module pilot and highly respected. He was no black sheep. No one was really too worried about whether he was up to the job, but the real-life, Lovell admitted, he were really worried about was the rendezvous with Swigert as they left the Moon, but that never got to happen. Another thing, when did being a bachelor; became a bad thing? Didn't every man in the life, start out, as a bachelor, at one time? I have to say, despite that. Kevin Bacon did surprising, pretty well. Bill Paxton as Fred Haise, was alright for the role, but he's by far, the weakest in the film. I love how accurate the film is. The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, \"Houston, we have a problem.\" This quote alone, was voted one of the best movie lists in movie history. Ron Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA's technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and even obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced gravity aircraft, KC-135 for realistic depiction of the \"weightlessness\" experienced by the astronauts in space. The actors went aboard multiple KC-135 flights so much, that they outdone, even real astronauts in the amount of training, they got. I have to say, all the training, pull off in a realistic portrayal. Not only that, the movie went the extra mile in special effects. In an era where CGI was primitive, this movie was able to make it look like a rocket was blasting off into space, while, using little CGI. All the space shots were original made, and not taken from previous NASA space stock footage. There was no moment in the film that I didn't believe, they weren't in space. Even, real life astronauts like Buzz Aldrin got fooled, in believing they were in space. While, the movie is pretty accurate to historical events, Apollo 13 did take some artistic licenses for dramatic effects. In real life, the three astronauts remained surprisingly cool under pressure in real life, but the movie ramped up emotional tensions between them to make it, more thrilling. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is how much, foreshadowing, they used in the film. We get it! Did we really need, the scene where Jim's car was having problems or Jim's wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) losing her wedding ring? Come on! Another problem is the abundance of technical babble and bureaucratic jargon. Some scenes were really hard to understand, what was going on. Still, the movie does a good job, trying to explain, all the science. One thing that I love about the film; is composter James Horner's score. It really captures the wonder of flight. Overall: From lift-off to splashdown, Apollo 13 gives one hell of a ride. It was a very compelling, smart and suspenseful movie. A must-watch.",

            "content": "This is a recreation of America's third NASA mission to land on the moon in 1970, and the subsequent disaster that almost befell the mission........Director Ron Howard and his producer Brian Grazer, made a top draw picture about an incident that everyone knew the outcome too. That it engrosses and thrills to make the inevitable denouement a mere component of a whole, is quite a fabulous achievement. Sure it can be said that it lacks a certain political appendage {RE:The Right Stuff}, but for the duration of this picture we are wowed by the design and construction on offer. It would have been easy for Howard to use stock footage of real NASA missions, but all sequences are recreated by the makers with astonishingly impacting results, thus adding authenticity to the palpable tension when things go belly up.Howard was wise in his choice of leading man, who better than Tom Hanks {Jim Lovell, who's memoirs the script worked from} to portray a bastion of Americana?, nobody, because Hanks is perfect, as are Bill Paxton {Fred Haise} and Kevin Bacon {John Swigart} sitting either side of Hanks, a couple of bona fide solid and respected actors you could not have wished to have. Down on the ground the acting is also exemplary, Kathleen Quinlan as the fraught Marylyn Lovell is fantastic, with Ed Harris {Gene Kranz} and Gary Sinise {Ken Mattingly} adding emotional weight to the unfolding drama. With Howard reining in his trade mark sentimental flourishes, Apollo 13 relies on its story and its craft to steer it safely home, and safely home it gets, just like the men of Apolo 13. To give us a punch the air joy that comes as much out of tension relief as it does because of raw human emotion, quite a picture indeed. 8/10",

The recreation of all the hardware and locations was perfect in every detail, which had never been attempted before, nor had the concept of generating ACTUAL weightlessness inside a KC-135 flying a parabolic trajectory!People complain that... ...the dialog was too technical, when in fact it was \"dumbed down\" quite a bit! If you're having trouble understanding what's being said... READ A BOOK! ...the ending was known! Ah, but the tale was not!

            "content": "When the Apollo 13 mission took off to go to the moon, the television networks generally tuned out with the attitude that it was more of the same old stuff that the public had seen before and grown tired of. To the crew it represented much more of course, being Jim Lovell's final mission and his chance to finally make it to the moon itself, an aim he intends to see through despite having one of his crew replaced at the last minute by Jack Swigert. However the networks all tune in when a minor malfunction with the electrical system results in an explosion and the loss of oxygen, sending the unit out of control. With the crew retreating into the lunar module, the ground crew scramble to work out how to get them home despite the constantly lengthening odds. At the time of release this was a fairly massive film that was talked up for all manner of reasons and not all of these are still as applicable today. One thing that wasn't really talked up was the writing and the convincing nature of the plot, not a real surprise considering that these aspects seem to be delivered without a great deal of spark or flair. I know that it is based on a true story but it is hard to fully accept all of the film as some of it seems so far fetched as to be a bit silly. I'm totally open to the idea that this could have been 100% accurate but if that is the case one has to wonder how simplified the material was because at times it feels like Lovell and his crew were just blasting their way to earth. The script is OK but never really gets that involving, instead keeping a consistent stream of memorable gruff barking but nothing that really gets close to realistic dialogue. This is not to say that it isn't engaging, because it is and it does have some degree of involvement and of course historical interest but it is not as good as it could have been.The direction is good even if the effects are not as impressive as they were a decade ago \u0096 even some of the blue screen backdrops don't look that convincing. The decision to shoot some of film in the 'vomit comet' in order to convey the effects of weightlessness is a nice touch and does work pretty well, although naturally none of these shots can last very long and sometimes the editing of these shots with shots in the same scene set on the static set doesn't quite marry up. This is a minor complaint though and it does serve to make the film feel more 'real'. The ensemble cast are mixed and many have little to work with \u0096 ironically though those with the least important characters seem to have an easier time just barking out gruff dialogue. It is for this reason that the film's more memorable performances come from the ground, where a lot of the action occurs. Sinise is interesting and a key part of the rescue effort while Harris (who was in space in the much better The Right Stuff) gets the memorable lines. Of course it is Hanks who was the star at the time and he does OK; he has 'the' line but mainly his performance is not helped by the material. He conveys Lovell's longing for the moon but can only do this by staring out the window wistfully every now and again. Paxton and Bacon make up the trio and both are good without ever really having a chance to excel. The ground crew are mainly very good in their minor roles but somebody forgot to give the wives etc characters and Quinlan et al are left to just occasionally look at the TV/sky with either a touch of tears or a look of hopeful resilience \u0096 unsurprisingly none of them really made much of an impression with this thankless task.Overall this is an OK film but not anything that special. It is a glossy historical piece that lurches between convincing telling to some rather extreme moments that feel like they have been over simplified to the point of doing the reality an injustice. The cast are impressive on paper but the lack of a strong script really gives them little to actually work with, although none of them are actually bad it is possible to see that they are reaching without much help. The effects are OK but are a little dated even if the novelty of the weightless scenes is still there, but what I would have given for more of a human touch to what is otherwise an enjoyable technical product.",

            "content": "\"Apollo 13\" is a docudrama that has you on the edge of your seat even if you may know what's going to happen. It's the true story of the 1970 mission to the moon where the famous \"Houston, we have a problem,\" quote originated. Other documentaries tell the same story, but this 1995 version, directed by Ron Howard, is a must-see masterpiece.The lead character of mission commander Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks. (My 10th-grade students watched it and recognized Hanks' voice as Woody from \"Toy Story\".) Lovell refuses to be superstitious about the number 13. When his crew is moved up from Apollo 14 to 13, his wife asks, \"Why does it have to be 13?\" \"Because it follows 12,\" he replies. Lovell is funny, smart and a good leader. He was a step ahead of mission control and always had his crew working ahead of mission director's requests. Before this mission Lovell had flown three missions for NASA, but now he wanted to walk on the moon in the worst way.Unfortunately, the crew winds up facing a catastrophe that threatens their mission to the moon and their lives. Instead of using the lunar module to land on the moon, they have to first live in it to survive their flight. The amazing thing is how director Ron Howard lets us experience everyone's journey, not just the astronauts. We also see the mission controllers arguing and problem solving. Lovell's wife, Marilyn, is shown each step of the way constantly adding depth and emotion to balance the technical NASA speak.Emotional balance and master pacing is a hallmark of Ron Howard's films. All of his movies, which include \"Cacoon,\" \"Splash,\" \"Backdraft,\" \"A Beautiful Mind,\" etc., have emotional cores that anchor them. You come away feeling like you've had a truly human experience.I am addicted to this movie: once I see a scene of it while flipping through channels, it's impossible to turn it off. I have to watch it to the end. I have almost studied it frame by frame for the unusual camera angles and another time for the pacing of humor to make the tension bearable.I'm not sure I'll ever grasp all the magnificence of this movie, but I think if I keep trying, all my storytelling will improve.Ultimately, there's something for everyone in this film, so watch if you haven't seen it.

            "content": "\"O, swear not by the moon, the fickle moon, the inconstant moon\u0085\" \u0096 Shakespeare, \"Romeo and Juliet\".I smell that familiar kerosene funk in the air: solid rocket boosters firing, RP-1 propellant and liquid hydrogen surging, flux capacitor giga-watting - yes, it's the Tom Hanks Oscar-Machine chugging rugged in red-carpet mode. Trying to film a story with so many integral characters is impossible with a camera-magnet like Hanks tooling around on set. Our media-driven lifestyle denotes that \"star-power\" dictates character importance in a movie, so though Hanks may be playing a prominent role as one of three astronauts imperiled by the Apollo 13 malfunction, Every Single Member of NASA is equally worthy of the limelight blindingly focused on Mr. Fantastic. Though not a Hanks-Hater, I feel credit is squandered on his character of Jim Lovell, simply because said character is played by Statuette Boy. In the real world, credit for the rescue of the seemingly-doomed Apollo 13 spacecraft is dispersed throughout hundreds of personnel, each of them a Hero, with a capital 'H': not least, the Flight Directors, Gene Kranz, Glynn Lunney and John Aaron (Kranz played by Ed Harris, the most notable actor of the FD's, thereby implying he was the most \"important\" \u0096 once again, sigh). Lunney, Kranz's relief FD, was played excellently by a stoic Marc McClure and Aaron - the FD who identified \"power\" as key factor in the life-saving stakes, thereby engineering the decision to \"turn off everything but the essentials\" \u0096 was fleshed out by the clinical-tastic Loren Dean. Astronaut Ken Mattingly, dropped from the original Apollo 13 crew and earthbound for medical reasons, was personified by the suave intensity of Gary Sinise. Lovell's crew were Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton, in his patented \"Game over, man!\" swoon) and John Swigert (the ever-dependable Kevin Bacon, whose presence in this movie with so many other A-Listers puts him at least \"two degrees\" closer to about 436 other actors\u0085)Unlike the DeLorean DMC-12, or the LZ 129 Hindenburg, or the RMS Titanic - all failures on a grand scale, all seemingly trespassing on virgin technology and future advancement, with each failure marking the end of an era for their respective milieux \u0096 the \"failure\" of the Apollo 13 lunar mission aided in advancing space-faring dialect and paved the future with skyward momentum for the International Space Station, the Space Transportation System (Shuttles), Mars Soft Landers and beyond\u0085Disabled by a wiring malfunction explosion, Apollo 13's prime directive shifted from \"frolic on moon at taxpayers' expense\" to \"stay alive, no matter what occurs\". As a result of the explosion, technical problems compound, each adversity overlapping the previous one, with the spacecraft crew and Mission Control united against the exigencies of the failing mission itself.Director Ron Howard intelligently chose to have nothing more than true-to-life events provide the drama of \"Apollo 13\"; as obvious as this may sound, very few \"true\" or \"inspired by\" films refrain from inserting Hollywood subplot and clich\u00e9 to ramp up the stakes \u0096 with this tale, Howard did not need to. The phrase, \"You can't make this sh*t up!\" springs to mind, as all the \"formulae\" were present: \"ticking clocks\", \"family stakes\", \"technological adversity as villain\", all encapsulated in the real life tale of three astronauts who missed the moon but unwittingly hit a jackpot\u0085Had the Apollo 13 crewmen died during their rescue attempt, American fortitude would have suffered a blow infinitely worse than the beating it took when either of the lightning-quick Shuttle disasters stunned the nation. With the Shuttles, it was over before anyone had time to realize problems had even arisen. With Apollo 13, manifest effort was expended over the course of four days; a public vigil during an avalanche of adversity that would have broken the back of America if the crew had not survived. And in the surviving, gradually attaining a \"success\" (read as \"fame\") far greater than any of the men who actually trod the Moon's surface (barring Armstrong and Aldrin). Proof? Tell me: who were the three astronauts of Apollo 14? (Not even Apollo 11 had the honor of having a PINBALL MACHINE created after them.) In the movie, responding to the notion that it could be \"the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced\", Ed Harris retorts, \"I believe this is going to be our finest hour.\" He was right. An exemplary aspect of this film is the unobtrusiveness of its computer-generated visuals. Though Georgie Lucas believes he has the monopoly on CGI-film-making (simply because he owns the company that icings a large percentage of A-List blockbuster), Ron Howard illustrates \u0096 via Digital Domain's finesse - how to incorporate CGI into one's movie with class and taste. Quite simply - this is as good as it gets! Every star-field, exterior shot and moon view is seamless subtlety; without even realizing it, we see *all-new* footage of Apollo 13 rising on the Saturn V pillar of fire; Hanks' fantasy of descending to the Moon's surface (made ever more poignant by the fact that he has lost the opportunity) captures the sheer, crazy joy of raking one's fingers through regolith and gazing skywards at a gibbous earth-rise\u0085 No need for dandy villains, exotic beasts or killer droids, Howard's judicious use of CGI captures everything that Lucas' imprudent abuse lost \u0096 true magnificence and awe.Lucas directed Howard in \"American Graffiti\". In sooth, the Padawan has become the Master.It is a testament to the talent of this Master that he could fashion such an involving movie from three guys stranded in a refrigerator for a week and a pack of Reservoir Dogs jargonizing at outdated computers.If not for those Apollo 13 \"failures\" (Lovell, Haise and Swigert), Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14 might have had a more glorious day in the sun \u0096 or the Moon, as it were\u0085(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",

To say more would be to spoil the experience, but this is an example of old-fashioned filmmaking at its best. There are a few weak CGI effects but mainly this story is told by the dedicated team of actors, none of whom do wrong. It's a slow burner for sure, but the premise is so unusual and so interesting than it works a treat from beginning to end.",

            "content": "Apollo 13 (1995, Ron Howard)\nThis may well be Ron Howard's crowning achievement as a film maker. I remember this film being good. It was nominated for awards, and even in my college age young adulthood I recognized that this film was good. At the time I didn't know the story of the Apollo 13 astronauts and thus the tension in the film was very real for me as it became a survival mission with incredibly long odds. This film triumphs in just about every conceivable way. It contains a powerhouse set of iconic actors in their prime including Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton and Ed Harris among others. The writing is brilliant balancing technical jargon with a very humanistic story. In the early 70's man has achieved the moon and now it has become an afterthought; something that is seen as almost pedestrian. It is not an afterthought for the astronaut's who trained a lifetime for this and fear funding for the program may be cut before they get their opportunity. It is not an afterthought for the men and women in mission control working as best they can to keep the astronauts safe. It is not an afterthought for the families left behind who feel unending fear and anxiety until those men return safely home. As we all know Apollo 13 misses the moon and the astronaut's lives are put in great peril and this is the story of those who worked tirelessly to save them as they also worked tirelessly to save themselves. The film is also a stunning technical achievement and has been lauded as one of the most technically accurate movies ever made. That is probably why, even 23 years later, the film still is visually stunning. I remember seeing the Apollo 13 launch scene in the theater and being blown away by it. And if you somehow don't know the outcome of this event if functions incredibly well as an edge of your seat nail biter. At the time I thought it was good. Now I have come to realize it is an American classic, one of the best films of the 1990's and the crowning achievement in the very prolific film career of Ron Howard.\nEric's Grade: A",

Having already achieved the landing, the world isn't paying attention to this mission. That is until things go wrong. Ed Harris plays the Flight Director Gene Kranz and Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell.This is a compelling story on its own. On the surface, this is the B-side of the epic man's mission to Mars. However director Ron Howard meticulously retains the details of the mission that makes it all come to life on the screen. That is the greatness of this movie. It is epic in all of its small details and its scope. All the actors are giving sincere performances in an old fashioned movie.",

But in any case, how many actors can tout four iconic movies in their entire career, let alone one decade.\"Apollo 13\" is a drama about a \"successful failure.\" A crew of astronauts failed to land on the moon, but faced with catastrophic damage to their vessel they were able to successfully get back home.This movie is a real tribute to all of the people who contribute to a space mission. Though the astronauts are the face of each space mission, there are tens, if not hundreds of people behind the scenes making sure that mission goes smoothly. In \"Apollo 13\" we got to see those people go to work.Director, Ron Howard, did a great job with the movie. Though it was replete with technical jargon it never once bogged down the script or made me feel lost like I would feel some years later listening to the Architect in \"Matrix Revolutions.\"\"Apollo 13\" is a spectacular movie that is gripping and intense without huge explosions or widespread wreckage.

But Hollywood's version of the events is probably the most American movie I've ever seen - not just those willing to hurl themselves out into the black, but those on the ground forced to bring them home (that's right, it's an engineering movie; the nerds are behind the wheel).And as a movie, it's a pretty great ride, going from adventurous space travel to unity in the face of disaster. Ron Howard knows how to maximize emotional impact, and it comes when you least expect it. There's genuine melancholy when the astronauts are denied their landing on the moon - and as dangerous as their predicament is, the real drama happens in the control room. That's saying something with a big effects movie like this. And as much as I like Tom Hanks (and this is a fine cast, right down the line), this really belongs to Gary Sinise and Ed Harris in supporting roles. And Harris has one of my very favorite lines in cinema: \"We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option.\" I dunno how accurate it is, but this film - on its own terms - is a tribute to American know-how.

And that I had been spoiled by the recent space movies such as Gravity, Star Trek, or even Man of Steel. While technology has come a long way since 1995, I think Apollo 13 does hold up. And that is thanks to director Ron Howard and the entire cast of the film.When I say entire cast, I mean it. There are a number of great actors who were involved with the overall greatness that this movie was. Ed Harris is once again the bright spot of the film. He can do no wrong in any role, and Gene Kranz is one of his most iconic roles. This role even helped him get the speaking only part in Gravity. Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon formed a good trio inside the spaceship, though I would preferred Sinise. Sadly it does take awhile to get into space, a near 40 minutes before lift off. I understand you need to set up the emotional side with the family before capturing our heart strings in the final 15 minutes. But to do that you also need to have capable cast members as the family. Which in my opinion were the major weak spot. You don't really get to know the children at all, and Hank's wife doesn't do anything that we haven't seen out of worried family member. It just wasn't what ill remember this film for. I will remember it for showing the amount of hard work that hundreds and probably thousands of people had to do to save 3 people. It just shows you what a little teamwork can do.I thought the pacing was nice, especially for a 2hr 20 minute film. I also found it fascinating how many steps go into just one particular task while aboard a spaceship. Comparing it to one of my favorite films Gravity, there's a lot more going on. But Gravity's story is probably more remarkable because it was just one person. It isn't a true story like this one so when a miracle happens in the film, you know you're watching something that has actually happen. Where would I put this amongst the all-time space films? Not sure, but it would have to crack the top 10. At least until Interstellar comes along.So in all, with a tremendous cast with a truly unbelievable story, this film can be enjoyable and thrilling at the same time. Just remember that this happened and that human beings were able to pull through that day and save human lives.+Great ensemble cast +Thousands save three +Pacing +Score -Family members didn't care about8.4/10",

I grew up not knowing anything about it until this movie came out in the summer of 1995, releasing the same weekend as Under Siege 2, which is the weekend I started getting very sick, an illness that came to define my teens. I finally saw Apollo 13 when it released in the UK, in screen 2 of the Edinburgh Odeon on September 23rd 1995, the day before my 15th birthday (my actual birthday movie was Speed on widescreen VHS), with a sold-out audience.In the US a lot of tall buildings miss floor 13, skipping from 12 to 14, fearing bad luck. They fail to realize that floor 14 will still be the 13th floor. For some reason this logic always reminds me of Nigel Tufnel. Pilots, sea captains, and astronauts are a very superstitious lot, so I don't get why NASA let two number 13s slip in there. Not that it would ANY difference at all, but they could have maybe launched on the 12th and called the mission Apollo 12.5. Maybe?There's a lot of effort made to keep this movie as accurate as possible to real life, from analysing NASA transcripts right down to the fashions and style within the Lovell household. There's no exaggeration or dramatic licence here. We're very far from Michael Bay's Armageddon. A routine mission to the moon, ignored by the media, is thrown into chaos when an oxygene tank blows, ripping open the side of the spacecraft. With the extremely limited technology of the time (the average iPhone has million times more computing power) the astronauts on board, the increasingly exhausted team at mission control, and the rejected third crew member struggle to keep things hanging together as they slingshot around the moon (so close, yet so far, in a bittersweet scene), and head back to Earth running on empty.Ron Howard details the long, torturous journey full of clammy, claustrophobic impatience on both the spacecraft and at control as everyone tears out their hair thinking of various last-minute solutions to every new problem, but it's not a film assembled by nervous, chaotic editing (I already said that this is not Armageddon). The pace and succession of events is laid-back and measured, a style of editing that is not too common now. James Horner provides one of his better scores, with some haunting touches, that lend the movie a timeless dignity.Apollo 13 shoots for the moon and back again and does so with more unpretentious dignity than virtually all of the similar blockbusters that followed. It's a Sunday afternoon movie, not a Saturday night special, and none the worse for it.",

Howard captures the drama and tension of the event and the teamwork and dedication of all involved with the space program.Excellent performances by Hanks, Paxton and Bacon as the crew of A13, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was scrubbed from mission at the last minute but selflessly did so much to help the crew make it back. Ed Harris was stellar as Gene Kranz, the Mission Control flight director as was Kathleen Quinlan, playing Marilyn Lovell, wife of A13 commander Jim Lovell.And after viewing this again I realized that we have had a couple generations of Americans (those under 50)grow without having experienced and seen the excitement and pride virtually all of us shared in the manned space programs, that climaxed with the moon landings in 69 and the early 70's.

The premise surrounds the historic \"successful failure\" of the Apollo 13 shuttle's attempt to land on the moon, a mission lead by Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, whose patience and poise make him a fascinating character. The bulk of the film is Houston and the crew working together to do whatever they can to get these men back home alive.Simply put, the acting here conveys the danger of the return mission and just how serious it all is. Ed Harris, for example, as NASA flight director Gene Kranz is other-worldly commanding on the screen. These actors suck you in to the last detail of what's going on, the great screenplay pads that with actual media coverage of the event to convey a sense of how the world is feeling, and then Ron Howard steps in to make the transitions flawless (with the help his Oscar-winning editors) There are times where a scene will show in the shuttle, in Houston, inside Lovell's family's home, at the nursing home where his mother lives, etc. all within minutes of each other and it's not confusing at all. No single thread seems overdone, they all work cohesively.Since the focus is on the characters and problem-solving, space does not become an integral part of the storytelling. It is contextual and is used to help convey the astronauts drive and motivation. For example, at first when things on the shuttle go wrong, it's not \"oh, I hope we survive\" but \"damnit, we can't go to the moon now.\" Especially for Lovell, the missed opportunity for space is something that nags at him despite just being glad he survived. That is what makes this film a great space film: space is simply a new place for disaster drama to play out and make us wonder about the implications of being in danger so far from home.\"Apollo 13\" doesn't have all the suspense that a film with a lesser publicly known outcome has, but it certainly gets you riding its emotional train to triumph. It's not glitzy, it doesn't over-glorify space and while it might have taken a hit on the entertainment value one might expect from a space movie, it more than makes up for with great, engaging storytelling.",

But Apollo 13 was famous for nearly ending in disasters, but NASA was able to prevent it.After the success of the Apollo 11 mission veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) and his crew Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are assigned to the Apollo 13 mission to the moon. They train and become an effective team, but Ken is removed when his blood test shows he is inflected with measles. Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) has to replace the man 2 days before the flight. When the flight takes off everything seems find for the first three days. But then one of the oxygen tanks blow up, and their capsule starts to run out of oxygen and the moon mission is abandoned. The NASA ground control team lead by Eugene F. Kranz (Ed Harris) and the astronauts enter in a race against time to get back to end. On the way they have to uses as little electricity as possible and make sure that the carbon dioxide levels from getting too high. On Earth there is also a personal drama involving the families of the astronauts, led by Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan), who can only watch on TV and pray that their husbands can come back to Earth safely.Ron Howard is easily on of the biggest hit and miss director's in Hollywood. For every quality film like Frost/Nixon there is a poor film to counter act it like the Da Vinci Code. Luckily Apollo 13 is on the good side on the Ron Howard scale. I have been very critical of the films that were nominated for Oscars in 1995, the awful Braveheart winning undeserved awards, whilst The Usual Suspects, Heat, Casino, Se7en, Nixon and Twelve Monkeys were all over looked for a nomination. Apollo 13 was at least the most deserving for a nod in that year. Ron Howard direct's a fine film, having some wise directional choices. He uses some excellent special effects, has some wonderful camera, shots in real locations and uses low gravity, a good use of real news footage and after a slow build up makes a interesting and exciting film about how NASA got the astronauts back against the odds. Ron Howard also shot the film as PG, which in modern cinema normally seen as weaken a film because it doesn't make it seem adult: but this was a wise move by Howard. This story didn't require swearing or violence, giving the film a wider audience and a older-fashion feel like Casablanca or Spartacus. But despite these good aspects, the film does have a very overwhelming score which wasn't needed.There is also a good cast to the film, Tom Hanks, who is very good in the film, Kathleen Quinlan was also very good, Ed Harris, an actor I like, Gary Sinise in one of his better performances, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. This was a film that was acting for awards. In another year it would have got them.A good film if you are interested in NASA and the space programme.",

However, just when the U.S. becomes complacent about it's achievements, disaster strikes. According to the book written by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, a faulty circuit built into the wiring aboard their space vehicle two years before their scheduled trip, a problem was waiting to endanger their mission. Ron Howard the gifted actor/director creates a real-life historical drama with this film called \" Apollo 13. \" Nearly a quarter of a million miles into space, the astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and rookie Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) experience a major explosion aboard this space craft and within minutes realize they may not only not reach the moon, but are in danger of dying before they get there. Their only hope is that the ground team at the Huston Space center can somehow discover a way to help them get home. Despite the fact there are several special teams who help the astronauts' convert their landing craft to become a life-line, none of it would have mattered had it not been for Astronaut Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). His expertise and computer knowledge is incredible and one applause's his tireless efforts. The film itself is a tribute to the courage and fortitude of the families and their daunting task of trying not to show their fear in front of a plethora of newsmen, media correspondences and T.V. reporters who lay siege to their homes. The movie is exciting and sympathetically poignant as the audience joins the three men in a life and death struggle. This movie is a triumph not only for the actors, the director, but also for the space program which endures to this day as America's finest. ****",

In short the dangers of space flight surpassed my courage and my feelings of endeavour . It takes guts to travel through space and if you get into serious trouble aboard a space craft you`re in danger of suffering a quick spectacular death or a slow lingering one\nAPOLLO 13 is the Hollywood blockbuster treatment of the ill fated mission to the moon and is a testament to the courage of astronauts everywhere . The film starts with the tragic accident of an earlier Apollo mission that left three astronauts dead and then goes on to tell the tale of the Apollo 13 where an oxygen tank explodes on the module close to the moon meaning the three man crew are almost certain to suffer a slow lingering death 250,000 miles out in space . It`s a true life drama fairly well told even if it does have a few flaws . For example director Ron Howard`s camera work moves around a bit too much while having a big name star like Tom Hanks detracts slightly from the drama . It would have been totally compelling if we`d had a slightly flat directing style with unknown actors , but like I said this is the Hollywood blockbuster treatment which needs to make money at the box office , so I guess we can forgive that . Astronauts are very brave people and APOLLO 13 makes light of that fact , so it`s a success .",

If you don't believe me, check out the photos of the actual Lovell, Haise and Swiggert.I heavily question the wisdom of casting Hanks and Bacon as astronauts, since NASA usually chooses real men, not pansies like these two Hollywood phonies. (Even worse, Howard originally wanted John Cusack to be the third astronaut!) If you thought that Buscemi, Willis, and Affleck were stupidly cast in the ultra-moronic \"Armageddon\", then check out A13. Not for a second did I manage to suspend my disbelief that Hanks is just Hanks, i.e. the pompous, overrated Hollywood bore, or that Bacon, who is an awful actor in any genre, could be anything but the man who married the \"beautiful\" Kyra Sedgwick. Paxton doesn't look anything like an astronaut either, but at least he is a likable presence. Harris is good, but I have to question any director who casts Gary Sinise: this man is one of the most uncharismatic, worst actors in recent years.Ron Howard is infamous for his awful casting choices. I can't think of a single movie he made in which he didn't cast according to his box-office aspirations, rather than according to who suits the roles best. Cash and fame are the sole motivators in his career. Howard is the consummate commercial director, consistently ejecting one mediocrity after another into the already dwindling-quality sub-par world of movies. The fact that his equally greedy and hypocritical Tinseltown peers love him, showering him with those meaningless little golden statuettes, only serves to prove my point.The story is good, but the casting sinks any hopes of this finally reaching the lofty ambitions of Howard: to finally make a movie that is good enough to be considered as average. I also wasn't too thrilled with the visual look of the space scenes; they have a plastic look to them; everything is shining nice and clean, as if Ron was making an AT&T commercial, not a thriller. Howard also fails to recreate that elusive 70s feel.There's a funny moment in \"VIP\" (\"Very Important Pennis\"), in which a mock journalist by the name of Dennis Pennis tells Tom Hanks and Ron Howard the following: \"Tom, you've made the ultimate space movie: completely lacking in atmosphere.\" To his credit, Howard laughed.",

            "content": "I've seen \"Apollo 13\" a few times now, and even with two sets of DVD commentary and a fine documentary under my belt, I can't exactly say what took place. They call it a \"Main Bus B Undervolt,\" but whatever the case, it cripples the spacecraft Apollo 13 just as it is about to reach the moon, forcing the crew to abandon their mission and undergo some hasty improvisations in order to make it back to Earth alive.There's a lot of technical jargon spewed in this film, not as much as was actually uttered on the spacecraft and at Mission Control in Houston, but enough to befuddle those of us who dozed off in science class back in high school. Still, I enjoyed this film, even when I didn't quite understand it.Tom Hanks stars as steady-in-zero-G Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, successfully underplaying the heroics without losing the dramatic urgency of the moment. Early in the movie, we see him joke with his wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) with the sort of easy banter those of us who have followed him since \"Bosom Buddies\" are accustomed to. There's a funny scene early on, as he watches the Apollo 11 landing with a roomful of simultaneously proud and jealous fellow astronauts, all yelling at the television to abort seconds before Neil Armstrong takes his one small step for man. It's funny because they all wanted to be first on the moon, and also, in a ghoulish kind of prefiguring way, because aborting the mission is exactly what is going to happen to poor Jim.There's also an early scene between Lovell and his youngest son, when the father is asked if he knew the crew of Apollo 1, who perished in a capsule fire scene in an opening sequence. Hanks answers matter-of-factly, with a mesmerizing combination of steely control and compassion for what his child is experiencing. There's a lot going on under the surface, and while it's my favorite scene, it's easy to miss. Many good moments like that are sprinkled like stardust throughout the picture.The movie is a fine, solid piece of entertainment, a little loose with the facts but essentially true to what Apollo 13 was about, but what makes this especially recommendable is the DVD, particularly the commentary track by the real Jim and Marilyn Lovell (SPOILER ALERT: He did survive.) At one point, when the film has Hanks imagining himself landing on the moon, the real Marilyn Lovoll audibly breaks down as she describes her sadness that her husband would never have this moment in reality (though what he got instead, however harrowing, turned out to be far more memorable than merely being Moon Man #5.) Jim himself is laconic as he fills in gaps in the storyline and explains where the film took liberties, meanwhile giving us a sense of where Hanks got his character from. For that, and many other reasons, this is a prize DVD for anyone's collection.A good feeling for the period abounds. We see smoking in the control room, miniskirts, floral upholstery, and ugly shagwall sideburns. The Lovells' oldest daughter has a conniption the day of the launch because the Beatles have just broken up, one of the things the Lovells address as a liberty in their commentary (she wasn't that much of a Beatles fan) but does make sense, because April 1970 was the month Paul McCartney announced the end of the band.Director Ron Howard piles on the technical detail. He wants us to understand just how tough it was to get Apollo 13 back, on enough power to barely run a coffee machine. He doesn't shirk from showing us a control room that is stacked to the rafters with what Howard himself calls \"techno-nerds with pocket protectors\" who emerge as real heroes in one of NASA's darkest hours. You have Todd Louiso from \"High Fidelity,\" Val Kilmer's buddy from \"Real Genius\" (Gabe Jarrett), even Clint Howard, Ron's brother, perhaps filmdom's uber-nerd.Nepotism is a good thing here. Not only does Clint have a good scene explaining to flight director Ed Harris that the moonshot is kaput and they will have their hands full just bringing the crew home, but their late mother Jean Speegle Howard shines as Jim Lovell's stroke-addled matriarch, delivering two of the film's best lines.I'm not crazy about \"Apollo 13,\" but I like it a lot, and I find myself liking it more the more I watch it. Ron Howard movies tend to push for maximum uplift, and the manipulation can be annoying, but here he seems to pull back on that while focusing on the human equation at the heart of the story. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese and especially Harris and Quinlan give excellent support for one of Hanks' best star vehicles, all the more a vehicle because Hanks serves the story rather than tries to make the story serve him.Hanks was inspired enough by this experience to do a series of critically-acclaimed mini-films documenting the Apollo program. You might be inspired enough to visit your local library, or do some Googling online. It's not `Gone With The Wind,' but as a history/science lesson, `Apollo 13' is a damn fine piece of work.",

Nothing against this movie or Ron Howard, but that was a vastly superior movie to this film. Of course, I do not particularly like this one all that much either as I gave it a six, it has some good stuff in it, but it is also rather long and you feel the length of it. Not in the bathroom way of say a \"Lord of the Rings\" movie where it is just super long so you are bound to feel the urge to go, but long in the \"man it is taking forever for this film to end\". The story chronicles a true event where a space mission had problems and the astronauts had to scrape their moon landing and just figure a way to get back home and it has some interesting moments. It also has way to much Tom Hanks for my tastes. He is not the only one in space yet he is the headline name so the other two astronauts are just not the focus which kind of sucks as I love both Bacon and Paxton, two underrated actors who usually do not get the bigger movies and when they do they are regulated to backup duties. For some reason Ed Harris got an Oscar nod for this film and his performance in this one is not as good as the one he had in the Sean Connery thriller \"Just Cause\" which got him nominated for nothing. His performance here is oddly like another performance he would have three years later in \"The Truman Show\" another film he mysteriously got an Oscar nod for. There is some nice space scenes though and at times you really worry about the guys in the dire situation they are in. So it is a watchable film, there is just to many times in this one that I was more worried about when it would end.",

The film starts off with that same level of casual wontedness.Of course there's ordinary about it for Jim Lovell(Hanks),Fred Haise(Paxton) or Ken Mattingly(Sinise)-the astronauts slated for the mission. And they're more than excited by the oppurtunity. This is a dream come true for them and due to the success of Apollo 11 &12 why should this one go wrong? However, the first sign of trouble appears when Mattingly is believed to have the measles and instead of being replaced by another team Lovell fills his seat with Jack Swigert(Bacon). They blast off at the schedule date and set off on their way to the moon. But just when their getting close BOOM,something blows and sends the ship into turmoil. What happens or why doesn't really matter and Hanks quickly brings the audience up to date as he says \"We just lost the moon\". From now on it's a new mission, getting back home. The ship's crew do what they can while Mission Control with the help of the measles free Mattingly and headed by Gene Kranz(Ed Harris) works to bring the astronauts back safely. Kranz played by Harris,in possibly the performance of his career, is a man whose attitude is summed up with the line,\"Failure is not an option\".\nAs the film progresses more problems arise: power shortages,rising levels of carbon dioxide,Haise developing a fever and more. But it's really not the problems that matter, it's the solutions and process that make the film. Apollo 13 is a film about complications with deadly stakes and how two teams of men work to solve them. You don't even have to understand what's going on because Ron Howard,James Horner and the all star cast are always there to let you know when something bad(or good) has happened. The picture knows this and doesn't bother getting into the minute details to explain everything. There's a lot to tell the audience in this film but it never overloads you with exposition. Instead it keeps you informed through sharp exchanges and many memorable quotes.The film is an inspiring tale of great minds being faced with great challenges and how they go about solving them.

I vaguely remember watching this film as a kid, only being able to recollect small details. Now, I've revisited this film and realized how much better it is from an older and more knowledgeable perspective. I no longer have desires to be an astronaut, but Apollo 13 is still a great movie. It's the true story of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert and their disastrous Apollo 13 mission where everything went wrong, yet through courage and determination the men made it back to Earth safely. It's emotional, it's daunting, and it's powerful. Apollo 13 is a truly thrilling film from start to finish as we watch the wonders as well as the risks of outer space come alive.Apollo 13 is a prime example of the Hollywood machine at work, but this time it produces fantastic results. Ron Howard directs this picture with the utmost care, as well as an obvious passion for the subject matter. Sure the events are probably glorified, but that's what this kind of melodramatic big budget Hollywood production is all about. Meanwhile, the film rounds up an all star cast with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinse, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, and many more. This fine collection of actors come together in such a brilliant way as they all pull off fantastic performances that make Apollo 13 a melodramatic, yet still believable film. Then you throw in an almighty score from James Horner and you've got yourself a surefire win. Everyone involved with this film deserves credit because it really and truly comes together to be a wildly engaging film.You don't even have to necessarily have an interest in space or astronautics to enjoy this film. You can enjoy it as an engaging dramatic piece full of tension, suspense, and emotion. However, if you come into this film not caring at all about space you will likely leave with some sort of newfound interest in the wonders it beholds. There's something incredibly fun and fascinating about the way these characters speak. Their space jargon rolls off the tongue and allows the dialogue to flow so graciously and poignantly as mission control quickly streamlines commands to the men in the ship. The whole film has a great flow that keeps you engaged and thrilled, never losing focus on the film, always wanting to know what will happen next.It's actually incredibly ironic that a film like this can keep you so hooked and so boiled with emotion and suspense because we already know what happens. We know the story behind Apollo 13 and it's general knowledge that it was a disastrous mission to the moon yet the crew made it back safe and sound. Yet, amazingly enough, the suspense is so vigorous and the tension that builds is so captivating it's as if you had no idea what would happen. It takes true skill in acting and directing to pull this off, and it's the major challenge to overcome when making a film out of true events. But this is the task that Apollo 13 overcomes, and it helps it to become a really great film.",

            "content": "My Take: Desite a few sizable flaws, APOLLO 13 is a great romp. Ron Howard's riveting and dramatic APOLLO 13, a terrific recreation of the famous events NASA near-failure, should be the answer to all those questions thrown in by those too young or too old to remember that fateful day when NASA's \"routine\" flight to the moon turns into the most memorably tragic one in their careers. Adapting from the novel \"Lost Moon\" by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, screenwriter William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert has written a riveting and gripping screenplay toying with the techno-jargon and human drama of the fateful days of the monumental disaster, while Howard stuck to the facts. From using the real newsreel footage covering the entire event to realistic images of space, Howard has created a perfect realization that captures the tension and especially the drama.As for the casting, nothing could be more flawless with the casting of Tom Hanks as astronaut Jim Lovell (by the way, the real Jim Lovell actually makes a cameo somewhere in the film) who dreams of the stars and sees the chance to reach it when he is tasked to be one of the astronauts manning the Apollo 13 mission. Bill Paxton plays Fred Haise while Kevin Bacon plays Jack Swigert, the last minute replacement of Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), believed to have drug complications. Kathleen Quinlan, however, provides what may be the film's more challenging performance as Lovell's wife Barbara, who experiences the dread, fear and drama back on earth as his husband and two of his companions are trapped inside the bowels of the crippled ship Odyssey, slowly running out of fuel and oxygen, aiding the help of Mission Control, led by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), back at NASA.The pacing is a little slow during the first hour, but everything picks up real quickly as Howard jump-starts the tragic events. While we are already familiar about the splashdown ending, Howard and screenplay keeps audiences' palms sweaty with suspense and tension. This is because the characters are so involving, we let ourselves carried away by them, and what happens to them. From the endless commotion going on inside The Odyssey to the drama back on earth with Lovell's wife and family, APOLLO 13 keeps us right up there with them, from lift-off to splashdown.Excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey and an excellent score by James Horner are just among the final touches that make APOLLO 13 the best in pure \"you were there\" entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.",

            "content": "Less than a year before this film took place, we landed a man on the moon. This film tells the story about the ill-fated mission of the NASA Apollo 13 space capsule, that almost ended with disaster, when a side of the capsule is torn apart, because of an electrical glitch, that causes the capsule to vent some of its oxygen. The explosion also causes the ship to lose some of its equilibrium and it begins to float off course at certain times. It's a nightmare that is happening, which mimics the nightmares that Jim Lovell's wife had leading up to blast-off. It is an underlying tone that director, Ron Howard hammers at the audience. It is a reminder of the dangers of the unknown.The astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), have to fight the ship to keep it from going off course. They have to deal with the darkness of space and the urge to keep from freezing. They also have to shut all the electronics off, until they find their way home and set-up for reentry. The cold void of space is highlighted by the interesting special effect choices used in the film. The mission control supervisor, Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) does all he can to guide the men back home, as does Lovell's wife (Kathleen Quinlan), who prays for his safety.The film starts out a little slow, but that actually helps the impact of the final hour and a half of the film. In the seventies the space program was an after-thought in the public eye, which is chronicled in the movie and this slow build-up helps bring out the tension the astronauts eventually face. This makes the plight of the astronauts all the more real. The performances by this very good cast, help propel the story forward. Ron Howard's directing is Oscar level. The film was nominated for Best Picture that year. The special effects are perfect, and the intercutting of Walter Cronkite's old news reel footage, mixed in with the characters plight, really brings things back to Earth for the audience. It is not a perfect film, but it came close.The audience learns, that even in today's worldview of the space program, these astronauts are still true heroes and a reason to keep on tackling the mysteries of space. The astronauts enter into a danger, that no other human being could ever imagine. The film places the audience in the capsule with the astronauts. It helps the audience feel the gripping fear, that matches the fear that was felt by people all over the world on that fateful day in 1970. It also captures the triumph felt in the final outcome. This is Ron Howard at his best.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

Somehow the suspense is kept up throughout and we can feel the tenseness and the fear of those in space and on the ground.  Tom Hanks gives his usual outstanding performance and he adds to the performances of Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton.  Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated role) is the best though, his take-charge attitude and lack of control on the ground may be the most important part of making the movie work.  Kathleen Quinlan also got an Oscar nod, but her role pales to that of the men at NASA.  Ron Howard's direction is outstanding, some of the film was actually shot in zero gravity and the technical effects are terrific.  The film is slightly flawed in a few areas, but \"Apollo 13\" is still a film well worth your time.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Every other February an old debate is revived: how, people ask, can a movie POSSIBLY be nominated for Best Picture without its director being nominated for Best Director?`Apollo 13' shows how this can be so and rightly so.  It's good, to be sure, but what MAKES it good?  The story (amazingly, a true one) and the subject matter.  Neither of these were Ron Howard's doing.  He transferred the story and subject matter to the screen and created a good film which, given the potential, falls a bit flat.  Considering the grandeur of space and the unspeakable emotions of astronauts trapped in a flying sardine can, in constant contact with the human race but thousands of miles from the nearest atmosphere, it ought to have been a knockout.But the problem is that there's the usual Howard mannerisms: formula, graceless direction, no taste whatever in music, and, worst of all, an inane trust in brawn, leadership and the power of positive thinking.  This is a film in which engineers and scientists are made to look like ineffectual fools, where people can be made to do the impossible if - and only if - someone shouts at them loudly enough.  I don't want to press this point. `Apollo 13' is far from being the worst offender of its kind.  Most of the film's energy is concentrated where it should be: on the space capsule and the difficulties it faces.A more serious drawback is Tom Hanks.  Somehow it's always Tom Hanks who talks sense, Tom Hanks who settles disputes, Tom Hanks who manifests initiative, nobility, perfect health and good cheer.  The other two astronauts might as well be made of wood.  For a film about three people who share exactly the same fate and have exactly the same claim upon our sympathy, this looks suspiciously like a star vehicle.  I personally find this particularly hard to take, since the star in question gives a typically leathery performance.  More than anyone else he looks as if he never left Earth.Still, he hasn't given a better performance and Ron Howard certainly hasn't made a better film.  It COULD have been much better - but superb though the subject matter is, the film wasn't GUARANTEED to be engrossing - and yet it is.",

            "content": "One of the most successful film of the 90s was this stunning recreation of the near-tragic flight of Apollo 13 to the Moon in April 1970.Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were 200,000 miles from Earth at 9:15 PM on April 13, 1970 when an oxygen tank in their service module suffered an electrical short, ruptured, and exploded.  Two of their ship's three fuel cells were gone, their entire navigational system was thrown into a tailspin, and their life support was rapidly fading.  It was bad enough that their planned moon landing was scrubbed, but it was even worse to consider the strong possibility that they might not get home alive.  But with the help of all the brave people at Mission Control, this most perilous flight in the history of manned space travel ended happily with a successful splashdown in the South Pacific on April 17.Director Ron Howard (BACKDRAFT) recreates this true story with such technical and dramatic precision that APOLLO 13 is nothing short of a masterpiece, ranking it right up there with other such films as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE RIGHT STUFF and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  Tom Hanks (as always), Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon give great performances as Apollo 13's crew.  Gary Sinise also scores as Ken Mattingly, who was to be the ship's command module pilot before a feared measles infection (which never materialized) beached him.  Kathleen Quinlan is good as Hanks' wife, and Ed Harris gives a very steely performance as Gene Kranz, the chief of Mission Control who urges his men on to find solutions to the complex problems that eventually came to surround this mission.Featuring an excellent score by James Horner, in the Copland tradition, APOLLO 13 won justly-deserved Oscars for sound and film editing.  Not to be missed, especially for those space travel enthusiasts out there.",

But its unlikely Ron Howard's dramatic re-enactment will have the same effect on moviegoers, however well crafted and exciting it can be. The trio of marooned astronauts is shown responding to their predicament with not unexpected fortitude, but the film correctly identifies the true heroes as the aerospace engineers who improvised a series of life-saving maneuvers using slide rules, string, and sealing wax. The best moments, as a result, are those at Mission Control in Houston, and the near documentary flavor of these scenes generates surprising tension for such a familiar scenario (facts aside, the outcome is never in doubt: high caliber stars like Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon would never be allowed the indignity of a slow death in outer space). Too bad the suspense is then diluted by constant cross-cutting to flight commander Jim Lovell's anxious family: Kathleen Quinlan may in fact be the real hero of the film for enduring such a thankless token role (Mrs. Lovell's lonely vigil was certainly every bit as brave as her husband's ordeal, but it belongs in another movie altogether). The screenplay, credited to three writers (including 11th hour script doctor John Sayles) leans hard on space cowboy techno-jargon, but at least it's convincing. Someone obviously did his homework, and co-writer Al Reinert's experience making the 1990 documentary 'For All Mankind' (for which he watched five million feet of NASA Apollo footage) was obviously a boon.",

It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon , but as far as the American public was concerned , Apollo 13 was just another routine space flight mission until these words pierced the immense void of space . In the deep outer space takes place the explosion in one of two oxygen tanks helping power and leaving three astronauts tumbling throughout the beyond . With the electrical system kaput and oxygen running low , the men seek refuge in the Lunar Excursion Module . Stranded 205,000 miles from home in a crippled spacecraft , astronauts Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) , Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and led by Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), fight a desperate battle to survive . Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinese) , flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and a heroic ground crew race against time and the odds to bring them Earth .Failure is not an option. Houston, we have a problem.Overlong and big budgeted re-enactment based on the real event and known outcome, it turns to be a correct reenacment of the 1970 Apollo lunar mission that ran into a problem , as the famous : \"Houston, we have a problem\" . This is a tale of how a group of astronauts and technicians face off a risked situation and the process delivering the dramatic payload , describing faithfully the averted tragedy, bravery , heroism and showing a testament to the creativity and intelligence of the scientists who ran the early space missions . The tension comes from communication breakdown , the confrontation on the ground between the boffins and the official services and the falling-out among the crew . However, being low in dramatic scenes , makes some claustrophobic , and resulting to be a little bit boring . Interesting but heavy and dull script , in fact the suspense is missing ; being writen by uncredited and prestigious John Sayles , while Apolo 15 commander David Scott served as a consultant . There is an enjoyable reunion of notorious actors giving nice performances that subtly restating traditional notions of male heroism . It joined director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks from \u00a8Splash\u00a8 and Hanks and Gary Sinese from \u00a8Forrest Gump\u00a8 . Tom Hanks is perfect , as always , giving a highly effective acting , while Bill Paxton is acceptable and Kevin Bacon great fun . Main actors Hanks , Bill Paxton , Ed Harris , Kevin Bacon , Gary Sinese are well accompanied by a plethora of familiar secondaries , such as : Kathleen Quinlan , Miko Hughes , Xander Berkeley , Brett Cullen , Loren Dean ,David Andrews, Ray McKinnon , Clint Howard , Michele Little , Chris Ellis, Joe Spano . Great special effects from James Cameron's Digital Domain , impressive production design , adequate cinematography by Dean Cundey , rousing musical score by James Horner , and adding TV footage is to a dramatic effect.Ron Howard directed efficiently this mega-hit but with no much originality , concerning the 1970 moon-shot sticks so faithfully to the version related in Jim Lowell's book \u00a8Lost Moon\u00a8 that this can qualify as the most lavish documentary/drama ever made. The film is decent and acceptable but Ron Howard has made better films than this some tiring rendition. As Howard has a long career , both actor and director , shooting a lot of success , such as : Willow , The Missing , Cocoon , In the Heart of the Sea , A beautiful mind , Ed TV , Frost vs Nixon , Ransom , Backdraft , Code Da Vinci , Angels & Demons , Cinderella man , and several others .

            "content": "The great thing about 'Apollo 13' is that it tells a true story essentially as it happened, one that most people over a certain age are at least somewhat familiar, a story of which everyone knows the ending, and yet makes it as fresh and exciting and even tear-jerking as if the idea had just popped out of some talented screenwriter's head. It is no small achievement that the movie takes stiff real-life dialogue and even some lame 'true' jokes and by sheer screen presence and charisma of its stars again makes all of it sparkle, not to mention the traumatic scenes in space of the crippled spacecraft as it wobbles its way back to Earth. It is fair to say 'Apollo 13' makes its story much more exciting than it seemed in real life, which somehow just doesn't seem right, but which feels like an unimportant thing to worry about while you're watching it. Part of this success I think is due to the fact that most of us really DON'T (or didn't) know the whole story of what happened on this space flight. I know I was shocked to realize just how badly the spacecraft was damaged in the initial explosion; one whole side was ripped away. Given what the astronauts and NASA had to work with at the time in terms of technology, and witnessing as we have even greater tragedies since with the space shuttle, it really is nothing less than a miracle the three men made it back to Earth safely. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon are all fine as the astronauts; each gets to be heroic at various points in the film though there is subtle stereotyping: Hanks as Commander Jim Lovell is level-headed, compassionate, almost too good to be true (the film is based on Lovell's book); Paxton's Fred Haise is quite ill during much of the flight and puts up a brave front but, well, he's no Lovell; and Bacon portrays Jack Swigert, who garners nearly everyone's resentment as a hotshot young pilot, a last-minute replacement for the more respected Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). Back on the ground in Mission Control, Ed Harris is wonderful to watch as Flight Director Gene Kranz, and 'director' is a good description of his role- he orchestrates the rescue effort, cool, determined, confident. The scenes in space are quite convincing, many of them shot in weightlessness, and convey believably the crisis which faced the crew and their counterparts on Earth. I didn't realize how good a film 'Apollo 13' was until I watched it the other night for the first time in about five years. It is an uncommon example of Hollywood telling a 'true story' and getting it right.",

I ran to the nearest window in the room and looked up to see if I could see it. Because I couldn't I presumed that something had happened and prayed that they returned safely. After that I never heard of Apollo 13 until the movie was released.In the days during the Aplllo missions, it was something exciting to hear about men being put on the moon.

The appeal of Apollo 13 also comes from the benefit of actually being shot in zero-gravity conditions. No special effects here, the no gravity you see was the no gravity the actors and the crew experienced, thanks to help from the NASA airplane known as the \"Comet Vomet.\" But I believe the real lure of Apollo 13 is how Director Ron Howard made these heroes, these spacemen, real men who had to deal with a real problem. Everyone, from the men just a couple of miles above the lunar surface to the guys who put the carbon monoxide filters together, had to come together to bring home \"NASA's most successful failure.\" From the musical score to the claustrophobic feel of the space capsule suggest suspense, and will these men really make it.

A very well cast movie.Another great thing about the movie are the special effects. They are really superb and seem ahead of their time. Better then some of the effects that are used in science-fiction movies that are made these days.I also liked the at some times quite unusual cinematography from Dean Cundey and the musical score from James Horner.I don't know how much is true about the story but it seems that sometimes the movie is a bit over dramatized. But that's not such a bad thing since it only does good to the movie and the characters. The movie is not only just dramatic, it also is tense and exciting. Especially the ending is done great, even though you already know how it's going to end you're still on the edge of your seat. Well done Ron Howard! There also are more wonderful scene's such as the launch which is done truly beautiful, mainly because of the music and cinematography the scene it is one of the best moments in cinema history of the last decade.But like I said before, it could have done without the many technical elements, or there at least should had been lesser moments with it.

            "content": "If you have even the remotest knowledge of history you know how Apollo 13, based as it is on a true story, will turn out. And yet the film is filled with a tremendous sense of drama, placing you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Being able to wring that much drama out a of a film which you might expect to have a sense of inevitability about it is a tremendous achievement. Full credit to director Ron Howard and his brilliant ensemble cast of wonderfully talented performers.Apollo 13 tells the story of a 1970 American space mission gone terribly wrong. The crew of Apollo 13 was headed to the moon which sounds exciting but at the time nobody in America seemed to really care. The general public now saw space travel as routine and the sense of wonder had been lost. A successful mission would have been barely noted by the American people. It took a potential disaster to capture their interest and the story as it is told here will certainly grab hold of you as well.When their spaceship is crippled by a potentially catastrophic failure the crew of Apollo 13 is facing seemingly insurmountable odds in its quest to safely return home to Earth. This film brilliantly captures the hardships the crew had to endure and the bravery and grace under pressure they exhibited. The film also shows the heroic efforts of the men on the ground who attempted to devise a way to bring the crippled ship home. All of the key roles are performed wonderfully. As the central figure in the drama, spaceship commander Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks is reliably brilliant. Lovell had to be a real leader and it's a role which fits Hanks perfectly. Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton portray the other two astronauts aboard the ship and each has his moments of brilliance as well. Gary Sinise has a key role as Ken Mattingly, an astronaut originally scheduled to be on the fateful mission who now does all he can from his spot on the ground to help bring his comrades home. Aside from Hanks probably the best performance is by Ed Harris as the man in charge on the ground, the resolute, confident, unwavering Flight Director Gene Kranz. Harris does a great job of bringing this character to life, inspiring you to believe that the seemingly impossible is possible after all.While the film, quite literally, takes a little while to get off the ground, once the spacecraft takes off Apollo 13 is an absolutely thrilling journey. It is wonderfully acted, beautifully photographed and packed with drama. Even if you know what's coming you can't help but be swept up by an immense wave of emotion. Given the benefit of a great story to work with Ron Howard delivers a masterpiece. Brilliantly done.",

After all, success breeds success. This story perfectly illustrates why success can never be taken for granted.It illustrates the teamwork in space & on the ground that made this rescue possible. It is a story of failure of a mission that evolves into the success of a second mission- survival. That is the importance of this story.If you have not seen this, it is worth viewing.

            "content": "Sometimes I find myself getting them mixed up -- Ron Howard, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall. Even Spielberg's heartwarming kiddie movies. They're often enjoyable viewing and they're suitable for children of all ages. Early conflicts between two people of honor are resolved. There's often a patriotic theme. Very few cuss words. The musical score tells us emphatically that this is a moving experience. Maybe not the Second Coming exactly but a dangerous trip to the moon or a damned good baseball game. And don't worry. Our side wins.This one is about a failed trip to the moon. The \"failed\" part of it is gotten past pretty quickly and the emphasis shifts immediately to a different challenge -- can we get the crippled craft and its stressed-out crew back to the earth in one piece? The answer of course is yes, so it turns the movie into a story of triumph instead of tragedy.I don't mean to apply too energetic a hammer to the real events or the real characters. It's pretty spooky stuff, being up there, looking at the earth when it's no bigger than a street lamp. The rest of us who tremble when we have to climb a ladder higher than the first-floor windows can only marvel.And the story itself, no matter well or poorly told, has enough suspense and awe intrinsic to it that we can't help being drawn into it.What's bothersome is the slick commercialism that seems to provide the craft and its story with its real source of power. You know ahead of time that we'll spend time with the anguished wife at home, that we'll see one endangered astronaut sharing pictures of his lovely family with the others. The reporters will becoming a nagging, intrusive nuisance. The wife will be given a line like, \"If this moon landing wasn't good enough for the press, why has it become news now that it won't land?\" There are a multitude of technical problem that arise when the side of the craft pops and deconstructs, and they're rushed through as if the audience doesn't really care about the challenges or how they're met. Or -- maybe not that the viewers don't care. Maybe they're too dumb to understand. The technical glitches and maneuvers seem to present challenges to the film makers as well -- how quickly can we get rid of the uninteresting metallic junk and get back to the suffering of the crew, the ground support, and the families? It succeeds extremely well in doing what it intends to do, but what it intends to do makes few demands on the maturity of viewers. It's like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle and after you put it all together you have a picture of three dogs in vests playing cards.You know what could be gripping? The real story of the Challenger disaster of 1986. With an emphasis on the groupspeak of Raytheon, Mission Control, and NASA. Maybe the hero could be Richard Feynman. You should have seen him cut through the blizzard of technocrap thrown up by the engineers and bureaucrats playing CYA at the hearings. Here they are, explaining what happened by evoking \"ambient temperature values\" and \"minimalizing coefficients.\" And Feynman asks politely, \"You mean when it gets cold the rubber shrinks?\" And he demonstrates by dunking a piece of rubber in a glass of ice water. Doesn't that have more cinematic potential than this movie's Ed Harris shouting, \"Failure is not an option\"?However, the kids should enjoy this, and it's worth watching for everyone, if only because it is based on a true story. Its heartwarming qualities aside, everyone involved in an enterprise like this -- successful or not -- should be applauded. And whatever they're being paid, it's not enough.",

Nobody puts images on film that tell a story dramatically and well better than Ron Howard.  In this connection, the reason that the sequences showing the astronauts floating were so effective is that the actors really were weightless.  Howard arranged to have airlines fly parabolar orbits so that a little more than twenty seconds of weightlessness could be achieved, during which time he filmed the weightlessness sequences.  10 out of 10.

It also did not fail in the sense that it did capture an audience and bring about the timeless quotation: \"Houston, we have a problem.\" Yes, they *did* have a problem, and I am speaking about the film here and not the mission.The problem with Apollo 13 is the slow pace of the film and the length of it. Yes, it is based on a true story, but that does not mean that it has to be so boring a dry. (A lot of the technical speak went over my head as a 16-year-old.) In terms of overall art direction or cinematography, the film was average. In short, it was just a very dry film and a long film to sit through. (The fact that it was rated highly and that the ending is well-known also probably did not help matters.)

Then there was Waterworld and Judge Dredd, two sci-fi adventures which cost about the same as the Third World debt and yet delivered so little.They were all modest successes plagued by mishaps - the whole floating set of Waterworld sunk - but there was a definite sense of Hollywood losing its way without the likes of James Cameron, Steven Spielberg or George Lucas to show them the way. Luckily for Apollo 13, Ron Howard - a Lucas protege - decided to stick to a more realistic subject matter than those caped crusaders or moist Mad Maxes.With the help of Cameron's effects company Digital Domain and the Midas touch of Tom Hanks (as Jim Lovell), Howard brought to the big screen a gripping tale of three astronauts trying to get back to earth when all hell breaks loose on their eponymous spacecraft.On a critical level, Apollo 13 succeeded where so many other movies failed by spending a little more time on the characters than on the derivative eye candy. It also tapped into the nostalgic hopes and fears of so many people growing up watching those fuzzy black and white news reports in the late Sixties and early Seventies.The Apollo moonshots were ripe for Hollywood exploitation so it seems strange that no-one had attempted the programme's ill-fated adventure earlier. If landing on the moon was part of the American dream, then this was, without doubt, the American nightmare. Watching how the crew at NASA - led by the excellent Ed Harris - solve the problem of getting the desperate astronauts back home with next to no fuel and far from compliant equipment will leave your heart in your mouth.Although the third act was written in reality 30 years ago, Howard has you gripped throughout, partly because he went to extraordinary lengths to achieve a degree of realism for the movie. While effects could successfully remove any wires holding up actors these days, many of the zero gravity effects were achieved by taking cast and crew up in a special aircraft and then filming certain scenes while the plane went into a zero G nose-dive.If you're a gadgets whiz, then chances are you'll already be watching in ear shattering stereo but if not then it might be time to invest in the relevant equipment - if only for that launch scene.As Apollo 13's engines fire and ice breaks away from the body of the craft, you'll be slack of jaw as the sound crew give you the sort of experience only usually possible by strapping your head to the space shuttle.For that alone, it's an unmissable experience.

Unfortunately, this effort to synthesize and simplify has made the plot unrealistic, predictable and forced, especially if we take into account the jokes around number 13 and other minor situations like that. The plot gives great attention to how the astronauts was prepared and chosen, as well as how NASA sweated to bring them back. In this field, the film is engaging and leaves the audience stuck to the screen. Another issue that it tackles, in obvious criticism, is the initial lack of interest from the media in that mission, but this is ancillary. The film has some special effects but they're not attractive or stunning except for scenes in zero gravity. Personally, I didn't have any problem with that, I think it leaves more room for drama.As for actors we need to consider the following: the cast is full of stars (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris...) but the film definitely doesn't know what to do with them. Hanks is the protagonist but is misused and spends more than half the film's length wishing for the Moon and trying to control his flight colleagues. Ed Harris, in a supporting character, shines almost as much as him and holds the final half of the movie in an excellent performance, but within the standards the actor has accustomed us to. The rest of the cast does not shine and there are several supporting actors who end up being demoted to extras with lines.In conclusion: it's a satisfactory movie but its far from being really good.

The world was transfixed at the time wondering how and if these brave astronauts would ever make it back to Earth. What one never thinks about are all the behind the scenes decisions that go with selecting who goes on a particular mission, how their families feel about it, and how important it is to the men themselves to be a part of history. The other element that amazes is how many integrated parts come together to enable such a space mission. One sees the booster rockets fall away shortly after launch and figure that's it, the men are on their way to the moon. But then they have to dock with the lunar module and carry it along for the voyage. When the astronauts suffered their cascading set of problems, the ingenuity required by both the men on the ground and the pilots in the space craft demonstrated just how much teamwork was necessary to bring them back home safely.What's baffling to me is how Ron Howard was overlooked for a best Director nod for this picture. Though the film itself got an Oscar nomination, Howard was eked out by the guy who directed \"Babe\"??? That's just a travesty, even if one doesn't care much for Howard as an actor or director.

            "content": "\"Apollo 13\" is a great movie...there is no denying that. It is a great example of how a real-life story can be translated into a great big-screen adaptation and be done right (I'm looking at you, \"Unbroken\"). Unfortunately, I think that \"Apollo 13\" has gotten a bit of the short shrift over time due to the fact that it was made right on the cusp (1995) of what I consider to be the \"new Hollywood\" look.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of the Apollo 13 NASA mission to the Moon. Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) are the astronauts on the mission, with buddy Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) grounded due to a potential case of the measles. Before the mission shifts into its moon exploration phase, however, an on- board malfunction cripples much of their technology and makes even getting back to Earth a dicey proposition. This is where the on-ground flight coordinator Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and his crew must work their magic in order to bring the three men home and in one piece.Viewing \"Apollo 13\" just in terms of story, it is a classic film. There is enough drama in the real- life story to not have to \"mess around\" with too many things, and director Ron Howard is easily apt enough to know how to bounce back and forth between action and emotion. This is truly a textbook example of how to adapt real events to the big screen...one of the best I've ever seen in that area. Simply put, this film captures the gravitas of the event, what it did to the men involved in the mission and their families, and grounds the events firmly in 1960s culture in both look and feel.It only helps to have such great acting. Hanks is his usually brilliant self, while Sinise, Bacon, and Paxton are all great auxiliary players. At times, Harris even steals the show as he essentially is forced to do the impossible to bring the men home. Kathleen Quinlan also adds some emotional depth with her turn as Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn.Sadly, despite this being such an exercise in film-making, I think that the timing of the film makes it a bit hard to quantify. Had it been made a couple of years earlier, it would be considered a \"classic\" much like Hanks' Forrest Gump (1994). Had it been made a few years later, it would probably get more air time than it does. As it was, however, \"Apollo 13\" walks perfectly down that center line between feeling \"old\" vs. feeling \"new\". Now don't get me wrong...I'm not saying there is anything wrong with older movies. But this movie just has a strange feel to it because even thought it deals with space and technology, it has that look of being filmed on older film or something like that. I'm sure someone more immersed in film technology could tell me the exact reason why I feel this way.Overall, though, \"Apollo 13\" is a great movie that was a joy to watch again having not seen it for a number of years. It is emotional, inspiring, and exciting all at the same time. For an interesting tie-in to the current film culture, I highly recommend it for anyone who really enjoyed 2014's \"Interstellar\". Both films share very similar themes despite being very different in actual content.",

            "content": "This movie in 50 years will be viewed as a semi documentary of the Apollo 13 mission. Pity, because as a piece that claims to be accurate from a historic point of view it misses the mark by a wide margin. My main problem with the film is how the story and characters were changed for dramatic effect. The best example of this is Jack Swigert. In the film he was shown as an inexperienced rookie who had to constantly prove his worth. Meanwhile Ken Mattingly is shown to be the great hero and the only one who knows the command module well enough to save it. The truth is Jack Swigert wrote the emergency procedures for the command module, the very ones the crew used when the emergency happened. It was said they were lucky Swagert was on the flight as he was one of the best to handle the situation. Mattingly meanwhile was also a rookie astronaut and it was in fact Gene Cernan and other veteran astronauts who worked out the problems in the simulators. A good film that tries to be very accurate in the look and feel but fails to be accurate in it's script as it goes for old Hollywood dramatics instead.",

            "content": "Y'know, it never ceases to amaze me how well films age. Whether it's a flashy blockbuster or a low budget drama, ageing is a curse that thousands of films succumb to. Apollo 13 though, still feels fresh when watching it today. Not because it's the depiction of a true event or the talented cast on screen (but that does help!), it's the direction. This was made to showcase the technical prowess and finesse that Ron Howard has in making, what I call, a Hollywood movie. James Horner for musical score, Tom Hanks as lead actor...it has all the ingredients for a 90's classic that Hollywood love to serve up. It works, so no complaints here. Let's talk about Ron Howard, he was superb directing this. His style, ever so consistent, yet always changing. Still shots, tracking shots, POV shots...you name it, he's probably included it. Tom Hanks was charming as always, Kevin Bacon's smile just steals every scene and Bill Paxton's nervous outbursts were relatable. Bringing in Ed Harris as the flight director was a smart move, he oozes confidence and brings in the acting experience to keep us hooked. It's a bittersweet true story, our astronauts venture towards the moon where an unforeseen event occurs that prevents them from landing on the surface. A landmark event, and yet they couldn't achieve it. I honestly had sympathy for our characters, seeing their dreams being crushed within hours. I also appreciated the friction between Jack and the crew, being a newcomer is always difficult and I thought that was presented well. The effects for the most part hold up decently, the rocket launch though...not so well. The background looked like Google Earth or Flight Simulator, could've been handled better even in 1995. It is a safe and familiar structure with not many thrills in store, a disadvantage for any well documented true event with a happy ending. In saying that, I was captivated and enthralled by the science and entranced by the performances. Ron Howard did a damn good job who deserves more recognition.",

At the end of 4 minute 30 second wait, when odyssey responds, the significance of the \"moment\" is summed up by the expression in Ed Harris eyes. MAN SECCEEDED IN FAILURE.

            "content": "Most people will recognise this based film because of its iconic catchphrase, and to be honest, that is all I could remember from it, so I'm glad I got to watch it again to get a proper perspective, directed by Golden Globe nominated Ron Howard (Splash, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code, Rush). Based on the true story, in July 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) hosts a house party, where the guests watch the first successful landing on the Moon, where Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface. Lovell, who previously orbited the Moon on Apollo 8 in December 1968, tells his wife Marilyn (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Quinlan) that he intends to return to the Moon to walk on its surface. Three months later, his boss, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton (Chris Ellis), informs him that due to problems with Alan Shepard's crew, his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) train for their new mission. However, days before the launch, Mattingly is exposed to German Measles, and he is replaced by backup pilot Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Lovell is not happy with this mission, but Slayton threatens to bump crew to a later mission if they do not go ahead. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband getting killed in space but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Flight Director Gene Kranz (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ed Harris) gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for the Apollo 13 launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, one of the engines cuts out prematurely, but the craft reaches orbit and continues towards the Moon. Now in space, Swigert performs the manoeuvre to connect the command module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull it away from the spent rocket. Three days into the mission, the crew makes a television transmission, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert turns on the liquid oxygen tank stirring fans as requested by Mission Control, one of the tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space, and the other tank is soon found to be leaking. They attempt to stop the leak by shutting off two fuel cells, but this fails. With the fuel cells closed, the Moon landing must be aborted, and Lovell and Haise must hurry to power up the Aquarius to use as a \"lifeboat\" to return home, and Swigert shuts down Odyssey before its battery power runs out. In Houston, Kranz rallies his team to come up with a plan to bring the astronauts home safely, declaring \"failure is not an option\". Controller John Aaron (Loren Dean) recruits Mattingly to help him with the rescue mission, to find a solution to the problem. Swigert and Haise watch the Moon pass beneath them, as they are using the lunar gravity to slingshot them around it, Lovell laments his lost opportunity to walk on the lunar surface. With Aquarius running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffer through freezing conditions, and Haise becomes ill and moderately feverish. As Swigert suspects Mission Control of withholding information from them; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly calms the argument. When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way for the astronauts to have enough breathable air to make it home. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine. Mattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to turn on the command module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from Aquarius. When the crew jettisons the service module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. Aquarius is released and they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, but no one is sure if the Odyssey's heat shield is intact and will hold. The tense period of radio silence due to a blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts eventually communicate and splash down in the Pacific Ocean. Helicopters bring the three men aboard the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima, where they are greeted with a hero's welcome. Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon. Also starring Mary Kate Schellhardt as Barbara Lovell, Emily Ann Lloyd as Susan Lovell, Miko Hughes as Jeffrey Lovell, Max Elliott Slade as Jay Lovell, Jean Speegle Howard (Ron's mother) as Blanch Lovell, Xander Berkeley as Henry Hurt, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Sy Liebergot - EECOM White, Ray McKinnon as Jerry Bostick - FIDO White, and Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Reverend. Hanks does well as the ordinary astronaut trying himself and his crew calm through the dangerous situation, Paxton and Bacon are equally good as his co-pilots, Quinlan is memorable as the worried wife, Harris is likeable as the chain-smoking mission controller, and Sinise is fine. You can tell Howard was going for a completely factual account of the events of Apollo 13, from the actors being in weightlessness to all facts and figures behind the mission, it does get your attention at the crucial moments, a well-made and interesting drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Music for James Horner, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Effects, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (\"Houston, we have a problem.\"), and it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",

This puts them in jeopardy of dying deep in space. They communicate with Houston in hopes of guidance home. Their loved ones watch with uncertain hope as the media broadcasts their progress. Emotional film experience by director Ron Howard who previously made such insightful films as Parenthood and The Paper. Tom Hanks leads the mission and imagines himself stepping onto the moon. Kathleen Quinlan plays his wife who awaits news. After that her role is pretty much limited to waiting and hoping. Ed Harris is commanding as the mission control communicator whose role is straight forward but quite insightful. Gary Sinise was originally assigned to the flight but rejected due to an illness. Next to Hanks he is the second most interesting performance in the film as he is now positioned to lend an important hand in bringing the crew home.

We have endless scenes of people looking worried about something, but I had no clue what was going on. And I didn't care, because I never liked the characters. And here is the final problem: we know they made it safely back, so there is no suspense. The only way they could have made it work was to make us really like the characters.

Ronnie helms with a purpose, never allowing any sidelines or subplots to undermine the story which he skilfully builds to not one, but several nail biting climaxes. Many of us know the story, yet writers John Sayles, William Broyles Jnr. and Al Reinart still manage to entertain us with an involving screenplay which recreates the excitement of the time.All the technical teams have masterfully brought to life the NASA Space Centre at Cape Kennedy, along with the amazing hardware that goes with it. The take-off sequence is especially well produced thanks to some stunning special effects and clever cinematography (Dean Cundey - who wields with effect throughout the pic).Tom Hanks convincingly personifies the ambitious dreamer Jim Lovell, sharing with us his trials and his triumphs. In support of him is Bill Paxton (in perhaps his biggest role to date), finally playing a character who is not paranoid, and doing so very well. Kevin Bacon also joins the crew, playing a late replacement for the devastated Gary Sinise, who is ousted due to concerns he may contract the measles. Back at Cape Kennedy, an impressive Ed Harris calls the shots in an Academy nominated role, keeping his feet firmly on the ground, unlike his turn in \"The Right Stuff\".James Horner provides a familiar sounding theme.Friday, October 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",

            "content": "Starring a superb cast including Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris, Apollo 13 is a dramatic account of the 1970 NASA space mission to the Moon that met with a critical problem midflight, putting the lives of the astronauts in very grave danger. But they managed to return back to Earth out of sheer determination, bravery, and luck, with coordinated help from a much focused ground team. Capturing the attention of the world at that time, the survival of these astronauts was one of the great moments of the 20th century.This is unmistakably a film about the triumph of the human spirit, of Man's innate determination to survive no matter how bleak the circumstances are. Directed by Ron Howard, Apollo 13 stands tall among other exemplary examples of inspirational cinema, and despite many of the sequences being rendered with CG visual effects, it remains to be an affecting human story of substantial worth. Deservedly nominated for nine Oscars including Best Picture, Apollo 13 also features a splendid score by James Horner, who also scored for Braveheart (1995) in the same year.Ron Howard is a fine director, albeit without a unique style to call his own. Although he is quite inconsistent with his output, Apollo 13 ranks as one of his top films alongside considerable efforts such as A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Frost/Nixon (2008). His lucid switching among sequences in space with Jim Lovell (Hanks) and his men, sequences in the chaotic ground control station with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), and sequences shot from the perspective of the astronauts' worried loved ones gives the film a kind of understated wave of human drama that rises and falls complementarily.The most exhilarating sequence from Apollo 13 is without doubt the launch of the rocket. The visual effects are respectable for a mid- nineties film though it seems more dated with each viewing. It is the sound mixing, however, that truly transforms the film into an extraordinary experience, as if the viewer is brought to the site of the launch. Despite viewers knowing how the story ends, Howard manages to create one of the most nail-biting climaxes in American nineties cinema \u2013 the anticipation of the astronauts' pod emerging in the sky after more than three minutes of transmission silence as it cuts and burns through the Earth's atmosphere.The joy and sheer relief of everyone matched by the soaring main theme of Horner's score after the emergence of the pod will make even the most emotionally-hardened viewer pump his or her fist into the air. Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb. Watch it for that experience.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

            "content": "We all know that the news seems to attract attention when bad news comes into effect. From the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, to the Gulf War in 1990, 9/11 among many others, these stories generate events we can look back upon and get a better understanding of how these events started and to inspire dig deeper for more clues that have been left out when it all began. Space has had its share of triumph like the moon landing by Apollo 11 back on July 22, 1969 and tragedy like the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger that took the lives of 7 astronauts when it exploded. Over the years space travel has become a routine initiative by NASA in finding new and exciting discoveries that our universe provides for us. But every once in a while, something does not always run smoothly and in the battle of survival and safety, these events will make headlines on the news, newspapers, radio and other media related formats. In April of 1970, the Apollo 13 space program were off on one of their routines hoping things would run copeseticly. However, that wasn't the case as a malfuntion in the system went haywire, therefore mission control and all the dedicated employees made it their mission to call off the program and get the astronauts back home to safety. Fortunately, they all survived which makes this event both a triumph and a failure at the same time. Meaning though the program was a failure, but more importantly, the astronauts survived the whole ordeal and in the end, that's whst mattered most.The Apollo Program came into frution in 1961 with the purpose of what is out there beyond our planet and what we could find. The turning point in their mission was when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped off the Apollo 11 and put their foot on the moon. Shortly after this event occurred, the Apollo 13 mission occurred. Led by astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) along with Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), the trifecta went aboard the Apollo 13 assuming that this will be a routine space flight and that their mission will not be a news headliner. But then when news out of NASA came along that an explosion in the system occurred, leaving the three men stranded fearing that they're going to die, due to the lack of oxygen power, the news was right on this story, and so was the world. Nearly two and a half decades later, the events of Apollo 13 were recreated under the direction of Ron Howard, as we get in an in depth view of an event that could've ended tragically, but through patience, knowledge and care for one another, everything worked out okay in the end. To me this is easily one of Ron Howard's best directed film in his career.Even though those who were alive or who have read about it knows what happened and what transpired. However in spite of the all familiar outcome, Howard succeeds in keeping the tension flowing and never once does he let it meander. Through it all, those who may not have been alive when this event took place, it's a treat go into further depth to what did transpire and how they managed to bring these people back safe and sound. Though it might not be 100% accurate (it's a movie, not a documentary), the performers, the script and the director make us believe that the events that transpired really happened.In it's nearly two and a half hour duration, \"Apollo 13\", the story depends on three subplots that coincide with the narrative. The main one as the astronauts do everything possible to stay alive, the people at NASA working endlessly on new tactics and methods to bring them back alive, and finally the fear and anxiety that the families of these astronauts are going through as they can only hope and pray for a safe return to Earth.Though it may at times feel like you're watching a science-fiction movie, but in reality, the scientific aspects of \"Apollo 13\" are pretty accurate in detail. We can take that into account because this movie was adapted from Jim Lovell's novel \"First Moon\". Sure the effects featured are fascinating, but it's customized to tell the story and not take over it.In terms of performances, Hanks, Paxton and Bacon are truly amazing at bringing these characters to life and act in the way you would have expected them knowing the situation they were facing. Ed Harris exudes a great level of coolness as the Mission Control panelist Gene Kranz as they face their toughest challange they ever encountered in a very strong and effective supporting role. Gary Sinise is back with Tom Hanks again following \"Forrest Gump\" as astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was denied flying due to medical differences, but plays an effective role in this rescue mission.Howard also succeeds in recreating the smaller, less important deatils this movie has to offer. From a pop culture reference to The Beatles break-up to the clothes and style and household appliances and gadgets that were used at the time, Hoawrd succeeds in keeping everything authentic. We also not only focus on the space issues here, but we also get the honur of exploring their personal lives as well. Like everyone else they have lives outside their work and families to raise and mortgages to pay and whatnot. And even though this movie has a happy ending from a survival standpoint, it's still not entirely happy. Lovell had big ambitions of going to the moon was crushed and thosed dreams he had are gone forever. In the end we all feel his loss.It's good that there was no character we can really pass off as a villain, though may be in a metaphoric standpoint, the cloest would be the unpredictability of space travel. For a movie to remain in its verismilitude, the stress and intensity that follows, we don't need to finger point any one to take the blame. It was no one's fault this happened, malfunctions happen all the time, though it was relief everyone came back in one piece. Those old enough to remember this event will be pleased to look back at this moment, those who weren't born at the time can be educated not just about space but about life growing up during time time when the Summer of Love was coming to a close and a new era has begun.",

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, I've been viewing a bunch of lunar and space-related pictures lately, and it's become quite apparent that making the most awe-inspiring and challenging feats people have ever accomplished into sustained movie thrills is not an easy task for many filmmakers. \"Marooned\" (1969) is an obvious precedent in this case. In fact, there's a nightmare scene here that is said to be based on Marilyn Lovell's real nightmare after having seen \"Marooned.\" While the real disaster is that film itself, it's understandable that the disturbance of it would linger for an astronaut's wife. \"Marooned\" is a thoroughly inhumane and mechanical exercise where a NASA chief played by an unsympathetic Gregory Peck hardly cares for the lives of helpless astronauts stranded in space. To him and the picture in general, those men floating in a tin can are nothing more than a math problem that he's forced to try to solve because the President of the United States ordered him to; otherwise, his first instinct is that it's not worth it and to give up.\"Apollo 13\" is still a series of mathematical and mechanical problems to be solved, but the astronauts are active participants in it, and most of the people at NASA actually care about getting them home. More than the famous line, \"Houston, we have a problem,\" much of the runtime involves continual communication and teamwork between the men in the sky and those on the ground. Whereas \"Marooned\" divorced the spectator from caring about the astronauts, either, by spending the first part of the film treating them as test subjects for seemingly how nuts they could make them with a long stay in space; \"Apollo 13\" invests in making their pilots likable. Part of this is just casting proven, well-liked stars: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise. At Mission Control, they put in charge Ed Harris, the guy who played John Glenn in the most-respected prior NASA-related film to that date, \"The Right Stuff\" (1983). So good so far, but Howard also spends the early part developing the domestic relationships of the Lovell family, which pays off when the film repeatedly returns to the family at home watching the drama in space unfold on TV. Compare that to the lack of dramatic connection of the conversations between the astronauts and their wives in \"Marooned.\" The audience hadn't invested in those relationships or characters, so they didn't care. Here, anyone who knows a bit about recent history knows exactly how the story ends, but it matters because those characters and relationships have been built in the film.It also helps that the visual effects here hold up well nearly 25 years later, while the blatant matte work of \"Marooned\" only compound its problems of a picture divorced from its characters. Many shots in \"Apollo 13\" were even shot in actual zero gravity. Thus, it's simultaneously a more dramatic and more realistic film. Unfortunately, when Howard was entirely untethered from the real world and offered a space picture based on a mythical cosmos with \"Star Wars,\" it bombed. \"Marooned,\" \"Solo\" (2018) and a host of other movies: those are disasters. \"Apollo 13\" is a triumph.",

Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, \"Mommy, you're squishing me\", and mission control cheering like football fans. We see Hank's disappointment about not making a touchdown, as well as an argument between astronauts that never happened in real life.The clich\u00e9s of \"Houston, we have a problem\" and \"failure is not an option\" ring empty. To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience. I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war. Instead of this film I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, \"Moonwalk One\". It's shown often on NASA TV.

What an achievement to bring back these astronauts alive. I remember the real event. I was age 9.One of my favorite scenes is when the team of astronauts walk their lonely way into the spacecraft and we see it from a distance. Then we hear a solo trumpet within the wonderful musical score accompanying these men and we are aware of the incredible scope and importance of this mission - and of the incredible courage of a few men.It is very hard for me to really judge this movie since I always look through the actors and see the real men and the real story behind them.The special effects are O.K. but we can see clearly that CGI still has a long way to go until it will be able to produce 100% convincing images. Nevertheless the launch sequence is great as we see it from a camera angle that is freely flying through the dramatic event. Hopefully they will replace it in, say, another 10 years - as George Lucas did with the Star Wars trilogy - with better technology when it can be done 100% convincingly.\nKevin Bacon, Bill Paxton and Gary Sinise are enjoyable but try a a bit too hard for my taste.

            "content": "This movie is similar to Deep Impact. It packs a lot of emotion into an okay film. The film is a little long and a little boring. There is little in the way of character development and the action is at a minimum. In essence, Apollo 13 is a disaster movie and these types of movies generally don't come out as much. Apollo 13 is based on a true story where a luna expedition experienced an explosion in space and had to be brought manually back to Earth. It is about the fear and the hope and the obstacles that are overcome to bring the astronauts back. Apollo 13 is a movie about hope. It tells us that no matter what the obstacles are we can over come it. No matter what the problem is, there is always a way out, all we have to do is trust ourselves. That is all well and good except that God is left out of the picture. Basically we believe that we are so great that we don't need God. There is a scene in the movie where everybody is praying, and a priest is present in the house, but they are only for comfort. When the astronauts are saved they forget God and praise themselves. This move reveals our instinctive superstitious nature. 13 is the unlucky number and thus when this spaceship breaks down we see it is because of the number and nothing else. When everybody prays, it is not because they want a relationship with God but because they are superstitious and believe that by doing so will help the astronauts. People don't understand prayer because it is not an answer to problems but rather it is talking with God. Yes we do ask God for help but that is because we know that he wants to help us. Prayer is more like talking to God and God is always wanting to hear from us. But prayer without belief is nothing more than superstition. Apollo 13 I found okay. It is not a movie that I would raise to the heights of brilliance, nor is it one that I will attack. I probably won't want it again because it was dull.",

Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Kathleen Quinlan, Ed Harris, and Gary Sinise all do very well with their roles.Looking back on the history of space exploration, one notices that every mission since Apollo 11 seems to have gone wrong. Apollo 13 had its snafu, the Challenger exploded, the mission in 2003 exploded, and a mission last year had a screw-up. Maybe \"I Dream of Jeannie\" convinced the astronauts that they would get to have hot genies, and they could only think about that and not concentrate on their missions (no offense to \"IDOJ\"; I love that show).

That mission is to be flown by Apollo 8 veteran Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise, who were originally due to fly the Apollo 14 mission. They train for the flight then, a matter of days before the launch, Mattingly is grounded because he may have the measles. He is replaced by standby astronaut Jack Swigert. This isn't the last of their problems by a long way. There is a problem with a rocket shortly after launch but that doesn't threaten the mission. Three days later when all appears to be going well Mission Control orders Swigert to stir the oxygen tanks; something goes wrong and there is an explosion. It soon becomes clear that they will not be landing on the moon; success will just be getting back to Earth. Everything from now on is far from routine as the crew, and those on the ground must solve problems that had never been envisaged.Given that this film is based on real events and I knew how it ultimately ended it is surprisingly gripping. The depiction of the events in space are particularly good; we get a real feel of what the crew are going through as conditions in their cramped living quarters deteriorates. Even those who know how the story ends are likely to learn new details such as the way everybody on the ground worked to find solutions to the various unforeseen problems and Mattingly tries out various ideas on a simulator. The biggest revelation for me was the fact that until things went wrong the American public seemed so indifferent to the mission so much so that the crew's broadcast from space wasn't aired by the TV networks. The cast does a fine job; Tom Hanks is great as Lovell and is ably supported by Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as crewmates Haise and Swigert. Those 'on the ground' impress to; most notably Ed Harris as mission controller Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as Mattingly. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody interested in the Apollo 13 story or gripping tales of men struggling to overcome adversity in general.",

I set to watch \"Apollo 13\" with only a memory that that was a good movie. Now after all this years, I must say that I'm little disappointed. Looking at the whole picture, this is solid movie, with very good cast and some interesting moments. But nothing more. What bothered me the most is the length of this movie. It just goes on and on (it's because the movie goes on very slow). And another thing; Ron Howard's presentation of how America is great and special country. Back then people weren't send to space primarily to explore; it was a race between America and Russia. So after America's success, other mission were send in space, like Apollo 13 (to explore;in this case Moon). Apollo 13 crew will be remembered as the lucky ones. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert (he replaced Ken Mattingly) were on board and they managed to stay alive because of great help they had back on Earth. From constellation of great actors in this movie (Hanks, Bacon, Sinise,...), my vote goes to Ed Harris. He's great as Gene Kranz, chief of the operation. This is definitely not Howard's best movie or a movie that should be watched by all means, but if you love any of these actors and you can separate 140 minutes of your life; go ahead and watch it.

            "content": "The American space program really was something to be proud of. Men putting their lives on the line just for a chance to get out into space, and reach for the stars. It's so unfortunate that nowadays we have far greater resources and sophisticated computers at our disposal, but the idea of space exploration has waned and petered out.Of course, back in the 60s and 70s nobody could forget the days of the space race. The days when America was in fierce competition with the Russians to put a man on the Moon. And did it in 1969 when Neil Armstrong took those first steps. In the opening scenes of Apollo 13, we get to see that happen, and the reactions of the astronauts on Earth is priceless. Their amazement and envy is clear.After the success of the Apollo 11 mission, NASA continued to send men to the Moon, but by the time the mission for Apollo 13 dawned, the public's enthusiasm for the space program was all but gone.That all changed when one of the oxygen tanks aboard the command module exploded, putting our three astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) in mortal danger. Then the public took a very real interest. People can be so hypocritical can't they?! Anyway, with a Moon landing now completely out of the question, our heroes had to put every resource they had into finding different ways to get home safely.Ron Howard doesn't always succeed with his more serious motion pictures. Sometimes they're downright dull and plodding, but he gets Apollo 13 very right. You can tell he's put a lot of work and effort into trying to recreate the mission right down to the finest detail. In fact, if you watch the 1989 documentary \"For All Mankind\" which is an account of this mission, there are almost uncanny similarities between the two. It's as if Ron Howard was present during those events, and captured the whole thing on camera.In fact, Ron Howard's film almost has the look of a documentary. What with the tight camera angles to heighten the sense of claustrophobia and tension, as well as panning around quickly to capture the different conversations at Mission Control. I always notice minute details every time I watch Apollo 13.The film can never quite shake the \"all-American\" feel to it's characters and events. In fact, if it weren't based on a true story, it might seem so ridiculous it could be attributed to American propaganda. But what really holds the film together is the film's solid storytelling, and some fine performances from the cast.Tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell. The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining. His best scene is when they are going past the Moon, and can't land on it. Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination. His sadness is profound and moving.Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon also put in some stellar support, especially the scene where they start arguing with each other about whose fault it is why the oxygen tank exploded. You could sometimes cut the tension of those scenes with a knife.Back on Earth, we have Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. Of course he does in the end, but it's still gratifying to see him put it together.Ed Harris is almost pitch perfect as Gene Kranz. He is like him in so many ways. They even look similar. Although some of his lines of dialogue are very \"all American\", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control.Kathleen Quinlan is a talented actress to be sure, but she doesn't get a great deal to do in this film. All she can do is watch and wait for her husband's shuttle to return home. She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.Some of the methods the astronauts improvise to get home are truly remarkable at times. Putting together a new filter is very nerve-wracking, making course corrections, restoring systems are all edgily worked into the narrative, and with the tight camera angles we really feel like we're right in the thick of it with them.Although we can't inevitably escape the fact that we already know the outcome, it is still a very rousing experience. When I saw the capsule parachute to safety in the cinemas, I almost cheered along with the people in the film.Definitely my favourite film from Ron Howard, and Tom Hank's epilogue really helps put things into perspective. Although people have been to the Moon and back, that doesn't mean we should interpret that as \"been there, done that.\"",

I am amazed at the few who have written of the dull direction of the dialogue, or the so-called cheesy effects.\"Apollo 13\" effectively retells the true story of a near-disaster in space. I think that people today have been spoiled by the canned summer 'blockbuster'.  They're told when to jump, laugh, or cry.  When I hear comparisons to \"Armageddon\", I laugh.  That was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The actors did an amazing job. Tom Hanks brings his full talent to this role.  Unassuming, subdued at times, he brings gravity to the storyline. Astronauts are in reality scientists, engineers, and skilled pilots, so there's going to be jargon.  Well used in this film, I think.  We've become accustomed to the sci-fi myth that flying in space is as easy as jumping on the expressway.  It's not.The camera work in \"Apollo 13\" was what made this movie.  One truly grasped the claustrophobic feeling of the command/lunar module.  The extreme close ups that Ron Howard uses, in conjunction with the real weightless effects, kept me at the edge of my seat.  All this, even though I knew how everything would turn out.I do find this to be a patriotic piece, as has been pointed out by the mostly foreign input here.  They forget that this was a true story.  In 1970 we were deep in the Cold War.  The lines were pretty clear then.  You were with us, or you were against us.  A little flag waving is appropriate here.\"Apollo 13\" ranks as one of the finest docudramas ever made.

The three astronauts and Mission Control must now focus on merely surviving and getting back alive, if possible.Directed by Ron Howard, \"Apollo 13\" (1995) is a solid account of the real-life events and obviously influenced \"The Martian\" twenty years later, which is even better, albeit not based on historical events.I suppose this zeroes-in on the weakness of this movie: If you're familiar with the account you know how the story ends, which diminishes suspense. Nevertheless, I found it interesting to observe the living conditions and challenges of real-life astronauts, as well as the resolve and ingenuity of the people at Mission Control to work with what's available and to figure out how to get the astronauts home.The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes. CAST: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan.GRADE: B/B-",

Tom Hanks stars as astronaut Jim Lovell who is about to go into space with his crew (Bill Paxton & Kevin Bacon). When They Get near the moon their oxygen and ship stop working and are in danger of death. This movie teaches us the hazards of going into space and how to trust your fellow man. Based on actual events of the shutdown of the Apollo 13 vessel.My advice is to go and see this film for it is extraordinary film which has won 2 Oscars they really deserved (Tom Hanks should have won his nomination but oh well.

            "content": "Apollo 13 follows the ill-fated mission back in 1970 of three astronauts attempting to land on the moon. When an explosion on the space shuttle forces the astronauts to abort their mission (which initially causes disappointment, but ultimately sets off a chain reaction of problems for the astronauts) flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and his team of NASA boffins must try to navigate the pilots back to Earth using several risky and untried methods....My summary above does give a basic foundation for this film, but unfortunately a lot of what I describe above occurs in the second half of the film (which I'm prepared to admit was pretty engrossing). It's a shame really that the first half of the film isn't anywhere near as strong as the second half as it could have been a truly great film rather than being merely a good film. The build-up to the space mission was dull and padded; Howard feels the need to show some syrupy family dynamics and topical references such as Lovell's daughters being upset about the Beatles breaking up (which seemed to have just been thrown in there to remind folks that it was set in 1970 and to give the film some soapy slush). The training aspect before the space mission was dull and I've got to be honest that I did find the film a bit tough going in the first hour.... but then....Howard must have had a big kick up the backside because the second half of the film was great. It has drama, tension and I really liked the way that everyone all chipped in together to try and get 3 of their best astronauts safely back to Earth. There is so much intricate planning in the second half that it becomes hard to keep up (and all of the geeky space talk will go over most people's heads), but the second half does contain everything that makes a good action/drama film and therefore for this portion of the film it gets two thumbs up. However....This is a narrative problem so I'm unsure who to blame here, but throughout the space mission we're led to believe that Swigert is the one who is responsible for the explosion on the shuttle and he is generally deemed as the 'bad guy' - also due to the fact that he took Mattingley's place on the shuttle. Swigert is never really painted in a positive light and I was fully ready to hate him at the end, but then I found that the rug was pulled from under me when I learned that the explosion was caused due to a defect with the shuttle rather than being caused by human error. Huh?? So Swigert did nothing wrong?? Then why make him out to be the villain all along? I've not read Lovell's book so maybe this is explained there - was there beef between Lovell and Swigert or was this Ron Howard putting in a curveball twist? Either way it didn't sit well with me and I would have preferred to have been behind all 3 of the astronauts rather than 2 of them. The energy that the film offers in the second half and the impressive cast and photography make this worth a look, but in my book this is far from being a perfect film.",

            "content": "\"Houston, we have a problem\".This simple and yet ominous announcement, ranking fiftieth in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie Quotes, became a staple of pop-culture, referencing to any acquaintance with an inconvenience... of as yet undetermined seriousness. Well, problem is the word to underline.They say in journalism jargon that a train arriving on time is no news but it becomes news when it doesn't. There's a moment in \"Apollo 13\" where the three men en route to the moon: Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) are clowning around in front of the camera, ignoring that they're not even aired on TV. When Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) asks why, the answer says it all: the audience finds moon missions as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh. But the fact is that Apollo 13 never made it to \"Pittsburgh\". And that was news, at least, news enough so Ron Howard would make a film of it, a film with actors and screenplay, but with the realism and the accuracy of a docudrama, and quite a good one.There's some talk now about a Neil Armstrong biopic to be directed by Damien Chazelle but so far, it says a lot that Apollo 11, the one with the small step and giant leap, one of the greatest adventures men ever embarked in (also the most hazardous, according to JFK) never made into a film, not even \"The Right Stuff\" which ended with Gordo Cooper's flight and mentioned the deaths of astronauts Grissom, Chaffee and White in the infamous 1967 Apollo 1 fire. \"Apollo 13\" actually starts with that tragic incident as it established its kinship with the other all American space-themed classic. Indeed, \"Apollo 13\" can be seen as a continuation of \"The Right Stuff\" with Ed Harris as a common link, Harris playing the Oscar-nominated part of Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz. And what an irony that it's Apollo 13, the third mission to the moon that made Kranz famous, not the first.And apart from Armstrong, Aldrin (and to some degree, Collins), I don't think anyone remembers the name of the other astronauts that went to the moon, but I'm sure everyone remembers the story of Apollo 13 and the name of Jim Lovell. Not that posterity matters, but it says something about memory's selectivity: as much as we need heroes to admire, we need danger to emphasize their heroism. I trust Chazelle to inject a sense of danger in the epic odyssey, but will it be as intense and palpable as when the lives of Apollo 13 men were at serious stakes when an explosion deprived the spacecraft from oxygen supply and fuel? One can say the film will have the merit to show the magnificent outcome of human intelligence and a rigorous combination of skills and talents, but isn't it through the miraculous way the NASA crew got their men back home that we could appreciate them the most?Indeed, we never realize how difficult it is to make these flights possible, especially in a time where IBM computers were the sizes of pool tables, where men could control a spacecraft hundreds of thousands miles away but when remote controls didn't exist. This is how craft and rudimentary the material was and this unique capability of mankind to improvise, to be resourceful, is illustrated to the fullest in the extraordinary adventure of Apollo 13, highlighting each step that made the miracle possible. And there is an extreme attention to procedures: how to stop the oxygen leaking, how to keep enough power to maneuver the spacecraft and make the transmissions possible, even to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles with a bunch of space bags and duct tapes the NASA crew worked on it. It's not just about intelligence, but practicality and sheer astuteness.And there's always the human factor, Lovell recalls a botched mission's that wouldn't have succeeded if his cockpit lights hadn't shorted out. Similarly, when Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is replaced at the last minute, that makes him available and a much valuable asset during the crisis as he's assigned to find a way to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, by using the simulator, no one knows the spacecraft better than him. In the 1989 documentary \"For All Mind\", Mattingly says he doesn't know what the others do, but he knows his part perfectly and it won't crash because of him. With that mindset, it's obvious that \"failure isn't an option\". They still called the mission a successful failure, but I wouldn't count it as a failure as it succeeded to say more about courage and resourcefulness than any other mission.And it's a credit to Ron Howard's precision and talent to have recreated everything for his film, not one single footage shot, from the equipment to the weightlessness, this is a remarkable achievement that even didn't get him an Oscar nod, while the fact that he made such a film without CGI is as remarkable as sending men to moon with an equipment that would belong to a museum today. It is also remarkable that Howard didn't inject any artificial subplot but stuck to the core of the story, only allowing to show the \"problem\" from the emotional perspective of Oscar-nominated Kathleen Quinlan, as the wife who accepts her man's job but would rather see him on the safer side, another element that is handled in the film's bigger brother \"The Right Stuff\".Driven by an intelligent and to-the-point screenplay, \"Apollo 13\" is one of these movies that can be screened in professional environments to show the merits of team work, processes and intelligence for crisis resolutions. And it much deserves its twelfth spot in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Inspiring Movies.",

            "content": "Having said that, the bizarre series of events associated with Apollo 13's ill-fated attempt to reach the moon might be enough to cause anyone to become superstitious. The flight was Apollo 13; it took off on April 11, 1970 (4/11/70 - the individual numbers add up to 13) at 13:13 hours; the explosion that crippled the ship occurred on April 13 at 19:13 hours CST. It goes on and on. But it's just a number! For about a 5 year period, Tom Hanks put out a series of absolute blockbuster movies (headlined, of course, by his Oscar-winning performances in \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Philadelphia.\") \"Apollo 13\" has to be included in that list of great movies, although I don't think it quite reaches the height of those two. Hanks is not quite as central to this movie as he was to those Oscar-winners, although he certainly plays the lead as astronaut Jim Lovell, Commander of the mission. This really is an ensemble cast, though, featuring good performances all around, especially from Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as Lovell's crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert respectively, and from Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was originally scheduled to be Apollo 13's pilot, but was replaced by Swigert due to a health concern.The performances have to carry the movie, because this is such a well-known event that there's not all that much suspense involved, and the performances are all very good. The chain of bizarre events afflicting Apollo 13 seems to have been pretty faithfully recreated (right down to a typhoon warning for the splash-down area), and even given the fact that I know, obviously, how this turns out, the end is still emotional. This is a good movie - not Hanks' best, but definitely one of his really good ones from that 5 year period of real super-stardom, when no one else in Hollywood could hold a candle to him. 7/10",

            "content": "Apollo 13**** (out of 4)136 mins / PGCast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe SpanoDirector: Ron HowardPlot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines \"Houston, we have a problem\", Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects.Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.",

Also notable is the emphasis on getting the details right, which in turn makes the dramatic bits more convincing.The technical execution is sound throughout, and all the control room & spaceflight manoeuvres are also carried out with necessary authenticity. The visual effects still hold up, and the imagery is steadily elevated by neat camerawork & score. But what grounds the narrative is the excellent work from the ensemble. Tom Hanks leads the show yet the finest contributions come from Gary Sinise & Ed Harris.Overall, Apollo 13 is a well-researched, thoroughly detailed & expertly constructed retelling of a historic & (in)famous space mission that's directed with clarity and still remains one of the best offerings of its genre. Despite no shortage of spectacle, it is the discussions in the control room that makes for the film's most interesting moments and helps keep the audience invested in the ride.

What did the inside of the lunar module or command module look like?  How big was a Saturn V rocket?  \"Apollo 13\" answers all these questions and more.Using computer graphics, the infamous \"Vomit Comet\", and realistic sets, this movie conveys what it was like aboard an Apollo spacecraft.  The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket.  Inside the spacecraft one sees the benefits (and drawbacks) of weightlessness.  There's even a simulator in which the astronauts train for maneuvers they must perform during the mission.  The movie is a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at the NASA space program in the 1960's and 1970's, giving all those not present at the time an idea of what it must have been like.The cast was worthy of such a project.  Tom Hanks is Commander Jim Lovell, an experienced space voyager who wishes to land on the moon.  Fred Haise (played by Bill Paxton) will accompany Lovell down to the surface as the lunar pilot.  Ken Mattingly (played by Gary Sinise) is slated to be the command module pilot, who will orbit the moon as Lovell and Haise land and explore the surface.  Other notable cast members are Ed Harris, who plays the military-like Gene Kranz; Kathleen Quinlan (playing Marilyn Lovell, Jim Lovell's wife); and Kevin Bacon (playing Jack Swigert), the backup command module pilot for Ken Mattingly.The movie is quick, with a lot of technical terms.  I highly recommend reading a few books about the Apollo-era beforehand, including \"Apollo 13\" (previously titled \"Lost Moon\"), on which the movie was based.  The books will give you a better appreciation of what goes on in the movie.Just a warning: you won't watch this movie unaffected.  It will make you wish you could be one of the space voyagers (despite the risks involved) or even just a spectator, watching as the mission events unfold.  You may need to see the movie more than once to get everything; for me, it's been about a dozen times and I still see something new each time I watch.So run, don't walk to your nearest video store, pick up a VHS or DVD copy of \"Apollo 13\", and watch it as soon as possible!

            "content": "Apollo 13 is a very well-executed, well-directed, and well-funded movie. It has great acting, good story, and a solid theme. However, the film is so enervated and the theme so obvious, that one would naturally wonder if it would be much better if cut shorter. Honestly speaking, I came for Tom Hanks. He is good in this movie, playing a character he is much familiar with by now. Ed Harris as Gene Kranz impressed me a lot. The other characters have all contributed convincing performances, and if rated individually, I would give the acting 8/10. The pacing of the film is horrible. The third act, or the forth act, which I cannot distinguish because the film gets messier as it comes to the end, is the most interesting and compact part in the film. The first and the second act is so overlong and dull. I just do not understand why Ken, as a character, is so important. He does not really help develop the thematic message, and this is not a documentary. If he has to be there, he should only have shown up in the first half of the film, illustrating that in front of the greater good, individuality has to be eliminated. Also in making Ken a character, the film somehow makes the medical team the villain! That is just stupid and confusing, especially when Tom Hanks takes off his medical things and the other two crew members follow. That is just so unprofessional and out-of-character. Now I understand it may have been used to say something about the comradeship, but that is just so clich\u00e9 and outdated, even to a film made in say 1950s. Oh the special effects are good. They are very realistic, matching the real ones. So in conclusion, if you are a spaceship fanboy or something like that, this is a great film for you because it is quite realistic; if you are looking for something more impactful or energetic, go to Gravity or The Martian; if you want something more abstract and has a deeper thematic message, 2001: the Space Odyssey is always there for you.",

            "content": "Apollo 13 is the type of film that inspires an almost reverential cinematic high immediately after a showing. This in itself is good. It's yet another example of the a well-made film's power. But then you sleep on it for a few nights; your blood cools; and you realize the film isn't actually perfect. Right?Apollo 13 certainly has everything going for it. The acting is first rate, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton all giving career-high performances. The script is excellent; it successfully rides the line of maximum emotion without degenerating into cliche and saccharine territory. It has excellent cinematography and visual effects. It's a superior period picture, although I'm relying on hearsay for this, since it takes place a generation before my time. Ron Howard also displays a willingness to take a few risks. The movie would have worked excellently as a straight docudrama, but he instead adds a few touches to give it some more intangible impact -- some \"evil omen\" signs that don't insult the audience's intelligence, and some dream and fantasy scenes that work excellently.One thing I noticed was that the film wears its era's politics quite unashamedly. There is precious little revisionist history here. The women are all housewives with very simple moral world-views, and the world they live in is completely white-bred. Tom Hank's Lovell reminisces about his World War II record, his son goes to military school, and the newscasts at the end are overstuffed with references to prayers for the astronauts going on all over the world. A lot of these are small details that could have been changed with no trouble, but the filmmakers retained them, and the cumulative impact is to give a very clear sense that you are living in the Nixon era.Ultimately, this may be the cause of my hesitation. This is a film that works best if you whole-heartedly immerse yourself in its emotions, rather than holding back to ponder its political bent. But even so, that climax and ending monologue will get you every time.",

            "content": "Strangely enough, this film is a real story and the story of a phenomenal US defeat in their conquest of the Moon that they turned, in the very heart of a disaster, into a victory, not as for landing on the Moon but as for bringing the three astronauts back home alive. Apart from that, there is little to say or add. The disaster came when a small industrial defect caused a catastrophe with an explosion that destroyed a great part of the oxygen reserve and impaired then the feasibility of the mission. The second lesson is that NASA was totally unprepared to such a situation and they had to improvise with the skills and knowledge they had or were able to mobilize, but especially with the resilience of the three men on board whose lives were at the extreme point of immediate danger.The film insisted on the atmosphere in the two technical teams in Houston and at Kennedy Space Center. It showed how unprepared they were and yet they managed to mobilize all their energies beyond the differences that were theirs, mostly technical differences since some engineers brought up their particular calculations on oxygen on carbon dioxide, on fuel and electricity and some of these figures were dramatic since the spacecraft could not come back home. They had to invent economies, ways to save electricity, oxygen, eliminate carbon dioxide, etc. Engineers generally can only see their own domain of competence and they only consider the proper route to make it work and succeed. So they find it very difficult to imagine defeat, failure, and how to cope with such a perspective. Strangely enough, they can only find their footing in such a situation if they are several people with different skills and if they confront their skills, compete with one another for the common goal of getting it right. The film shows that very well.The families are of course taken care of and the film does not emphasize this side of the story and avoids all the dramatic scenes there must have been and there should have been in real life. But after all, the main point of the film was not the reactions of wives, children, parents, and relatives but clearly enough the human technical exploit.It makes an easy entertainment, especially if you can feel some empathy for the three astronauts, and also for the bureaucrats of science, technology, and politics in such a situation. Nixon was nevertheless sidelined, sidetracked and simply pushed out of the way.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

All throughout this picture there are challenges that are met, while anything and everything that can go wrong, do go wrong.Apollo 13 is full of great acting and the costumes, sets, and appropriatly dated technology make this film easier to watch.  There's nothing worse than watching a period film with a late 90's Mustang in the shot. Cudos to Gary Sinise for his brilliant acting as the cool headed Gene Kranz, a late scratch from the mission due to the possibility of a measles break out.  With Apollo 13 all but counted out, Kranz heads a round-the-clock effort to bring the boys home.

            "review_title": "Two Versions of Howard's flick a bonus too good to pass up!",
            "content": "Ron Howard's \"Apollo 13\" (1995) is a compelling account of the bravery and commitment that men of character faced during the initial and dangerous days of the space race. The film stars Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell, devoted family man and adventurer who's dream of outer space turns into a nightmare when a serious malfunction jeopardizes the safety of his crew orbiting the earth. Along for the ride are Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). Grounded after a bout of measles, but ever the committed optimist, is Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) \u0096 aiding in the morale boosting efforts of NASA specialist, Gene Krantz (Ed Harris). The talented Kathleen Quinlan is wasted in the role of Jim's devoted wife, Marilyn Lovell \u0096 an insult to her formidable talents made all the more obvious when one views the new IMAX edition of \"Apollo 13\" presented on Universal's new 2-disc edition. Her performance has all but been distilled into a cameo.About the transfers: both the original 1995 2hr and 20 min. Panavision 2:40:1 aspect ratio feature and its new 1hr. 57 min. 1:85:1 IMAX aspect ratio incarnation have been digitally remastered by Universal for DVD. In both cases image quality is quite superb. Colors are bold, rich and vibrant. Whites are white. Blacks are deep, solid and rich. Contrast and shadow delineation is stunning with fine details appearing throughout both versions, even during the darkest scenes. The audio on both editions is 5.1 and will give your speakers a healthy workout, particularly during the blast off and re-entry scenes.What is particularly irksome for the film purist, is the way director Ron Howard's original pacing has been butchered on the new IMAX edition. Nearly 35 min. of footage has been excised \u0096 presumably because anything more than two hours of a really big image is just too much for audiences to endure. As a result, the IMAX edition loses some of the film's most poignant scenes to the cutting room floor. Also, the original scope and depth of the Panavision aspect ratio is compromised greatly during several space scenes. The bone of contention here is in today's ever increasing ability to make disposable art that is more user friendly to the masses. The IMAX version fills all of one's widescreen television with the film's image. The original presentation results in thin black bars filling the top and bottom of the screen. And yet, that is the way the film was originally intended to be seen, with more width and a longer running time. Purists will undoubtedly agree with this assessment. The average consumer will easily overlook the both absences.Extras include some very nicely packaged and quite comprehensive documentaries on both the real space mission and the making of the film, as well as an audio commentary and theatrical trailer. Since Universal has given us both versions to experience in pristine image quality, this edition of \"Apollo 13\" comes highly recommended.",

And this film does go a long way towards showing subsequent generations what happened aboard the Apollo 13 in 1970. But while it does chronicle the events, it fails to show the political upheaval which took NASA by storm as a result of this failed mission and instead, chooses to focus on the heart-wrenching and sometimes played-to-death angst of the NASA wives.The arguments and disagreements which occur within that capsule are documented in the book written by Jim (Hanks's character), and are downplayed something fierce in order to allow Ron Howard his warm and fuzzy feeling; something he seems to need. While I haven't a problem with Ron's warm fuzzies, I do if they interfere with the story, and this time (Sorry Ron), they do.Other than these oversights (intentional or not), the film adequately depicts the actual events of the Apollo 13 mission. I know, because I was one of the millions who was alive, and remembers it. In spite of ignoring the (understandable and excused) virtual battle our three astronauts waged against one another in space, NASA fallout omissions, and errant warm fuzzies, I still enjoy this film.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",

This film is a celebration of a different era, and the remarkable individuals that made it happen. Watching the problems the crew are faced with, and the solutions they come up with (with a little help from their friends at Houston) makes me proud to be a human being - that's the effect this film has on me.Then I think of the layers of bureaucracy and mismanagement that have since come to represent NASA, and I wonder if a similar crew would survive if they faced the same problems today.The story itself is standard fare - a group of people must overcome technical obstacles and personal differences in order to survive in the face of unlikely odds - but you're never allowed to forget that it all happened for real. The fact that we already know the outcome doesn't reduce the tension - quite the opposite in fact.

This movie is more of an experience than a narrative, as most of us are quite familiar with the events surrounding the doomed Apollo 13 mission to the moon.I was simply impressed with the utter and stark realism of the film, and the fact that the near tragedy did not manage to sour the audience on space exploration.  The men on the Apollo missions were heroes, and the men on this 13th mission were no less heroes than those who actually made it to the moon.  I can't imagine the feelings that these three men must have experienced being trapped in space, so very far from home, but this film really manages to capture the essence of the trip.Howard made an excellent decision when he chose to simply re-tell the story rather than adding lots of peripheral dramatic storylines (as a lesser director surely would have), he allows the story to speak for itself.  The acting is so understated and controlled that it is often hard to notice that we are dealing with actors and not the actual event itself. \nThe special effects are also unnoticeable, which means great.  There was never a moment in the film when I felt as though I was watching a movie, but instead I always felt like I was experiencing something. \nApollo 13 is truly a film that any lover of the medium must see, any future director must watch and anyone who dreams of space travel and exploration will truly enjoy.

The film really brings back the drama and excitement, of this historical time in NASA's history. Nominated for 9 and won 2 Academy Awards. I'm surprised by the omission of a particular award nomination. Director Ron Howard deserved an Academy Award nomination for his directing. Clearly, this is a director's film. The inspiration shows. Ron Howard did receive a Director's Guild of America Award for Best Director.To me, \"Apollo 13\" is just about a perfectly made film. The sense of time and emotion is very true to life. The story is told between three perspectives: the crew of Apollo 13, their families and the mission control center in Houston. Everything from direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, film editing, visual effects and sound, all come together remarkably well in this exceptional film. The film manages to be educational, inspiring and entertaining. That's a rare and special achievement.I was 7 when the mission of Apollo 13 occurred. The look and feel of the film is very accurate. I felt very much like I was back in 1970 again. The attention to technical, personal and environmental details, is what makes this film outstanding. I'm a science/technical minded person. I noticed most of the technical details are accurate, and what was lost in the historical archives (personal and technical), is recreated intelligently and dramatically.The makers of the film definitely did their homework and put some admirable passion, creativity and inspiration into the film, and it shows very much.",

Kurson was able to interview a lot of the astronauts and NASA personnel and it was clear that NASA assembled some of the greatest engineers and Air Force and Navy pilots for the space program. The kahonas the astronauts had at that time to not only go into space but to actually circle the moon, and then land on the moon in such a short time period, it was incredible!!!!And after reading Kurson's novel, it's very hard for me to imagine what they were able to accomplish with such archaic technology.If you have an interest in the space program, Apollo 13 is a great film,",

Of course for those of us who are old to remember the moon missions we already know the ending. However, Ron Howard does an excellent of making this \"remake\" even more breathtaking & astounding than the real event!There was always the risk of Hollywood taking \"dramatic\" liberties with this movie, but fortunately they resisted temptation for major chances and kept faith with the whole traumatic tale.Never being a keen fan of Tom Hanks (Jim Lovell) I was really surprised & delighted with his performance here. In real life Hanks had taken a close interest with the Apollo story and so in the movie he really plays his character with great enthusiasm & intelligence.He is also ably supported by one of Kevin Bacon's best performances and particularly from Bill Paxton.The only troublesome acting came from Kathleen Quinlann, playing Lovell's wife. She isn't given much to do throughout the film other than to cry a bit and offer moral support to her family and friends. Quinlann is a very capable actress but I felt she wasn't given enough to do here other than play the helpless-woman role, which is a great pity.However, top honours has to go to Ed Harris as the MC chief. I've always like under-rated Harris, especially in the earlier GlennGarry Glenn Ross movie. In both films he seems to excel as the man struggling to stay in control and walk the fine line. Although in this movie he goes that little bit further with an added intensity that gives a lot more human impact to the movie than perhaps Hanks offered, who's dialogue at times seemed to drone on in a robotic-like monotone.Top marks to the special effects too, which unlike getting in the way of a good story, simply adds to the real-life drama.Possibly Howard's best movie to date and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to check on their space history.****/*****",

            "content": "I had difficulties liking \"Apollo 13\" because in my opinion there are no characters. Indeed all of them have not an internal struggle, nor a characterization that is something more the mono dimensional they have. They have not a inner struggle, something to overcame emotionally and in same cases they feel like some lines of dialogues played by an actor and it's not good because the viewer is brought out of the atmosphere. Sincerely I would've preferred a documentary given how the movie is. This is because when you want to tell a story like this one, a true story, you have two ways: the documentary (with an high historical fidelity) or the movie (where you have to alter a bit reality in order to make the story more cinematic). In \"Apollo 13\" I saw the intention to make both at the same time and it felt flat for me. As an example I saw a lot of documentaries about the Apollo 11 and I saw \"First Man\" by Chazelle. This is a perfect example of what I said because in the documentaries I've learned the real story, in the movie instead I was captured by the story of a man that has an enormous pain inside and that sees the Moon as a goal but also as something that can help him overcome the pain. It's not super historical accurate but I don't care because the character feels real and the viewer can empathize with him. In \"Apollo 13\" instead they are flat, starting with the main protagonist who wants to go to the Moon, he fails and that's ok. And if this is the characterization of the protagonist, good luck for the others.\nBut in the end \"Apollo 13\" is worth watching because it has a very very strong technical department and though the characters are not explored as much the story works. In addition I know that other people didn't have my problem so take a watch and find out by yourself if you like it!",

He IS a fine actor, and \"Apollo 13\" IS a great film, but does anyone else get the urge to see Tom Hanks playing a real scumbag for once?  His characters always seem so WORTHY, making them a cert for Academy nomination at least.  Sometimes I wish he'd be a little more brave in his career choices.  Academy recognition aint the be all and end all.  There are plenty of fine actors never to be recognised in such a way. I think I'm right in suggesting Johnny Depp? Still, onto the film.   Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from.  Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension.  No-one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for A13 because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals IN FRONT of the camera rather than the guy behind it (take note Scorsese.)  The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end.  The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.  The crew on the ground, led by Ed Harris, are almost as impressive as those in space, if not more so.  The whole production has obviously been polished until it gleamed...   Definitely Ron Howard's best film, and one of the best pictures of '95. As I mentioned before, I just wish the Academy weren't so obvious in their Oscar choices...

Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest. And when the resolution comes it will command your emotions.Part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood. Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.Ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship. In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances. A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look. After all, they were engaged in the success or failure of the mission in the most immediate sense.I also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner. When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that. The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself. It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.Although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Perhaps the movie was considered too much of a purely commercial venture at the time (and because of the budget it was largely that of course), and perhaps Howard's direction and intention seemed very much by the book. However I think the final result turned out to be more than some thought when it was released in 1995. It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done. Everybody worked hard for veracity and they certainly convinced me. Nonetheless there is perhaps something missing here. Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.See this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.",

En route to the moon on a 'routine' mission the vessel is practically crippled by a mechanical malfunction. In short order the objective changes from landing on the moon to simply making it home safely.Based on astronaut Jim Lovell's book \"Lost Moon\", the screenplay sticks pretty close to the facts. Certain tweaks were made for dramatic effect, of course, but the filmmakers strove for authenticity. I, for one, was surprised at how successfully the film built tension considering the fact that the outcome is known to any who are already familiar with the incident.As for the cast, it's a good one. The lead, Tom Hanks, was fresh off of back-to-back Oscar-winning performances in \"Philadelphia\" & \"Forrest Gump\". Joining him as fellow astronauts were Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon & Gary Sinise. Quite an enviable line-up, in my estimation. While none of these individuals garnered Oscar nominations, Ed Harris & Kathleen Quinlan both received nominations in supporting roles. Overall, the cast was well-picked and without any weak links.Ron Howard's underrated direction keeps the action flowing despite being anchored to only a few sets for the vast majority of the picture. Meanwhile, the Oscar-winning editing seamlessly integrates footage shot in simulated zero gravity with footage shot conventionally. The Oscar-nominated special effects are also both believable and attractive. Finally, James Horner's score effectively contributes to the mood of the piece.Overall, \"Apollo 13\" is a captivating period piece that is constructed with technical know-how and skillful performances.

            "content": "There is something innately fascinating about films that are based upon real historical events. To know that what we're on screen actually happened in some capacity, or at least most of it did, makes what you're seeing so much more potent than fiction. When you think about it the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission is prefect for the big screen. Three astronauts on a mission to get home against all odds with the intelligence of those back on Earth as their only hope. It almost writes itself. The story of Apollo 13 mainly succeeds as a film because it is told with a great deal of clarity and a clear understanding of its aims. From a technical viewpoint to a directing and an acting one, the film is pretty much faultless which only adds to its entertainment value. Ron Howard is frequently accused of being far too sentimental in his directing, which I do at times agree with, yet he is pretty much perfect for this film. He views this time period as one of wonder and discovery. I think that his more emotional style suits the film down to the ground. Every shot of the black of space inspires awe and every conversation between the astronauts and their families comes across as genuine. There are a number of scenes between Lovell and his wife (brilliantly acted by Hanks and Quinlan) that completely avoid falling into the schmaltzy category in part because of how real they are. I'm not sure that many other directors would have been able to get across such emotions as successfully as Howard does here. Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise and Harris are all superb actors and provide the material with extra weight. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon all fit perfectly as the astronauts given their charismatic styles. Gary Sinise is always a gripping screen presence and you really get to sense the disappointment he feels at missing out on the voyage. Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated performance) is at his most convincing as tough guys, but here he manages to balance that out with deep compassion for his men in what is a powerful performance. Quinlan (who was also Oscar-nominated) probably has the most difficult part as Lovell's wife, but she injects the role with plenty of heart and every expression is believable. The NASA control room is packed full of people, frantically working on various methods to get the astronauts home. Despite some many being involved, almost all of them are fleshed out just enough that we get an idea of their personalities. The ever increasing wave of tension that takes place each time something appears to go wrong is executed magnificently. By the time the craft is attempting re-entry you are truly exhausted, in the best way possible, by all that has taken place. It's a testament to the high quality of the directing and acting that we are so concerned for those that are a piece in something so spectacularly eventful. I like how despite the humanised approach, the film doesn't forget that there needs to be thrills for the story to really hit home and there is tension in all the right places. These instances were aided by stunning visual effects, which still convince to this day, and a beautifully stirring score from James Horner.By the time the film draws to its conclusion you are left emotionally drained. It thrills you in all the ways you'd want it to, and pulls on the heartstrings in the exact same way. For me it doesn't matter that the film can delve into the sentimental a little too often because it fits the style it is going for almost perfectly. It made me care about these individuals, even when we know so little about them. The cast is full of actors who are a joy to watch and they help bring this film to life as much as Howard's deft direction does. Even if you know the outcome of the story you still get drawn into the struggle and constantly questioning whether or not those on board will survive. That is possibly the highest praise that a film of this kind can receive.",

            "content": "In 2000, I saw no less than the first approximate hour of this 1995 Ron Howard film based on a true story, but never got to see the entire film that year. Before that, I had seen the movie mentioned in a magazine, so I was aware of its existence, but didn't know much about it. I never watched \"Apollo 13\" all the way from beginning to end until ten years and a few months later after just seeing some of it. I don't think I had much of an opinion on what I saw of the film just over a decade ago, but by the time I sat down to watch it all, I knew it had a good reputation, so I was expecting a decent film. After watching it, I don't think it's as great as many others who have seen at some point it in the past fifteen years do, but it's still a good drama.In 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell is mesmerized by Neil Armstrong becoming the first person to set foot on the surface of the moon during the successful Apollo 11 mission, and hopes to go there himself someday. It seems he will have a chance to make that dream come true, as he is expecting to take part in one of these Apollo missions, originally Apollo 14, but then he is switched to Apollo 13. He will be going into space with Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly, so the three of them begin their training for the mission. Shortly before the day of the launch, Mattingly is pulled out of the mission due to exposure to the measles, and is replaced by Jack Swigert. On April 11, 1970, the spacecraft is finally launched, and leaves Earth's atmosphere with the three astronauts inside. At first, the mission doesn't get much attention, but that completely changes when things go terribly wrong, and Lovell, Haise, and Swigert find themselves in serious danger, and there's a good chance they won't survive their journey! The beginning of this historical drama features archive footage narrated by journalist Walter Cronkite, and this is an intriguing sequence. I did not care for the flirt scene right after this, but that fortunately didn't last, and most of the film can certainly hold the viewer's attention with the events leading up to the Apollo 13 launch, as the crew trains for the mission and Jim Lovell talks to his family members about going into space. There is one awkward scene with Jim's oldest daughter freaking out over the break-up of the Beatles, but fortunately, most of the movie isn't like this at all. The launch scene is intense, with a fitting musical score to go along with it, and after this, it's hard to stop watching \"Apollo 13\", as we see the three astronauts in peril far from the earth's surface as Mission Control tries to help them, the news reports on the spaceflight, the reactions of Jim's wife and offspring, etc. This 1995 blockbuster also has great visuals, showing the space shuttle in orbit, and also well designed sets. The performances from the lead actors (Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris) are strong, while some of the supporting performances are a little weaker, but that's not the case with most of the supporting cast. The cast as a whole is very impressive.I've watched a lot of movies in the past few years, and am not sure exactly why it took me so long to get around to this one, since I had seen a lot of it years before and knew for a while that it was a popular film based on a true story. However, now that I've finally seen the whole movie, I can understand its appeal and why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, two of which it won. This 1995 blockbuster shows that an adventure movie like this doesn't necessarily need a lot of action to be exciting, since \"Apollo 13\" doesn't have a lot of that, yet still manages to be effective. At 140 minutes, it's certainly not a short movie, but despite occasional stumbles in quality, it remains intriguing for the vast majority of that time. As an historical film, there are obviously inaccuracies, but it seems many have praised it for its accuracies, unlike some movies based on true stories, and this drama can remind us of how risky space travel is!",

While I recognize the enormous achievement in even sending people to the vicinity of the moon-- much less landing on the moon and returning home several times-- I was too young to remember the feelings of awe and excitement that must have accompanied the moon landings.In a way it is sad that the one unsuccessful Apollo mission would be the one made into a hit movie-- but the movie brought out such a range of emotions (like most good movies do, in my opinion): a child's curiosity, the overwhelming excitement mixed with apprehension and fear of the adults, and the way public apathy suddenly gave way to intense interest. For those of us who were too young to remember, the movie gives a good brief introduction into the culture and politics of the day. But the thing that struck me the most was the primitive state of technology that brought men to within inches of the moon in that day: I have to say the shots of calculations being done by slide rule and pencil and paper nearly brought me to tears.10/10",

            "content": "The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.",

Due to incompetence and neglect the crew of Apollo 1 died during a routine count down. Due to the human intelligence and good fortune Jim Lovell and his crew returned safely home. The movie is excellent. There are technical flaws of course but most of them are covered by live Lovell's commentary. And the story is about how every human being, sometimes against all odds, can survive activating the human will of survival and powers of our mind. The visual effects are of minor importance here. It's the actors, their faces, tone of their voices, their moves tell us the story. They did well. After I read Lovell's 'Lost Moon' and Kranz's 'Failure is Not an Option' /which quote was spitefully used on the NYT after the tragedy of Columbia/ I liked the movie even more. Dust in the wind we are. Such achievements like the conquest of the cosmos give our lives a bit of meaning, due to possible harvesting the assets by our children. Apollo 13 is a kind of record of such heroic efforts. Worth watching and thinking about.",

If they couldn't get further unlucky they are forced to shut down power and have to go to the loo in bags.

Although the chemistry of Paxton, Hanks, and Bacon is useful, the main problem is that the viewer becomes lost within a dialogue full of space craft-NASA mumbo jumbo.

But in watching the movie, realizing that these men went to the moon using technology less sophisticated than what is in my smart phone and that there was only 1 mission where something went wrong was miraculous. Plus the bravery history shines on them as we now can compare how little we knew to the achievement, and that it was will to beat the soviets that drove the nation to willingly pay to risk these lives to make a trip to the moon that made the movie have an impact on my life as an adult. It was the drive of a nation to prove that we where technologically superior to our enemies that drove this to be such a high priority. The fact that it resulted in tremendous growth in high technology as the tax payers willingly backed this effort which drove technological innovation and breakthroughs for years as we went from WWII technology to the information age. To bad our government doesn't invest in our economy that way now instead of taxing the middle class to strip them of medical benefits to fund benefits for the poor. This movie and the comparison of where our nation was vs. is makes this an incredibly emotional movie for me. I wish those who were younger (and not foolish enough to believe these accomplishments were not real; tainting a great period of investing in our technological future) would look at it and learn from it and what this nation is capable of when its population is working and leadership strong with some true vision can accomplish.I think this was a well made movie and Ron Howard did a great job of capturing the important aspects of the events around this mission. Living through the real event and \"holding our collective breath\" for all those days until we saw the parachutes open upon re-entry (an event we watched in the gym at school) and the celebration that nobody died helped to make even more real the true level of danger those men faced and not the version communicated through the press until after it was over. Things that would be lost if you weren't alive at the time, but part of what makes for an excellent movie of an incredible event in our countries history.",

The visuals are awesome and still hold up largely well to today's standards, between great effects, detailed sets, and impressive production. Extremely real is the sound, too. This constant noise actually adds to the sense of impending doom, working nicely with the solid score that absolutely captures the building tension. What truly draws the audience in, though, is the editing that manages to wonderfully move from one set of characters to another. This is particularly evident when swapping between the crew and mission control. The way these sequences form allows the story to flow in a natural way that keeps track of time, as well. Also integral to this success is the meaningful dialogue and chemistry between characters. Every interaction feels real throughout, especially those of the astronauts. The audience can wholly buy into the countless great performances by the cast, who clearly give much to their respective roles. With such an impactful event taking place, the stakes are transparent and emotion convincingly runs high. Even more so, the characters are all likable with distinct personalities and easily become people to root for, just as the world did then. Ultimately, the story comes together to make for an impactful journey. Some of the technical dialogue may take from the entertainment factor at times, but there is not much to otherwise critique. Sparingly used comic relief even mostly works. Overall, Apollo 13 is a well made film that is worth the watch, being a phenomenal representation of history that involves intriguing characters, interesting drama, and special visuals.",

Great film making and direction by Ron Howard.  Great performances all around.   While watching this film give some thought to what was actually accomplished and also what was accomplished by the entire manned space flight program between 1961 and 1972.

With the success of this movie then Howard, Tom Hanks and Brian Grazer all were able to make the great mini series From the Earth to the Moon which showed you the beginning of NASA to the end of the Apollo series of flights.The movie lists a who's who as far as its cast goes with Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon and many, many more.",

On the other hand, Jack Swigert was a single man, and the movie made it seem as though no one was concerned about his save return. According to the movie, Jack did not have a loving parent, a close sibling, or a dear friend who cared whether he lived or died. As a single women, I find this portrayal of the life of a single, childless person unfortunate. In addition, Mr. Swigert was portrayed as a somewhat incompetent playboy, when in reality he was a well educated man with an impressive resume. The fact that Mr. Swigert is dead and can not defend himself makes the situation that much worse.",

            "content": "August 19, 2015This is one of the best films of the year. Ron Howard knows how to make a great movie, visually and creatively. Tom Hanks is a great actor and this creative team of actor/director takes me all the way back to 1984 when Howard directed Hanks in \"Splash,\" one of my favorite pictures of love, magic, and beauty. \"Apollo 13\" is a visual masterpiece that is based on the real-life ill-fated mission to the moon that happened 25 years ago.It begins on July 20, 1969, with an astronaut, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) who has orbited the moon on \"Apollo 8.\" Jim tells his wife he wants to walk on the moon's surface and he gets his chance when he is selected to take flight in \"Apollo 13,\" instead of \"Apollo 14.\" Jim, along with his flight crew, blast off into space with minor difficulties. En route to the moon, one of the crew members performs a routine housekeeping procedure that causes one of the ship's liquid oxygen tanks to spill out into space while the other explodes and sends the ship tumbling. The mission to land is canceled and the crew becomes trapped in space. With time running out, Lovell and his crew must now work together to figure out a way home before it's too late.The \"Apollo 13\" mission was launched on April 11th, 1970 from Cape Kennedy, Florida. It was the seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program. Two days later, an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the service module for which the command module depended on. The three astronauts became trapped with the loss of power, loss of cabin heat and loss of oxygen while mission control worked desperately to try and find a way to get them home safely. They faced almost impossible odds and the fact that they might just end up marooned in space, frozen to death.I can just imagine what the cast went through for this movie because their performances are stellar and you can see they were well prepared. It opens with a surprise party for Jim. We meet his wife, Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan) who is always worried about her husband going into space and not coming back. She follows him through his training and eventually she shows up to the launch party to see her husband take off into space. Kevin Bacon is fantastic as Jack Swigert who feels responsible because he, unknowingly, flipped the switch that caused the explosion and Bill Pullman is Fred Haise, the man who hangs on to every last minute he may have. Ed Harris plays Gene Kranz, the chain-smoking mastermind at Houston Mission Control who tries to figure out if the Apollo 13 crew can safely make it home. He doesn't take \"no\" for an answer and commands his team to work effortlessly to keep them from dying in space.Originally, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) was supposed to fly the \"Apollo 13\" mission but was grounded due to possibly being exposed to the measles. Early in the picture, Ken is diagnosed and we see that Gary Sinise might be limited in his screen time but he's not. He becomes some of the brains to figure how to get the ship home. He works tirelessly in a simulator to figure out a way to power the weakened batteries on the Lunar module exploration device (a lifeboat) so they can swing around the moon and flame burst the ship home.What Ron Howard manages to create is a technically accurate film with a crew that floats around \"weightless\" in the spaceship and we see some visual shots of earth from a space-eye view. He takes all the technical work and makes it shine. At one point, the crew is freezing out in space and suffering from carbon dioxide poison. Back on earth, a group of engineers is put together to creatively build something that will clean the air. The come up with a jerry rig that the crew can make materials out of on board the shuttle to give them more times. These are the intense sequences that really make you pace and wonder what will happen next and wonder if the crew will make it home alive.",

            "content": "When I first rented Apollo 13 on VHS 20 years ago I found myself to be easily distracted and my interest seemed to waver throughout the movie. I don't know why but that's just the way it happened. Fast forward to 20 years later and I made the right decision to hire out Apollo 13 on Blu-ray. Apollo 13 was a fantastic experience from start to finish and I gained a greater appreciation of the movie. Apart from the fact it was based on true events, you couldn't go wrong with a brilliant cast with the likes of Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris. On top of that, the masterful Ron Howard has added another excellent movie to his stellar career.Following the success of Apollo 11 in which in a landmark event in history Neil Armstrong became the first man in history to step foot on the moon on 20 July, 1969, the titular Apollo 13 is destined to be the third lunar landing mission on the moon. The following year astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) are picked to be the crew members of Apollo 13 for a seemingly routine mission to the moon. Things go awry when an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. Lovell's message to ground control changes everything when he announces the immortal words, \"Houston, we have a problem\". NASA's ground crew led by the no-nonsense Gene Krantz (Ed Harris) orders Apollo 13 to abort the Moon landing and along with original crew member Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) who was sidelined on medical grounds, spearheads the operation for the safe return of the three men back to Earth.Everything about Apollo 13 was excellent. Tom Hanks, riding high from the success of Forrest Gump (1994), is faultless as Jim Lovell. Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton and Ed Harris (who received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor) are also perfectly cast in their respective roles.The late James Horner's score was beautifully done throughout the movie and fit in neatly. I found myself getting goosebumps from the opening score.Ron Howard who has come a long way from his days as Ritchie Cunningham from the TV series Happy Days has carved himself a brilliant career as a director. His attention to detail throughout his movies as well as his love of depicting historical events is a perfect fit for Apollo 13 and Ron Howard has done a superb job as a director.Apollo 13 was met with widespread critical acclaim as well as becoming one of the biggest box office hits of 1995. It is still deserving of its praise and I have grown very fond of Apollo 13. With a brilliant cast led by Tom Hanks, the masterful direction of Ron Howard, and a gripping story based on true events, Apollo 13 is still an excellent movie.9/10.",

Hanks, Bacon and Paxton are superb in their roles as Astronauts doing their jobs and systematically meeting the incredible challenge that confronts them head on. Ed Harris is no less perfectly cast as the stoic but steady hand at the helm to guide the efforts to bring the ship safely to shore. Ron Howard's direction, although heavy handed at times, stays the course by intertwining and humanizing the lives of all those involved in this historic event in US space exploration.

I continue to marvel at the skill in which Ron Howard spinned the tale based on the true incident which happened in April 1970. I adore this movie, even to the point of being corny!!! Let me just say that everything, from the music to the period detail, was beautifully brought to life.  I loved all the guys in Houston with their 1970-looking hairdos, clothing and horn rimmed glasses,  I loved the big honking (now antique looking) TV in the Lovell's living room, I loved Kathleen Quinlan's retro clothing and earrings (she's such a lovely woman and actress) and I loved the acuracy of the rocket, the command module, the lunar module (that spidery looking guy) and the little pod with the parachutes. The cast was absolutely perfect. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell, the commander of the Apollo 13 mission to the moon, was brilliant, and brought all the excitement and anticipation...and then disappointment and fear, to life. Bill Paxton is always a joy to watch, portraying astronaut Fred Haise, whose wife is pregnant. Paxton displays a childlike joy in his excitement about \"flying in space\" for the very first time. Kevin Bacon was quiet and strong as Jack Swigert, a \"bachelor\" astronaut, and his feelings of guilt over what happened to the spacecraft were very tangible to me. Gary Sinise was a fabulous support as astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was supposed to be the pilot, but was held back from the mission because of exposure to measles.  Ed Harris, ahh, Ed Harris. I love this guy. He turned in a fiery, commanding, yet lovely performance as the head of the flight operations in Houston. The stress that Gene Kranz must have been under looked exhausting coming from Harris. While the crew of Apollo 13 awaits a plan for re-entering Earth's atmosphere safely, they encounter problem after problem, loss of power, loss of breathing oxygen, increase in toxic CO2 gas, freezing cold because of the lack of electicity,  a kidney infection in Haise, inappropriate weight, velocity and angle for re-entry, and if all that weren't enough, their parachutes might not open and the heat sheild might have been damaged to where the astronauts would be incinerated before they can return to earth!!! Oh yeah, and a typhoon in the south Pacific too!!! This movie is over two hours long, but it is so absorbing, so interesting, and so riveting, that not one milisecond is boring. The supporting cast also features Xander Berkely, Clint Howard, Loren Dean and many other familiar faces whose names escape me, as the hard working, wonderful staff of experts in Houston who were DETERMINED to bring the three men of Apollo 13 home alive. This movie was perfect. I can't say a bad thing about it. It deserved Film Of The Year for 1995 (I don't even remember which film got the award, so it must not have been all that memorable) and I think it is Ron Howard's finest film to date.",

Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are true survivalists of what could have been a complete disaster. They would be the infamous crew of the Apollo 13 space mission.In Ron Howard's 1995 release of Apollo 13, Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon play the crew that would be launched from Cape Canaveral and into history. The flight that went wrong and had Lovell (Hanks) utter those famous words, \"Houston, we have a problem\". When a routine task aboard their ship goes horribly wrong, these three men are thrown into a life or death situation.In the shadow of the 1969 lunar landing, the first ever, these men were nobodies to the general public, until \"it\" happened. With media flocking the Lovell's home, wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must muster up all the courage she has and make sure her family keeps it together. She and the whole world waits for the three men to return home safely.Flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) also has the difficult job of finding a way for these boys to come home. He and his team of experts work around the clock for nearly a week to ensure the safe return of the crew. Every time something seems to be going right, there is another problem. CO2 levels run high, exhaustion, power, and the troubled heat shield are all problems the crew at Houston the crew thousands of miles above Houston confront.With so much stress and a problem arising every other minute, tension grows on board with the crew. The fact that Jack (Bacon) is replacing what would have been Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) makes the other crew members a little cautious of his skills and his performance levels. They trusted Ken, but Jack is new and since he performed the task the caused the problem, they are very suspicious of him. The men must keep it together if they went to get home in one piece.This movie shows true courage in one of the worst space accidents the world has ever seen. Howard does a great job of preserving this unbelievable story of bravery and survival. So many times movies about something that actually happened get caught up in computer graphics or try to hard to appeal to everyone when this movie uses better acting, directing, and does have good computer effects as a bonus.

This entire flight was a topic I knew very little about (though I was probably a teenager at the time), so found it both an informative and gripping drama.It chronicles the ill adventures of Apollo 13, NASA's third planned lunar landing, which at the time had become routine and failed to capture the public's attention. The flight runs into potentially fatal problems when an oxygen tank explodes, precluding the planned moon landing, and the intelligent, highly stressed astronauts (as well as the Houston control team) must use all their skill, creativity, and ingenuity to avert disaster and ensure a safe return to earth.The cast does a magnificent job in recreating the three astronauts, their camaraderie and determined efforts... flight commander, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and replacement astronaut, Jack Swiger (Kevin Bacon), and also the Houston mission control director (Ed Harris). The film captures the disappointment of crew members (especially Lovell) in being denied their exciting moon landing, so long anticipated and trained for, and also portrays the effects of this potential tragedy on their families, particularly Lovell's devoted wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan).I have little knowledge of the historical accuracy or personal lives of the astronauts aboard this Apollo flight. Some have claimed that the personalities of some of the crew have been altered; if so, I would not approve. Although based on fact with a lot of attention to technical detail, it should, nevertheless, probably be regarded as a Hollywood production, and not necessarily a documentary.Even though we know in advance the outcome, it still has a riveting plot to keep viewers glued to their seats. The movie is especially a testament to the dangers inherent in space flight even to this very day, the training and courage of astronauts, and the anxiety that must be experienced by their families, especially when something goes amiss during the flight. Personally, I found The Right Stuff just a wee bit dull, but rate very highly this movie that put the phrase 'Houston, we have a problem' into our everyday vocabulary.",

There's a bit of drama added, but overall the movie does extremely well at also going deep into the technical struggle with a well executed fortitude far beyond what most Hollywood would dare (i.e. Gravity).This movie teaches, entertains, and inspires the audience toward scientific endeavor like no other. Special effects are amazing, especially for its time, but they are not the sole source of meaning (as with mofoing#! Gravity). Apollo 13 respects its audience, and though filmicly it's rather standard storytelling, it's great to see a film made that tells such a story.",

            "content": "It has been almost half a century after we have stepped on to an other celestial body apart from Earth and in Honor of this achievement I am going to review the best movie about these missions Apollo 13 ,which dispute that it is more than two decades old still pack a powerful punch of emotions, characters and a tribute to the resourcefulness, ingenuity and traveling spirit of our species as a whole.So the film follows the NASA team of the mission 13, who after a disastrous malfunction ,the crew on the spacecraft is in a dire situation and so the man on the ground and on the space-capsule must find out a way to return the crew safely back home. If you know basic space-race history then you already know that the team return alive to Earth and they even gave advice to the actors and production ,like the rest of NASA in order to help the directing team to make the film as authentic as possible and over all they did it.Now granted many of the sense are dramatized and some arguments are put it to mix to create tension in the story and show the how hazardous was the position of our team. But in reality both the crew and the NASA team on the ground were as calm as it gets, no joke I saw the original recordings and the tone of the voice was CASUAL. That is a testament to the professionalism of the NASA personnel, even in the worst case scenario they kept calm and gave the 100%. Now that doesn't diminish the quality of the film, on the contrary it strengthens it for shows how the artistic liberty should be done, with elegance and showing the humanity behind an event, which is exactly what happened with that film. Wow and the astronauts ,I am 200% sure, that posses balls of steel!Also many dialogues are a bit simple, which they would never be in that way, but let'd be honest 99 out 100 people aren't trained to be in NASA so that was also a logical move from the director and writers part.As for the acting, the visuals ex-ordinary and for the later to get the best possible sense of weightlessness of space they used an airplane known as \"the vomit-comet' to make them pitch perfect and they got it. To return to the crew Tom Hanks rocks, Kevin Bacon rocks and Ed Harris surprised me because he usually took part in action films not in serious biographies, but still he rocked as the rest of the team, a truly dream team, out of this world! ;)All in all I love that flick and makes me sad the fact that when those events happened there were so many ideas for the future and despite the fact that technologically we have made a lot of progress, the real deal, space odysseys to encounter strange new world and perhaps there wonderful inhabitants, it hasn't become a reality yet.",

But once you get desensitized to the Richie Cunningham lines, like `Let's go to the moon, gentlemen,' you'll really enjoy the ride this film takes you on.  Cast is great, Hanks flanked by 3 of the most prominent second fiddles in the business, Sinise, Bacon and Paxton. And the shots of mission control are just as I remembered them as a kid. Either the actress wasn't too swift, or the role was poorly written, or maybe its such a guy movie that she didn't stand a chance of holding her own, but...Lovell's wife is really a detractor, and kind of unlikable. I think the movie does a fantastic job of restirring those same emotions of utter awe at what we were accomplishing by walking on the moon. Something we haven't done since, oddly enough.  These early missions were carried forth, more on grit than on technology. I'm sure each of you reading this has more processing firepower in your PC than the entire space program had at the time.

Now don't get me wrong I am all for schmaltz but it just didn't work for this movie especially because we know exactly what happens. Also I was bummed they spent the whole time in the space ship having purposely avoided knowing what happened in the mission (as it was 37 years before I was born) either way it was a good watch and pretty suspenseful overall.

In fact, I think showing the way Houston was handling the problems was the most unusual and wonderful thing about the movie.\nI also compliment the studio - imagine the temptation to do it at FAR less cost by showing it all from only the astronauts' perspective - a three actor movie with only a spacecraft to pay for.

The administrators, flight directors, and mission control crew were capable of making quick decisions and therefore were able save the lives of the crew 200,000 miles from the earth.  I believe the most important moment is when Lovell wonders when we will go back to the moon. After the Apollo program NASA started to lose public interest while overlooking major design flaws in its spacecraft (which led to the Challenger disaster).  Only recently has the public started to take interest again with the Mars Pathfinder and John Glenn's return to space. Apollo 13 shows us how NASA worked then, and insight on how it can work in the future.The acting was great particularly by Hanks who in real life has a deep interest in the space program.  The character of Deke Slayton (my favorite astronaut!) was well played, except for the fact that he should have had a Wisconsin accent.  Deke is portrayed as someone who knew how to lay down the law, but at the same time he truly cared about the astronauts who worked for him.",

I searched out my copy of the DVD as it is an Emily Ann Lloyd, companion to Annie and Molly in Annie 2, which is also of 1995. She is age 10ish and playing the younger daughter. Discover it to be a well crafted story about the Apollo disaster, with lots of Apollo stuff in it, then it gained massively in potential power. The extras in the DVD gave a lot of additional stuff that still makes the package worthwhile to me. In all sorts of ways this feature is magnificent and perfection. Except the feature itself appears to crash this aspect, deliberately, by making a smattering of technical detail to be askew. The most positive part, for me, is how people in mission control are shown. The filmmaker demonstrates very real skills at portraying the feel of most of the situation, Grumman?, as if he has a real in-tune-ness with the people there. A remarkable achievement, but that became scuppered. In some ways this feature is still so nice that when I watch it I typically have to shrug off the disaster of the deliberate flaws. * I personally interpret this to be triggered by a culture clash and a personality clash. Different understandings about taboo. From that there is a demonstration of how today's dominant intolerance ethos turns things into a hatchet job. It should be easy to interpret my reaction as an over-reaction. It can be dismissed. Downer that Emily got serendipitied into this feature. I understand her as a girl with very typical growing up hurdles to have to try to face. Someone who got channelled into features that highlighted parts of that until the year 2000, age 16ish, when her last feature was released.

            "content": "Ron Howard is a solid if unspectacular director. He's capable of making enjoyable films, but they often feel trite and uninspired. However, with Apollo 13 he comes closet to making something that achieves greatness.But it must be said that it would take an unspeakably awful filmmaker to make a poor movie about the Apollo 13 story. All you have to do is stick close to the facts, film it and not get in the way. And I guess that's what Howard does, for his directing style is pretty anonymous and his viewpoint is narrow \u0096 the film doesn't really concern itself with the politics of Apollo. And while in some cases that could hurt a film, here it's the right decision, because rather than try and be a critique of the space programme it's the simple story of a bunch of guys trying to get home \u0096 too much commentary would detract from the drama.Not that there isn't the odd bit of commentary here and there. There's a good scene where the astronauts are broadcasting from their craft, not knowing that the TV networks have dumped them \u0096 already space exploration has become boring. And there's also the scene where the media try and set up shop on Marilyn Lovell's lawn \u0096 the media are only interested in the mission once the crew are in jeopardy. And on top of this you get a few digs at NASA bureaucracy. But aside from that, the film assumes you're in awe of space exploration and that you agree with the Apollo programme.And while the flag waving nature of the film with its patriotic music, long pauses and hushed voices is its weakness, it's also its strength, because as absurd and expensive as space travel is, it still touches something deep inside. There's something moving about a bunch of guys risking their lives to push the boundaries. And although Teflon is the greatest thing that space exploration has produced, there's a sense of wonder and pride in knowing that men have managed to break the shackles of the Earth and walked on the Moon (anyone who thinks the landings were hoaxed should be shot \u0096 conspiracy theorists are perhaps even more worthless than Goths).Therefore there's quite a bit of emotion when Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) realises that he wont be walking on the Moon. This is his dream and its been dashed. And there's a great scene when the craft orbits the Moon. Knowing that he won't be walking on it, he refuses to look, knowing that to gaze upon it would be torture. But despite his reluctance, his resolve eventually cracks and when he turns back round he imagines what it would have been like to walk on the surface. It's a small moment of fantasy, but it brilliantly illustrates the joy that has been denied this man.Less effective is the scene where Lovell explains the lunar landing to his son. The intention is okay \u0096 to make light of the risks for the sake of family \u0096 but the kid is a little too cutesy. And I also dislike the scenes with Lovell's mother. She's a dotty old woman and serves as the film's comic relief \u0096 she asks Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin whether they're part of the space programme. But the film should have either made her more believable or dispensed with her entirely.Much more effective are the scenes with mission control. Ed Harris is great as always and there are some moments of real tension. Plus the scenes with mission control show what a team effort it was to bring the astronauts back home. And I even forgave the film scenes of mass whooping, because although a bunch of loud-mouthed Americans whooping usually irritates the hell out of me, I was almost joining in. I felt like punching the air when the rocket took off and I felt like raising the roof when the crew landed in the Pacific \u0096 finally here's something worth whooping about.Another of the film's strengths is its attention to detail. All the technical jargon, all the confusing buttons and all the convoluted procedures have a convincing air of authenticity. And it also helps that some of the scenes were shot in zero G. It allows you to concentrate on the story (dodgy effects would have been a huge distraction). And the zero G produces a couple of wonderful moments, the first being Bill Paxton puking chunks (we've all wondered what weightless vomiting would look like) and the second occurring during the television broadcast that was ditched for baseball when Paxton throws his sunglasses at the camera \u0096 it captures the fun of space.But really the film works best as the story of a bunch of guys trying to get back home (and it's apt that one of the craft was named Odyssey, as the journey has a lot in common with Homer's epic poem). And while that means that the film doesn't have a whole lot to say on an intellectual level, it works superbly on an emotional one.",

While not diminishing Cameron's accomplishments with TITANIC (I had to be dragged into it, but found it affective), APOLLO 13 is the standard for all fact-based films in the future. Side note: Tom Hanks has worked on two continuation projects where you get the feeling he didn't want to let go of the subject matter: after APOLLO 13 (RACE TO THE MOON) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (BAND OF BROTHERS), which is some kind of testimonial to the impact he felt in being involved with these projects.

The extraordinary visual effects combined with the all-star-packed casting couldn't have been better; each performance, from Tom Hanks down through the ranks to the techs at Mission Control, and the 'spot-narration' voice over (in the form of news bulletins) by Walter Cronkite accurately captured the anxiety, character, enthusiasm and  'can-do' attitude of this 'gremlin plagued' mission.If you lived these events then see it, it's sure to recall the times and places.

So I went into this film as an 11-year-old boy not knowing the absolute drama of it all. To this date I watch it on April 13th of every year and it is still was of the greatest historical films ever made. The acting is stellar from all of the talented actors cast in the film. Ed Harris was always my favorite as Gene Kranz, the mission director tasked with getting these three astronauts home. A sense of dread and fear comes over you when Jack Swigert (played by Kevin Bacon) mixes the O2 tanks and a loud bang resonates through the module. Jim Lovell calls Houston with the famous words: \"Houston, we have a problem\" (it was actually Jack who said those famous words). From this moment until the end the three men overcame the odds by keeping a level head. Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) develops a UTI and gets sick during the last few days and you genuinely worry about him. This is Ron Howard's masterpiece. To this day both Jim and Fred speak well of this film and that is a testament to when Hollywood told a story instead of embellishing one. 10/10.",

The music, sets, hairstyles, clothing, etc. all contribute to the recreation of the early 1970's, but it never overwhelms the viewer. A less skillful director might have had a few scenes that just screamed \"YOU\"RE IN THE 70's! GET IT?\" An explosion on the Apollo 13 rocks the ship off course and causes an oxygen leak. They have to get the leak under control, turn around, and get back to Earth, in the midst of solving a seemingly endless number of problems that crop up. Apollo 13 is a drama that takes place in space, and winds up being more suspenseful than many of the science fiction/action movies today. Just the sound of the alarms and the sight of Oxygen levels dropping are enough to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. It keeps you rooting for the good guys to come home safely even though we know how the film will end. I must compliment how educational the film really is. By all accounts the film is pretty accurate, and one can learn a lot about space travel in the 70's from Apollo 13. This film proves historical films can be accurate and entertaining at the same time. The film's greatest strength however is a stellar cast. Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris are all likable and easy to relate to. We sympathize with Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, because he will never realize his dream of walking on the moon. Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) falls ill and has kids on the way. We feel sorry for Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) because we can't help but feel there is an unnecessary antagonism toward him because he was not originally assigned to the mission. Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is kicked off the mission because he is exposed to the measles. He never gets the measles, and he has a great \"I told you so\" moment. We all sympathize with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and the rest of mission control, who work day and night to get Apollo 13 home. Finally, there is Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan), who can only wait helplessly and pray her husband will come back. The scene where her wedding ring falls down the drain gives a strong sense of foreboding.Apollo 13 was a much better film than Braveheart and should have won the Oscar, if not Babe.",

Thirdly, while it doesn't sound bad, a mortal being with the limitations of a lifetime's perspective understandably is just not so moved by the idea that one day our proverbial grandchildren might be able to speed off to another planet and thus make it till the grand finale of the universe in the End, thanks to space research.So, what I found interesting about this space movie is that it shows the importance of coming back more than that of going out, and that so it puts the whole debate above into a funny perspective, rather unintentionally of course. Let's just stay here, get everyone into safety on Earth, all of humanity. What a warm and pleasing thought indeed. Otherwise, the film is rather mediocre, I thought.

            "content": "It was 1970. Apollo 13's mission was to repeat what the astronauts at Apollo 11 did---go to the moon and go back successfully.The blast-off was normal and the series of separations just before they reached space were also good. As they reached about 80,000 miles or so into space, one of the astronauts tries to stir the fuel tanks with just a press of one button. Little did they realize that this action would mean a precarious event is going to hit not only the spacecraft of Apollo 11--but also threaten the lives of the astronauts inside it.It started with a main explosion of a fuel tank, and then, subsequent shakes and booms. There are reports of fuel tanks having undervoltage, and not until about 10 minutes later, does astronaut Jim Lowell (played by Tom Hanks) visually realize that at least one oxygen tank is spewing out oxygen. He is the first to realize that there was a major leak in one of the fuel tanks of the command module.They now realize that they have to follow Mission Control commands in Houston, because Lowell is telling the two other astronauts that they have to shut down the power to the command module, or the \"Odyssey\", as they call in the movie. And Lowell is the first to tell those other Apollo 11 astronauts probably one of the most famous quotes...\"We've just lost the moon.\" Not just the other famous quote, \"Houston, we have a problem!\" Later on, Mission Control specialists tell the astronauts that they need to shut down the command module's power, which they do, and they had to move the LEM--or the lunar extraction module (or \"lunar module\" for short), which is nicknamed \"Aquarius.\" Then, now that the landing of the moon had been scraped, the astronauts had to make a controlled burn around the moon in a slingshot action almost similar to that burn-around you may have seen in the movie \"Armeggeddon.\" Yes, using lunar gravity to speed-up the trip back to Earth.The burn is successful, but they need to save much needed power, so they shut down power to the LEM, which includes shutting down heat to it, so that means they have to freeze a little bit in order to have a safe trip for a good geodesic entry towards Earth.Then more problems. Readings on the LEM indicate that the carbon dioxide levels are rising to toxic levels...meaning that the astronauts could suffocate in minutes. Mission Control finally finds a bizarre procedure to knock those high levels of C02 back to the non-danger zone. It was tense as the astronauts started to cough. But eventually, the astronauts finally fix the problem...they can breathe again.Now, the geodesic re-entry is in 2 steps--very difficult. First, they do the retro-burn about 70,000 miles towards earth and their trajectory towards earth eventually goes quite good. Now, because the command module only has the heat shield, and power to the module can only have several amps, they had to separate first the Odyssey (the LEM) and the Aquarius (the service module). After Aquarius goes away from the command module, Lowell realized the big damage in the Aquarius' fuel tank.Now, the second step for the good geodesic re-entry to earth depends on the command module's heat shield as they head towards splashdown. A failure of the heat shield would mean incinerating death for the 3 astronauts. Temperatures on re-entry outside can be as high as 2000 to 3000F. The whole world was on pins and needles as the command module heated up as the craft went through the earth's atmosphere...but then, as the craft splashed down with already-opened parachutes in the ocean and word spread that the craft survived re-entry, Lowell was the real hero.As well as the two other astronauts! And even more--Lowell's mother was overjoyed about the near-disaster now coming to an end for Apollo 11 for good!!",

After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Cpt James Lovell, John L Swigert and Fred Haise jnr to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are eerily convincing as the astronauts and excellently manage to convey the tension of being in mortal danger in a malfunctioning tin can a quarter of a million miles from home, facing not only the bitter disappointment at not completing the mission of landing on the moon but the prospect of losing their lives in such an inhospitable and lonely environment. Of course nobody except the original astronauts knows what was going through their minds but Hanks et al allow the audience to appreciate the state of disciplined tension and terror that the voyagers were subjected to.Other performances worthy of note include a determined and gritty portrayal of Charismatic and forceful Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz by Ed Harris.The film is well directed and the pace does not lack, despite the difficulty of portraying events in a tense fashion in a space not much larger than a large caravan, and the long periods of inactivity that form a large part of manned space flight.Summary : An excellent `true life' movie, successful  in portraying events both in space and the reaction of those left on the ground.Rating : 90%",

            "content": "I don't find \"Apollo 13\" a very entertaining movie, but it's still what I would call very good entertainment. Sometimes there is this kind of annoying emotionalism, which is quite clear, as it's about both technical achievement and American history. There is that one scene I dislike most: When the pope and the people at the Wailing Wall are praying for the astronauts. I have no idea whether this really happened or not - but honestly I do not believe it.But the good thing is that I don't mind this emotionalism because of some very refreshing aspects. First what we see here are altogether very nice performances. Especially Ed Harris makes the movie enjoyable with his very fine acting. Kathleen Quinlan, who was nominated for an Oscar as well, is also very good - but you don't really notice her. Gary Sinise is almost as good as Harris and Tom Hanks also tries his best to give his character a special personality and some soul - he doesn't really succeed.Also very refreshing is the small deal of irony in this. There are many little scenes before the launch which indicate in a slightly funny way that Apollo  t h i r t e e n  means disaster like Quinlan losing her wedding ring. All these aspects make a not really entertaining movie extremely worth watching. I voted 7, for good.By the way...I noticed that Emily Ann Lloyd (whom you might know from \"Home For the Holiday\") who plays little Susan Lovell, is overacting. She's got no major importance for the story, but her overacting attracts of course attention.",

Howard's casting is almost like the casting of The Aviator. Tom Hanks doesn't look like Jim Lovell. Bill Paxton doesn't look like Fred Haise. Neither Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris or Gary Siniese. But, despite the casting, the rest of the movie is pretty accurate. Is very exact to what happened in real life. The sense of disaster movie is always there, never leaves the screen during it's almost 2 and a half hours, but is basically a human drama with realistic touch. Ron Howard uses his great heart to make us tremble and sob with the agonize tragedy of this three astronauts, and when you reach to the end and see the resolution, you just have to clap! Claps for the heroes, claps for Ron Howard. My verdict: The best realistic space movie ever made. And I mean space movie, not sci-fi movie.",

When I\u00b4ve watched \"Apollo 13\" the first time, I was amazed about the weightless in the spaceship, and I asked myself \"How did they do that?!\", because it looked so real! They simulated the weightless in the NASA KC-135 jet. A big praise to all the actors for their hard work to let this film look 100 % realistic. Breathtaking in every moment, altough you know the ending. It\u00b4s an intimitate play in space, so don\u00b4t expect an action packed movie like \"Armageddon\". \"Apollo 13\" is a thousand times more thrilling than a lesson in history.(and I liked history lessons!)",

Anyone who goes to elementary school knows that all three astronauts survive, so for all the scenes in space I kept saying \"Yeah, I know! they're going to live!\" This brings the film down many levelsThe plot doesn't start until 30 minutes in, it doesn't feel long but the scenes in the first half hour feel like filler. I don't need to know that Jim's wife dropped her ring in the shower!Also, it has the same problem as Super 8, the unsubtle period detail. I didn't need to know that Jim's daughter was upset that the Beatles broke up, or that she dresses as a hippie. It rarely happens and isn't as bad as in Super 8, but why can't any one in Hollywood make subtle period detail! Then again this film does have the director of the Grinch.Many scenes are done well like the scenes of just the astronauts in the ship. The moon scene would've been very good, but they had to ruin it with Jim's fantasy of being on the moon. The scenes of they're family's got irritating after a while. It doesn't help when you keep cutting from the main story of the movie to people watching TV and listening to the radio. Also what was with the son in military camp? He has no lines of dialogue and does exactly what everyone else who isn't the main character does. He didn't need to be in this movie, or at least have something to do!The box that creates the oxygen in the ship has no explanation. It would in real life, but I would like to know how a box made of tape and plastic bags can seamlessly make air out of nothing!Then there is the end narration, which sounds like it came out of a bad teen film. I'll watch this movie again maybe in a few months but until then, I'll stick with Armageddon",

After massive damage is suffered to the spacecraft the mission is changed to safely returning the crew back to earth. Historical events are difficult to portray on the big screen, but I believe this film has truly captured the essence of what truly happened. Unfortunately, I am personally not a fan of long films that, especially without side stories that add to the overall storyline. I think this film is good, but I would have taken some of the slower, less interesting events out and possibly added more of Ken Mattingly, played by Gary Sinise, after he was denied the flight.Other than the length, this film looked and felt great. Ron Howard did an outstanding job getting the best performances out of his star-studded cast. There were not a lot of films that successfully portrayed realistic CGI in this era, especially compared to the movie magic we see today, but I think it was spot on in this film. Though I admit its length is less than desirable, the storyline is very in depth and gives a full picture of the event as it may have happened.

Apollo 13 has to be one of my favourite films of all time.It is amazing how things always seem to be much longer you are young. I first saw the movie when I was about 6 or 7 and it seemed to go on for much longer than, but I was still gripped. The acting is very good, with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon in the centre of it all, giving life to the situation that they are in. The visual effects were awesome, and even to this day they still look good, and the fact that for the zero gravity scenes, they really went up in a \"vommit comet\" (the same aircraft training scheme that the real astronauts used, and still use for the astronaut training program!) However, the film is brimming with factual errors and anachronisms, which most people find intolerable; TV programs that appear on screens throughout the movie that don't actually appear until after or before April 1970; Lunar errors (give me a viewing of E.T. any day!) and props that didn't appear until after the incident e.g. coffee mugs, beetles albums and other items. However, it is only a Ron Howard film, what can you do?However, this is made up for with the good acting, brilliant visual effects and brilliant score (composed by James Horner, who I think, next to John Williams and the late Jerry Goldsmith, is the one of the best movie composers). A brilliant \"historical\" adaptation (in terms of drama and acting). 8/10",

This movie came out when I was five years old and was my first exposure to the world of the amazing Tom Hanks. I absolutely adore this movie. I dressed up as one of the astronauts as a kid in elementary school. Ron Howard's Apollo 13, to me, is simply a masterpiece. This is truly captivating film from beginning to end that tells the real-life tale of the Apollo 13 disaster. Everything about it just feels so authentic. Not just the amazing attention to detail with the spacecraft's and mission control. But to the acting and characters. The late Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, and even Clint Howard, everyone was so perfectly cast in this movie. True, grade-A acting from the whole cast. You really feel connected to all the characters on an emotional level. Ron Howard did his best work here. Everything about this movie and the directing and editing is perfectly executed. At no time to things ever feel like they drag on. Scenes are always appropriately cut between the drama of the spacecraft and the drama of Jim Lovell's family. We get a true sense of teamwork between the astronauts and mission control as they desperately work to solve each problem the dying spacecraft is having. I also commend the unforgettable soundtrack. From the uplifting main theme song to the dramatic moments of watching the CO2 meter go down, the soundtrack just perfectly compliments this film. Not just that, but the mix, appropriately hearing the sirens and alarms going off when things go haywire on the spacecraft. I just... I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie. I've watched this movie a thousand times in the past 20~ years and every time I watch it it feels like I'm watching it for the first time. My eyes are just constantly glued to the TV when it's on. I think I can say that this is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time. I own it on blu-ray. I've never not liked it. It's stood the test of time to me. It still looks great today. It's a good run time. It's not bloated with CGI like the films of the 2000's. It's just a telling tale about this real-life scenario of three astronauts nearly losing their lives on a mission to the moon.

However, Ron Howard is one who does this again and again and again.At the end of Apollo 13, when the astronauts break through, it's so hard not to want to get up and yell, scream, cry, and cheer for those guys. I have seen this movie a hundred times and each time I tense up when the guys are missing and I always cry when they make it. It takes a damn good director to do this type of work. I give this movie a 10 and Ron Howard a 15.",

But you don't need me to tell YOU that, you already KNOW that.  Right? So...next.The special effects.  If you don't already know, many of the zero-gravity shots in this flick were accomplished by constructing a set of the space capsule inside what's known as the \"Vomit Comet\", a modified jet aircraft designed to simulate weightlessness for astronaut training.  What it does is simple: it flies up to a high altitude very fast, then gradually turns earthward at just enough speed to make whatever is inside of the jet \"float\" off the ground, thus creating a weightless effect.  Not too impressive, right?  Except the actors, directors and other crew members made between 500 and 600 individual flights on the \"Vomit Comet\" to get all the required shots.  But you already know THAT.  Don't you?The story.  It's kinda like watching \"Titanic.\"  You KNOW the boat sinks, you just wanna see how it's DONE.  Same here.  Ron Howard, director extraordinaire, tightens the story and ratchets up the tension so we are prepared to either bawl our eyes out or stand up and cheer at the end...and either way would be equally as satisfying.But you don't need ME to tell YOU this...do you?",

The film was very good from the technical standpoint, no big blunders, just some slight exaggerations, to maintain the suspense. But I was a kid when it happened and I remember those times, I think the general attitude is missing. Modern kids, who listen to Alanis Morrissette, may not understand this, but people had some strange dreams in those psychedelic years. By the early 70s everybody knew the dream had ended, we would not colonize the Moon in this century, environmental pollution was (and still is) a lethal danger, global nuclear war was imminent, you get the idea. Depending on your point of view, you were afraid that either communism or capitalism would take over the world (my uncle died with a piece of shrapnel through his heart while fighting the communists in eastern Europe, so you know what was MY fear). \"Apollo 13\", the film, was well made, both from the technical and the artistic point of view, but it missed the chance to capture the spirit of the final days of an age when drama was lived in real time.",

There's a few things about it that are a little bit inaccurate, like some of the patterns on the Saturn 5 rocket, and the course correction in space which in real life was much smoother.

The scenes filmed in the vomit comet still delight. Tension is built and diffused, then rebuilt with precision, leaning heavily on the excellent score. The astronauts' family scenes still evoke tears of shared pain or relief on repeated viewings. In short, the movie is close to perfect for me. The only slight bum note is the endless use of the journalists to provide explication. They could have cut 15-30% of these and the audience would still have got it. It's like those exposition gags in the Austin Powers movies. But in no way does it spoil the movie, you just feel a bit as though your intelligence has been insulted.",

With his collaboration with Brian Grazer, they made the impossible possible. The acting was amazing through out the film. Tom Hanks delivers his character very well. Kathleen Quinlan carries her supporting role very good. The rest of the cast fits in with roles that they were given and they were great. The premise of the movie is based off of a true story. Apollo 13 has suffered a major malfunction in space putting the lives of the three astronauts in jeopardy and NASA must find a way to back them back home. That is the premise of the movie: story.

It was smart of the director to use this line in the movie. The plot of the movie was that three guys are launched into outer space on Apollo 13 and something goes wrong when they're up in space. On earth, the people at NASA are trying to figure out how to get them back to earth ground safely with little time and oxygen left for them. Apollo 13 was the first ever rocket launch i remember hearing about in elementary school. I knew it was launched in 1970, but in the years 2007- 2009 I remember being talked to about it. I know there's been tons of other rocket launches, but for some reason, that one seemed to be the only one ever talked about in my atmosphere. I've seen other movies of this genre, and they're all really good movies, they just all have the same plot, more or less, and it makes them predictable. Ron Howard is the name of the director for apollo 13. He's also the director for countless other movies. The only other movies i've watched that've been directed by him are: Jay-Z-made in america, The Dilemma,The grinch, The heart of the sea, Inferno, and a beautiful mind. All of which are great movies. The main actors are Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise. All have been great actors in other movies they've appeared in. I personally think Tom Hanks was the best actor of all.

So really if you think about it, if you want to see a movie that's accurate and well done about the Apollo 13 mission, I suggest seeing Apollo 13. The script was very well written, the acting was incredible, by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Gary Sinice, and the woman who portrayed Jim Lovell's wife. The movie was perfectly paced. They give you time to get what they're going to do on the Apollo 13 mission. They tell you everything that was important that was prior to the launch, happy and sad events. Tom Hanks truely desereved to be the winner for 1995's best actor, though I don't know who were the other contenders.

A regular stirring of the oxygen tanks on board the spacecraft resulted in an explosion, effectively crippling Apollo 13 and putting its three astronauts-Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert-in grave jeopardy of not returning to Earth.Although there are a few too many cuts back to the Lovell household, where his wife, kids, and friends sit praying in front of the television, the overly sentimental director Howard comes through, managing to keep the domestic drama largely in check while never losing sight of the compelling story playing out in space.",

From start to finish the viewer is taken on an ill-fated trip that conveys 'contingency' at its utmost. Survival is the name of the game and the film portrays the resilience of the entire space program to bring three astronauts' home. Howard sets the dramatic tone early with a front-loaded revisit to the tragic deaths of the Apollo 1 crew. It is a reminder and signifies the fragility of life as an astronaut.Howard effortlessly incorporates family and the behind the scenes skepticism of very engaged spouse played perfectly by Kathleen Quinlan. Her onscreen chemistry with Tom Hanks, though limited, is infectious. Along with Hanks, Howard has an excellent ensemble of characters all of who offer insight into the multifaceted background of a space mission. Ed Harris delivers a gem of a performance and absolutely takes command of the film, as he steers the audience through the launch, the casualty and motivates the ground team to get the men home.Overall, my liking this movie centers on the vicarious nature and the \"what would I do\" feel of the story. Howard's film keeps you firmly in space and presents the environmental conditions aptly, so the viewer indeed understands the harsh reality the Apollo 13 crew endures. In contrast, he reveals the circumstances with the families, where the stress, strain, and feelings of helplessness are poignantly unveiled.Alas, it is that emotional aspect that I also feel is lacking at the film's end. We see that the crew returns safely, we see the families react from afar, but after being subjected throughout the film to the intimate emotional swings of the families, one would love to have seen the inevitable and conceivably incredible reunions with loved ones. It is my impression that Ron Howard missed the boat on that omission. Thus, the movie gets 8 out 10 stars from me, but do not let that be an indication I feel it is not truly a 10.",

Ron Howard did a great job of directing this film, Every actor did their part with pure dedication, Tom hanks proved why he is one of the greatest of all time. The movie is about the 3rd attempt of America to land on the moon and how it failed to reach its original destination and still became a phenomenon. As the movie goes on it reveals a lot more than just the journey. It shows the human kind can overcome any odd if they truly want to. It also shows how determination is superior than the problem. The Movie is very well put together. Every scene shows more than what one will expect. This is one of those movie that one can say after seeing\" yes that was a good one\"",

The representation of the spacecraft and the technical settings is incredibly accurate (I believe that the mission control sequences were actually filmed in the genuine mission control room at Houston space center.) The film would still be fascinating, entertaining, dramatic, humorous and emotional if it were merely fiction. Knowing that this superb movie retains all those qualities while being the true story of an event - that I still remember with powerful emotion - lifts it from the realm of good movies to the ranks of all-time classic masterpieces of cinema.",

Then they decide to give continuous exposition dumps through the news in the most mind numbingly boring ways.

            "content": "Based on the NASA mission, this movie follows the flight of the space shuttle Apollo 13. The movie is really heavy in way of emotional moments. It is rated PG because of the emotional intensity. One of the astronauts goes into space while he has a baby on the way and coming soon. His poor wife has to worry about what'll happen to her husband in space, but she can't worry too much because of the baby. One of those movies you have to watch again and again.Although not recommended for children under 12, it's a spectacular recreation of actual events. There is a considerable amount of language and a couple questionable scenes that are easily fast forwarded through, but isn't really that bad. Parents of younger children may want to watch the movie first before letting their children watch it. For all the young kids watching the movie, there is no need to be fearful for the lives of the astronauts. Spoilers: they make it back to earth safely, just not quite in the way mission control would have liked them to. They are unable to land on the moon because of the oxygen tank explosion among other problems.The screenplay is phenomenal. Every scene that the astronauts are weightless is real weightlessness. The director used the Vomit Comet to get the effect of being weightless. The shuttle that is used in the movie is inside the belly of the Vomit Comet, an airplane that NASA uses to train astronauts how to handle being weightless while in space. The weightless feeling only last 25 seconds out of a 65 second flight. The crew of the movie had to take multiple shots of the same scene to get enough for the movie. For the time period, these were high tech special effects and knowing that the actors are really weightless makes the movie even better. Most space movies in which the actors are in space, the weightless effect is made by using strings attached to the actors to move them in a weightless manner. It's rather interesting to watch a movie after seeing it once and knowing the second time that the astronauts are really weightless.",

A real sense of team effort developed, which is very rare in Hollywood, where 90% of films feature one or two main characters saving the world (boring).This film is a fine example of how to bring a real story to life without butchering it or just using it as a set piece - in stark contrast to Pearl Harbor.

And so it's essentially this repetitive chain of events, capturing the exhausting 5-day redundancy of the historical incident. Tom Hanks steals the show in one of his most iconic performances. The score by James Horner (R.I.P.) is terribly dated and at times too sentimental, but one of my favorite tracks captures the vastness and mystique of space.

It does everything well by showing what an astronaut has to do to train for a space mission but also builds character to where the characters in the movie seem real. It is exciting and makes me interested in the events and lives of the astronauts on board the Apollo 13. While in the first part of the movie there isn't much action but was full of suspense which made when the action did eventually happen better. When they launch on a mission, they get lost in space which leaves the audience asking, \"how will they get out?\" or \"will they?\" The images in the movie were spectacular. It shows images of the moon and the ship and describe how the astronauts desired so badly to be able to be on the moon. They had risked themselves to experience something few humans get to, and they had come up just short. While they couldn't set foot on the moon, they now have to do everything in their power to save their lives.",

Themes such as loyalty, honour, love, and failure are explored in the film in a very mature and moving way, without ever resorting to sentimentality.Even though we know how the events unfold and how it ends, I was still completely immersed in this great experience. One of the many strengths Ron Howard has as a film maker is in casting. With Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan, Howard has assembled a cast of truly great actors, who reflect what America is and what it stands for. I have never been so moved by an ensemble cast in this film due to their passion and love for this event.The other plaudits should go to the makers of the film. Ron Howard has succeeded in bringing out the tension on a moment by moment basis. I really felt as if I was living this event with those in the film.Digital Domain also deserves credit for the breathtaking visual effects on display. They are perhaps the biggest achievement of the company so far. James Horner is one of the top composers in the business and his score is moving, breathtaking, and spiritual. The scene where Apollo 13 goes around the moon and loses temporary contact with Houston is one of the most memorable and spiritual scenes I have ever seen. It is completely unforgettable and shows space in the most eerily beautiful way.If I was to go on about what I liked about 'Apollo 13' this review would go on and on. This film shows a hope and optimism that seems to be lacking not just in films, but also in the world today. Being from England and having lived in the USA, I have a great love and respect for that nation and 'Apollo 13' reminds me the ideals America stands for. This is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time.",

The main sequences of the mission are largely accurate, but the people plots are in my view often silly. The flight controllers in Houston were at the time some of the most able folks in this area in the world yet in the movie they are bumbling around in a way that is truly embarrassing. One of the saddest aspects was how they used this oaf from the company that built the LM who complained every time that \"...it is not designed to do that...\" Utter and complete NONSENSE. The true story is far better than any of the corny romance crap in the movie. I really don't think women go to movies just for this tripe anyway. Hollywood has to be more imaginative. In real life the Grumman plant in Bethpage Long Island NY came a alive during the night with men coming in off shift in the middle of the night without being asked to do so and from vacation to provide the knowledge of their little corner of the LM. Everyone knew that the LM was going to have to bring the boys back and it was the ground that made it so. The astronauts while having endure the cold and other privations as well as the disappointment for not getting to landing did relatively little in the effort to get them home. Another aspect is the one bespectacled controller who seems at a loss to solve any of the problems until astronaut Mattingly get there and saves the day with his knowledge! You gotta be kidding me! The controller they are effectively disrespecting with this fiction was John Aaron who for ALL accounts was one of two men who were really saving the mission. Kranz is effusive in his praise for Aaron in his book. There are many other matters in this disappointing movie. The problem is that when movies such as this one or Titanic and such like are made the average person often gets their history from them; flawed as it is. I have no problem with Hollywood writing movies that are period pieces and they can then have their idiot romances and such like. However, I think it behooves them to get it right, perfectly right when you call a movie Apollo 13, Gettysburg, The Longest Day, Hindenburg or whatever. It is a shame that they have multi-million dollar sets and a 50 cent plot. As an aficionado of space travel I find I can't watch the movie very often because of the mistakes and fiction. It is not funny to me. It is disrespectful to some true heroes who gave far more to their country than their government salaries would ever suggest.",

Until I watched this movie, I had no idea what had happened or what their mission was for. I never knew that they were trying to get to the moon again on that mission. Because I never knew the story, I was in suspense the whole movie, which I like while watching movies. Unlike in other history movies where I know what is going on, this one was interesting to watch because it was almost like history unfolding right in front of me which was cool.\nThis movie is about NASA's Apollo 13 mission to try to get to the moon after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had gotten there the first time. Three astronauts are sent on this mission: Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Some things on their mission go wrong and they and their team back on earth do all they can to get the three astronauts safely home.\nBefore I watched this movie, I did not know this part of history. I had no idea that there had been another mission to try and get to the moon after the Apollo 11 mission. This part of history is really interesting to me because we put men into space which is really awesome. Even though the technology back then is not near to what it is now, it still amazes me that they were able to put people and even just things into space. It blows my mind.\nThe director of this movie is Ron Howard. I have seen a couple of the movies that he has directed. I really liked them. There was only one I watched that he directed that I didn't like. The main actors in this movie are Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton who play the three astronauts. I have seen Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon in a few movies, and I think they are great actors. They are always entertaining to watch and I like the type of movies they have been in (at least the ones I have seen). My favorite scene in this movie was when the astronauts were trying to stay on target with the earth, but had to keep the earth in view from their window, instead of using technology because most of the technology in their shuttle was down.\nI really liked all the scenes with the astronauts in space, especially after everything went wrong. It was interesting to see how they acted and reacted in their desperate situation. It was also interesting to see how their team on earth worked together to get the astronauts safely home. This was a great movie and the space scenes were really realistic. The acting was really good too. I would watch this movie outside of school.",

Even in moments of utter silence, with nothing happening, the tension was still obvious. The music as a whole is quite good, but the main title theme is repeated a little too much - after all, it hardly has the impact of something like Alexander Courage's Star Trek theme. Overall, an excellent movie. But there are still many bad points. The movie is rather slow to begin with, and there are plenty of the family scenes that should have been cut. They add nothing to the movie - and in many cases they detract from it. This isn't helped by the acting from the female cast members, which is simply appalling. Surely they could afford at least one person besides a few of the top listed men who could act. Also, there are many cliches in the dialogue, and the heroic nature of these people is hammered into us far too many times. Still, I did enjoy it, but more as escapism than anything meaningful. 7/10",

The second physics point is that by letting the module coast, they know it will get to the moon as an object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by a force, in which case the settings of space don't allow there to be any. They then fear about burning up upon re-entry, which brings up the force of friction and air resistance that cause the heat to take place.

However, my only real gripe, and it's a big one, is that there is just too much exposition. If it's not from the characters asides then its from the shots of TV programmes or the O.B.s of various TV journalists. Whether this is because everything has to be explicitly revealed to an American audience or not I dont know. But what do we say to stupid people when they dont take something in?

He lost accuracy in the dialogue, but this adventure had all the drama and excitement of anything writers could make up. Sadly, Ron caved to the mentality that everyone speaks and acts like they do in Hollywood. I remember seeing one of the astronauts commenting on the film after viewing it, and he said it was very realistic what happened in that ship, except that NOBODY ever swore during their entire mission. So much for reality. How sad is that, that we must inject profanities and swearing into an action packed, true story for no reason whatsoever. Obviously the men on that mission had higher standards than Ron Howard. Had Ron been more true to the facts this film would have been great instead of good.When directors want to inject graphic violence, profanities, and swearing into a movie (thinking the entire world is as immoral as Hollywood) they use the excuse \"that's what really happened\". In this case, though, that was not the way it happened. He made these decent, courageous men out to be swearing, profane men. What a double standard. They excuse filth because it is realistic - but cannot bring themselves to portray decent men with morals. These men deserved better.",

Effects are breathtaking (all of the launch scenes, for example, are computer-generated since the stock footage was all unacceptable).Best of all, the movie is historically accurate.  Granted, Howard took some license, but not much.  The biggest difference is that the astronauts on the historical mission fired the engine several short times manually while the movie version packed all the excitement into one firing.  Other differences amount to minutia.  For example, the historical record shows that they played \"Blue Danube\", as opposed to the movie's \"Spirit in the Sky\", at the beginning of the real TV broadcast.  At other times, the details are real. Marion Lovell actually did loose her wedding ring in the shower!Acting in the movie is superb.  You feel the frustration when Mattingly has to stay home with measles.  You feel the excitement when Swigert gets to go in his place.  You feel Marian Lovell's stress when she doesn't know what's going to happen to her husband.  You feel the cold, uncertainty, and dependence on ground support on the return trip.  You feel a part of the team called NASA that ultimately brought the astronauts home.Overall, Apollo 13 is a magnificent movie - well worth watching time and again.",

The moments when the ship was returning to Earth (having not known the real story myself) were incredibly suspenseful due to the quietness and faces of the actors. I have rarely been on the edge of my seat in a movie like this one. Great scenes in space, gives you a view most won't experience. Good special effects, spectacular sound in the launch scene. This is a classic tale that has been very well directed. It would not be easy recreating this story but this movie has achieved that. I would have liked to have seen a reunion with family at the end for that extra \"oomph\" but thats just a personal opinion that doesn't need to be taken as a criticism.

It's another film about the great America and one of the thousand times that did things that shook the world. If you are ok with that then you will have a great time watching this movie. First of all it's really well crafted. Really for this film to be made in 1995 is really impressive. Sure there are some old effects and a naive screenplay but this movie was made in the mid 90's! That alone is so impressive. I don't know if the events are portrayed with a lot of reality but this is not a documentary so I was alright with that. It's a fun movie with some really good performances (seems like Tom Hanks is playing the good guy since forever) with my favorite being probably Ed Harris's role. As I said the story is really naive. All characters are portrayed like they are the best persons in the world and any conflict or obstacles are gone after a while for the shake of the good ending. But that was the case abput blockbuster films back then. And at least fromsame films of this century \"Apollo 13\" has a soul. It takes itself as seriously as it must for the story to proceed without being tiresome. The movie gets into the mission right away and our heroes are sent to the moon in the first 30 minutes. It's a fast paced and hard boiled movie that you will enjoy if you shut off your brain and let it tell you its story without expecting much.

            "content": "I'll start out by saying I'm a fan of old, classic films and don't watch new movies at all. As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how \"right\" they \"got it\".I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to \"modernize\" styles, not trusting the audience to \"get it\", that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deep\u2014just dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood.Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them.A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a \"story\" instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives.The acting was good, but the writing was often clich\u00e9d. A lot of it reminded me of things like \"Back To Bataan\" or the \"Sands of Iwo Jima\", only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing \"A\" part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting.A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to be\u2014mainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.)But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff. US space history doesn't begin with Apollo 11 and end with Apollo 13.",

Is he Howard Hawks reincarnated, maybe?However, Tom Hanks is an incredibly irritating, sanctimonious s.o.b. \"Gentlemen, what are your intentions?\" he solemnly postures to his underlings.  Maybe it's just the the way the character was written, but I get the impression that Hanks is way, way too impressed with himself.  He acts as if his every word is some precious insight that is to be savored and smiled at with respect.  I don't know if Jim Lovell was quite this arrogant, but if I were stuck inside a box for 7 days with that mouth of his, I'd have jumped ship, helmet or not.",

I think there's a gaffe at the end of the movie where mission control is awaiting the splash down. I think there is a space shuttle patch on the wall behind them at one angle and if that's the case well... the shuttle was 10 plus years after Apollo 13. But that's minor. Tom Hanks is a perfect choice for Jim Lovell. The mix of real footage and the redone is seamless. It earned the praise.

The three leave the helicopter and are greeted by the crew of the carrier. During the time that they are being greeted you will see several men in white uniforms. You will see one man in the scene pat Hanks character on the shoulder, the greeting is longer than the others. That is who I believe is Jim Lovell is standing to the left of Hanks in a profile shot.

Tom Hanks, once again, playing astronaut Jim Lovell, once again took a character and filled the shoes perfectly to make a jaw-dropping and powerfully intense film. He appears to be the clear and commander of not just the capsule but also the movie. The mission was intended to hold Lovell, Mattingly and Haise but the crew hits their first roadblock to walk on the moon when Mattingly was sadly forced off the mission. He was said to have contracted the measles (who, in the end, never ended up getting it). Mattingly was then replaced by Swigert. The excitement in Lovell to walk on the moon was apparent throughout the movie before the launch. So when the oxygen tank in their capsule exploded and the men were forced to end their mission and return home, the heartbreak was felt through the screen and into the audience. The harrowing mission around the dark side of the moon and back home left everyone on the edge of their seats, fearing for the lives of Lovell, Swigert and Haise. The emotion trying to get the three back safely was felt throughout the film and it was as if the audience was in that control room, trying to figure out a way to safely land the men. At the end of the movie, when the three land the capsule in the ocean and are rescued, it was hard not to sigh with relief along with the rest of America. Apollo 13 was told with clear detail that informed but also kept the attention of its audience through adventure and dramatics.",

            "content": "This movie might have been about space, but it was the human story that made it. The movie skillfully shifted from space to the control center to the families at home without being melodramatic or glib. Every face had deliberate emotion and Tom Hanks clearly led the way. He stole the show without stealing scenes from other actors which moves him out of the group of good actors to great ones. Kevin Bacon also did well with his character's struggle with being a last minute replacement that wasn't necessarily enthusiastically welcomed. The technical talk was at times pushed into weird conversations as it was necessary but not made interesting enough to pay attention to for long periods which they made up for with the three astronauts struggling with their physical movements in the cramped area trying to save themselves. The audience didn't always understand the specifics of the problems but they were still able to feel the tensions of the moments. Something that really kept me going with the movie was how mission control really embraced only being able to use the materials the astronauts had in solving all the problems. The back and forth between mission control and the astronauts as a result livened up the end that is usually just a bunch of men yelling at computers. As a result of the movie being based on a true story, there were very few opportunities for falsities to exist in the movie. The realism added to everything really allowed the drama of the movie to be fully embraced by the audience. Regardless of having the knowledge of how the movie ends, the audience is still able to ride every emotional wave with the character in the story. My main complaint would have to be that the ending was a bit anticlimactic just because after the climax of the story, there was a drop in emotion that never came back up. My heart stopped beating so fast and there was never a moment that tugged at my heart-strings to cap it all off. Overall, it was truly an incredible movie I would easily recommend to anyone. This is a great introduction into the space genre, especially considering how it was based on a true story.",

I have read numerous books by authors who were involved with this mission and I do not find many contradicting details of Ron Howard's extraordinary film with their recounts of the \"successful failure.\"  Apollo 13 is so accurate that the dialogues of certain scenes (i.e. Flight Director Gene Krantz in mission control) matches verbatim with NASA recordings.  In addition to the accuracy, the acting is superb while the pictures and sound are astounding.  Howard had full cooperation of NASA and to reconstruct weightlessness he used the method NASA trains its astronauts with-the KC-135.  The scenes of mission control were shot at Johnson Space Center in the actual mission control and astronauts Jim Lovell and David Scott trained Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise, and Howard at Space Camp.  Ron Howard should be commended for what I consider the greatest film ever and for not \"selling out\" to crowds that just want to see big, shiny exploding things, such as the Titanium Shuttle in Armageddon.

As well as considerable emotions that is not typically seen in most movies now and days as it doesn't have a message besides the story. This is why I say its a solid 8.5/10 movie as it truly shows the dangers and quite how unforgiving space travel is, however, it felt that the child actors and some of the side characters ruined some of the more touching and emotion-filled scenes.

They train for the flight then, a matter of days before the launch, Mattingly is grounded because he may have the measles. He is replaced by standby astronaut Jack Swigert. This isn't the last of their problems by a long way. There is a problem with a rocket shortly after launch but that doesn't threaten the mission. Three days later when all appears to be going well Mission Control orders Swigert to stir the oxygen tanks; something goes wrong and there is an explosion. It soon becomes clear that they will not be landing on the moon; success will just be getting back to Earth. Everything from now on is far from routine as the crew, and those on the ground must solve problems that had never been envisaged. Given that this film is based on real events and I knew how it ultimately ended it is surprisingly gripping. The depiction of the events in space are particularly good; we get a real feel of what the crew are going through as conditions in their cramped living quarters deteriorates. Even those who know how the story ends are likely to learn new details such as the way everybody on the ground worked to find solutions to the various unforeseen problems and Mattingly tries out various ideas on a simulator. The biggest revelation for me was the fact that until things went wrong the American public seemed so indifferent to the mission so much so that the crew's broadcast from space wasn't aired by the TV networks. The cast does a fine job; Tom Hanks is great as Lovell and is ably supported by Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as crewmates Haise and Swigert.",

Today, however, no more lands to be found and no more areas can be explored. It is wondered whether the frontier hero is gone, or if we can still seek a new life. This movie give us an answer -- yes. This is why I love this movie and watched more than one time.In the geographic field, there is definitely not more land can be found. However, about space, we still do not know much more about it. Furthermore, even in many new scientific field, they are strangers to us. We have to research and learn more and more about them.There are still frontier culture in the world, but why I love it. Somebody may tell you, because frontier life is extremely exciting and excellent. Anybody have the same opportunity to be a winner. However, there is not everyone can be a winner because of many different reason. For personally, in the three days before the launching, Ken Mattingly was removed from the mission due to exposure to German measles, which he never contracted. For the whole mission, 13 could not land on the moon, and they have to come back to the earth. Nevertheless, All of them are still frontier heroes, because they have to fight with every dangerous cases which they met.In summary, there are still frontier heroes in today. But no every frontier experiences are exciting and excellent, no every one can be a winners. But nobody can say pioneers are loser.",

During his talk someone asked why the movie didn't follow the book more - Lovell said that they thought audience would have trouble with all the crises in the movie to add the other things that happened, we did think the public would believe any of it. Rather than overplay it, they down played it. This is not a work of fiction. Timeless. True. He lived it. He did the interviews with others.Maybe that is what captures us? I lived on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii at the time and the astronauts used to drive behind our house and we would line the fence waving to them in their containment unit.This movie is probably EVEN better, more relevant today than when it was written.

The realistic special effects of the Saturn 5 launch, the docking of the Command and Lunar Modules, and life in space filled in missing information that could not be captured by the televised reports available in that day. Stays true to one of the dichotomies of the time - showing the young straight laced NASA mission control engineers, in contrast with the flower-power generation evolving around them.

            "content": "Synopsis: Tom Hanks stars in this Hollywood film that is based on the infamous Apollo 13 lunar landing as astronaut Jim Lovell. Alongside him are his fellow spacemen and trusty pals Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton). A smooth beginning is foiled when the oxygen supply suddenly drops and their new flight path around the moon becomes a battle of survival.This amazing rendition of the crisis that is the Apollo 13 mission is overflowing with leaders within the film. Imagine you're the mission control leader on one of the biggest missions ever, one to the moon. All is great until an oxygen tank explodes and the other one leaks quickly. Now, enter the mind of Gene Kranz. He has several moments during the movie where he has to control the room and the million dollar metal rocket flying through space.The first is when the oxygen tank explodes. Everyone seems to be rushing to him asking him what they should do and he calmly says \"one at a time\". As a leader, you must be able to face hard situations with confidence because if you are scared, then everyone else is going to be even more scared. \"Failure is not an option.\" The next display of leadership is when the men at mission control are discussing how long they will last and that they won't make it back to Earth. Gene tells them that they will and his resilience empowers all of the men. Once he is able to set a course of action, Gene displays an act of delegation. Delegation is a very important characteristic for a leader and his use of telling them they need to find the solution without him, allows him to be more aware of the other problems and to address the additional problems that are bound to arise. He also inspired them to think outside of the box by saying \"I don't care what anything was designed to do. I care about what it can do.\" Because of this, they were able to break down the problems into sub-units and build a solution from the ground up. When the astronauts are just on the cusp of reentry, we see the NASA director talking about how this could be the worst disaster in the history of NASA. So then, just when everyone needed to be reassured the most, we see Gene swoop in and say, \"With all due respect sir, I think that this is going to be our finest hour.\" Gene wasn't pessimistic, but optimistic about the outcome of the landing. How leaders deal with adversity and doubt is very important. Gene is a perfect example of a leader in this regard and all others. He is optimistic, calm against stress, and a leader that people want to follow.",

Ron Howard saw his dream of revisiting the Apollo 13 space mission come true and he did so in  such an emotionally investing and captivating way, he shows us the astronauts in space, their families back on earth, and mission control all throughout the movie and each one has it part to play in the story and they all work beautifully. I really felt for the families of the men in space, they were truly frightened that they may never see their father/husbands again. Mission Control felt very involved and they communicated effectively to Apollo 13, but the most important aspect of mission control that was nailed in this movie, is that when it was time check in with them, it was never boring, it didn't break up the momentum of a previous scene or ever feel out of place, and they also weren't in the movie too much. As for the acting, Tom Hanks was excellent, per the norm, he really brought the veteran presence and leadership that this movie needed to be successful. Bill Paxton was really good as well, but he wasn't a part of the movie as much as we would have liked him to be, he spends a bit throwing up in a corner, and for a lot of the third act, he's basically frozen and just floating around in the ship. Kevin Bacon was my personal favorite in this movie, he was the unexpierienced rookie who was always questioning mission controls orders after the explosion, he was terrified and I really felt his fear through his performance. Ed Harris and Gary Sinise were both excellent in mission control.  The cinematography is gorgeous in this film, the shot are wide and are not quick cut. The CGI was also really good, nothing that I saw on screen wasn't believable. The best thing about this movie in my opinion is the script, it allowed for so much characterization and emotion to be crafted across the entire film, the dialogue as well is very good, so many memorable quotes and you learn about the characters through what they say very well. I also liked the fact that after the explosion in space happened, everybody said that they are going to die, their was always someone their to say that they would be fine, and the optimism in this movie is so essential to the entire journey. Overall, this is a really good movie based off of a true story that must be viewed by many, but is not for everybody. I adore this movie and will keep coming back to it for many years to come.

            "content": "This is one of those films that I would consider overrated not because I don't think it's a good film but for all of the praise that gets heaped on it for being one of the best films of the 1990s. It's a solid film that's very good places but it also faces it's lulls and has that unfortunate decent but never brilliant sheen that always rests over Ron Howard directed films. It's probably one of the best films about astronauts, up there with The Right Stuff (1983) and Marooned (1969), but it features actors essentially playing themselves and doesn't illuminate the experiences of working in a stressful job in the way that The Right Stuff does. I would definitely say that you should watch this, I saw it in school, but don't go in expecting the masterpiece it has been heralded as.\n\nAstronauts Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks, Jack Swigert, Kevin Bacon and Fred Haise, Bill Paxton, will serve as the crew that flies on the Apollo 13 aircraft in April of 1970 as Swigert replaces the ill Ken Mattingly, Gary Sinise, who resents this decision. The men quickly encounter problems when they are launched into space and it is up to the men and their flight commander on the ground Gene Kranz, Ed Harris, to get themselves back to earth alive. It will require some tough maneuvers and everybody pitching in, including Mattingly, to get the men home safely.\n\nThe film does a good job at building tension even as we know that these men will survive, an often stated view on this film but nevertheless true. We get to learn about Lovell's relationship with his wife Marilyn, Kathleen Quinlan, before we see him as an astronaut which makes us invested in him when his life is threatened. We feel that we know these men personally because their struggles are relatable, we've all worried for a family member or been passed over for a job at least once in our lives, and as they have tense discussions about flight plans we are engaged because we like these men and want to see them succeed. This is what so many disaster movies miss as they expect us to be invested in the lives of people just because they are threatened without showing what they will be missing out on in life.\n\nThe performances are all solid if unremarkable as Howard assembles Hanks, Harris, Sinise, Bacon, Paxton and Quinlan to perform admirably in an ensemble drama. I would not have given this film the Academy Award nominations it received for acting as Quinlan and Harris are serviceable but not superlative in a year that gave us Illeana Douglas in To Die For (1995) and Clive Russell in Margaret's Museum (1995). Hanks pulls a Captain Phillips (2013) and just plays himself but his charm is enough to carry the performance and his accessibility allows even the least interested viewer to become invested. Howard is typically good with actors as shown in his best film, The Paper (1994), and here he uses a reliable cast to great effect, if only he had brought that skill to A Beautiful Mind (2001).\n\nI would not considered Howard to be one of the best directors working today but he did deserve recognition for his work on this film as he adapts the story to the screen artfully. He makes all the right decisions as he steps around having too much focus on the technical aspects of the mission and doesn't over saturate the film with details about the personal lives of the characters. We are pushed far enough to earn an emotional response but not so far that we are resentful of the manipulation. In any case he did a better job than Mel Gibson did on Braveheart (1995) and we could have avoided the infamous 2001 Best Picture win had he been rewarded at this point.\n\nYou can watch this film anywhere with anybody and I suppose that's one of the reasons for it's enduring popularity but mostly it's just a very well made, tense film. Howard's direction and the skillful storytelling raise the film above the rest and although it's not perfect it deserves praise.",

The movie made me feel incredibly empathetic. Once the men were stranded in space, I was hanging onto everything that happened in the film. It made me think how incredibly terrifying that must have been for the men and their families. I don\u00e2(TM)t feel that I\u00e2(TM)ve seen enough films within this particular genre to be able to compare, but I felt that this one was profound and very professional and there isn\u00e2(TM)t anything I would have done differently. In terms of writing, I most enjoyed when Jim\u00e2(TM)s son expressed his concern over his dad getting safely to the moon while Marilyn listened on in the background. It sets up the stakes for the film because the prior spaceship that had been sent off didn\u00e2(TM)t make it safely. I also really enjoyed the line that the film ended with when Jim says, \u00e2when would we be going back, and who would that be?\u00e2? It was such a great way to end the film - on a high note and to leave the audience with something to think about. In regard to the directing, my favorite shot was when Jim\u00e2(TM)s wife is having a bad dream about Jim being sucked out of the spaceship and it goes into an extreme close-up of her eye opening and looking around. I also particularly enjoyed the shots that took place inside the spacecraft. They were all tilted, which offered an interesting perspective of the alternate reality the men have to get used to within the spacecraft. In general, I feel that the editing that was done between what was going on in the rocket along with what was going on in the command center was done really well. There was a lot of editing between reactions to what is happening and what is actually happening which really heightened the tension and added to the dramatization of each step in the process. When the guys realize they aren\u00e2(TM)t going to the moon there\u00e2(TM)s a very pregnant pause, which was a great example of pacing. In regard to acting, my favorite scene was when they tell Ken that he can\u00e2(TM)t be on Apollo 13. Everyone was listening really well with each other; the scene wasn\u00e2(TM)t big and angry when it could easily have been performed that way. Overall, the cinematography was wonderful, and my favorite scene was when they did the urine dump from the spaceship. Everything sprays out of the ship in front of the stars. It was a really cool shot! The sound design was probably my favorite part of the film. The swell of the music when the guys get on the spacecraft accentuated the momentous moment. Then when the rocket takes off, it\u00e2(TM)s not overwhelmingly loud but there\u00e2(TM)s so much sound and depth of sound that you can tell something huge and powerful is happening",

            "content": "NASA's Finest Hour told in Two\nApollo 13 is a perfect example of how the underappreciated hands of filmmaking can fine-tune an otherwise cable channel documentary into a noteworthy historical film. Apollo 13 had 7 Oscar nominations, only 2 of which were nods towards the actors.  It is a perfectly woven tapestry of music, sound effects, visual display and direction, brought together by a versatile and flawless cast. Echoing the very mission it depicted, the cast and crew of Apollo 13 (some legends in their own right) worked together as team with a common goal- with no one player competing for the spotlight and glory.\n     Directed by the legendary Ron Howard, this based-on-true-events drama tells the story a failed lunar mission. It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon, but as far as the astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and the American public was concerned, Apollo 13 was just another routine mission. Before diving into the events of Apollo 13- ultimately deemed NASA's finest hour, the movie starts with the Apollo 11 lunar landing -NASA's biggest victory. Opening with literal trumpets- a James Horner signature, Hollywood's soundtrack specialist stayed true to his brass-laden compositions, laying the perfect auditory background fit to carry impeccably written dialogue and carefully chosen archived news reports.\n\tJust as the set directors Michael Corenblith and Meredith Boswell settle the audience into the brown nostalgic couches of the era with Jimi Hendrix, The Who and Jefferson Airplane in their ear, the viewer is jolted back into the gravity of the film with the famous phrase, \"Houston, we have a problem.\" Stranded 205,000 miles from Earth in a crippled spacecraft, the scheduled moon landing is called off. It is at this point in the film we see the emerging and meshing of unique contributions that turned individuals into heros. The triangular synergy of the astronauts, mission control and the family on Earth created a triangular synergy that was captured by the performances of Bacon, Hanks, Paxton, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan (playing Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn) and Jean Speegle Howard (as Blanch, Lovell's mother).  \n     It may have seemed that only the astronauts spent the better part of the seven day mission in a claustrophobic space capsule, but Mission Control, Marilyn and Blanch had their own types of confinement. Mission Control- led by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) was tied to the constraints of limited technology, time and the very laws of physics. Marilyn and Blanch were confined to boxes that gave them news and information but little hope that their Jimmy would return alive. The cast collected to portray this symbiotic triangle possessed the same blend of raw genius, humility and versatility as the real heros behind the Apollo 13 rescue. Any tensions within the crew (movie or mission) that threaten the prime objective became an opportunity to project confidence and produce solutions- solutions like making a CO2 filter in space with a sock and cover of the flight plan, or salving the fears of the astronauts' children by demonstrating unwavering faith. \n     Much like the actual mission and rescue, the re-creation of Apollo 13 was not created in a Hollywood bubble. NASA equipment and aircrafts were used to film the zero-gravity scenes. Jim Lovell, who made a cameo at the end of the movie, lent the transcripts from his autobiographical account of the events. Astronauts, crew members, family and media from the actual mission were interviewed to help solidify the script and sharpen the scene sequence and set designs. \n     This was the perfect story to brought to life at the perfect time when technology could impactfully articulate to an audience the true peril these three astronauts were in and the literal gathering of the world to bring them home. Remember, this is a story that has been re-told multiple times. It is through painstaking lengths that Ron Howard went to create new footage, not simply re-use and re-organize previous narrations and imagines. It is with the tool of technology enhanced with perfectly curated music of the era and a symphony of brass compliments of James Horner that gave Al Reinert and Robert Legato a place for their script and special effects. \n     While some may say Apollo 13 is an outdated film, we are reminded that it is important to replay significant moments in history to remind ourselves how problems can be constructed into solutions with considerable collaboration. NASA's finest hour was finally told using Hollywood storytelling at its best. Apollo 13 may not have been a major box office hit, if there is one thing we learned is there is such a thing as a \"successful failure\".",

Howard recounts the true story of the Apollo 13 spacecraft and its crew's miraculous return to Earth. You will still be stunned by the realistic special effects and the enclosed environment. You feel like you are in the ship with these astronauts. Howard also lets you understand how hard it is for the families of NASA's team members to endure these flights. Apollo 13 is a phenomenal historical drama that plays out more like an epic disaster film.\n\nApollo 13's cast is filled with excellent character actors that all deliver heartfelt performances. Tom Hanks, Kathleen Quinlan, Gary Sinese, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, and Ed Harris are particularly wonderful to behold in Apollo 13. These actors bring these incredible real events to life with a genuine quality that comes across the screen. Their emotions and desires are felt by you through these highly expressive depictions. I think Apollo 13 is as much a display of believable acting as it is a recreation of historical moments.\n\nJames Horner delivers an emotive score that grips your heartstrings with each tender note. The scary sequences are elevated by Horner's tense score as well as the intimate familial scenes are grounded by his gentle sounds. Apollo 13 keeps you in the moment with its tense scenes in addition to Horner's classical music.\n\nIn short, Apollo 13 is a must see American classic. It may have been released in 1995, but it looks like it could have been made currently. The effects, story, acting, and direction all hold water to date. I think you could play Apollo 13 in a classroom as a time piece of the late 1960's and early 1970's. It is that good.",

With stalwart flight director Gene Kranz, played by Ed Harris, Apollo 13 weaves an inspiring narrative that crosses generations. Failure was simply not an option on Apollo 13. \n\tThe special effects are on point. The audience feels transported into the endless void of space. The movie looks realistic, despite not using any NASA footage from the real mission. These effects add to the suspense of the movie. Even though the outcome of the mission is well known, I was still on the edge of my seat wondering whether the perils of space would take the heroes. \n\tThe real Gene Kranz believes the most important part of space flight is \"the human factor,\" and Apollo 13 captures this idea perfectly. In the movie, NASA isn't a confusing government organization, but a tight-knit team of individuals whose talent and determination saves the lives of three American heroes. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to feel inspired.",

Whether it's a flashy blockbuster or a low budget drama, ageing is a curse that thousands of films succumb to. Apollo 13 though, still feels fresh when watching it today. Not because it's the depiction of a true event or the talented cast on screen (but that does help!), it's the direction. This was made to showcase the technical prowess and finesse that Ron Howard has in making, what I call, a Hollywood movie. James Horner for musical score, Tom Hanks as lead actor...it has all the ingredients for a 90's classic that Hollywood love to serve up. It works, so no complaints here. Let's talk about Ron Howard, he was superb directing this. His style, ever so consistent, yet always changing. Still shots, tracking shots, POV shots...you name it, he's probably included it. Tom Hanks was charming as always, Kevin Bacon's smile just steals every scene and Bill Paxton's nervous outbursts were relatable. Bringing in Ed Harris as the flight director was a smart move, he oozes confidence and brings in the acting experience to keep us hooked. It's a bittersweet true story, our astronauts venture towards the moon where an unforeseen event occurs that prevents them from landing on the surface. A landmark event, and yet they couldn't achieve it. I honestly had sympathy for our characters, seeing their dreams being crushed within hours. I also appreciated the friction between Jack and the crew, being a newcomer is always difficult and I thought that was presented well. The effects for the most part hold up decently, the rocket launch though...not so well. The background looked like Google Earth or Flight Simulator, could've been handled better even in 1995. It is a safe and familiar structure with not many thrills in store, a disadvantage for any well documented true event with a happy ending. In saying that, I was captivated and enthralled by the science and entranced by the performances. Ron Howard did a damn good job who deserves more recognition.",

I figured since it was in my want to see list on Flixster, I rented this with other films to get some films off my list. So for this, I really enjoyed this film for what it is. The acting is pretty solid, and the story is well-told that respects the real life people that were actually involved with the event.  The visual effects are the highlight of the film as to this day, they look really good and realistic that really shows the believability of the actors acting around in zero gravity. It's tense at some points, and you get enough of the characterization of the crew that you want them to survive the event, even if you know what already happened. The only issue that I do have with this, is the pacing. There are some slow moments that are a bit often than it should've, andthat wasn't quite an easy sit for me and just felt long, even though it's suppose to be suspenseful.

Despite the movie's ending already being known, as we all know what happened during the real Apollo 13 catastrophe, you can't help but fixate your attention on the movie as you wait for the next turn of events.\nSprinkled in, are moments of sadness, of heart, and, thankfully, some comedy to help alleviate it all.\nActing is phenomenal, but that is to be expected from a cast like the one chosen.\nAnd throughout the movie, I couldn't think of any flaws. \nDespite this though, I can't give this movie a 5 star rating. There is just something about the movie that didn't strike home, that didn't make me say \"That was an absolutely extraordinary movie\".

Firstly, I bought this movie yesterday (new) for $4 on DVD and I've never seen it before. Secondly, my review shall begin after this sentence. Let me just start off with the audio because it is REALLY sharp and loud for a non Blu-Ray format movie, in particular, the music. James Horner's 5-star score couldn't have sounded better; it packs so much in emotion, tension, and restrained patriotism. The movie could be described in the same way, and when I say tense, I mean, tense. The first hour went by so fast that I had to check my phone to make sure I was looking at the right time. This is a \"based on a true story\" film where we know that it all ends well, yet, the way \"Apollo 13\" is written/directed/etc--it's hard to describe, but the movie feels like Paxton, Hanks, & Bacon might not make it ...even though we KNOW they do. Across the board, the movie is well done: the dialogue is there, the visuals are there, and the acting's there. You couldn't ask for a better film; the ending is so triumphant (again, James Horner's music BOOSTS that scene so much) that even 2013's \"Gravity\" seems to have missed the mark by comparison.",

I can just about remember seeing the news footage of the return of crew Earth after their ill-fated mission when I was a child and this film does so much to show the bravery and inventiveness of the people involved. Tom Hanks leads the cast giving one of his stand-out performances. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris are all equally good in their various roles, with Harris in particular putting in a commanding performance. The effects in this film are terrific, bringing vividly to life the drama of a rocket launch and the journey into space. I find the shots of the capsule drifting through space particularly impressive as they seem to bring home just how far away and isolated the men actually were. This mission that went so wrong, could have ended in tragedy. Instead, the tenacity and ingenuity of a dedicated team turned it into something of a triumph. What Ron Howard did with this movie was dramatise these events with great care and attention to detail. I have watched this film many times and always find it both inspiring and gripping. It has everything that you could ask for in a drama and was been brought to the screen by a team who clearly cared a great deal about what they were doing. It is indeed a fitting tribute to the brave men who flew on Apollo 13, the ground crew who supported them and the families that waited for their safe return.",

But with what he had and by choosing what he needed to show and what he didn't, Ron Howard commendably crafted a brilliant space opera set in the earlier stages of mankind's adventures into the dark void.\n\nWhen the story is already known by the viewer, the stakes are higher for the filmmaker and when the known story is also a part of some huge historical event not just from some bestseller novel, you can imagine the pressure to get everything right. Ron Howard chose his casts right and they did great; Tom Hanks, Ed Harris especially. And he and his crew did the rest of the things right, nine academy award nominations can vouch for that.\n\nApollo 13 is an absolute masterpiece.",

Stylistically everything looks good (including the early stages CGI) as the headsets, sideburns and cigarettes in mission control center, contrasting the groovy floral prints in the Lovell home.\nWhile Gravity had to raise the stakes by making Sandy Bullock float in space and Interstellar attempted to teach us a brief history of time, this true story remains thrilling without implausibility issues. It's joyously scary to watch human beings rocket into space, and the mood and tone of the characters never gets too bleak even when they have many reasons to despair. There's a dramatic grandeur to this film that is common in Hollywood, but it's still great to see it done in earnest.",

Howard is known for making real life stories alone in his career. Apollo 13's extreme usage of technical language seems too boring for normal people.

What has always amazed me is that, even when you know the outcome of the mission it is still tense and exciting. They have compiled a number of moments that will get your heart pounding and have you worrying about the well-being of the 3 astronauts. I'm always impressed when a movie is able to keep me emotionally invested even when I've seen it dozens of times. But my absolute favorite scenes don't even take place in space. The way that the technicians at mission control have to troubleshoot so many different problems is fascinating to me. It's like a series of little puzzles that they must work together to solve. It doesn't hurt that I love Ed Harris' acting.\n\nThe rest of the cast is amazing too. Most notable are the performances of the 3 astronauts. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton play off each other perfectly. There are so many moments when you can read exactly what they're thinking without them saying a word. I think what holds me back from calling Apollo 13 one of my all-time favorite films is the length. It feels like they have filled the movie with a bit too much material and every time I watch I can't help thinking \"Well, that scene was unnecessary.\" Almost everything with the Lovell family feels very forced as if they're trying to coerce the audience into an emotional reaction instead of letting it happen naturally. Then there are the numerous times when they cut to news reports to reiterate the stakes for us. There comes a point where it starts to feel condescending that they keep telling us and then retelling us what is happening. Once or twice is enough, thank you. Apollo 13 is still a great film that did some truly remarkable things. If they could have trimmed it down it could have been one of the best movies of all time.",

Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon are the three astronauts, who must navigate their way back to Earth, with the assistance of Mission Control in Houston, after an explosion onboard leaves them with a depleted oxygen and electrical supply. This is a conventional, straightforward re-telling of events that lacks the ambition or visionary exhilaration of Philip Kaufman's \"The Right Stuff.\" Howard embraces the simplistic Reagan-era heroism that was the satirical target of Kaufman's film. It feels as weightless as an astronaut in space. Ed Harris is commanding as the unflappable flight director. Kathleen Quinlan is affecting as Hanks's wife.

The film tells the incredible story about the events surrounding the Apollo 13 mission before, during, and after the launch, including the preparation, conflict, launch, flight, disaster (explosion) on the ship while in space on the way to the moon, and the fight to get the astronauts back to Earth.  The film has an amazing use of visual effects, and sound effects, creating beauty and realism in the film.  The film is also brought to life by Ron Howard's incredible direction that never got an Oscar nod (what the hell?!).  The film not only focuses on the problem in NASA's, Jim Lovell's, Fred Haise's, and Jack Swigert's point of view and experience on the incident, but also on the effect of their friends, families, the country, and the entire world as an accident like that never happened before.  The film also has stellar performances, but the one that's more convincing and believable is Ed Harris in his Oscar-nominated portrayal as White team Flight Director Gene Kranz, thanks to his moments of showing confidence and determination to get Lovell, Haise, and Swigert back home.  Another great performance is Kathleen Quinn in her Oscar-nominated portrayal as Marilyn Lovell, Jim's wife, as she always expresses concern and anxiety towards her husband going on the mission, as well as dealing with the incident, the family issues, and facing the truth that it's actually happening.  The film has perfect timing of tension, laughs, and pure drama, making this one of the greatest biographical films of all time.  The film also benefits from William Broyles, Jr.'s and Al Reinert's script that was adapted from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13.  The film has perfect scientific accuracy, smart dialogue, and historical inaccuracies that we leave out, such as the reworded quotes that have since become famous like \"Houston, we have a problem\", and \"Failure is not an option\", and the timing of the on-board explosion.  The film also has an amazing score, thanks to composer James Horner.  A film that should be seen by all as it tells an incredible story that will never be forgotten.",

Even if they were decent, or even good, it doesn't make up for the fact that all they do is talk and talk until your brains burst in boredom. I don't know how this film got to be so popular with cinema-goers, critics, or the general ITV2 audience, but I generally think that this is a pretty overrated film, mainly because it's so damn boring.",

We get good character moments to make us feel for the characters. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the disaster in space, and a tad bit less of the build up.

The ending didn't quite pull at my heartstrings, but the journey that these three men went on did. Their ordeal got to me, especially through Tom Hanks' character. It's overly long, but enjoyable.  \r\n\r\nIt's the true story of Apollo 13, the spacecraft flown by three astronauts not long after Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong with the ship. The three astronauts (Hanks, Bacon, Paxton) must try everything possible in order to survive the journey home.\r\n\r\nThere are some nail-biting scenes in this movie, addressing issues such as Carbon-Dioxide levels rising too high, and the temperature falling so low that the condensation turned to ice. The cinematography and the music also add a very exciting atmosphere to these scenes. It truly makes you feel like you're there with these men. Sometimes they had to hold their breath, and I found myself holding my breath with them.\r\n\r\nOne thing Apollo 13 has no shortage of is melodrama. Much of it is very touching, such as Hanks' character fantasizing about walking on the moon (something he soon learns that he will never do). What makes the movie so emotional is the thought that they will never return home. I was more sad in the middle of the film than I was when it was finished.\r\n\r\nAlthough I liked this film on many levels, it wasn't absolutely amazing. The special effects were no better than that of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). It's not that Apollo 13 had an uninteresting story, it's just that it was not enough to sustain suspense and emotion for over two hours. So yes, I was a little bored at times.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought it was a solid film. Sometimes it was cheesy and sweet, other times it was a nail-biting thriller. It's thoroughly enjoyable.",

The entire cast is what makes this movie work. \r\n\r\nThe special effects are done well, especially since none of the special effects were done with a computer. \r\n\r\nThe cast is unbelievable in this movie.

            "content": "A downfall to creating a film based off of well known true events is that the conclusion is spoiled, therefore, leaving little in the conclusion that is unexpected.  Therefore, these kinds of films tend to rely more on the journey to provide the emotional umph, then the actual conclusion.  When the film is made to be suspenseful, this doesn't always work so well.  Films like Valkyrie shows us how this can fail.  Films like Apollo 13 shows us how it can work.\n\nThree astronauts, named Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise, find themselves in a dangerous predicament when after blasting off into space, begin having extreme rocket malfunctions.  Problem after problem occurs, and things are seeming really, really bleak.  With just about everything going wrong, it's a frantic survival tale, where the three men are desperately fighting for their lives.\n\nDespite being based off of well known true events, Apollo 13 still provides a suspenseful ride.  Though the first half-hour or so is a bit slow, the pace quickly picks up quite a bit, and the film rarely feels long after that.  This is quite an accomplishment for a film that's nearly 2 and a half hours long.\n\nDespite being a highly suspenseful and exciting film, Apollo 13 is not what one might consider a \"joy ride.\"  The emotional aspect of the film keeps us in pain and sadness for the families waiting to hear whether their husbands and fathers will return from space alive.  And of course, worrying families aren't comforted by exaggerating media that are squeezing every last drop of suspense out of the already emotionally taxing situation.  By playing a more stressful and tragic game with the family's involvement, Apollo 13 becomes a more intelligent and thoughtful film than it might've been otherwise.\n\nThe families aren't the only stressful aspect the film plays from.  Back at Mission Control, the entire staff is frantically trying to find a way to guide the astronauts back home.  Going with little sleep and lots of coffee, each small victory is a reason for celebration, though there are no rests until the men are safely back.\n\nSolid acting further assists this.  Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton, as Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise respectively are very good in their roles, as is Ed Harris as the Apollo 13 Flight Director, Gene Kranz.  The standout here, however, is Jim's wife, Marilyn, played by Kathleen Quinlan.  She portrays a distraught and pained wife in a performance that we truly believe.  There's some deceptive depth in this role, and Quinlan nails it.\n\nThe visuals are quite nice.  While not particularly breathtaking, the effects look good, and they look real.  The zero gravity effects specifically are very good.  It's certainly a breath of fresh air from the often excessive CGI effects in film today. \n\nThe score, by James Horner, is good, but it's an interesting approach to the film.  While one might expect a film in space to have a much more grand score, James Horner composes a less loud and brassy score.  While there are moments of triumph in the music, they come less often then one might have expected.  Also, in moments of high tension (and there are several), Horner takes another interesting approach to the music.  Rather than composing pieces at higher tempos, these pieces are usually played at a slower speed, letting the onscreen action carry most of the tension.  Whether this is a plus or a minus is up to your own tastes.\n\nApollo 13 is a well made and well acted film.  Told with suspense and precision, this is a fine example of true event films done right.  Still, while there's not much here in the way of flaws (though some might argue that it's a bit repetitive), Apollo 13 also just misses being a truly great film.  It's certainly an enjoyable one, and making a 2 hour film endurable is an achievement in itself, but I couldn't help but wonder while I was watching Apollo 13, why I wasn't loving it.  The funny thing is now that I've seen the film, I still couldn't tell you.",

Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are the team of astronauts who are scheduled to fly to the moon as part of the Apollo 13 mission. But Mattingly is ruled out, on account of him being sick. They instead bring in Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) as the third member of their team. They blast off.\n\nAnd this movie is just getting started.\n\nNot much can be said about the masterpiece that is Apollo 13, because words won't be able to do it justice. It's that good. Hanks, Bacon, and Paxton put forth some of the best performances ever, and Sinise and Ed Harris as the mission control leader don't do a bad job, either. \n\nThe movie does such a great job of authenticity, which is the best thing I can say to explain why it's so good. We feel like this is perfectly legit, like this is exactly what happened, word for word. It seems plausible to us. Unlike the recently released Apollo 11, which was totally unrealistic and not well done, Apollo 13 seems like it could have been footage taken from the space shuttle by Lovell, Haise, and Swigert themselves.\n\nBottom Line: This mission was made possible using technology that can be found in today's iPhones. So why are we not flying to the moon everdyday nowadays? Because people aren't interested, it's become too routine. But Apollo 13, this flawless masterpiece, makes us look back on the idea and care about it",

Although anyone familiar with history knows the outcome from the very beginning, this movie still manages to be dramatic and intense, which is always an amazing accomplishment with true stories.  Not only is Hanks his usual great self, but he's also accompanied by stellar performances from the entire cast, which includes Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, and Gary Sinise.  The ending is so emotional and translates great on the big screen.  This movie is also topped off with a beautiful musical score.  5 stars.",

So now that they're in space and they have landed on the moon, an onboard explosion causes the power systems to go downhill and the oxygen begins to dwindle. It's up to the workers at NASA back at Earth to send oxygen back up there and rescue the three astronauts in order to get them back to Earth safely before anything else goes wrong. I'm one of those guys who find movies about astrology very interesting and this was no exception. If you watch the scenes in the film when they're in space, you can easily soak up the drama alone. The performances from our lead actors are amazingly believable, The story is solidly written and directed and I think most of all, it is the drama that soaks up the whole movie itself making this visual media pretty epic. This is a professional astrology movie where no cheesiness, goofiness, silliness nor stupidness is allowed. Apollo 13 just got a 10/10.",

There are several hitches in preparation but the takeoff is smooth, beginning a supposedly routine mission. However, after a malfunction the situation turns dire very fast and the men who looked forward to walking on the moon now must struggle just to get home. They make difficult decisions and Lovell keeps them level-headed while Houston scrambles to problem solve and bring them home.

It does not only stands out as one of the most produced drama in years, but with such a cast (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris) taken into such an intense plot, it's almost impossible not to fall in love with this movie in first sight. To begin, it has a really big name in direction, although barely recognised. Ron Howard is hated and praised, but in the film industry he is definately between Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorseses. In other words between the bosses. The first movie I saw from this man was The Grinch, the Jim Carrey version, another classic as this movie, only that they are absolutely different, of course. But something you can notist from Ron Howard, and you can see it in movies like Frost/Nixon or the Da Vinci saga, is that he really knows how to keep the tension. But of cours, 2 hours and 20 minutes are a lot of seconds to fill up with nail-bitting moments. Without violence but limited to problematic situations, this movie is interesting but gets heavy after some times. But the cast, amazing by the way, do their best to keep you in the movie, although is inevitable loosing some interest as it's a true story. Indeed, Apollo 13 is one of the best movies ever made because of its simplicity. It's a drama with no cheap shots, a thriller with no KA-BOOMS but almost a realistic experience of a trip to space, despite troubled, and how it was when americans still went to the moon. This, proud to say, it's a real space movie. Armageddon, meh, maybe too sticky. Apollo 18, yes, that space Paranormal Activity, is some crap to recycle. This movie however, is a clean, pure space movie as it should be. And even though its said to be a documentary (And it can perfectly fit as one) for me Apollo 13 is only awesome because it had some really tiny flaws that can barely be noticed on the splendour it gives away.",

The ENTIRE Saturn V launch sequence is created from scratch! You can see shots that are familiar to you (ie. the close-up of the boosters igniting and sucking in of the exhaust flames), as well as some incredible shots that would have been impossible during an actual launch (ie. what would it have been like if you could have a helicopter shot above the Saturn 5 as it rocketed passed you?). Every single shot was created by the Ron Howard's special effects team. The launch sequence is so good that Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin asked Ron Howard from what vault did he acquire what he thought was stock footage.\n\nWhat the viewer has to realize is that even though the plot turns play out like a typical Hollywood film, these events REALLY happened (including the panned scene where Marilyn Lovell's ring falls into the shower drain).

A lot of the dialogue is technical space stuff, but a good amount of it makes just enough sense to tell what's going on. Even though I already knew the ending, it was surprisingly emotional and that's one way to spot a good director; being able to pull a reaction from you even when you know what happens. I have seen better space movies, but the fact that this one is a true story makes it more important than others. Overall, Apollo 13 is a solid depiction of the 1970 crisis; solid performances all around and an emotional payoff at the end.",

Seeing the level of time management and problem solving that went into bringing those 3 guys home was wonderful to see.  \r\n\r\nI still get choked up during the final blackout scene.  the combination of intense drama, beautiful musical score and wonderful visual effects leaves you on the edge of your seat.

I think the crowning achievement of the movie, though, is making the audience feel the suspense and fear that the crew members of Apollo 13 felt even though we all know the ultimate outcome, and I think the director is to thank for that. All in all, I believe Apollo 13 is a piece of masterful film making that everyone deserves to see; I had been previously hesitant to watch it because I thought it might be boring, but after seeing it in its entirety, I can easily say it is one of the most thoroughly engaging and exciting films of the 90s, and an instant classic to boot.",

            "content": "I don't know much about politics or budget restraints, but if the work that NASA does can produce films like ``Apollo 13'' and its predecessor, ``The Right Stuff'', I'm all for keeping it around. The tenuous blend of technology and human spirit that these films celebrate is the closest thing to a man-made miracle that we have.\n``Apollo 13'' is a great achievement. Not only does it capture the look and feel of the early seventies- it educates and illustrates the accomplishment that the early Apollo missions were. Ron Howard's direction is near perfect; focusing and complimenting the natural drama of the events. So powerful is the contents of the story, that the subtlety of the direction can easily be overlooked, but given the scope of the film and the infinite number of directions that it could have taken, it's easy to see that Howard knew exactly what he wanted to concentrate on and how to best cover it.\nAs the name implies, the film covers the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission that launched on the 11th of April in 1970. Slated to go to the moon, the ship and its crew ran into serious trouble when an explosion occurred on the third day of the journey.\nThe film starts by reviewing a brief history of the Apollo program, from its inception through its set-backs right up to its seemingly routine nature at the time of the Odyssey mission. Far from dull, this background gets us into the mood of the late sixties, reminds us of the virtual new-ness of the space flight activity. Space shuttles take off routinely these days with little hoopla. We take it for granted. Undoubtedly too much so. By the time of the Apollo 13 mission ( a mere three years after man first set foot on the moon), the American public had already grown nonchalant about space travel. Yet the technology was definitely far from perfected.\nOne scene that elicits chuckles is a VIP tour that astronaut Jim Lovell is conducting for some Washington bureaucrats debating the value of continuing to fund an expensive space program. Talking of the great strides that have been made, Lovell attempts to impress them with a description of a computer system responsible for complex operations of the program that barely fills the space of an ordinary room.\nLooking back, it's hard to imagine that most of the public was still watching their favorite television programs on black and white sets. It's a poignant moment when the major networks (there were only three, if you recall) opt to ignore the astronauts live broadcast from space in favor of regular, rating-boosting sitcoms and programming. The apathy seems staggering as the crew continues its television feed, unaware of the last minute change.\nFrom the start, the mission appears plagued. A medical decision prompts a change in the crew two days prior to the launch. The intimacy that has developed amongst the members over the months of training is upset with the replacement by the back-up pilot. When the explosion occurs it robs the crew of its chance to land on the moon. Soon, the issue becomes ``Will the crew be able to get home?''. The odds are against it.\nThe command module has lost power and precious oxygen. The crew is forced to take haven in the lunar module. Designed to accommodate two for approximately 45 hours worth of work, it is forced to house all three of the men. This creates its own set of problems. In order to have sufficient power to enable a re-entry, the ship is forced to shut down all its systems. Soon, the capsule is near freezing. Next, the air purification system- designed to serve two- is unable to cleanse the CO2 from the air. Without a quick solution, the men will be incapacitated.\nThe amazing thing behind the entire story is that in spite of the hours of training, the millions of details and the myriad considerations of the mission planners, this accident made all of the preparations completely void. None of the problems or complications that the mission encountered had been anticipated. Even the make-shift solutions forced upon the men came accompanied with new sets of problems. Both the men in space and the support team on the ground were working from scratch; improvising from the materials on hand, fighting against the impossibility of the situation and the unbending restrictions of time. There was no allowance for error, no second chance.\n``Apollo 13'' stars Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise. The performances are good and certainly believable, but even so, the familiarity of the faces (especially Hanks') detracts slightly from the real-life knowledge of the scenario. Try as I might, it was hard not to see Tom up on the screen instead of astronaut Jim Lovell.\nWith some mild swearing of frustration, the film is rated PG-13. Though the rating will allow for younger children, the pacing and length of the film (2 1/2 hours) will make it difficult for all but the most space-happy youngsters to sit still for the duration. Be forewarned- Adults won't want to miss a minute of this exceptional film in dealing with fussy children.",

Factually accurate for the most part it avoids an overload of sentimentality and focuses on the crisis at hand... Three astronauts stranded in space with barely any hope of getting home. This story is told really well with 3 views of the unfolding incident, they being the astronauts point of view, mission control and their families'. There isn't really any stand-out performances here but rather a single solid collaboration of actors. Watching Apollo 13 also lead to other questions about life in the 60s and 70s such as fashion, technology and rampant smoking habits (lol). I didn't realise it was a gate-way film... LOL. I love this movie and we might even keep up the interest with the consequent HBO series From Earth To The Moon (produced by Howard & Hanks). Good stuff.",

        {
            "content": "Although I had watched it many times before, as it was an excellent depiction of the historical event, Apollo 13 was a film I was eager to see once again.\n\nWhile the impact of Apollo 13 decreases the more you've seen it, the general spirit of the film is all there regardless.\nThe two central themes in Apollo 13 seems to be the unprecedented disaster of space travel on the Apollo 13 mission and the patriotic heroism put into the mission by everyone determined to bring the astronauts back to earth safely. There is a lot of talking that goes on throughout the film's 140 minute running time and a slow pace too which may faze some, but it is truly a powerfully realistic film which captures the excellent visual spectacle of a space mission and the humane drama of the disaster that occurred.\nApollo 13 is an interesting change of form for director Ron Howard. The former actor from Happy Days has come such a long way since then and has directed films of very many genres, and Apollo 13 depicts him stepping into a scientific biographical story. The intense accuracy he puts into the story is incredible, both visually and in terms of how he handles the script.  His role as director is just perfect because he is able to give the film an atmosphere which is brilliantly intense and touching. But what he does visually is way more impressive. \nApollo 13 is loaded with extensive imagery. The scenery for the film is flawlessly convincing in how it sets up the film from the start, and then from there it just gets better. Once the Apollo 13 mission takes off, viewers get a sight for the incredible visual effects of the film. Everything depicting the space launch is done in extensive detail, and then from there is a plenty of strong scenes which depict the space voyage. The journey is a thoroughly convincing one which looks great and is captured with stellar atmospheric cinematography and edited at a steady pace. The sound effects are also powerfully realistic and edited into the audio plane at a good steady pace. The costumes for the characters are also great, so everything in Apollo 13 is captured with fine visual detail.\nWilliam Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert give the film a really good basis with its script because the dialogue in the film gives a lot for the actors to work with, and it in general uses a lot of historical accuracy to note many of the major and minor technical aspects of the mission. It is explained in a way that viewers are able to understand without degrading it from the sophistication of the real scientific language behind it all which makes the film a learning experience as well.\nAnd as a means of ensuring that Apollo 13 succeeds on a human level, the large cast all manage to deliver truly stellar performances.\nTom Hanks is easily a great casting choice for the lead role. His natural dramatic charisma and general charm make him a good lead in any film, and Apollo 13 is of course no exception. He commands the Apollo 13 ship with ease because he has the spirit of the leader and the ability to interact with the other cast members excellently, whether it be in direct contact with Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon or across a satellite speaker with the flight crew down on earth. Tom Hanks makes a great lead in Apollo 13 due to his natural patriotic heroism, and he leads the mission with gusto.\nKevin Bacon makes a powerful part in the film as well. You can tell that he gets the character deeply because he always has a sense of inner torment, largely based on his character's regret for undergoing the command which compromised the Apollo 13 mission. He adds that his character's determination to truly prove himself as an astronaut. His character's presence is dramatized well with underlying subtext being all there, and Kevin Bacon steps into the role with easy acting talent. You can really expect no less of him, his performance in Apollo 13 is just plain solid.\nBill Paxton always keeps himself tied into the atmosphere in Apollo 13. As the themes of the film become more intense, Bill Paxton works incredibly hard to ensure that the harsh reality of the environment in the Apollo 13 spacecraft is conveyed. He floats around at a fast speed while he delivers his lines with a true sense of fear which can only come from real emotion. Bill Paxton goes into the role and never lets up in a performance which is tense and emotionally strong, so he makes a welcome addition to the Apollo 13 flight crew.\nEd Harris is in top form again. He is one actor who has never let me down in a single film because what he brings to his roles are always impressive. In the case of Apollo 13, Ed Harris works to convey the heroism behind the people working down on earth to ensure the safe return of the Apollo 13. Every actor does their part, but none of them command the role as well as Ed Harris does. He fits the profile because he looks the part perfectly and his intense line delivery is just incredible. Ed Harris is 100% convincing in his role as Flight Director Gene Kranz because he flawlessly delivers every line with a sense that he genuinely understands every word of what he is saying, and so he brings an all new level of realism to the film during his scenes.\nGary Sinise delivers a fine supporting effort. It is easy to sympathise for him because his character Ken Mattingly missed out on a chance to participate in the flight through space which puts him into a melancholic state, only for him to be drastically brought back in as part of an emergency to save the crew on the ship. He is terrific in the part simply because he has a subtle sense of stoic sadness in him which is realistic without being melodramatic, and so his role shows him keeping his emotions in tact very well. Gary Sinise is really a welcome presence in Apollo 13, and it is terrific seeing him working alongside Tom Hanks once again.\nThe supporting performance of Clint Howard is also great. The actor has made an appearance in 17 of his brother Ron Howard's films to date, but he has never given it a finer performance than his role in Apollo 13. His role is small but pivotal, and he does a fine job in the role.\nKathleen Quinlan is also good. While her role in the story is mainly for its dramatization, she makes a sympathetic effort in the role which turns out effective.\n\nSo Apollo 13 is a slowly paced but excellently realistic depiction of the unforgettable historical mission which is well acted, technically excellent and acted with a large cast of great talent.",

Like all Howard's films, it's manipulative in a golly and gosh way, in a pat, slick,package.\n\nThe dialogue is all bluntly about the mission, with none of the indirect details that flesh out a good story and give the characters three-dimensions. \n\nThe actors are all good actors, but they act too much, in a stock, predigested way. There's no searching for the particular truth of the moment. Howard can direct a film, but he doesn't require his actors to discard their learned tricks and look deeper into themselves.\n\nThere's more drama and tension in listening to recordings of the actual flight, the almost bland, military precision of real people on the edge of survival, unrehearsed, as it is actually happening.\n\nI gave it three stars for its production values -- although given its big budget, this is the minimum to be expected from Hollywood these days. And then deducted a star for (1) the music, which was either hyper-emotional or cloying, and almost always intrusive, and (2) its absolutely false use of the sound of rocket engines in outer space -- where, of course, there is no air and therefore no sound. This last was inexcusable in a film that pretends to authenticity.",

It's shot beautifully, as most Ron Howard films are, and you get a good sense of how cold, dank, and alone the astronauts must have felt adrift in the cosmos. The music is a big part of what stirs your emotions throughout, especially during the re-entry sequence. \r\n\r\nFor my money, the best performance in the movie is Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, the flight director for the mission.

            "content": "[b][u]Review My Collection #17[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nIf there's one certainly in the world of cinema, it's that we love going to space.  A place few of us will see in our lifetime, film gives us a window to a mysterious world where gravity fails, stars shine bright and, no matter how hard you try, nobody can hear you scream.  Every imaginable genre has taken trips to the great beyond.  From Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s groundbreaking A Trip to the Moon to the surrealistic nightmare of 2001, filmmakers have been fascinated with the skies above since the beginning of the art form.  Hell, even Abbot and Costello went to Mars.  \r\n\r\nProblem was that space had always been situated in the realm of science fiction.  Fantasy tales of thunderous rockets, starship battles and grotesque aliens, nobody ever bothered to simply get it right.  Depict space travel as it really was for the brave men and women who stepped into a tiny capsule strapped to 800,000 pounds of rocket fuel and blasted into the heavens.  Not quite Wile E Coyote strapped to an Acme rocket, but close.  Luckily for us, director Ron Howard and star Tom Hanks had that a singular vision to bring the real life drama of space travel to the screen.  The result was 1995's Apollo 13, an emotionally stirring story of tragedy and triumph wrapped in the real life drama of a doomed NASA mission.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw this film in the late nineties, I had no clue of the real Apollo 13 mission.  My dad brought the VHS home one day, we popped it in and I was blown away.  The story tracks the strange set of circumstances that took the voyage of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and turned it into a fight for survival.  Not satisfied with simply tracking the mission, the movie also tells the story of Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), the astronaut left behind, the mission's gruff flight director, Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and Jim's wife (Kathleen Quinlan). The movie boasts an extraordinary accuracy in not only how they deal with the science, how they handle the relationships between the different players.  Simply put, the film feels real from performance to blast off.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks stars as the captain of the doomed vessel and you can tell he loves every minute of his portrayal.  A self-professed space nut to begin with, Hanks hurls himself into the role with surprising restraint, getting every beat of the eagle eyed captain down to a tee.  Harris is also noteworthy in the role of the flight director, giving a grounded and restrained performance.  The film also boasts the most accurate depictions of the science of space travel ever put to film.  From the inside of Mission Control, to the interiors of the spacecraft to the launch itself, Apollo 13 set a standard for space realism, a benchmark no film has exceeded since.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is treated with the same attention to detail, sometimes to the detriment of the film.  Side stories like Jim's wife losing her ring in the shower or the networks not running the crew's TV broadcast may come off as emotionally leading but actually took place in the real life events.  These scenes may come off cheesy to the viewer but they never dull the impact of the events that took place.  Viewers who are unaware of the actual story may find the suspense artificially enhanced but the effect is downright riveting.  Every element of the movie, from the sound design to the score, are all perfectly pitched to heighten the drama and creating genuine suspense.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the outset of this review, if space movies are a dime a dozen, Apollo 13 is the statistical outlier.  While it may not have any standout performances, the film is a well-mixed combination of acting and directing.  Standing on the bedrock of historical accuracy and providing more than enough suspense, Apollo 13 is an entertaining docudrama that holds up even today.  Suffice to say, when NASA astronauts not only approve the production but use scenes from the film for historical purposes, you know you got it right.  A fine film in nearly every regard.\r\n\r\n[url=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/808326/blogs/?id=701434\"]**Check out my RT blog entitled \"Review My Collection\" for the rest of the series!!**[/url]",

Ed Harris was excellent as the flight director as was Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly. Great pacing by Ron Howard and one of the best films made about the space program.",

My first reactions were absolute amazement and real shock-and-awe to this huge space landscape that they had created for the movie. It doesn't take us very long to fall in love with the way the movie was made, directed, written or shot. \nI would have to group this movie with the timeless classics category of movies made in and around the 90s. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that this movie deserved every bit of the high ratings and huge favor that it has received. \n\nBottom line; When it's on TNT make sure you watch it!

Hank's turn as Jim Lovell keeps us assured that space travel is always a gamble, and if something does go wrong, you'd want him trying to keep the keel even.  For my money, it's Ed Harris as NASA flight director Gene Krantz that takes the film to another level.  We are always convinced that he was going to be sure that the NASA flight crew would leave no stone unturned when trying to find a solution that will only result in getting our astronauts home.  \"Dammit, I don't want another estimate!

The movie is about the 3rd attempt of America to land on the moon and how it failed to reach its original destination and still became a phenomenon. As the movie goes on it reveals a lot more than just the journey. It shows the human kind can overcome any odd if they truly want to. It also shows how determination is superior than the problem. The Movie is very well put together. Every scene shows more than what one will expect. This is one of those movie that one can say after seeing\" yes that was a good one\"",

That's not limited to just the actual astronauts: the NASA crew on Earth, as well as the families of the astronauts, all have a good amount of screentime, and all three of these points-of-view are well developed for the most part. The astronaut crew is obviously the most developed, and the family is probably the least developed, but the focus on the characters is admirable to say the least. Tom Hanks is as great as ever, and Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Ed Harris all do well alongside him. It's not just a character-driven movie though: seeing as the film deals with space travel, it comes with visual spectacle that is absolutely stunning.

He's got the stylistic distinctiveness of a Big Mac, and the melodramatic touch of an elephant, but when he sticks to the technogeek talk of the astronauts and their ground crew, the movie becomes compelling. Then he cuts to Kathleen Quinlan pining away back on Earth or to a CGI shot so flat and blatantly fake my teeth grind again. Almost, not quite--a tolerable two plus hours.",

            "content": "Apollo 13 is the ultimate subtle film, a film that knows it's a space film, but it doesn't shove it in our faces. It's entertaining, well written, well acted, and just an awesome film in general. Ron Howard really shows us a great film, filled with everything we could ask for, with the side effect of a few minor flaws here and there. Ever since then, plenty of space films tried to copy it's formula, but none of them had the substance and charisma that this film has. It makes the film feel not as \"Based on a True Story\" but as if you're actually ON Apollo 13 with these characters, feeling the suspense all the way. It's just very memorable and very cool. The story is basically a recreation of the Apollo 13 moon mission, which ended up failing because of technical error. It really doesn't lead to any surprises or uncertainty, but those don't seem as necessarily as, for the most part, this is a calm film, no real action or scares, just some suspense. The characters were... pretty good. The main character, Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, is a great character, and so is his wife, but the two other pilots, although likable, are not focused on much. It's not THAT big a problem, as it's intentions was to follow the main character, the other 2 characters, although also likable, aren't the main focus. However, it would be nice to know more about the other 2 characters, but we do learn a bit about their personalities during the actual mission. The acting was also good. Tom Hanks was not really disguising himself as anyone, he wasn't Forrest Gump or Woody, he was pretty much just being himself, and I actually respect him for that, as he did do a good job in this film. Also, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan all did great. Now, usually I don't discuss this in great detail, but I feel I must talk about the special effects, and in my opinion, they were very well done. Sure, some parts, it was completely obvious the special effects were CGI, but for most of the movie, they looked really cool, almost like they were really there. They aren't the best special effects ever, but for the time, they must have looked OUTSTANDING. Now, for my favorite part of the review, \"The Best and Worst of Apollo 13\". The best part of this movie... Even though I'm tempted to say the cinematography, I'll have to say the atmosphere. Why you ask? Well, let me give an example: When the 3 characters are escaping the earths atmosphere and rocketing into space, you FEEL as if the characters are actually blasting into space, it makes the film seem more like an experience than just a film. The worst thing about this film is probably the other two main characters. Like I said, they're likable and all, but most of the focus seems to be on Hanks, which is OK, but in the end, you barely felt like you got to know the other two, so that got me a little angry, but to tell you the truth, the rest of the movie was pretty awesome. I really enjoyed it for the execution of the story, the effects, and of course, the experience itself. Also, in my opinion, this is one of the best disaster films of all time, even surpassing Titanic! So overall, this is an excellent film, well worthy of a watch. 5/5.",

            "content": "My consensus on Apollo 13 is really easy to confirm; it was great. It was near amazing, and nothing close to  bad, it was just great. It had problems here and there, and it could've been more of a story, but simply, it's not that bad. The amazing thing is that this all in the film really happened, and none of it was fake. It surprises you at every turn, with scary events, and you highly doubt this happened on the real mission, but when you research the Apollo 13 flight, the movie follows exactly the facts. And that is why I'm giving this film a 70%.\r\n   \r\nI'm not really gonna get into the plot of this whole film, for it just really follows the adventure of astronauts who head off into a mission to the moon, and not all really goes as planned.\r\n   \r\nThe acting within this film was brilliant. With Tom Hanks as the lead actor, Ed Harris as a supporting actor, and Kevin Bacon as another supporting actor, no one should be surprised at the amazing capabilities this team brought to the screen. Personally, my favorite actor was Kevin Bacon. He brought to his character a kind of personality no other one had. He was at the same time fearful, but yet determined to keep his fear contained and prove to the rest of the team that he had potential within this mission. Tom Hanks played his role surprisingly well, for I wouldn't have ever expected him to play a part such as this. I liked the leadership and courage he brought to his character, but he's Tom Hanks, so it really wasn't anything new for him. Ed Harris brought a nice touch to the film, a kind of energetic feel. Not sure if he should've been nominated for his Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor, but I really didn't pay much attention to him at times he might've done his best acting, so I'm simply not sure. Overall, though, acting was brilliant.\r\n   \r\nThe editing and cinematography were one for the books. The scenes they shot at times on Earth were as good as the scenes they shot in space. I liked this certain aspect of the film for the fact that most sci-fi space films heavily place their best cinematography in space, but in this film they had great cinematography throughout, and I really enjoyed that. The lighting was also nice, for it was accurate with space lighting, which some sci-fi movies don't usually seem to get right.\r\n   \r\nThe score for this film was truly American and inspiring. It is ranked as a top 15 favorite of mine. The work of the violins and the drums during this score were some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The vocalization pieces were the best I've ever heard in a sci-fi film, and this is best sci-fi score I've heard since Star Wars. I advise everyone to check it out on YouTube.\r\n   \r\nBut there were a couple of things in the film that bothered me. 1) To most people, this film seemed to be a thriller. While it was nail-biting at a few parts, I couldn't really consider this to be one a thriller. It wasn't fast paced enough, and the suspense at times wasn't built up as high as it should've been to make the film seem thrilling (although I do have to give credit to a part in this film in which I held my breath for quite a long time). 2) Already knew the ending. The thing with historical adventures, and especially films such as space missions, is that most people know how things end up. Meaning, I already knew what happened to the Apollo 13 even before I heard about this film, and when watching this movie, the conclusion was already in my head. I can't blame anyone about this, but I'm pretty sure for people like me, who already knew how things were gonna go, they really just couldn't enjoy the film as much. And 3) there were a lot of unnecessary scenes. If you guys have read my reviews, then you guys know I HATE scenes that don't get the film anywhere. If a car stops on a road in a movie, and all the character does is cuss once saying something like \"D*mn it\", then that is an unnecessary scene. And there were plenty of them in this film. Who needs to see kinds of scenes with NO character development, NO commencing with the plot, NO humor, NO drama, NO suspense etc. and all we get is a stupid 10 second scene just wasting film time and MY time? Apollo 13 really irritated me with that.\r\n  \r\n All in all, though, I have to say Apollo 13 was a nice win for me. The flaws I stated were really the only downside, but the movie proved to be really emotionally touching and exciting and I plan on watching it again soon. I want everyone to check it out if they're in a mood for a historical drama, and please, if you still don't understand why I gave this film 70%, please visit this link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/935623/blogs/?id=703501\r\n\r\nThanks!",

            "content": "Throughout his career, Ron Howard has always been somewhat underestimated as a director. His background on Happy Days and his love of sentimental storylines have led many people to brand him as 'Spielberg-lite', trying to pack the same emotional punches of his more famous colleague but without having the same level of imagination to pull it off. While Howard has made a number of big mis-steps in his career (The Da Vinci Code being one of the most egregious), his filmography as a whole suggests a man of many talents and interests who has never quite got the credit that he deserves.\n\nMore than any other film in his back catalogue, Apollo 13 is the film which should silence doubters about Howard's credibility as a director. It pulls off a really difficult trick, namely taking a story whose famous characteristic is its ending and making it tense and dramatic both for people who know the story backwards and those coming to it the very first time. Howard's direction is top-notch and his attention to detail in both the script and the visuals has ensured that the film still holds together after 23 years. It remains the gold standard for space-set dramas, and may even be Howard's best work behind the camera.\n\nOne of the big issues which all period dramas have to deal with is capturing the period setting in a believable way. You can't just put a character in a miniskirt with The Beatles in the background and expect us to believe that it's the 1960s; instead, you have to focus on the little details, giving the audience enough clues to trust that the setting is accurate without the film becoming solely about fashions and popular culture. This is particularly difficult when you're dealing with an important historical event with plentiful archive footage or old news reports available. The temptation is to just plaster Walter Cronkite and his ilk all over the screen whenever an exposition dump is needed, but as George Clooney found on Good Night and Good Luck (with the footage of Joseph McCarthy), this can jar with an audience - too much realism can actually take them out of the action.\n\nApollo 13 is one of the few Hollywood films (at least in this period) which manages to pull this off. Much of the old footage which is used generally repeats information we already known in a slightly different way, but it is well-integrated through its timing and positioning in the plot. Rather than being shoved in front of an old TV screen and sitting through a few seconds of Dick Cavett, these clips are only rolled out once we feel invested in the characters, and feel like we are watching alongside them. The other period touches - including the cars and the costumes - all feel well-researched but don't draw attention to themselves, and even the most distinctive elements (like Ed Harris' white waistcoat) are handled very diligently.\n\nIn approaching its subject matter, Apollo 13 is less of a Hollywood blockbuster and more of a high-tech cousin of All The President's Men. Like Alan J. Pakula on that film, Howard is starting on the basis that the audience already knows something about the outcome of the real-life event - respectively the resignation of Richard Nixon and all three Apollo 13 astronauts making it back to Earth. And like Pakula, he flatters the audience, letting them figure things out in the build-up to the main event. They walk into the film invested on an intellectual level, and come out with an emotional bond as well as having learned more about an interesting subject.\n\nWhere All The President's Men created tension through conflicting information and the political pressure being put on Woodward and Bernstein, Apollo 13 plants small seeds of doubt about the mission in the audience's mind. Some of these seeds are played for laughs, with the astronauts joking about taking a pig into space to combat the bad luck of the number 13. But other scenes are equally effective at making us feel uneasy about the fortunes of Jim Lovell and his crew. Individually, Marilyn losing her wedding ring in the shower or Ken Mattingly getting the measles wouldn't be enough to get us worried - we might write them off entirely, or at least dismiss them as not too significant. But Howard structures these moments as milestones on the countdown to disaster; because we don't pick up on everything the first time round, the pay-off still comes as a surprise. \n\nThis slow, ominous build-up is complimented by the way in which the astronauts' mission is contextualised. Where a more histrionic film would have built this up as 'the most important moon mission since Apollo 11' or other such nonsense, Howard is keen to point out the public's waning interest in the US space programme in 1970. This is all done with subtle hints, whether it's Marilyn mentioning she might not come to the launch, her daughter being more bothered about The Beatles breaking up, or the TV stations not showing Lovell's broadcast live (in an exchange reminiscent of the ratings speech in Capricorn One). The films taps into the idea that people only care about things when they go horribly wrong - a view which seems all the more biting in today's car-crash celebrity culture.\n\nThe scenes in space are masterful on three levels. Firstly, they are a mechanical marvel - before Gravity came along, this vied with 2001: A Space Odyssey as the most realistic depiction of weightlessness in cinema. By recreating weightlessness through hundreds of parabola flights, shooting just 30 seconds at a time, Howard gives Tom Hanks et al the chance to relax into their roles which they wouldn't get from being winched around in harnesses or jumping around against green-screen. His choice of camera angles is superb: because shooting could take place on any angle and would drift around at will, we feel like an active, curious observer, allowing things to unfold more naturally than if we were rooted to the spot.  Throw in the excellent special effects and cinematography by John Carpenter's long-time collaborator Dean Cundey, and you have one smashing shot after another.\n\nSecondly, Apollo 13 is an argument for being able to maintain tension without losing accuracy, and vice versa. Screenwriters William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert stuck as closely to the mission transcripts as possible - something which adds realism without the film ever becoming tedious. A few creative liberties are taken, including the film's most famous line - Jim Lovell actually said: \"Houston, we've had a problem\". But it never feels like the film is labouring to be accurate merely out of any sense of duty to NASA purists. Howard is determined to get things as right as possible, while maintaining a lightness of touch and a populist approach so that we always understand and care about what is happening, even when the jargon starts flowing.\n\nThirdly, the scenes in space see Howard and the script stretching their narrative muscles a little. In amidst all the procedural dialogue and the individual races against time, we get a number of touching fantasy sequences which use outer space to focus on inner space, as all proper science fiction should. In one such sequence, Tom Hanks imagines himself walking on the moon; in a scene reminiscent of The Ninth Configuration, Howard contrasts the silent awe of the moon's surface with the quiet despair on Lovell's face from inside the lunar module. It's a beautiful moment which expresses Howard's confidence in himself, the material and the actors who are bringing it to life.\n\nThe performances in Apollo 13 are excellent across the board. Following back-to-back Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks continues to embody the likeable American everyman even in the most extraordinary of circumstances. He is totally believable as Jim Lovell, and is complimented beautifully by his co-stars Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, who both give the best performances of their respective careers. On the ground Ed Harris remains eternally underrated as flight director Gene Kranz, and there is a very fine supporting performance by Gary Sinise, who would collaborate with Hanks again on The Green Mile.\n\nThe only real mis-steps in Apollo 13 are those which pander to Hollywood's expectations, either in the stakes of the mission or attempts to lighten the mood. The scene with the grandmother and the Apollo 11 astronauts feels forced and over-played, though it is at least brief enough not to throw us out of the picture. More problematic is the argument between Bacon and Paxton's characters - something which didn't happen in real life and which comes across as manufactured. There is enough tension in these scenes without adding more into the mix, and while the film does get over it quickly, it could have just as easily been cut without harming anything.\n\nApollo 13 is a great docudrama which remains a standard to which all future historical dramas should aspire. Howard directs with confidence and aplomb to wring out all the tension he can without it feeling contrived, bolstered by a very fine script, great performances from his three leading men and visuals which are both technically superb and deeply involving. It is a very hard film to dislike and a hard act to follow for all involved.",

So one may think going in that simply knowing the outcome makes the film somewhat anti-climactic, but I'm glad to say that this is simply not the case.  Ron Howard does a fantastic job directing one of his finest films, and the tension he builds from start to finish is absolutely amazing.\r\nApollo 13 is about astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert and their near fatal mission to the moon, but the film also focuses on the effect this has on the people back on Earth.  \r\nAfter an explosion causes the ship to rapidly lose power, mission control in Houston has to devise a way to keep the 3 men alive long enough for re-entry and hope they survive it, as well as several days on a cold ship with limited resources.  Much skill and improvisation is required in this task, and the way we watch how taxing it is on the men below is riveting.  This is especially true with Ed Harris' character, Gene Krantz.  I have to say that despite acting alongside talents like Tom Hanks, Gary Senise, Bill Paxton, and many others, I believe Harris' performance to be the best of the film.  His unforgettable line \"We've never lost an American in space.  We're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.  Failure is not an option!\" is filled with such determination and desperation, and it really is a great example of how he plays the role.  His reaction at the end is that he is overwhelmed, and one can't help but feel it for him too.\r\nThe film also focuses on the families at home, waiting, praying and hoping that their men come back alive.  Kathleen Quinlan does an excellent job as Jim Lovell's wife, and her determination to hope against the odds is well played.\r\nA film like this wouldn't work well unless the payoff at the end was good.  Like I mentioned before, anyone who knows the history of the flight knows the men returned home safely, but how well this moment was filmed would be crucial to its overall impact.  Thankfully, it isn't just good, it's perfect.  Howard keeps us waiting and waiting, watching as the hope begins to drain from the faces of those who love and/or care for the men.  But then the image of the heat shield falling and the parachutes opening makes our hearts leap, until those wonderful words \"Hello, Houston.  This is Odyssey.  It's good to see you again.\" sound out and emotions erupt with joy.  The scene is beautiful, and it brings me to tears every single time I watch it.\r\nIf you haven't seen this film yet, I urge you to do so.  It is a masterful tale of perserverance despite enormous obstacles, and one of the most emotionally satisfying films I've had the pleasure to see.  Wonderfully filmed and wonderfully acted, Apollo 13 is a masterpiece.",

Well,pretty much because it makes a lot of money,but I'll give Apollo 13 one thing Titanic lacks.The fact it follows it's story much better than Titanic,and is a lot more interesting for me.Now,of course,let's just get to the review and endless praise.\r\n\r\nThe plot is,as I said,about the Apollo 13 mission.Now,other than that.Now,it's extremely well written,and very moving,gripping,saddening.Despite knowing they survive,it's really sad and while not tear jerking,and the fact I'm not one who cries during a movie,unless an obnoxious tear jerkier,this still gets at least one sniffle....and a tear.Moving on,the movie is written extremely well,it's very dramatic,and really well paced.This is also a pretty long movie,nearly two and a half hours long.I really don't like pure drama,and for a movie to engage me this well,and be that long,it's pretty surprising (for me).The accuracy of the movie is flawed,but most of it is needed.The line \"Houston,we got a problem.\" is needed,as the actual spoken line would imply this is taking place in the past,and not the present: \"Houston,we've had a problem.\".Over all,the plot is amazing all around,and extremely well written.I know there are other inaccuracies,but most are small for me.\r\n\r\nThe acting is amazingly well done,and Tom Hanks is brilliant in here.I give a lot of credit to Bill Paxton too,as I usually don't like him (especially after Twister).Kevin Bacon is great too.The rest of the cast does an incredible as well,and pretty much everyone is perfectly casted.The portrayal's of the crew aboard the ship is extremely good,and feels genuine enough that it seems like the actual crew is portraying themselves.The delivery of the dialogue is excellent,with the occasional exception of the boring (if you seen Titanic,you know what I'm talking about) scenes,that are rare for me.I find those moments to come more in the middle of the beginning of the movie,so at least they get it out of the way.The best acting comes in the middle of the movie,when everything is pretty much established.It's by that point the acting is at it's maximum,and never ceases to amaze me.Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances out there,and pretty much gives the movie more and more strength each time he speaks.Over all,the acting was amazing.Simple as that.\r\n\r\nAttempting to think of what to use in the place of the minority for me in a movie,it was difficult.Pretty much,I can praise the effects and the suspense,and the fact the inaccuracies aren't noticeable for me much.But,none the less,I eventually decided to praise the movies very impressive zero gravity,rather than harnesses and strings.It makes the movie,once again,feel really...real.I actually find it unique looking,and probably one of the most interesting-looking.....things in movies I've seen.I can't tell what else to say,but it really impresses me when I look at it,and makes me jealous.I wanna be in a zero-gravity environment,and fly around.Of course,the negative effects of zero-gravity really suck (The ability to watch is pretty much gone,due to your legs becoming numb,and you pretty much are \"crippled\" for a while).Look,aside from that,there isn't much to critique the minority for me.So I picked something unique for me,and that's filming  in zero-gravity.Though it became something different.\r\n\r\nThe directing by Ron Howard is fantastic,and the movie feels quite stylish and very claustrophobic,yet wide open.Which,in the movies case,makes it quite more suspenseful,despite knowing the events (if you do).I also give Howard a lot of credit for not holding back,by making this is as intense as he could.Despite a PG rating,this really feels more like it's pushing an R rating in the intensity level none the less.Hey! It's Saw for the kiddies! Watch a man almost die in the vacuum of space! Watch an event that had national schools close! The look of a traumatized kid would probably fit a few theaters,much like Gremlins,but I'm not one of argue over the movie rating system back then (Though I can today,with Horror movies).Aside from the rating system,for some stupid reason,Howard's stylish and very intense atmosphere,combined with Tom Hanks' amazing acting (I won't bring up the failure of The Davinci Code),makes Apollo 13 a winner within the first 20 minutes.As the movie gets to the really suspenseful and dramatic area of the replacing of the blown Oxygen tank,that's when the directing and acting become insanely good,and become an amazingly done cinematic achievement.Bottom line (or topping line for this movie),Apollo 13 deserves a pure gold medal in the directorial department.\r\n\r\nThere are no characters for a movie like this.Much like United 93,I won't criticize real human beings.So,I'll tell of the portrayal.I already said that the way the acting is,it feels like they're all being played by the real people who where in the Apollo 13 mission.I truly find that a strong point for this.Now,side by side,of course,there may be differences,but I don't know since I don't know the people who where in the mission.I truly haven't got anything else to say because,truthfully,Apollo 13 seems to do a great job of keeping in tune in with the real people.Now,maybe I'm wrong (of course I am),but from my knowledge and crappy memory,This does seem like a great portrayal of everyone who was involved in the Apollo 13 mission.I truly find it a great representation of them all,and for all the right reasons.The fact they nearly sacrificed themselves for there fellow astronauts isn't an insult as a few might think.I really find that Tom Hanks,and everyone else did a fantastic job making them more like heroes,and less like,in the hands of another writer,director,and actors,lunatics (I say that because,rest assured,that would have happened in the hands of others).Over all,it's the combined efforts of everyone involved in here that makes the characters come to life.They've been done a lot of justice in the movie,which makes me happy to see.\r\n\r\nIf anything has made Apollo 13 famous,aside from it being one of the greatest movies out there in my honest opinion,it's the dialogue.It is phenomenal,it is magnificent,it is some of the best dialogue in a movie.The movies most famous line,for most,is when Tom Hanks states \"Houston,we have a problem.\".I already said the inaccuracies here,and the fact it's required to make it so the movie takes place in the present,and not the past (so it doesn't become an inaccurate documentary).I consider my favorite line in the entire movie to be a line I should go by,and probably one of the greatest lines in a movie I've ever seen: \"Failure is not an option.\".That was never actually said in real life,it was made up by Ron Howard.Even then,it's one of the greatest lines I've ever heard in a movie.Enough quoting,I really consider Apollo 13.As for the development of the \"characters\",it's brilliantly done,and delivered,and shown,really well.Bringing the characters to life even more.It's another strength as to why the characters feel even more life,pretty much making the on screen characters who they are in real life.I will state that,in the beginning,it feels a little boring.If I compare it to the rest of the movie,it's over shadowed to the point it's gone.I'd consider the first five minutes boring,if only because it's pretty much just credits.Afterwords,it vanishes.I'd say that's pretty much worthy of fast forwarding,if you've got some prior knowledge (as I do,for the most part),of the event that occurred,or have researched the astronauts involved in the Apollo 13 mission.To sum things up though,the dialogue is brilliantly done,and the development makes the movies characters some of the most well done in a movie I've seen.\r\n\r\nOver all,Apollo 13 is a magnificently done,brilliantly directed,amazingly acted,and phenomenally written movie.If you haven't seen it,I seriously recommend watching it.If you don't like it,then oh well.This movie succeeds in every department for me,and is virtually flawless,even in the first five or so minutes.Slow pacing for five minutes still makes it engaging,as slowly building suspense works better than rushing,since then everything is as sloppy as a two year old's drawing of a criminal who tried to steal something.Apollo 13 does the smart thing by slowly building it to one of the most amazingly done sequences in a movie out there (At least in the real/true event sub-genre).It's a dramatic and amazingly well told story about one of the most close encounters with space mission out there.It's a pretty accurate movie to,so it makes for something interesting,though inaccuracies are still in here,so it's not a pure,factual basis.But aside from any of that,and as a stand alone movie,Apollo 13 scores a 10/10.With the factual basis,it's rating does not change.Not even a billionth of a point.",

            "content": "It seems the easy way out to view \"Apollo 13\" as an allegory for verifiable American suspension, but it's hard to ignore when the entire movie so clearly emphasizes the pursuit of happiness being found in a space journey that stood for so much more. Then again, that's pretty much what Howard is going for, and you can't strike him down for it. Imagine the huge task it must have been to capture the 1970 U.S. lunar mission, and the added bonus of that flight taking place during a series of historical comeuppances which wherein held the peak of nationwide positivity.\n\nTom Hanks plays Jim Lovell, a loving husband and father who's truly psyched to have his kid get the chance to watch him wave from the stars. Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert and Bill Paxton Fred Haise, guys without a ball and chain to question their accompaniment on the Apollo 13 commission. The doll with strings holding him back comes in the shape of Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, whose measles scare keeps him grounded like a growly Vietnam vet without the use of his legs or something. There isn't much depth to any of these characters, which explains my hesitation to name names of the central protagonist whom we the audience are meant to attach to. The real swoon of \"Apollo 13\" is the importance of the undertaking, and Lovell, Haise, and Swigert's persistence to get back home when their ship loses steam mid-air. They radio Houston, Texas for comfort and support from the likes of NASA flight commander Gene Kranz (a bored Ed Harris), concerned mostly with protecting his stellar rep.\n\nAgain, the united allegory is obscure enough, because \"Apollo 13\" is a pretty simple movie. That doesn't mean that when our boys swim gravity afresh it's any less of a genuine inspiration, though. And for all its novelty Howard's film doesn't make a referential chuckle at Apollo's one-liner of oncoming disaster (and even the eventual Beatles break-up, which is dismissively mentioned early in the film.) Incredibly entertaining, the movie might best be read as three men pressured to finish what they started and act calm while doing it, not so much because of their legitimate friendship but because they feel a moral obligation to. The later responsibility of the Apollo 13 operation didn't involve hyper-kinetic wizardry, but it couldn't have been completed without the cooperation of planetary parallels that with revolving drinks of coffee were asked to try, try again.",

I believe however, that without such a fine cast that my care for the crew would have been weakened, Tom Hanks, puts on one of his finest performances in his career, his ambitious pilot whose dreams are snatched from his grasp is incredible and the supporting cast also provide added momentum to the film. Gary Sinisie, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon all add something different to the film.

I also felt that Ron Howard did a tremendous job directing this movie. This was a true cinematic success. My favourite scene was the launch (of course). I will only say that because I watch the special features and saw how the shot that scene. The simulated an explosion of the base of the rocket and the did CGI for the rest. The director of Photography for this movie put the camera in positions that are truly breath taking. The plot was also entertaining. It kept me emotionally and physically interested for all 2 hours.

            "content": "Along with Backdraft, Apollo 13 is one of Ron Howards ultimate best films. The film chronicles the failed mission to the moon and the ensuing rescue attempt to bring them home. A film that is both spectacular and powerful, Apollo 13 is a superbly crafted drama film.  One of things that Apollo 13 does very well is building up the tension. Obviously we all know that the astronauts came back home safely,  but still there always is a feeling of tension going on throughout the film from the point where theres an explosion on board the spacecraft to the safe landing. Every time I watch Apollo 13, I get that same feeling. Ron Howard's brilliant directing  makes this possible, and you always get that same feeling every time you watch it. Ron Howard has assembled a great cast of actors to portray the astronauts. Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton plays Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon plays Jack Sigert. They play the Apollo 13 astronaut with much respect to the real astronauts who flew the near fatal mission. Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, the original Command module pilot. Mattingly still plays a vital role in the story as he tries to find a way to get as much power from the crafts battery to restart the craft.  Ron Howard strips away the traditional way of telling a story big Hollywood overtones. Instead, Howard tells the story of Apollo 13 like it was using fact instead of fiction. The film is very technical and rich in detail. Every aspect of the story has been covered with tremendous respect from the real life incident.   Apollo 13 is a well acted, well told and well directed drama film. This is without a doubt Ron Howards best film.  A powerful drama film, Apollo 13 tells a story about a failed mission, but also that it was a success due to the fact that they all came back safe. This is a film that has definitely aged well, and doesn't look dated whatsoever.  A fine masterful film, Apollo 13 is a must see film, and what I appreciate the most about the film is that they didn't try to romanticize the story sort of like Titanic, they told it like fact and stayed true to the historical background of the film. The film is not cliche trite or boring. Apollo 13 remains a solid historical film that tells it like is and doesn't use a made up story to make the film seem emotionally charged. If you must watch one Ron Howard film, make it Apollo 13.",

I can't really criticise the characters for being uninteresting, because these are real people. It sounds like I hate the film, but I do have things about it that I love.

An intensely realistic retelling of the doomed spacecraft, and how the dedication and skill from all turned a near tragedy into a human triumph.  Apollo 13 will boost your pulse, raise your hair, and give you goosebumps all at the same time.  It's a super tense thrill ride that's filled to the brim with suspense and special effects.  The set design and cinematography are astounding, Howard and company literally brought the 1960's back to life again.  The cockpits of the spacecraft were stunningly brought back to life.  Spectacular movie making, a cinematic masterpiece that will move in ways that only the best films do.  A visceral look back to those tense few days where crew and personnel alike worked to the point of exhaustion to bring this spacecraft and it's crew home.\n        Ron Howard put together an all-star cast for this one, Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell masterfully.  Hanks' talent never ceases to completely amaze me.  Bill Paxton in a great role as Fred Haize.  It also features Kevin Bacon in a brilliant role as Jack Swigert.  Gary Sinise is also great in his role as Ken Mattingly- the astronaut that got snubbed from the mission.  For me it was Ed Harris, who plays fight director Gene Kranz, that stole the show in this film.  He is legendary in a role that demanded intense emotion and patience.  A simply steller cast that couldn't get any better.\n         Apollo 13 throws you straight into the heart of the failed mission, it's a deep look into the ever-enduring human spirit.  Against overwhelming odds these men never gave up, it's breathtaking, the courage these men showed exemplifies the human spirit.  It's great to see a movie that's absolutely true, capture the emotion from all involved so well.  A classic masterpiece that won't be matched, it's simply too remarkable.",

It's also one of Howard's best efforts in creating tension. You know they're going to get back all right, but the obstacles keep coming, and you really feel the relief when they're safe. An excellent job. \n\nInteresting to note all the actual weightless footage used, courtesy of the training aircraft, and the meticulous detail put into the film.

The special effects in the film are truly amazing, having been nominated for best visual effects at the Oscars. Apollo 13 is one film that cannot be missed by any American.

            "content": "Ron Howard has made an excellent docu-drama based on the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon landing mission which suffered serious mechanical problems and the very real threat of not making it home. Howard has to take all the credit for sticking to what really happened and not trying to over dramatise the true events of the mission. It never gets too patriotic and overly emotional; it's just a great account of one of NASA's most disastrous missions.\n\nThe Apollo 13 mission suffered an explosion after a routine stirring of the oxygen tanks, which left the three man crew, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, in a serious fight for their lives. It took the endurance of the crew and the help of hundreds of people in mission control to get them back safely. The cast is excellent, Tom Hanks, Kevin bacon, Bill Paxton and Gary Sinise or on top form but it's Ed Harris, as the Mission Control Chief, that steals the show with a brilliant performance. The effects are top notch, even the CGI effects for the Rocket Launch look excellent and better than many of today?s films which is quite an achievement given this film was made in 1995. There is plenty of actual footage from the event interspersed with the films footage. The pace is perfect which keeps the tension levels high throughout. The only real downfall of the film, which ironically is not the film makers fault, is that we can only feel so much tension at the situations as we already know that the crew all made it back safely. Huge praise has to be given to Howard for managing to make the film so gripping given its background.\n\nApollo 13 really is an inspirational and excellently made film with pure entertainment throughout.",

I being The Nerd. Not AVGN however.\r\n\r\nThis movie was fantastic. Even though I personally don't believe that the Apollo missions were real, this movie is God D@m real!!!! First, it bugs me that Tom Hanks looks like Dan Akroid. Second, it bugs me that WWE would name a stupid wrestler (not to say wrestlers are stupid,) after one great Astronaut. Thirdly, this movie makes you feel like your  there. The acting and visuals are so impressive, they give you the feeling of what it would be like in there in space.\r\n\r\nThe director was OBVIOUSLY extremely smart. He puts every shot into thought, something as smart as I get I will never have the patients to do. The scriptwriter went above and beyond with only one problem: The movie either feels long or is to long, took me two days to watch this film. The producer didn't spare any expense he gave them the opprotunity, and the editor does things exactly right. The slashers who made this movie are fantastic.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that they tell the story of Apollo 13 and not 12 or 1, that was not typical. They also don't recreat any transmissions, only scenes. What I mean is that they use real television broadcasts from 1970. Again, the acting is awesome, it makes you feel like you know these guys. Even as this is based off real life, it took a good director to recognize the irony and drama that went into this story.\r\n\r\nHeck. what am I saying, A1 was a pretty huge part of this movie. But it's like, it's like dirt. Not bad, but good. Dirt makes up so much of what we call the earth, or at least what we feel is earth, yet we recognize plants and animals more like earth. But dirt not only makes up more earth, not only does it help keep living things survive, it is earth. Basically, in a sense, Apollo 13 was Apollo 1 except successful. It's the symbolsim and metaphor stuff you here about in school.\r\n\r\nI could talk more and more about how this movie is so realistic, but here's the stuff: this is awesome space. It gives you the fun of space. It gives you space, outer space, but not space between you and a zillion years of cold darkness. But, that's the thing: this movie is all over the place.\r\n\r\nAt this point you probably wonder: why the heck was he reviewed Apollo 13 and not Star Wars? Well, I used to do reviews for YouTube. When I watch a movie more than once, it almost takes away the charm unless it's done amazingly. I also need to get off my butt and watch some of the movies in my collection,\r\n\r\nAnd Apollo 13, the rating? 4.9/5. Almost there, just not there yet.",

He gets every point of view that it possoble while witnessing the events of April, 1970.\r\n\r\nHanks once again can do anything. To me it seems like there 2 ways a Tom Hanks role can go. Either he can play a character that is a little different or he can play a character that is basically Hanks in real life. Lovell is that character for me. I'm assuming that Hanks just played this role like he would if he was at home with the family.\r\n\r\nIt still amazes me that we had this technology back in the 1960's...to take men on the moon.

Two big thumbs up just for that. i mean seriously it is like you are transformed into this entire different world. i may not remember right now but no movie based on real life Space travel have ever gave me that feel, i never felt like this. this movie defines America or NASA. though it was a sad turn or sad time for them because as you know the are not being able to perform the mission after the accident takes place and in the end when they show individual characters, what they are doing right now, that scene just makes your eyes get all teared up because you feel for them, you realize what actually this meant to them and their families the town the whole nation and perhaps the whole world at that time. i mean keeping your foots on Moon.\n\nyou know this is a perfect movie when there is a powerful story, told with absolute brilliant technical detail, superb performances and everything else done well. this movie shows from the start the two missions that were done before, one was the first Apollo-1 which met with a horrible accident killing those astronauts and the other and the most remarkable one, Apollo-11 where Mr Armstrong lands on Moon while they are watching it on TV. Jim Lovell played by Tom Hanks himself had been on a mission but that was just to orbit Moon and he wants to go back this time, to land on Moon. it happens as the are being send through Apollo-13 not 14. Ken Mattingly can't go because of some disease instead of him, Jack Swigert goes along with Fred Haise. Marilyn, wife of Jim isn't quite sure about all this, she sees nightmare and after all that, her wedding ring falls into the shower drain. the shuttle is launched and everyone, families, friends, town people and the nation are hopeful ti see the back soon. as part of the routine check up, Swigert switches something that has something to do with the Oxygen tank i guess but one of them explodes with a leakage. the are now trapped, aborts the mission, they have to find a way to come back home, technical and health difficulties and above everything else, a dream.\n\ni personally think that the standout performance was from Ed Harris as Gene Kranz. he was truly spectacular in his dialogue delivery and his emotions. this was a performance where you could understand completely, like 100% what was going on in the character's mind. his face was speaking everything he or the character were feeling. n excellent performance. also Tom Hanks was good, he fitted in this role very easily as usual. Katheleen Quinlan gave a good performance too. everyone was nice in this movie also even Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton and Gary Sinse.\n\nexcellent written story and plot with a superb screenplay. one of the best Editing i have ever seen in a movie like this. no wonder it was Oscar nominated. it looks superb and has emotions powerful enough to make you cry in fear, excitement and everything else. a powerful and excellently made drama by Ron Howard. one of the best movies of Ron Howard making him truly Ron Howard. a must see.",

            "content": "Probably one of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic film despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. \n\nNot only is this film wonderfully acted, it also presents a nearly flawless portrayal of the time period, even down to the slide rulers that were used to do calculations. The audience is literally taken back in time to the 1960's, and all of these universally exciting events are brought back to life, and this is one of the things that makes this movie so special. So many films try to do this, and the vast majority of them fail miserably, so it just feels so good to occasionally see it done right.\n\nAnother thing that was used in the perfect amount in Apollo 13 was the special effects. I am entirely against excessive special effects, because if they aren't justified in being in the film, they can sometimes ruin the film by themselves (remember The Perfect Storm?). The special effects in Apollo 13, however, served the film very well. Of course, the most significant special effect in the film, aside from the space scenes, was the zero gravity, which was done flawlessly. I'm just glad that they decided to go up in one of those Zero-G planes for these scenes, rather than have the actors drift lazily around and act as if they are in zero gravity, because that would have taken a lot away from the film. \n\nApollo 13 has an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic.",

This movie is brilliantly inspiring and makes you want to achieve your dreams. One stunning aspect of this film is that we all know what happens in the end but dspite that, Ron Howard creates moments of absolute tension. Off course this movie has a true story which adds to the spice. \r\nJames Horner has proven his ability to be a great composer composing a tension-filled score of Aliens, one of the most epic scores in Braveheart, a truly inspirational score in Apollo 13, a romantic theme for Titanic and another romantic and beautiful theme in Avatar.\r\nMany critics have given this film a perfect rating but the RT Community has hardly given it a 10.

Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third shuttle to land on the moon but an oxygen tank exploded and the astronauts found themselves in a real situation. Going through hell to get back to Earth, the guys finally made it and the world was happy. An interesting story but very simple. Thanks to writers William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert, the story became a complex challenge of life or death situation. Also helped by strong performances particularly from Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan, Apollo 13 became an instant classic when it came out in 1994.",

The film is certainly slow at points, but for me, throughout, I was very intrigued by the film. From when they were preparing to when things start going wrong to the end, I was hooked. The film is never great, so to speak, but it was still very good and, while it needed no help in doing so, did a great job creating suspense when things went wrong, as well as sympathy for the families of the men aboard. The suspense is constant and really leaves you on the edge of your seat as you see the inner workings of the ordeal and it almost leaves you in tears as you watch their families deal with the ordeal back at home.

There is also something of the sense of the film as a live-action storyboard, so highly developed is its sense of organization and calculated effect.\r Nevertheless, the film works in a primal way as the story of three brave explorers who manage to find a way home in the face of hazardous obstacles and heavy odds. The verisimilitude with which the mission has been visualized is impressive, and the positive, virtuous, \u201cfailure-is-not-an-option\u201d posture of the characters has been adopted winningly by the entire cast and crew.\r Placing the opening scenes in a family context manages the twin feats of conveying some needed exposition and establishing the film\u2019s wholesome credentials. A bunch of NASA personnel and their kin assemble to watch the dramatic moment on July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The host, family man Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), was aboard Apollo 8 when it passed just 60 nautical miles above the moon, and he\u2019s only got to wait nine more months to get his chance to become the fifth man to set foot on the lunar surface.\r As the April 11, 1970, launch date approaches, command module pilot Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is exposed to measles and has to be replaced by swinging bachelor Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). But by the time they and lunar module pilot Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) blast off on their 600,000-mile trip, the public has come to regard moon missions as almost routine and worthy of only passing interest.\r Two-and-a-half days later, and 50 minutes into the picture, this attitude abruptly changes. During a routine \u201cstirring\u201d of the oxygen supply, an oxygen tank explodes, which quickly leads to three significant problems for the crew: a dissipating oxygen supply, reduced power on board and a filtering system on the blink, leaving the men susceptible to carbon dioxide poisoning.\r Through this critical portion of the six-day mission, events in Houston prove considerably more dramatic than goings-on in space, where the men shiver and await the fateful moment when they must attempt re-entry. A number of nicely individualized scientists and nerdy computer geniuses argue the merits of different courses of action, with Kranz making the ultimate decisions through a sort of consensus by decree. While chain-smoking flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) overseas the rescue operation,  some of the key contributions are made by Mattingly.\r Physically, \u201cApollo 13\u201d pulls off some stunners, notably the giant rocket launch, the separation of the boosters as the spaceship soars away from Earth, the views of the moon and scenes of weightlessness that were filmed aboard a high-flying Air Force plane that afforded the actors brief moments of zero gravity. Kudos to the special effects hands at Digital Domain, production designer Michael Corenblith, costume designer Rita Ryack and the army of technicians on board for an outstanding display of authenticity. Dean Cundey\u2019s lensing works to seamlessly blend f/x work with normal scenes, but look of the images leans toward the grainy and soft.\r Casting Hanks as Lovell gives the film a human center, someone with whom the audience can easily feel at home, but his dramatic opportunities are more limited here than of late. His most powerful scene has him calming down his two partners when their dilemma threatens to get the better of them late in the journey.\r Bacon brings a colorful cockiness to the one \u201cTop Gun\u201d-style flyer in the bunch, while Paxton is obliged to suffer quietly with a high fever during much of the journey. Harris\u2019 coiled tension provides a strong focus of attention in the control room, and Kathleen Quinlan gives depth of feeling and understanding to the necessarily compartmentalized role of Lovell\u2019s omen-fearing wife.\r \u201cApollo 13\u201d will inevitably be compared to the only previous large-scale film about the U.S. space program, 1983\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d  New effort is much more succinct and conventional in its aims and will no doubt play more successfully with the public.",

Ron Howard makes it look like easy and effortless through his brilliant execution skills but unfortunately isn't supported well enough on the editing department. Tom Hanks leads the way with another stellar performance from his side and is supported by a great cast like Ed Harris and Kevin Bacon. Apollo 13 isn't as important or nail biting as the makers think but it surely is witty and thought provoking that was just piled upon by the undercooked emotions like it was essential to install.",

Unfortunately, this effort to synthesize and simplify has made the plot unrealistic, predictable and forced, especially if we take into account the jokes around number 13 and other minor situations like that. The plot gives great attention to how the astronauts was prepared and chosen, as well as how NASA sweated to bring them back. In this field, the film is engaging and leaves the audience stuck to the screen. Another issue that it tackles, in obvious criticism, is the initial lack of interest from the media in that mission, but this is ancillary. The film has some special effects but they're not attractive or stunning except for scenes in zero gravity. Personally, I didn't have any problem with that, I think it leaves more room for drama.As for actors we need to consider the following: the cast is full of stars (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris...) but the film definitely doesn't know what to do with them. Hanks is the protagonist but is misused and spends more than half the film's length wishing for the Moon and trying to control his flight colleagues. Ed Harris, in a supporting character, shines almost as much as him and holds the final half of the movie in an excellent performance, but within the standards the actor has accustomed us to. The rest of the cast does not shine and there are several supporting actors who end up being demoted to extras with lines.In conclusion: it's a satisfactory movie but its far from being really good. The blend of a strong cast, a script reduced to the basic and an uninspired direction is as inefficient as a Ferrari engine in a Beetle.",

The astronauts have to overcome situations no human on Earth has had to deal with, and the movie shows this in great detail. That's a treat to see.The acting is well done, especially by Ed Harris playing Gene. He's shows leadership, a positive and calm attitude and probably saved the astronauts with those qualities. The scenes with control and the shuttle are very entertaining.However... the scenes with THE WIFE are extremely annoying. Besides the fact that Jim Lovel's wife in this movie has the worst haircut i've seen in a long time, she interupts the interesting scenes repeatedly with staring at radio's and tv's. We get it, you are worried about your husband... but that should not have been shown this much. And that also goes for that particular school kid who looks like he's trying to catch flies with his open mouth.By the end of the movie you'll feel like it would have been a better movie without the harrasing of the wife scenes, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat. I give this movie an 8/10, it is an excellent movie.",
